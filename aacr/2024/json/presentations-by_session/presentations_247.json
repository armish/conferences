[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of malignant primary brain tumors. Despite current standard of care, the overall survival for GBM is ~15 months. While immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 have been efficacious for solid malignancies, very little progress has been made in a clinical setting for GBM. This is mainly due to GBM being known as a &#8220;cold&#8221; and non-immunogenic tumor. It has been previously established that a tumor may become &#8220;hot&#8221; if the T cell responses can be enhanced by increasing the presentation of tumor-specific antigens to the immune system. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are alternating electric fields in a specific frequency range (100-500 kHz) delivered to the human body through transducer arrays. Treatment with TTFields have been approved and have shown efficacy in GBM. TTFields have induced immunogenic cell death in GBM, which in turn can elicit anti-tumoral immunity by inducing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). These patterns are important for promoting engulfment of lung cancer cells by dendritic cells and recruitment of immune cells. These findings suggest that TTFields may enhance the immune response in GBM by increasing tumor specific antigens. In this study we show <i>in vitro<\/i> that TTFields enhanced the immune response to GBM. We initially demonstrated that GBM cells (GL261 or CT2A) treated with TTFields (200 kHz) can elicit DAMP emissions as evident by the increase in secretion of ATP and HMGB1 and the enhanced translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface. Additionally, TTFields stimulated the phagocytotic activity of antigen presenting cells (Raw264.7) and increased T-cell early activation (CD69\/CD4+, CD69\/CD8+) and activity (IFN&#947; and perforin). Since our findings <i>in vitro<\/i> indicate TTFields enhanced the immune response to GBM, we studied the therapeutic potential of using TTFields together with anti- PD1 in a syngeneic mouse model. We applied TTFields to GBM cells prior to intracranial injections. While our survival studies are preliminary, our findings suggest that systemic anti-PD1 and TTFields may result in a myeloid and T-cell mediated anti-tumor response and enhanced survival. Our findings indicate that TTFields treatment may help transform GBM into a &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor thereby making it an attractive target for immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),PD-1,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The weak responsiveness is attributed to tumor intrinsic as well as tumor extrinsic factors, suggesting a need for novel approaches. We have used the CRISPR Cas9 kinome knockout library consisting of 763 kinase genes to identify tumor intrinsic kinase conferring resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade and identified the CDC42BPB kinase as a potential target to overcome the resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We found that CDC42BPB is highly expressed in breast cancer patients who are non-responsive to immunotherapy. Importantly, a small molecule pharmacological inhibitor, BDP5290, which targets CDC42BPB synergized with anti-PD-1 and enhanced tumor cell killing by promoting T-cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, anti-PD-1 resistant breast cancer cells showed higher expression of CDC42BPB, and its inhibition rendered the resistant cells more susceptible to T cell killing in the presence of anti-PD-1. We also found that CDC42BPB phosphorylated AURKA which in turn upregulated PD-L1 through cMYC. Our results have revealed a robust link between tumor intrinsic kinase and immunotherapy resistance and provided a rationale for a novel combination therapy of CDC42BPB inhibition and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Breast cancer,Kinase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Thus, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy that bolster anti-cancer immunity is expected to improve long-term survival with reduced recurrence. Neoadjuvant ICI revolutionized management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, this represents only 5-7% of all BC cases, where estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype that consists of 70% of all BCs is not indicated due to less tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Using I-SPY2 trial we aim to investigate the potency of ER-alpha gene (ESR1) expression as a predictive biomarker, and whether the inhibition of the ER with fulvestrant enhances the efficacy of ICIs in ER+ BC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b>Total of 1157 BC patients from two independent cohorts (ISPY2 trial; n= 73, TCGA; <i>n <\/i>= 1084) were included, encompassing both clinical and transcriptomic profiles. The TIL score was determined using the xCell algorithm.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b>Using the transcriptome of the ISPY2 trial, we found that compared to ESR1 low expression patients, ESR1 high patients were associated with significantly lower pCR rates after neoadjuvant immunotherapy with ICI in whole cohort (n=71, pCR rate=30%, p&#60;0.05) and HR+ subtype (n=50, pCR rate=20%, p&#60;0.001), but not in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). ESR1 expression outperformed PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 in Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the whole ISPY2 cohort (AUC=0.75, 0.68, 0.48, and 0.62, respectively), and further pronounced in HR+ BC (AUC=0.88, 0.73, 0.55, and 0.65, respectively), suggesting the potency of ESR1 expression as a predictive biomarker for ICI in HR+ BC. In agreement, ESR1 expression inversely correlated with the amount of intratumoral TILs consistently in both ISPY2 and TCGA cohorts in HR+ BC, but only in TCGA in whole cohort (all p&#60;0.05). Among the intratumoral TILs, CD8+ T cell and M1 Macrophages were found to be less infiltrated in HR+ BC in TCGA. Given that ESR1 expression was associated with less intratumoral TILs and a poor response to ICI, we hypothesized that suppression of ER-alpha would enhance the effectiveness of ICI in HR+ BC in vitro. ER-alpha positive MCF7 cells were incubated with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 1:1 ratio, and treated with 0.1 microgram of anti-PDL1, and 1nM of ER antagonist, fulvestrant, which demonstrated minimum cell killing. We found that ICI therapy with anti-PDL1 significantly decreased the cell viability of the MCF7 cells when ER-alpha expression was suppressed by fulvestrant, while activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or anti-PDL1 alone or the combination did not exhibit any significant cell killing.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We found that ESR1 expression is a predictive biomarker of ICI, and ER antagonist fulvestrant enhances the response of HR+ BC to ICI, suggesting that this combination could expand ICI indications to HR+ BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The interaction between PD1 and PD-L1 is a significant therapeutic target in oncology, as its inhibitors have shown improved outcomes across a variety of malignancies. However, the treatment response to immunotherapies such as pembrolizumab has shown a modest response (~30%) in previous studies. This could be explained by the lack of molecular insight pertaining to the interaction of PD1 on T-cells and PD-L1 in the tumor cells in malignant tissues at the time of clinical diagnosis. The recent development of <i>in situ<\/i> Proximity Ligation Assay (<i>is<\/i>PLA), marks a significant advancement in the field. This method allows for the visualization of direct protein interactions within tissues, for example between PD1 and PD-L1. This adds an important layer of information compared to multiplexed immunofluorescence, which is useful for deep phenotyping of cell types in a tissue but lacks the ability to detect direct interactions between specific cells.<br \/>Methods: PD-L1-PD1 interactions in human FFPE tonsil and bladder cancer tissue were identified using the NaveniFlex Tissue Atto647N kit, following the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. This method is capable of detecting proteins within a proximity of less than 40 nm, utilizing oligonucleotide-antibody conjugates that generate an enhanced fluorescent signal. After completing the Naveni&#174; detection process, we performed multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) using the Phenocycler platform and a panel of 14 barcoded antibodies, to generate <i>is<\/i>PLA and multiplexed IF data on the same tissue section.<br \/>Results &#38; Discussion: We have successfully established an automated workflow for the <i>is<\/i>PLA protocol. In this work, we aim to continue this effort and combine the <i>is<\/i>PLA, with downstream highly multiplexed immunofluorescence using the Phenocycler platform. We have generated proof of concept data for the successful integration of the two methods, using tonsil and bladder cancer tissue to detect protein interactions between PD1 and PD-L1, as well as phenotypic profiling of the tumor microenvironment with a 14 plex panel. This panel allows us to phenotype the relevant cell types (B cells, dendritic cells, T cells, macrophages, tumor cells and their proliferation status) and subsets of T-cells like cytotoxic CD8+ cells. The integration of the <i>is<\/i>PLA and multiplexed IF is poised to significantly advance our understanding of the TME and hopefully aid in patient stratification for immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. The clinical significance of this method integration will later be explored in a retrospective cohort of muscle invasive bladder cancer, receiving immune checkpoint inhibition therapy with pembrolizumab as a second line treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Immuno-oncology,Fluorescence imaging,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"T.

However, despite major advances in peri-operative immunotherapy for melanoma, little is known regarding these strategies in BCC. This phase 1B, single-arm study evaluated neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) together with standard of care (SOC) resection in advanced BCC of the head and neck.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients had resectable, locally advanced BCC of the head and neck, defined by at least one of the following high-risk characteristics: a measurement of &#8805; 20 mm, indication for post-operative radiation, or perineural invasion (PNI) in multiple nerves. Patients were naive to hedgehog inhibitors (HHI) and had an ECOG of 0 or 1. All patients received IV PEMBRO at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles, then within 4 weeks underwent a SOC resection followed by adjuvant PEMBRO until a total of 17 cycles was completed. After the 30-day post treatment safety follow-up visit, patients were followed for up to 5 years post-operatively. The primary endpoint was pathological response rate. Secondary endpoints included RECIST response by radiographic or physical exam, adverse events (AE), and recurrence-free survival (RFS).<br \/>Results: 13 patients were enrolled in the trial from July 2020 to May 2023, and received at least one dose of PEMBRO. Two patients withdrew from the trial after one dose of PEMBRO, one following treatment-related G3 hepatitis and a second due to an unrelated medical complication (cholecystitis). Out of 11 patients undergoing surgical resection, 10 patients received 4 out of 4 and 1 patient received 3 out of 4 planned cycles of neoadjuvant PEMBRO (investigator preference without new related AE). Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 3 patients (23%). For those with RECIST measurable disease, 2 patients demonstrated a complete response (CR), 1 patient a partial response (PR), and 5 patients showed stable disease (SD). Two patients had progressive disease (PD). One patient with a complete pathologic response had a discordant RECIST response with PD noted radiographically. All 13 patients experienced at least one AE of G1 or 2. The highest grade of related AEs were noted in 2 patients with grade 3 hepatitis and pruritus respectively that resolved with supportive therapy.

ANGPTL2, particularly abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, promotes damage repair through tissue remodeling, and contributes to tissue homeostasis; however, in severe obesity, ANGPTL2 is overexpressed, resulting in irreversible tissue remodeling, which induces chronic inflammation and is involved in systemic insulin resistance and diabetes development. On the other hand, it is unclear how systemic chronic inflammation controlled by ANGPTL2 is involved in cancer progression and acquisition of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms in the acquisition of ICI resistance by systemic chronic inflammation from the perspective of ANGPTL2.<br \/>Materials and Methods: 1. To induce chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, BALB\/c mice were fed high-fat-diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. CT26 cells, a mouse colon cancer cell line, were subcutaneously implanted in normal diet (ND) and HFD mice and anti PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody was administered intraperitoneally. Immune cell fractions in tumor tissue and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry. 2. CT26 was subcutaneously implanted in WT and systemic ANGPTL2-deficient (<i>Angptl2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) mice, and anti PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody was administered intraperitoneally. Tumor size and survival time were analyzed. Bone marrow cells were isolated and the immune cell fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue were also analyzed. 3. Bone marrow cells were isolated from BALB\/c mice, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were established <i>in vitro<\/i> by GM-CSF and IL-6. Recombinant ANGPTL2 protein was added, and MDSC differentiation and function were evaluated by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.<br \/>Results: 1. HFD mice had larger tumor size and poorer response to ICI treatment compared to ND mice. In tumor microenvironment, MDSCs were increased in HFD mice. HFD mice had significantly increased MDSCs, especially polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) in bone marrow. 2. ICI-treated <i>Angptl2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice showed higher treatment efficacy and prolonged survival compared to WT mice.

NRT-YHD_001 is a modified antisense miRNA of let-7i-5p for liver cancer treatment. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine was attached to NRT-YHD_001 for specific delivery to the liver. <i>In vitro<\/i> phagocytosis assay showed better macrophage phagocytosis activity than non-modified antisense let-7i-5p. To investigate the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of NRT-YHD_001, spontaneous (Ras-transgenic) mouse liver cancer model was used and compared with that of sorafenib treatment. This mouse liver cancer model usually develops spontaneous liver cancer mass after 15 ~ 20 weeks of birth. We confirmed that both weekly i.v. injection of 1mg\/kg and biweekly i.v. injection of 2mg\/kg NRT-YHD_001 showed more significant therapeutic efficacy than the sorafenib-treated group. Furthermore, xenograft assay with Hep3B human liver cancer cells in athymic-nude mouse also showed that weekly i.v. injection of 1mg\/kg NRT-YHD_001 exhibited better survival and tumor growth inhibition compared to non-treated group. In mouse and cynomolgus monkey maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies, no toxicity of NRT-YHD_001 was found at doses up to 500 mg\/kg intravenously.

More robust predictive biomarkers to guide patient management and to select optimal combination immunotherapy strategies for the individual patient are needed. Our previous studies indicate that the tumor-intrinsic NLRP3 inflammasome-HSP70 signaling axis promotes the recruitment of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and drives resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.<br \/>The KEYLargo phase II clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab (pembro) in combination with capecitabine\/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) in HER2-negative advanced GE cancer patients. An 8-day lead-in period of pembro monotherapy in 36 advanced GE cancer patients allowed for the acquisition of blood and tumor tissue specimens to determine which immune-mediated alterations within the tumor microenvironment correlated with resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Baseline and on-treatment specimens were collected for HSP70 ELISA, immunofluorescence microscopy, spatial transcriptomics, <i>NLRP3<\/i> FISH, IHC, and NLRP3-ASC proximity ligation assays (PLA) to measure NLRP3 pathway activity levels. All data was correlated with best objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and PMN-MDSCs were increased in responders and non-responders, respectively. While PD-L1 CPS failed to associate with response, elevated baseline NLRP3 PLA activity correlated with increased tumor-infiltrating PMN-MDSCs (<i>P<\/i> = 0.001) and resistance to pembro\/CAPOX therapy (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01). Only non-responding tumors exhibited an increase in NLRP3 PLA activity and <i>NLRP3<\/i> amplification. Transcriptional studies revealed tumors with enhanced NLRP3 activity to exhibit decreased expression of the NLRC5 transactivator, MHC class I antigen presentation genes, and an increase in the NK cell negative regulator, HLA-G. Baseline plasma HSP70 levels correlated with tumor NLRP3 activity (<i>P<\/i> = 0.043) and with resistance to pembro\/CAPOX therapy (<i>P<\/i> = 0.001). Elevated baseline NLRP3 PLA activity and amplification were associated with diminished PFS (<i>P <\/i>= 0.008) and OS (<i>P <\/i>= 0.009). In additional studies, pharmacologic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome suppressed PMN-MDSC recruitment, upregulated MHC class I, and reversed anti-PD-1 resistance in an orthotopic model of GE cancer. Together, these findings implicate tumor-intrinsic NLRP3-HSP70 signaling as an important mediator of anti-PD-1 resistance in advanced GE cancer. The NLRP3-HSP70 pathway is a promising source of therapeutic targets and biomarkers capable of improving treatment outcomes for this patient population. Additional clinical studies are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Immune checkpoint blockade,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"N.

To address this unsolved problem, we previously suggested that a new immune checkpoint, CNTN4, is expressed on the tumor side and suppresses T cell-dependent immune activation. We further investigated the association between the clinical outcome of pembrolizumab and the expression of <i>CNTN4<\/i> in the gastric cancer cohort using bulk RNA sequencing data to establish a clinical strategy for targeting CNTN4. We split the patients into high- or low-group based on the expression of <i>CNTN4<\/i> and <i>CD274<\/i> (PD-L1) with the median of those two genes and analyzed for the responses. As a result, patients who had low-<i>CNTN4<\/i> expression and high-<i>CD274<\/i> expression were favorable to the pembrolizumab (Objective response rate, ORR; 64.3% [9\/14]). However, patients who had high-<i>CNTN4<\/i> expression and high-<i>CD274 <\/i>expression<i> <\/i>showed unfavorable responses (ORR; 0% [0\/9]. &#42931;<sup>2<\/sup> = 5.951, <i>P<\/i> = 0.002). We also figured out that non-responders (NRs, N = 33) had a relatively lower expression of <i>CD274<\/i> (p = 0.0012) and a higher expression of <i>CNTN4<\/i> (p = 0.0015) compared to responders (Rs, N =12). Furthermore, in <i>CD274<\/i>-high patients, NRs showed significantly higher <i>CNTN4<\/i> expression than Rs (Fold change = 2.17. <i>P<\/i> = 0.0086). Immune-related cytokine genes, such as <i>IFNG<\/i>, <i>GZMA<\/i>, and <i>CXCL9<\/i>, were negatively correlated to <i>CNTN4<\/i> expression (<i>R<\/i> = -0.69, <i>P<\/i> = 2&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>; <i>R<\/i> = -0.52, <i>P<\/i> = 0.0108; <i>R<\/i>= -0.54, and <i>P<\/i> = 0.0077, respectively.). In addition to the cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblast, important for immunotherapy, was deconvoluted from bulk RNA data and showed higher <i>CNTN4<\/i> expressions in NRs than Rs (Fold change = 3.3, <i>P <\/i>= 0.002). When classifying tumor tissue based on TCGA molecular subtypes, genomically stable (GS) type and chromosomal instability (CIN) were more observed in the NRs compared to the Rs with poor prognosis. CIN and GS type patients showed higher <i>CNTN4<\/i> and lower <i>CD274<\/i> expression than other TCGA subtypes. We also figured out that all <i>CNTN4<\/i>-high patients were composed of CIN or GS types. Similarly, higher <i>CNTN4<\/i> expression and lower <i>CD274<\/i> expression were observed in CIN and GS gastric patients from the TCGA database. Moreover, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were poorer in <i>CNTN4<\/i>-high patients (OS: median of <i>CNTN4<\/i>-high = 9.73 [95% CI= 4.77-NA] months, median of <i>CNTN4<\/i>-low = NA [95% CI= 9.03-NA] months, <i>P<\/i> = 0.072. Hazard ratio = 2.15 [95% CI = 0.917-5.037], <i>P<\/i> = 0.078) (PFS: median of <i>CNTN4<\/i>-high = 2.10 [95% CI= 1.33-3.97] months, median of <i>CNTN4<\/i>-low = 5.47 [95% CI= 2.80-NA] months,<i> P<\/i> = 0.0004. Hazard ratio = 3.303 [95% CI = 1.647-6.624], <i>P<\/i> = 0.0008).Together, we suggest that <i>CNTN4<\/i> is a potential ICP candidate for gastric cancer patients unfavorable to pembrolizumab treatment.

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined from date of CN.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 22 pts (median age 59) are included: 18 (81.8%) males, 19 (86%) Caucasian, 20 (91%) had clear-cell histology, 20 (91%) had ECOG Performance Status 0-1, 10 (45%) had intermediate-risk disease and 12 (55%) had poor-risk disease by IMDC. Median ICT duration before CN was 6.5 months (mo) (range, 2-19 mo). 17 (77%) completed 4 cycles of N+I, and 16 (73%) received N maintenance before CN. 5 pts (23%) had grade 3\/4 immune-related adverse effects; 1 pt did not complete 4 cycles of N+I due to hepatitis. There were no therapy-related deaths. 12 pts (54.5%) had progressive disease (PD); 3 pts (14%) died of RCC. Median PFS was 22 mo, median OS not reached (NR). Pts with pathological response had greater radiologic reduction in primary size compared to pts without pathological response (median reduction 38% vs. 15% p-value 0.01), smaller final primary pathological size (median 5.7 cm vs. 10.65 cm p-value 0.002), and lower pathological yT stage (pT0: 1, pT1: 6, pT2: 2 pT3: 3, pT4: 0 vs. pT0: 0, pT1: 1, pT2: 0, pT3: 8, pT4: 1 p-value 0.045); ICT duration was similar between groups (median 5.5 mo vs. 7 mo p-value 0.733). 6 pts achieved low viability within 5 mo of ICT.

Despite significant advancements in the fight against cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors have limited effectiveness in treating prostate cancer. Evidence shows that disrupting the interactions between Siglec-7\/9 and sialic acids can enhance immune responses and effectively inhibit tumor growth in several cancers. However, the understanding of Siglec-7\/9-sialic acid interactions in prostate cancer remains limited. Here, we found that tumor-infiltrating immune cells derived from prostate cancer patients exhibited high levels of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9. TCGA data analysis suggests that high levels of Siglec-7\/9 are correlated to worse patient survival. Elevated levels of Siglec-7\/9 ligands were found in prostate tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Prostate cancer cell lines exhibited significant expression levels of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 ligands, and cell surface sialic acids. Proteomic analysis suggests that increased sialylation was observed in tumor tissues in comparison to adjacent normal tissues. Disrupting interactions between Siglec-7\/9 and sialoglycans enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cells. Treatment with anti-Siglec-7\/9 antibodies effectively suppressed the growth of PC3 and 22Rv1 tumors in a humanized mouse model. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor tissues showed that PC3 and 22Rv1 tumors treated with anti-Siglec-7\/9 exhibited reduced proliferation, decreased vascularization, increased apoptosis, and enhanced immune cell infiltration. The CRISPR screen and mass spectrometry analysis suggested CD59 as a potential ligand for Siglec-9. Knockout of CD59 in prostate cancer cells decreased their binding activity of Siglec-9-Fc chimera proteins and promoted T cell-mediated killing ability. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic strategy of targeting Siglec-7\/9 and their ligands for prostate cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immune checkpoint,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Unfortunately, current immunotherapy trials have yielded few objective responses in PCa and hormonal therapy seldom cures necessitating the need to develop new immunotherapy or targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) treatment options for PCa, including B7-H3 targeted approaches.<br \/>Method: In this work, we evaluated important ADC targets and immune checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, LAG3, TIGIT, OX40, 4-1BB, CTLA4, STEAP1, STEAP2, PSMA, NECTIN1, TROP-2, DLL3 and B7-H3) in various PCa cell lines and multiple patients spanning various subtypes of PCa using publicly available bulk RNA sequencing data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data respectively. The results were validated at RNA and protein levels in listed cell lines. Further, the impact of androgen receptor (AR) signaling on B7-H3 expression was quantified using charcoal stripped media, AR agonist (R1881) and antagonist (enzalutamide) using real-time PCR and flow cytometry at RNA and protein levels respectively.<br \/>Results: We found that B7-H3 shows high expression and very low variability compared to other ADC targets and immune checkpoints in AR-positive (LnCAP), hormone-refractory (VCAP), Castrate resistant (22RVI), AR negative (PC3, DU145), and neuroendocrine (H660) cell lines, as well as in&#8212;PCa cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) myeloid cells&#8212;of multiple patients spanning various subtypes of PCa. Western blotting confirms the ubiquitous presence of B7-H3 in all these cell lines, even when PSMA is absent. Furthermore, B7-H3 expression was modifiable via androgen depletion, R1881 supplementation, or addition of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. These changes were significant in AR-positive LnCAP cells compared to AR-negative DU145 cells further endorsing the crosstalk between AR and B7-H3 signaling pathways, which will be presented in greater detail.<br \/>Conclusion: This work explores the therapeutic relevance of important ADC targets and immune checkpoints for Prostate Cancer (PCa), highlighting B7-H3 as a unique therapeutic ADC and ICI candidate across the continuum of PCa&#8212;androgen sensitive, castration resistant, and neuroendocrine&#8212;due to its stable expression across various subtypes and on TME myeloid cells. The relationship between AR and B7-H3 opens the possibility of future combination therapies based on this interaction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

However, TIGIT co-expression with other checkpoints has not been comprehensively characterized to support identification and prioritization of patients most likely to benefit from anti-TIGIT drugs and guide clinical trial design. In this study, we investigate TIGIT and other PD-1\/PD-L1 axis checkpoint targets across various solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: A discovery cohort (DC) of 24,186 solid tumors across 35 tumor types was evaluated by comprehensive immune profiling. TIGIT gene expression was normalized and ranked yielding a percentile rank values [0-100]. TIGIT rank was classified as high (rank &#62;e 75) and low (rank &#60; 25). We studied the distribution of TIGIT expression, cellular proliferation signature, and co-expression with PD-1\/PD-L1 axis and other checkpoint targets using Spearman correlation(r<sub>s<\/sub>). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Chi-squared assessed associations between TIGIT expression\/checkpoint co-expression and overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) differences in a separate cohort of 72 pembrolizumab treated non-small cell lung cancer (LC) patients treated with pembrolizumab.<br \/>Results: The DC confirmed a large range of TIGIT expression with highest median expression observed in NSCLC (median = 61), head &#38; neck (HNSCC) (median = 59), and cervical cancer (median = 55). Significant association between PD-L1 IHC positivity (TPS&#8805;1%, CPS&#8805;1) and TIGIT expression (p&#60;0.001) was discovered, where 69% (n=3574) of TIGIT high cases were PD-L1 positive, whereas 66% (n=3606) of TIGIT low cases were PD-L1 negative. By RNA-seq measurements, significant TIGIT co-expression (p&#60;0.001) with various checkpoint blockade targets including PD-1 (r<sub>s<\/sub>=0.5), PD-L1 (r<sub>s<\/sub>=0.5), and TIM3 (r<sub>s<\/sub>=0.6) was confirmed. In the LC, patients with TIGIT high tumors had significantly improved OS (median OS = 44 months; p=0.01) and PFS (median PFS = 35 months; p=0.006) compared TIGIT low group (median OS = 23 months; median PFS = 18 months). Similar results were observed for response to pembrolizumab, where TIGIT high cases had significantly higher response (ORR=60%, p= 0.001) vs. TIGIT low cases (ORR=39%). This was confirmed in TIGIT high and PD-L1-IHC<sup> <\/sup>positive group with improved OS (p=0.013), PFS (p=0.017) and ORR (p=0.016).<br \/>Conclusion: In an ultra-large cohort of clinically tested solid tumors, TIGIT was differentially expressed across tumor histologies of solid tumors. TIGIT expression was strongly co-expressed with PD-1\/PD-L1 axis, supporting the improved outcomes for patients with NSCLC treated with a combination of TIGIT and PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors from recent clinical trials. This finding of co-expression pattern of TIGIT and PD-1\/PD-L1 axis highlights the potential use of immune profiling for combination therapy strategies and clinical trial design in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,PD-1,PD-L1,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarabjot Pabla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Maria-Fernanda Senosain<sup>1<\/sup>, R.J.

Despite recent advances, high rates of recurrence highlight the need for novel treatment options. Groundbreaking discoveries in identifying and exploiting the PD-1\/PD-L1 (Programmed Death 1\/ Programmed Death Ligand 1) immune checkpoint have resulted in the approval of monoclonal antibodies that disrupt this interaction as a first-line therapy for lung cancer patients. However, only ~20% of NSCLC patients benefit from checkpoint blockade. A critical question remains as to what mechanisms facilitate resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy and whether other immune checkpoints or pathways can be pursued clinically in combination with this therapy. The integrated stress response (ISR) pathway represents an emerging therapeutic vulnerability. The ISR is a generalized response to maintain cellular homeostasis, and is known to be activated by hypoxia, heme deprivation, amino acid starvation, and oncogenic activation. We previously demonstrated that ISR activation potently induces PD-L1 in NSCLC and suppression of anti-tumor immunity (Suresh et al, <i>Nature Cancer<\/i>, 2020). We discovered that ISR pathway activation enhances PD-L1 translation through the bypass of inhibitory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the <i>PD-L1<\/i> 5' UTR and a mechanistic link to the translation initiation factor eIF5B. Our latest studies demonstrate that the immune checkpoint protein, CD155 (Cluster of Differentiation 155), is induced by ISR activation. We find that both<b> <\/b>PD-L1 and CD155 are induced by multiple arms of the ISR pathway, and CD155 harbors inhibitory uORFs in its 5' UTR. Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between PD-L1 and CD155 expression in a panel of primary human lung adenocarcinomas. We further demonstrated that ISR activation inhibits T cell function <i>in vitro<\/i> and promotes tumor growth in the CMT167 syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of immune cell infiltration using mass cytometry in this <i>in vivo <\/i>model is ongoing. Currently, we are determining the extent to which ISR inhibition suppresses tumorigenesis by promoting anti-tumor immunity and whether this may synergize with existing immune checkpoint therapies. Overall, these studies will set the stage for determining whether inhibition of the ISR pathway alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade will benefit lung cancer patients. Our studies may also lead to new therapeutic approaches to trigger anti-cancer immune responses and improve current strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Stress response,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

CIP often necessitates discontinuation of immunotherapy, even in cases of tumor response. Currently there are no effective models in predicting CIP. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and the use of harmonization models to analyze radiomic features from chest CT scans, aiming to predict the occurrence of CIP in patients with NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study examined data from 152 stage III-IV NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy. Tumor segmentation was performed using LIFEx software (IMIV\/CEA, Orsay, France). 3D-radiomic features were extracted from both the tumor and the surrounding 1 cm thick peritumoral regions. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was employed to develop a classification model to differentiate between CIP and non-CIP. A harmonization model was deployed to account for the scanner-related differences by using spleen and normal lung signals. The dataset was divided into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%). Bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was performed to estimate the model's performance by calculating the median and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimate. The accuracy of the model's predictions was evaluated by creating a confusion matrix. The model's performance was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CIP prediction.<br \/>Results: Among 152 patients, 87 (57.23%) are female and 65 (42.76%) are male. The median age was 59 years. Histology types included were Adenocarcinoma 111 (73%), Squamous cell carcinoma 27 (17.8%), and others 14 (9.2%). CIP was seen in 30 (19.73%) patients. Among the 30 patients with CIP, 17 (56.7%) patients had grade 1 pneumonitis, 11 (36.7%) patients had grade 2 pneumonitis, 2 (6.6%) patients had grade 3 pneumonitis, and none had grade 4 or grade 5 pneumonitis. The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.57, a specificity of 0.67, a PPV of 0.48, and NPV of 0.38 for predicting CIP. The AUC of 0.59 indicates that the model may predict checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis with an accuracy of 59%.<br \/>Conclusions: The study provides insights into the potential of radiomic analysis coupled with AI algorithms and the use of harmonization model in predicting CIP among NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings and the utility of harmonization models in predicting CIP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Pneumonitis,Harmonization Radiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

We sought to (a) identify biomarkers and (b) determine mechanisms of response to IPI+PD1 in PD1 resistant pts.<br \/>Methods: Pts with PD1-resistant MM subsequently treated with IPI+PD1 were included. We performed multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on melanoma samples, and cytometry by time of flight (CYTOF) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), at 3 timepoints (before PD1 [T1], before IPI+PD1 [T2], and after IPI+PD1 [T3]).<br \/>Results: 34 pts with PD1-resistant MM (82% innate resistance) who received IPI+PD1 were included: 16 (47%) responders and 18 (53%) non-responders to IPI+PD1. Median age was 66yo (37-86) and 19 (56%) were male. Six pts (18%) were ECOG PS &#8805;1, 18 (53%) were stage M1C\/D and 11 (32%) had elevated LDH at the start of IPI+PD1.Gene expression analysis (RNAseq) on T1 and T2 tumor samples revealed higher expression of cancer testis antigens (CTA; MAGE-A3 and MAGE-C1; p&#60;0.05) and immune regulatory genes (ILR2; p&#60;0.2), but lower expression of fibrosis regulation genes (FABP3 and MMP7; p &#60; 0.2) in responders vs non-responders. We then examined whether the addition of IPI led to expansion of CTA-specific T cells, and CyTOF analysis of MAGE-A3 tetramers on PBMCs showed a decrease in peripheral MAGE-A3-specific CD8+ T cells with PD1 (T1 to T2; p=0.03); and expansion of this T-cell subset with subsequent IPI+PD1 (T2 to T3) was seen in 7\/12 HLA-A2+ pts. Further analysis on PBMC longitudinal samples showed an increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs) in responders (p=0.04), between T1 and T3, and a decrease in % of TCF7+ CD8+ &#38; CD4+ T cells in non-responders (p&#60;0.05) with the addition of IPI (T2 to T3). On baseline (T1) tumor samples (mIF), IPI+PD1 responders had a higher % of stem cell-like TCF7+ CD8+ T cells (p=0.0004), lower % of well-differentiated Tbet+ CD8+ T cells (p=0.07), and higher % of CD4+ T cells (p=0.006), compared with non-responders; but no difference in Tregs. On longitudinal tumor samples, there was a decrease in the % of stem cell-like TCF7+ CD8+ T cells but an increase in the % of tumor-reactive CD39+ CD103+ CD8+ T cells with PD1 (T1 to T2; p&#60;0.05), mainly seen in responders (p=0.06). There were only 3 T2 to T3 IHC paired samples, precluding further analysis. IMC analysis on longitudinal samples (T1, T2 and T3) is underway to characterize the interaction between Tregs and T effector cells.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified potential mechanisms of response to IPI+PD1 in PD1-resistant MM pts. Our data suggests that response to IPI+PD1 requires baseline stem cell-like TCF7+ T cells with the potential to differentiate to an effector phase (CD39+ CD103+ CD8+ T cells), and that IPI facilitated expansion of antigen-specific T cells in a CTA-expression context, that PD1 alone is unable to do.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,anti-PD-1 \/ anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4,Resistance,Mechanisms of response to anti-CTLA-4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

However, many patients fail to respond to the treatment, necessitating research for new targets and improved approaches. The Killer cell Lectin-like Receptor G1 (KLRG1), expressed on a subset of NK and T-cells harbors an immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) within its cytoplasmic domain, indicating its inhibitory function. On CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, KLRG1 is expressed on highly differentiated antigen-specific effector memory T-cells (TEMs) and CD45RA<sup>+<\/sup> effector memory T cells (TEMRA). These cells are known to exhibit strong cytotoxicity potential and display developmental plasticity following KLRG1 blockade. And 16-48% of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME) are KLRG1 positive. We hypothesize that the blockade of KLRG1 should enhance the effector function of KLRG1<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T-cells in the TME and provide therapeutic benefit as a standalone or in combination with existing ICBs.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the human KLRG1 extracellular domain (ECD) were generated through mouse immunization and hybridoma technology. Purified mAbs from positive clones were screened using CHO-K1 and Jurkat cells overexpressing human or cynomolgus KLRG1 and human primary CD8 T-cells (n=3) to determine EC<sub>50<\/sub> values. Epitope binning was performed, and high-affinity clones from each bin with cyno cross-reactivity were humanized to IgG1-Fc LALA variant. The Abs were evaluated for ligand blocking and enhancement of CD8 T-cell effector function through multiple functional assays. The assay measured enhancement of IFN&#947; or TNF&#945; by KLRG1<sup>+<\/sup> human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells co-cultured with CHO-K1 expressing OKT3 and E-cadherin as artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) or PBMCs stimulated in with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs in presence of soluble E-cadherin. A human IgG1-LALA antibody (Ab) served as a negative control. PD-1 and KLRG1 synergy was evaluated in hPBMC assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> NB005.1 demonstrated single digit nanomolar (nM) binding potency on human primary CD8 T-cells and Jurkat cells expressing human KLRG1 as identified by its EC<sub>50<\/sub> value. Blocking of KLRG1 with NB005.1 on purified human CD8 T-cells in co-culture assay with aAPC expressing E-cad and OKT3 led to CD8 T-cell activation and increase in IFN&#947; production confirming inhibitory function of KLRG1. Similar result was obtained when the Ab was tested on hPBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs in presence of soluble E-cadherin.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> NB005.1, a fully humanized mAb, binds to human KLRG1 in the single digit nM range and effectively blocks the interaction with its ligand. This blockade enhances T-cell effector function as measured by IFN&#947; production, supporting the advancement of NB005.1 for preclinical testing, either as a standalone therapeutic or in combination with existing ICBs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Cancer immunotherapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Stem-like memory T cells (T<sub>SCM<\/sub>) have been identified as a T cell subgroup which possess enhanced proliferative capacity that could expand and differentiate upon dendritic cells (DCs) priming. In this study we investigated the expression of the recently discovered inhibitory receptor PVRIG and its ligand, PVRL2, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Leveraging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from diverse cancer indications, we found that in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, PVRIG clusters with early differentiation\/T<sub>SCM<\/sub> genes, unlike other immune checkpoints that cluster with genes related to T cells exhaustion. In agreement with the scRNAseq data, PVRIG protein expression was markedly increased on CD28<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> early-memory T cells across cancer indications. PVRL2, was dominantly expressed on intratumoral DC subsets on both scRNA and protein levels. The observation that PVRIG is uniquely expressed by T<sub>SCM<\/sub> cells, and PVRL2 by DCs, led us to evaluate whether these cell populations physically co-localize in the TME, thus potentially allowing PVRIG\/PVRL2 interaction. Employing spatial transcriptomic analysis in surgically resected CRC lesions we showed that while CTLA4, PD1, and TIM3 were mainly expressed by tumor infiltrating T cells, PVRIG and other genes of the DNAM-1 axis were intensely expressed by T<sub>SCM<\/sub> in specialized immune aggregates, as well as by T cells in tumor bed. High resolution spatial mapping of interacting immune and adjacent cells revealed pairs of activated LAMP3<sup>+<\/sup>PVRL2<sup>+<\/sup> DCs interacting with CD28<sup>+<\/sup>PVRIG<sup>+<\/sup> CD8 T cells in the intratumoral immune aggregates. Thus, PVRIG\/PVRL2 interaction may limit T<sub>SCM<\/sub> priming by DCs and blocking this interaction may unleash potent T<sub>SCM<\/sub> proliferation, differentiation, and infiltration into the tumor regions. To gain a more comprehensive understanding on the intratumor effects induced by PVRIG blockade, we evaluated the immune response in the TME of patients with poorly immune infiltrated tumors, platinum resistant ovarian cancer and MSS-CRC, indications typically less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Treatment with COM701, anti-PVRIG antibody, as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab resulted in an increased tumor T cell infiltration, accompanied by TCR clonality expansion, which were associated with clinical benefit. In summary, our study identifies PVRIG as uniquely expressed on T<sub>SCM<\/sub> in the TME, with its ligand PVRL2 expressed on activated DCs. Blockade of PVRIG\/PVRL2 interaction by COM701 antibody emerges as a promising strategy to induce potent T cell responses, providing a novel approach overcoming resistance to immunotherapy in immune excluded tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

However, despite this advancement, only ~20-30% of the patients derive durable benefit from such a treatment. One of the suggested reasons for this limited success is the expression\/activation of compensatory inhibitory pathways such as LAG-3 on tumor-reactive T cells. Therefore, it is envisioned that simultaneous antagonism of PD-1 and LAG-3 receptors would overcome this adaptive resistance mechanism and allow a more profound reinvigoration of tumor-reactive T cells. LAG-3 is constitutively expressed by regulatory T cells (on Tregs) and it has been reported that its blockade increases Treg suppressive function which could potentially off-sets the benefit of blocking LAG-3 on tumor-reactive CD8 T cells.We therefore developed a 1+1 PD1-LAG3 bispecific antibody, Tobemstomig, with a unique PD-1 binder recognizing a glycoepitope and more than 20 fold higher affinity than the LAG-3 binder which recognizes a novel and differentiated binding epitope (E3). This difference in affinities allows for an avidity driven selectivity gain to PD-1 and LAG-3 double positive T cells over and the following advantages over monospecific and other bispecific aPD-1\/-L1 and aLAG-3 antibodies:1.improved targeting to tumor-reactive T cells rather than Tregs due to the selectivity gain and different expression patterns of PD-1 and LAG-3 on these two T cell types, 2.reduced internalization, 3.resistance to drug-shaving by macrophages due to Fc -silencing via P329G LALA,4.increased <i>in vitro<\/i> T cell effector functions even in the presence of Tregs, 5.in-vivo targeting and expansion of CD8 TILs, including stem-like T cells, and increase in T cell effector functions and6.superior<i> i<\/i><i>n vivo<\/i> tumor control\/eradication compared to combination of monospecific anti-PD1 and anti-LAG3 antibodies,in several mouse models including Panc02 in syngeneic huPD-1xhuLAG3 dtg mice and BXPC3, WSU, OCI-Ly18 and BC004 in humanized mice Tobemstomig has completed dose escalation and is currently tested in a composite proof of concept Ph2 trial in several solid tumor indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,PD-1,Efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Hence, blocking LLT1-CD161 interaction could potentially activate NK cells and resulted tumor cell cytotoxicity. ZM008 is a first-in-class anti LLT1 monoclonal antibody with promising pre-clinical safety, efficacy data and received IND approval from USFDA. Clinical study will start soon at multiple US sites. TCGA data analysis revealed high LLT1 gene expression in multiple solid cancers BRCA, CHOL, ESCA, GBM, HNSC, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, LUAD, STAD, SARC. Several immune checkpoint genes PDL1, LAG3, TIM3, TIGIT, ICOS, B7-H3, are positively correlated (p&#60;0.05) with high LLT1 expression. CIBERSORT analysis of immune cells revealed significant presence of Treg and CD33+ immune cells along with IL4, IL10, Arg1 and IDO1 in the TME with high LLT1 expression. Cox regression analysis suggests high LLT1 is a risk factor for survival (p&#60;0.05) in patients with COAD, KICH and KIRC. High TMB and MSI scores were significantly correlated (p&#60;0.05) with LLT1 expression in Colon and Kidney cancers, suggesting plausible biomarker application. Overall, transcriptome data analysis strongly suggests immune repressive gene signatures are prevalent with high LLT1 TMEs in multiple solid cancers. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies with human PBMC revealed ZM008 activates immune cells by inducing expression of CD69, NKG2D, CD107a, proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-&#947;, IL2, etc.,) secretion, and tumor cytotoxicity. In MLR assay, ZM008 as a single agent or in combination with Pembrolizumab primed DCs to secrete IFN&#947; and IL-2 which results in effector NK and T cells activation\/proliferation <i>Ex vivo<\/i> studies with biopsy samples from NSCLC and Bladder Cancer patients showed significant tumor reduction and infiltration of patients&#8217; immune cells with ZM008 monotherapy and ZM008 + pembrolizumab combination. An open label, 3+3 design, multicenter dose escalation phase 1 trial for ZM008 is planned in patients with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors with no therapeutic standard alternative to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ZM008, as monotherapy and in combination with Pembrolizumab. FIH dosing of 0.15mg\/Kg was determined based on MABEL strategy. <i>In silico<\/i> data analysis showing high LLT1 expression in patients non-responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments indicate the potential benefit to the patients from ZM008 + pembrolizumab combination treatment. ZM008 treatment will release the immune break, activate the infiltrated immune cells and provide anti tumor effects in solid cancers either as a standalone treatment or combination therapy.

RNA velocity and latent time analysis in single-cell sequencing for melanoma TILs showed that the differentiation of T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cells from the naive CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were different from that of other CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. In addition, the T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cytotoxic CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were at the late stage of differentiation and some non-cytotoxic T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cells might differentiate into T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cytotoxic CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. We additionally found considerable overlapped clonotypes between the cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic clusters. T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cytotoxic CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells have high LAG-3\/BLIMP1 and low TCF1 expression without self-renewal ability, whereas non-cytotoxic T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like cells express low LAG-3\/BLIMP1 and high TCF1 with self-renewal ability, closely resembling the relationship between terminally differentiated and stem-like progenitor exhaustion in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings provide novel insights into T<sub>FH<\/sub>-like CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell exhaustion with helper progenitor and cytotoxic differentiated functions, which mediates antitumor immunity orchestrally with CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Initial trials with ICI in refractory cancers demonstrated remarkable efficacy compared to standard-of-care (SOC) treatments. With the integration of ICI into combination therapies, including chemotherapy and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), its role in frontline, early-stage, and locally advanced cancers has grown. However, the potential of an immunotherapy-only strategy, especially in advanced malignancies, warrants better biomarker selected approaches given the inconsistencies with existing biomarkers. This study investigates the \"cross-over&#8221; effect observed in Kaplan-Meier survival curves from randomized trials comparing ICI with non-ICI agents where the survival curves, assumed to be proportionally constant distinctly cross over each other during the on-treatment monitoring period. We initiated a meta-analysis investigating randomized trials comparing ICIs with non-ICI historical SOC agents and finally analyzed data from 38 large clinical trials. Trials were selected based on their comparative nature with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) data as outcomes. A positive &#8220;cross-over&#8221; in Kaplan-Meier curves was identified when divergence occurred for at least three consecutive months. Cross-over in PFS and OS curves were observed in 53% (20\/38) and 43% (16\/37) of trials, respectively. All cross-overs were one-sided with the ICI arm crossing over the non-ICI arm with a superior tail. Notably, 100% of trials with OS curve cross-over involved ICIs against chemotherapy. A significant association (Fischer&#8217;s exact test, p=0.01) was found between OS curve cross-over and adenocarcinoma histologies, in contrast to trials with no cross-over effect, predominantly featuring squamous cell carcinomas. This pattern persisted within various organ sites such as the lung, esophagus, and cervix where both adenocarcinomas and squamous histological patterns are seen. Cross-over of Kaplan-Meier curves blatantly violates the cox-proportional hazard assumption, potentially underestimating the impact of the ICI-only approach compared to alternative therapies. These observations highlight substantial biological heterogeneity in tumor responses to ICI versus chemotherapy. The cross-over effect, particularly pronounced in gland-forming tumors (adenocarcinomas), underscores the urgent need to investigate mechanisms of ICI resistance in these tumor types and incorporate tumor histology and longitudinal tumor growth dynamics into existing predictive models for biomarkers for IO response and help identify patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy-only approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Histopathology,Survival curves,Cross-over ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shubhank Goyal<sup>1<\/sup>, Anish Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Parth Anil Desai<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Developmental Therapeutics Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Hematology & Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5d02c042-cb2e-4974-8615-427e32e37944","ControlNumber":"1031","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

The trial initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and was expanded into additional sites, including City of Hope, Ochsner Health, Sheba Medical Center and Hadassah Medical Center. Study objectives are safety, dose-finding, and efficacy with focus on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biomarker discovery. NTX1088 is investigated as a single agent and in combination with the anti-PD1 mAb, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Ongoing dose escalation demonstrates a safe profile across ascending dose levels. NTX1088 is a high affinity humanized IgG4-S228P mAb that binds PVR and blocks all known interacting receptors at a single nM EC<sub>50<\/sub>. PVR, is a highly upregulated membrane protein on numerous tumor cells. PVR expression has been associated with worse patient outcome, due to its central role in immune suppression. PVR&#8217;s impact is mediated through interaction with the key stimulatory receptor, DNAM1 (CD226), on T and NK cells, leading to internalization and degradation of DNAM1. PVR also interacts with the inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors, TIGIT, CD96 and KIR2DL5A. Blocking PVR by NTX1088 has multiple immune-stimulating roles, through restoration of DNAM1 immune activation function, while simultaneously neutralizing TIGIT, CD96 and KIR2DL5A inhibitory signals in immune cells. Importantly, DNAM1 downmodulation was recently identified as a key resistance mechanism to approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, and its restoration by NTX1088 is a novel MoA, not demonstrated previously by other therapies.In vitro, as a monotherapy, NTX1088 significantly increased immune cell activation, superior to TIGIT, CD112R, and PD1 antibody blockade, leading to a greater immune-mediated tumor cell killing, IFN&#947; secretion, and CD137 induction. Importantly, only NTX1088 was able to restore DNAM1 to the surface of immune cells. Synergy was obtained when NTX1088 was combined with PD1 blockers, or with the anti-CD112R mAb, NTX2R13.Syngeneic models of PVR<sup>K.O<\/sup>, demonstrated a complete immune-mediated tumor regression. Numerous humanized murine xenograft models were investigated whereby NTX1088 exhibited robust tumor growth inhibition as a standalone and in combination with PD1 blockade.In conclusion, PVR blockade by NTX1088 has a remarkable pre-clinical efficacy, suggesting a potential clinical breakthrough, based on its ability to simultaneously overcome multiple tumor escape mechanisms. First-in-human (FIH) trial is currently ongoing and biomarker analysis is showing initial mechanistic proof of concept for NTX1088 mode of action, including the restoration of DNAM1 surface expression on patients&#8217; immune cells. This is the first case of surface DNAM1 elevation in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,PD-1,Immunotherapy,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Two central mechanisms limiting the T cell response in the tumour are suppression of effector T cells responses by regulatory T cells, and chronic exposure to tumour antigens that may bestow T cell unresponsiveness or exhaustion. Restoring exhausted T cell responsiveness through blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints such as the PD-1\/PDL-1 interaction is an established therapeutic modality leading to durable responses and improved survival rates in some patients.We have modelled suppressive mechanisms <i>in vitro<\/i> using purified human T cells and investigated the impact of the cytokines IL-2 and IL-7. A comparison of <i>in vitro <\/i>assay systems for T cell exhaustion including T cell\/allogeneic dendritic cells, a recall response to a viral antigen, prolonged stimulation of T cells to generate an &#8216;exhausted&#8217; phenotype followed by a secondary stimulation with allogeneic DCs, revealed in some donors, the greatest impact of pembrolizumab was with exhausted T cells, a finding consistent with our studies using a dissociated tumour cell response with primary cells from patients with lung or colon carcinomas. Quantifying a range of cytokines (e.g. IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and IL-10) and flow cytometry activation markers (e,g, CD69, CD25, CD71, OX40 and CD137) established that in general pembrolizumab was effective at restoring the IFN&#947; response, although some donors were not responsive, and there was a more modest impact on other readouts indicating not all T cell functionality is restored. We therefore tested the impact of IL-2 and IL-7 on the reversal of the &#8216;exhausted&#8217; phenotype and identified further improved functionality and donor responsiveness. We subsequently tested the impact of these cytokines in another &#8216;inhibitory&#8217; context, that of regulatory T cell suppression; we identified that high-levels of IL-2 overcame regulatory T cell suppression and IL-7 led to an overall enhancement of response.These findings highlight how multiple suppressive mechanisms may need to be overcome to maximally restore anti-cancer immune responses, and that the combination of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-7, and checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, may enhance T cell responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Tumor,Checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.
