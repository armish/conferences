[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are an anti-cancer treatment that use low intensity, alternating electric fields. Anti-mitotic treatment effects of TTFields have been, to date, considered the primary anti-cancer effect. Recent studies have shown additional impacts on cancer cell invasion and migration, among other effects, resulting in a complex anti-tumor response derived from a combination of factors. By deploying computational imaging tools to assess experimental conditions that apply TTFields treatment to 3D cancer multicellular spheroid cultures, the goal of our study is to elucidate important mechanisms and effect sizes on anti-tumor effects relating to the modulation of cancer cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) biophysical interactions.<br \/>Methods: 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) are cultured using GFP-tagged U-87 MG glioma cells. A single 3D MTS is placed in a cell culture insert and embedded in collagen I ECM at 2.25 mg\/mL. Fluorescent polystyrene microspheres are dispersed in the ECM to facilitate subsequent tracking of displacement fields induced by the MTS-ECM construct. Fluorescence microscopy imaging is acquired for all spheroids prior to treatment initiation. Then, with 3 replicates in each treatment condition, TTFields are applied for a duration of 48 hours at 200 kHz frequency with a no treatment condition as a control. At 48 hours, we acquire fluorescence microscopy images to track spheroid growth and bead-field displacement. To determine deformation fields induced by the cancer spheroid, we compare each image at 48 hours to their respective baseline image. Deformation fields are analyzed using a custom-developed analysis code that performs an initial alignment of the baseline and specific time point images using a global rigid registration. Next, we perform a B-spline based nonrigid image registration to generate an estimate of the deformation field vector at each pixel location within the image. Deformation intensity is measured within a circular region of interest (r = 900 &#181;m) centered at the spheroid core.<br \/>Results: The average magnitude of displacement for treatment and control groups is 0.52&#177;0.2 &#181;m and 1.07&#177;0.1 &#181;m, respectively. Analysis of deformation fields reveals a significant difference (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.1) in the magnitude of deformation present between treatment and control groups.<br \/>Conclusions: Implementation of our computational imaging analysis methods using rigid and nonrigid registration, we observe a 69.6% decrease in the magnitude of deformation in TTFields treated spheroids compared to control spheroids. Due to the decrease in deformation induced by cancer spheroids treated with TTFields, we conclude that TTFields impact cancer cell traction forces applied to the ECM to disrupt cancer cell invasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Extracellular matrix,Invasion,Spheroids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Tumor reoccurrence attributed to chemotherapy resistance remains a main challenge in fighting disease relapse. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most prominent component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have already been implicated in therapy resistances. Although the exact molecular mechanisms behind this resistance remain unclear. In this regard, we recently identified 4 CAF populations (S1-S4) in ovarian and BCs, and showed that only CAF-S1 promote immunotherapy resistance as well as metastasis. Based on these observations, we are now investigating the impact of CAF-S1 on the chemotherapy response of BCs. To study the interactions between CAF-S1 and BC cells, we developed a tumor on chip (ToC) device, mimicking the TME in 3D. Using ToC live imaging, we show that primary CAF-S1 mediate a chemoprotective effect over luminal and triple negative BC (TNBC) cells by significantly decreasing their apoptosis rate as early as 10h after Doxorubicin and 40h after Paclitaxel treatment. Interestingly, CAF-S1 display a highly heterogenous response to Doxorubicin, allowing the classification into chemo-sensitive and -resistant CAF-S1. Regardless of premature CAF-S1 cell death, the chemoprotective effect over BC cells is maintained for at least 3 days. This indicates a crucial CAF-S1 - cancer cell cross talk at early timepoints. Additionally, by applying machine learning algorithms on live imaging videos, we demonstrate that physical proximity of CAF-S1 to BC cells immediately after treatment initiation correlates with BC cell survival, even after several days of treatment. This again implies cancer cell priming by CAF-S1 as a possible mechanism of chemotherapy resistance. To investigate this molecular interplay further, we performed scRNA-seq of ToC extracted and treatment na&#239;ve CAF-S1 and TNBC cells as well as bulk RNA-seq of patient derived TNBC tumors before\/after chemotherapy treatment. We identify mitochondrial metabolic pathways to be upregulated in TNBC cells after CAF-S1 co-culture inside ToC devices and in TNBC cells of chemo-resistant patients enriched in CAF-S1 at baseline. We are now validating the impact of target gene knock downs on the survival of TNBC cells in CAF-S1 co-cultures after chemotherapy treatment on chip. Overall, these results provide insights into molecular mechanisms by which CAF-S1 promote chemotherapy resistance of breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Drug resistance,Single cell RNA-seq,Tumor on chip,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

To obtain a better understanding of cancer biology and pathophysiology, information about the physiological state of the tumor microenvironment is crucial. By using the <i>in situ<\/i> microdialysis technique we can quantitate relevant modulators in the interstitial space of the tumor.<br \/>The current set of experiments demonstrates the benefits of the use of microdialysis in freely-moving awake tumor-bearing animals. Following inoculation, growth was monitored continuously and upon an average tumor volume of 400 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, the animals underwent surgical implantation of microdialysis probes. The next day, the sample collection was initiated by perfusion of the implanted probes with dialysate fluid. Samples were continuously collected over several hours and stored at -80C. Levels of analytes indicative of metabolic and physiological conditions of the tumor microdialysis were quantified by EIA and\/or LC-MS\/MS analysis.<br \/>The microdialysis technology combined with sensitive analytical methods allows us to quantify several analytes from the tumor microenvironment simultaneously and monitor changes over time. Metabolic activity is an important indicator of tumor growth speed. Depletion of energy can lead to increases in lactate levels and acidification of the tumor microenvironment. Resulting in a reduction of host immunological efficacy.

NF1 is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF1<\/i>, which encodes for neurofibromin, a negative regulator of RAS activity. Selumetinib, a specific inhibitor of MEK1\/2, is the only FDA-approved drug for NF1-associated PNFs. However, the anti-tumor effects of selumetinib are limited in MPNSTs and have dose-limiting side effects. Deficiency of the <i>NF1<\/i> gene not only promotes tumorigenesis but also has broad effects on the immune cells and cytokine signaling driven by hyperactive RAS signaling. Because macrophages account for almost half of cells in NF1 lesions and their infiltration correlates with disease progression, we hypothesized that targeting tumor-promoting immune cells could be an alternative approach for treating NF1. The novel retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist MSU-42011 reduces tumor growth in experimental Kras-driven cancers by decreasing pERK expression, reducing tumor-promoting immune cells like CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells, and increasing activated cytotoxic T cells. Here, we treated NF1-deficient cells and macrophages with MSU-42011 and selumetinib, either alone or in combination, using monoculture and conditioned media (CM) conditions. In human PNF cells and mouse MPNSTs, treatment with 200 nM MSU-40211 or 50 nM selumetinib for 3 hours reduced pERK protein levels compared with untreated controls, and the combination treatment enhanced this reduction in pERK protein levels. Additionally, there was a trend toward reduction in cell viability with increasing drug concentrations after 72 hours of the combination treatment. Moreover, CM from human and mouse PNF cells increased the mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant <i>CCL2<\/i> (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) and the secretion of IL-6 and TNF&#945; in human THP1 monocytes\/macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). Notably, MSU-42011 and selumetinib alone inhibited <i>CCL2<\/i> mRNA expression in THP1 macrophages and BMDM stimulated with CM from human and mouse PNF cells, respectively, and the inhibition of <i>CCL2<\/i> mRNA expression was greatest with combination treatment. The combination of MSU42011 and selumetinib also significantly reduced tumor burden in a LL2 model of lung cancer driven by an activating <i>Kras<\/i> mutation. Based on the similarities in RAS activation and immune cell infiltration in NF1 and lung cancer, our next step is to confirm the immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects of MSU-42011 and selumetinib in a syngeneic model of PNF and MPNST.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Neurofibromatosis type 1,Selumetinib,RXR agonist,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.-Y.

Previously, we reported the enhanced antitumor activity of a triple combination (E7386 in combination with Lenvatinib [LEN, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFRs and FGFRs] plus anti-PD-1 antibody) versus a 2-drug combination (LEN plus anti-PD-1 antibody). In this study, we further investigated the immunomodulatory functions of E7386 as a triple combination by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis and subsequent functional assays.<br \/>Methods: Mice bearing subcutaneous RAG (mouse renal cell carcinoma) tumors were randomized into 4 groups (n=6 in each group), including &#9332; Nontreatment, &#9333; E7386 at 25 mg\/kg (PO, QD), &#9334; LEN at 10 mg\/kg (PO, QD) plus anti-PD-1 antibody at 10 mg\/kg (IP, BIW), and &#9335; triple combination. Tumor tissues were collected after a 2-week treatment period. CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells were isolated from the tumors by magnetic cell separation (MACS) and subjected to scRNA-Seq using 10x Genomics pipelines. Bioinformatics data analysis was conducted with Clarivate Analytics. To evaluate the effects of E7386 on Treg differentiation, an in vitro-induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation assay was conducted. Na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated by MACS and plated under iTreg differentiation conditions (stimulation of TGF-&#946; and IL-2) with or without treatment of E7386. Induced Tregs and conditional culture medium were collected for evaluation of Treg differentiation, including gene expression and protein analysis.<br \/>Results: CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells were clustered into 14 cell-type groups. Increased proportion of monocytes, NK cells, Tregs, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils were observed after LEN plus anti-PD-1 treatment. Among these subpopulations, Treg were most significantly suppressed by E7386 plus LEN plus anti-PD-1. Gene expression analysis revealed that the triple combination suppressed the activated gene expression of the Stat5\/Foxp3 axis in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, particularly Tregs, induced by LEN plus anti-PD-1 treatment. Consistently, the iTreg differentiation assay confirmed the suppressive function of E7386 on the Treg differentiation rate. Multiple subsequent in vitro assays also demonstrated the inhibitory effects of E7386 on TGF-&#946; secretion and the expression levels of TGF-&#946; downstream target genes.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, these data suggest a suppressive role of E7386 on Treg differentiation, which leads to antitumor activity of E7386 in combination with lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibody in a preclinical tumor model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"E7386,Lenvatinib,Anti-PD-1,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) designed to inhibit oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions have transformed the treatment of patients with ALK+ NSCLC and many survive for several years on TKIs. While most patients experience a decrease in tumor burden on initial alectinib therapy, for many, tumor shrinkage is incomplete and persistent, residual disease remains. Critically, the degree of tumor shrinkage and amount of residual disease that persists despite TKI associates with overall survival. Multiple cancer-cell intrinsic mechanisms of persistence despite TKI therapy have been reported, but they do not fully account for the heterogeneity of this initial tumor response, suggesting other determinants are present beyond inhibiting the primary oncogene. However, extrinsic mediators of persistent disease, such as immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), have not been rigorously studied in ALK+ NSCLC as they are considered immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. Using EA-1 and EA-2, two distinct murine ALK+ adenocarcinoma cells lines derived from immunocompetent C57BL\/6J mice, we have demonstrated that ALK+ NSCLC response to alectinib requires the adaptive immune system. C57BL\/6J mice bearing orthotopic EA-1 tumors experience tumor shrinkage but have persistent, residual disease on CT imaging; those bearing EA-2 tumors have no residual disease. In this model system, when alectinib treatment stops, no EA-2 tumors recur but all animals bearing EA-1 tumors experience tumor outgrowth. TME interrogations by multispectral tissue imaging demonstrated more CD8+ T cells in the EA-2 TME compared to EA-1 and no difference in CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in activated CD8+ T cells and CD86+ CD103+ dendritic cells within the TME of EA-2 tumors compared to EA-1. When implanted into nude mice, EA-1 and EA-2 both experience initial disease shrinkage on alectinib, but EA-2 tumors now exhibit residual disease on imaging. Notably for both cell lines, tumor outgrowth occurs in the nude mice despite continued TKI therapy. Using knock out animal models, we established that CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, were required for response to alectinib. In animals lacking CD8+ T cells, EA-2 tumors shrink with alectinib therapy but are not eliminated as in the wild type controls. Notably, despite continued alectinib therapy, tumors grew out in the CD8+ knock out animals. In the EA-2 model, CD4+ T cells we not required for response to alectinib, and CD4+ knock out animals did not experience tumor outgrowth when alectinib was held. Taken together, these data suggest that the adaptive immune system, specifically CD8+ T cells, are required for a deep and durable response to molecularly targeted therapy for ALK+ NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Lung adenocarcinoma,Targeted therapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Greg Reis<sup><\/sup>, Stevie Phelabaum<sup><\/sup>, Andre Navarro<sup><\/sup>, Emily Kleczko<sup><\/sup>, Lynn Heasley<sup><\/sup>, Raphael Nemenoff<sup><\/sup>, <b>Erin L.

Oncolytic virotherapy exploits viruses that preferentially lyse epithelial cancer cells as opposed to normal cells. Interestingly, we have observed that oncolytic reoviruses are able to infect and lyse CAFs, in addition to epithelial cancer cells. Targeting CAFs, in addition to cancer cells, could be advantageous to increase therapy effectiveness. It could serve as a conduit for viral spread and simultaneously disrupt the desmoplastic barrier around tumors, thereby also accelerating the influx of other therapeutics and immune cells. We previously found that the proneness of CAFs to lysis by oncolytic reovirus correlates with the cell surface expression levels of the reovirus entry receptor junction adhesion molecule A (JAM-A). However, most pancreatic CAFs do not express JAM-A. Therefore, a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screen was employed to identify the genes regulating JAM-A expression on fibroblasts, which can subsequently be targeted to sensitize CAFs to reovirus. Pancreatic stellate cells with a moderate JAM-A expression level were transduced with a gRNA library making a knockout of one gene per cell. The highest and lowest JAM-A expressing cells were sorted and sequenced to identify the gRNAs that regulate JAM-A expression. Clonal CRISPR\/Cas9-generated knockouts of a top negative regulator were generated and infected with reovirus, followed by cell viability assays to quantify their susceptibilities to reovirus-induced cell death. F11R, the gene encoding JAM-A, was identified as the top positive regulator of JAM-A expression in the CRISPR\/Cas9 screen, verifying the validity of the screen. The top negative regulators identified were Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) and Zinc finger E-box Binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), thereby serving as potential therapeutic targets to sensitize CAFs to reovirus treatment. Using clonal Zeb1 knock-outs, Zeb1 was confirmed as a strong regulator of JAM-A expression. Zeb1 knockout in JAM-A negative pancreatic fibroblasts caused a robust upregulation of JAM-A and sensitized these inherently resistant fibroblasts to reovirus-directed cytolysis. Additionally, the clinically approved drug Mocetinostat, previously described to inhibit Zeb1, upregulated JAM-A expression on CAFs and increased cell lysis by reovirus. Altogether, our data show that Zeb1 is a strong negative regulator of JAM-A expression on fibroblasts and that Zeb1 inhibition can sensitize CAFs to reovirus-induced cell death. This research provides a rationale for combining Zeb1 inhibitory drugs with oncolytic reovirus treatment to improve killing of CAFs, which in turn could boost overall tumor eradication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,CRISPR\/Cas9,Oncolytic virus,Zeb1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

E7386, a novel orally active antitumor agent, inhibits the interaction between &#946;-catenin and CREB-binding protein (CBP) and thereby modulates Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling. We previously reported that E7386 in combination with lenvatinib (LEN), a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFRs and FGFRs, showed a greater antitumor activity and reduction of tumor microvessels than each treatment alone in preclinical tumor models. Multiple clinical studies are in progress including the combination of E7386 plus LEN (NCT04008797). Here, we further tried to elucidate the mechanism underlying the antitumor and antiangiogenic effect of the combination of E7386 plus LEN by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tumor endothelial cells (ECs).<br \/>Methods: Mice bearing subcutaneous RAG (mouse renal cell carcinoma cell line) tumors were treated with E7386 at 25 mg\/kg and\/or with LEN at 10 mg\/kg by daily oral gavage for 8 days. Tumor ECs (CD31<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD45<sup>-<\/sup>) were isolated by magnetic cell separation and flow cytometry and were subjected to scRNA-seq using 10x Genomics pipeline. Bioinformatics data analysis was conducted by Clarivate Analytics. After quality control and filtering, ECs were gated by their expression of pan-EC markers and were further classified into 9 subtypes (tip, capillary, arterial, venous, proliferating, immature, interferon, activated artery, and lymphatic) according to previously reported markers for each subtype.<br \/>Results: Among classified subtypes, proliferating and immature subtypes showed clear reduction in the percentage of total ECs with combination of E7386 plus LEN versus LEN monotherapy. In both proliferating and immature subtypes, a subset of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin downstream genes showed increased expression with LEN monotreatment. Conversely, these Wnt\/&#946;-catenin downstream genes were downregulated with the combination of E7386 plus LEN, suggesting that Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling may be associated with a drug resistance mechanism against LEN in these subtypes. Pathway analysis indicated that genes involved in cell proliferation and survival were downregulated by the E7386 plus LEN combination versus LEN monotreatment in both proliferating and immature subtypes.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest a role for E7386 in suppressing the activation of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling induced by LEN monotreatment in specific EC subtypes; this activity leads to enhanced antiangiogenic and antitumor activity with E7386 plus LEN combination therapy in a preclinical tumor model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"E7386,Lenvatinib,Endothelial cells,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

MyCAFs are emerging as an important tool for understanding tumor biology. CAFs produce type III, V, VI and XI collagen that are the essential components of tumor fibrosis. Pro-peptides of these collagens can be quantified both in serum with the PRO-C3, PRO-C5, PRO-C6 and PRO-C11 biomarkers where they are prognostic for poor overall survival in patients with various solid tumor types and may be applied in vitro. Here we investigated the association and difference between myCAFs and iCAFs and their collagen expression profile and related that to data available data on serological assessments of PRO-C3, PRO-C5, PRO-C6 and PRO-C11, and cultured CAFs.<br \/>Methods: The collagen expression in CAF subtypes were established from publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq dataset from pancreas cancer (PMID: 31273297) and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 36973297). In addition, we generated a biomarker profile using PRO-C3, PRO-C5, PRO-C6 and PRO-C11 ELISA to measure in serum of 220 patients with various solid tumor types and 33 healthy controls. We cultured CAFs in vitro and measured the same biomarkers in conditioned medium. We compared the result to historical PRO-C3, PRO-C6 and PRO-C11 prognostic data for pancreas cancer patient data.<br \/>Results: Based on the single-cell RNA-Seq dataset, while type III and type VI collagen were found expressed in fibroblasts both from normal tissues and tumor tissues whereas type V collagen and XI collagen were found almost exclusively expressed in CAFs (tumor tissue). When further examining the CAF subtypes, type III collagen and VI collagen were found expressed in both myCAFs and iCAFs whereas type V collagen and XI collagen were found almost exclusively expressed in myCAFs and not iCAFs. Moreover, in the 220 patients, PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 was elevated in elevated in a few cancer types (p&#60;0.05-0.01) with an inter-patient variation ~2-fold whereas PRO-C5 and PRO-C11 were elevated in all cancer types (p&#60;0.0001) with a ~5-fold inter-patient variation. These four biomarkers identified different pancreas cancer patients endotypes all with poor overall survival, P&#60;0.001. In direct alignment, collagen pro-peptides we highly upregulated in cultures of CAFs.<br \/>Conclusions: Profiling collagen expression in fibroblast from PDAC and NSCLC reveals that type V collagen and type XI collagen are exclusively found in myCAF not iCAF. Biomarkers of these collagens can be measured in serum from cancer patients and are prognostic for poor overall survival. Thus, these data suggest that cancer associated myo-fibroblast (myCAF) activity can be assessed non-invasively by specific collagen pro-peptide biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Collagen,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

While the anti-inflammatory nature of NRF2 activation protects healthy cells from malignant transformation, cancer cells can utilize the pathway to promote resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Up to 30% of human lung adenocarcinomas acquire mutations in either <i>NFE2L2<\/i> or its negative regulator <i>KEAP1<\/i> which result in constitutive activation of the NRF2 pathway. However, despite our knowledge of the important immunomodulatory effects of NRF2, these effects are not well characterized in the context of cancer. With NRF2 activators now approved for clinical use, it is critical to understand the impact of these drugs in cancer. Triterpenoids including CDDO-methyl ester (CDDO-Me, also known as bardoxolone methyl) are potent pharmacological NRF2 activators with demonstrated anti-cancer activity in preclinical models. In an early-stage preclinical model of lung cancer, CDDO-Me significantly decreased tumor burden in a dose- and Nrf2-dependent manner and improved immune signatures within the tumor microenvironment. However, most human lung cancers are not diagnosed until more advanced stages. To test CDDO-Me in an established tumor intervention model, lung tumors were initiated with vinyl carbamate in A\/J WT and Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice. Tumors were allowed to develop for 8 weeks post initiation, after which mice were fed either a vehicle control diet or CDDO-Me (50-100 mg\/kg of diet) for an additional 8-12 weeks, alone or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (C\/P) at 50 mg\/kg and 15 mg\/kg, respectively, by IP injection every other week. CDDO-Me significantly (p &#60; 0.05) decreased surface lung tumor counts 35-71% in a Nrf2-dependent manner, and C\/P significantly (p &#60; 0.001) reduced tumor burden 53-59% regardless of Nrf2 status. The combination of CDDO-Me + C\/P reduced tumor burden in WT lungs by 84% (p &#60; 0.05), more than either agent alone. Nrf2 KO mice had an approximately two-fold increase (p &#60; 0.001) of surface tumors compared to WT mice in both studies, regardless of treatment. C\/P reduced tumor burden similarly in Nrf2 WT and Nrf2 KO mice. Interestingly, the combination of CDDO-Me + C\/P increased T cell infiltration into the lungs of WT mice, but this change was not observed in groups treated with either agent alone. Importantly, CDDO-Me did not decrease the efficacy of C\/P but protected WT mice from mortality and weight loss and lowered white and red blood cell counts. These studies suggest that NRF2 activation in advanced lung cancers can still decrease tumor burden by favorably modulating the immune microenvironment and, importantly, complements the anti-tumor efficacy of conventional chemotherapy while decreasing drug toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-03 Role of the microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Microenvironment,Tumor microenvironment,Nrf2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) and sodium chloride (NaCl), MPO catalyzes the production of electronically excited singlet molecular oxygen, which exerts focused cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: Human bladder non-cancer (SV-HUC1) and cancer cells (T24 and 5637) were used to assess differential cytotoxic activity of pMPO. pMPO was combined with associated reagents, including H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>, NaCl, and L-proline and glycine for 45 minutes to support the generation of singlet oxygen. MTS assay was used to assessed cell viability at day 3 post-treatment. Non-cancer and cancer cells were labeled with GFP and mCherry, respectively, via infection with lentivirus and cultured in tandem to allow for simultaneous treatment of both cell types. After the treatment, flow cytometry and microscopy were used to monitor the growth of the cells.<br \/>Results: No cytotoxicity was noted when SV-HUC1 cells were cultured with individual reagents pMPO, NaCl, L-Proline, or Glycine, and limited cytotoxicity was observed with H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>. Notably, cell viability was nearly maximally preserved for SV-HUC1 cells. The combination of pMPO with associated reagents resulted in killing of 5637 and T24 cells, with tumoricidal activity maintained across increasing tumor cell density, with cell viability preserved for SV-HUC1 cells. Within the cell co-culture system, simultaneous treatment of both cell types with the pMPO treatment resulted in selective killing of tumor cells and preservation of SV-HUC1 cells. Mechanistic studies confirm specificity of pMPO binding to tumor cells, and further, high levels of expression of gammaH2AX and phospho-ATM in 5637 and T24 cells following treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: pMPO demonstrates selective and efficient killing of bladder cancer cells with minimal cytotoxicity against non-cancer urothelial cells. Given its reliance on direct surface contact with tumor cells for activity, pMPO may be developed as an intravesical therapy for treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancers.<br \/>Acknowledgements: This work was partially supported by Mayo funds provided to Dr. Haojie Huang.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,MPO,Drug discovery,Oxidative DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The current study aimed to uncover cellular response mechanisms to TTFields.<br \/>Methods: A2780 ovarian cancer cells and H1299 NSCLC cells were treated with TTFields for 72 h (200 and 150 kHz, respectively; 1.7 V\/cm RMS). Changes in signaling pathways were analyzed using the Luminex multiplex assay and validated by protein expression. Fluorescence microscopy, calcium switch assay, antibody neutralization assay, and immunoprecipitation were employed to investigate the mechanism of action. The efficacy of concomitant treatment with TTFields and a potential inhibitor was tested in cell lines (cytotoxic and clonogenic effects) and two orthotopic mouse models: MOSE-L-FFL ovarian cancer and LL\/2 lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor sections from both models.<br \/>Results: Increased AKT phosphorylation was observed in the cancer cells treated with TTFields. N-cadherin, known to be involved in the activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway, was elevated in the membranes of cells treated with TTFields. Elimination of calcium ions required for N-cadherin homophilic ligation abrogated TTFields-induced AKT phosphorylation, whereas calcium supplementation restored AKT phosphorylation. Inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts by neutralizing antibody resulted in a significant reduction in TTFields-induced AKT phosphorylation. Pull-down assays with an anti-N-cadherin antibody demonstrated increased recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to N-cadherin complexes following TTFields application. TTFields-induced activation of AKT could be mitigated in cell cultures as well as in animal models by application of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib. Co-treatment with alpelisib also enhanced the effectiveness of TTFields <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: The PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway, activated via cell-cell N-cadherin interactions, plays a role in the cancer cell response to TTFields treatment.

Here we explored biomarkers of response to the combination therapy and their associated biology.<br \/>Methods: In a Phase 1b\/2 study, mKRAS mCRC patients with prior exposure to oxaliplatin (with or without Bev) were treated with Onv (Days 1-5 and 15-19) in combination with FOLFIRI\/Bev (Days 1 and 15) of each 28-day cycle (NCT03829410). Efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR, RECIST v1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DoR). Preclinically, the combination of Onv and Bev was tested in 3 mKRAS CRC xenograft models. The role of PLK1 in hypoxia was assessed through protein and RNA analyses of mKRAS CRC cell lines exposed to low oxygen levels and treated with Onv.<br \/>Results: As of 25-AUG-2023, 66 patients were evaluable for efficacy in the Phase 1b\/2 and ORR of Onv + FOLFIRI\/Bev was 28.8%. Patients had a median PFS of 9.8 months [95%CI: 7.6, 12.6] and median DoR of 11.7 months [95%CI: 9.0, NR]. An analysis of baseline characteristics revealed that patients not exposed to Bev in the 1<sup>st<\/sup>-line setting (Bev-na&#239;ve patients, n=15) achieved superior clinical benefit compared to Bev-exposed patients (n=51). Bev-na&#239;ve patients had significantly higher ORR (73.3% versus 15.7%, p&#60;0.0001) and longer median PFS (14.9 months [95%CI: 10.5, NR] versus 7.8 months [95%CI: 5.6, 9.8], p=0.0013) than Bev-exposed patients. This data prompted us to assess the effect of Onv+Bev in mKRAS CRC xenograft models. Onv+Bev significantly reduced tumor growth in the 3 xenograft models tested. The combination resulted in a greater decrease in tumor vascularization and tumor cell proliferation, and a corresponding increase in apoptosis, compared to either monotherapy. Further, the effect of Onv on the hypoxia pathway was assessed in mKRAS CRC cell lines. Our findings indicated that under low oxygen levels, Onv inhibited the hypoxia pathway by reducing the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1&#945;) protein, and the mRNA expression of its downstream targets.<br \/>Conclusions: Onv + FOLFIRI\/Bev resulted in greater clinical benefit in Bev- na&#239;ve than Bev-exposed mKRAS CRC patients. Preclinical studies revealed synergistic effect of Onv and Bev in mKRAS CRC xenografts, and a new function of PLK1 in modulating the hypoxia pathway through the regulation of HIF1&#945;. Collectively, this data supports a crosstalk between PLK1 and angiogenesis, and further exploration of Onv + FOLFIRI\/Bev therapy in Bev-na&#239;ve mCRC patients with KRAS mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Polo-like kinase,Angiogenesis,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Since the bone microenvironment plays an important role in this process, attention has been directed to the interactions between cancer cells and the bone microenvironment, including osteoblasts. Here, we investigated the mechanism of interactions between prostate cancer cells (DU-145 and PC-3) and osteoblast cell line hFOB.1.19. We are investigating the broader effects of four different nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) analogs 5-fluoro-1-((1R,4R)-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-yl)pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (KBMD-E), 3-benzoyl-5-fluoro-1-((1S,4S)-4-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)cyclopent-2-en-1-yl)pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (KBMD-G), 1-((1R,4R)-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-yl)-5-methylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (KBMD-H) and 1-(5-hydroxymethyl)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)-5-methylpyrimidine-2,4(<i>1H,3H<\/i>)-dione (KBMD-S) along with aPKC specific inhibitors ICA-1S and &#950;-Stat to develop as potential anti-cancer drugs. Our previous publications suggested that aPKC-&#953; and &#950; are involved in prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Current data suggested that aPKC specific inhibitors along with KBMD compounds induced apoptosis and pyroptosis of DU-145 and PC-3 while having lesser effects on hFOB.1.19 cell line. Our data demonstrate that osteoblasts assist prostate cells to establish in the bone microenvironment by producing metastatic stimulating chemokines while upregulating responsible transcription factors such as c-Jun. In addition, our preliminary data suggested that PKC-&#953; and &#950; are crucial for driving critical steps of the metastatic cascades of prostate cancer cells. Preliminary data suggested that all 6 compounds upregulated interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1&#946; while downregulating IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL-1. Upregulation of Caspase 8 with cleaved gasdermin D in prostate cells indicates an increase in pyroptosis. Our preliminary results suggest that all 6 compounds can be used to disrupt the main steps of prostate cancer bone metastasis which can be targeted to develop customized, tailored therapies for bone metastatic prostate cancer which merit further research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Prostate cancer,Chemokines,Small molecule inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Rigosertib is in a Phase 2 program in advanced squamous cell carcinoma complicating recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB-associated SCC) (NCT03786237, NCT04177498), and a Phase 2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma (NCT05764395). The aim of our study was to further elucidate the mechanism of action and to identify potential novel targets engaged by rigosertib.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A variety of biochemical, molecular and cell biological assays were performed to characterize the binding of rigosertib to previously proposed targets and its effect on RAS-MAPK signaling and tumor cell survival. A mass spectrometry-based Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA-MS) was conducted to identify potential new protein targets of rigosertib. Time-lapse microscopy was used for detection of ROS levels and tubulin polymerization in rigosertib treated lung cancer cells. Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDM) collected from C57\/BL6 mice and human lung cancer organoids were treated with rigosertib and the cell death was determined by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Comparative CETSA profiling of rigosertib and colchicine, a classical tubulin depolymerizing agent, reveals unique targets of rigosertib in multiple tumor cell types. We identify two ROS-related proteins, ERO1A and NQO2 that potentially contribute to the induction of ROS-dependent JNK activation. Fluorescence live-cell imaging confirms the effect of ERO1A and NQO2 on rigosertib induced ROS generation. NEK7, a relevant protein for microtubule organization, is another potential target for rigosertib. NEK7 knock-down reveals reduced microtubule depolymerization in rigosertib treated lung cancer cells. While we confirm that rigosertib might affect microtubules at higher concentrations, the main cellular target(s) responsible for the induction of stress and JNK-mediated inhibition of RAS-RAF-MEK signaling needs to be further characterized. Rigosertib affects the tumor immune environment by activating NLRP3-dependent inflammatory responses and Caspase-1 to trigger IL-1&#946; and IL-18 secretion in THP1 cells, as well as in human cancer organoids, and in wild-type, Casp1\/11<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, Asc<sup>-\/-<\/sup> and Nlrp3<sup>-\/-<\/sup> BMDMs.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These findings indicate that rigosertib may represent an effective compound for inhibition of RAS-MAPK signaling through ROS-mediated JNK activation.

To develop novel therapeutics for TNBC, we explored the efficacy of the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924. We showed that MLN4924 displayed increased sensitivity against TNBC compared to non-TNBC subtypes. Mechanistically, MLN4924 induced extensive re-replication and DNA damage leading to cell death. Furthermore, MLN4924 improved cisplatin efficacy by elevating the DNA damage levels. To demonstrate the mechanisms of MLN4924+cisplatin-mediated enhanced cell death, we examined the XPC level, a key factor in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, playing a central role in cisplatin damage repair. Neddylation of CUL4A promotes XPC ubiquitination which influences XPC binding to the DNA damage sites for NER.<br \/>Methods: We examined the XPC protein level by Western blot assay and RNA level by Real Time PCR using both BRCA1-wild type (MDA-MB-231) and BRCA1-mutated (MDA-MB-436) cell lines and mouse xenograft tumor samples. We evaluated if the proteosome inhibitor MG132 stabilizes XPC ubiquitination and protein levels by treating these cells with MG132 for various times. We also overexpressed XPC in these cell lines and examined the effect on survival upon MLN4924 and MLN4924+cisplatin treatments.<br \/>Results: Our results demonstrate that MLN4924 reduces XPC ubiquitination upon shorter drug treatment but reduces the protein level upon longer drug treatment in both BRCA1-wild type and BRCA1-mutated cell lines. MG132 treatment did not stabilize the XPC ubiquitination level upon shorter drug treatment but stabilized the protein level upon longer drug treatment. We also observed a reduction in the XPC protein level in tumor samples which correlated with the increase in the DNA damage level. Surprisingly, XPC overexpression improved the cell survival in both MLN4924- and MLN4924+cisplatin-treated BRCA1-wild type and mutated TNBC cells.<br \/>Conclusion: We hypothesize that a reduction in the XPC ubiquitination and protein levels plays a role in cisplatin-induced DNA damage repair reducing NER efficiency and consequently increasing the DNA damage upon MLN4924+cisplatin treatment. Since overexpression of XPC results in improved survival of both MLN4924-and MLN4924+cisplatin-treated cells, we anticipate that XPC not only regulates cisplatin damage repair through NER but may have a broader role in MLN4924 sensitization beyond the NER pathway. Importantly, MLN4924 treatment does not affect the XPC mRNA level emphasizing that neddylation influences the XPC protein level. In summary, our research uncovers novel insights into the role of XPC in both MLN4924 and MLN4924+cisplatin sensitization, shedding light on potential avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neddylation,DNA damage,Survival,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

The therapeutic outcomes of ovarian cancer patients are limited by the development of acquired chemoresistance and the lack of targeted therapies. This study aimed to understand the mechanism in which a benzenesulfornamide named Y3 enhances the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Y3 was previously identified by our team as an activator of AMPK with the activity to induce immunogenic cell death of ovarian cancer cells.<br \/><b>Material and Methods:<\/b><b> <\/b>Patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines were pretreated with Y3 for 3 h before treatment of carboplatin or paclitaxel. Celltiter Glo assay was performed to determine the impact of Y3 pretreatment on the IC50 values of carboplatin or paclitaxel after 48 h. Apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin VI\/PI staining and Caspase 3 activity assays. The role of AMPK pathway was assessed using AMPK siRNAs and western blot. The potential of Y3 to enhance immunogenic cell death induced by carboplatin or paclitaxel was evaluated in a syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer using a vaccination assay. The control group mice were vaccinated by subcutaneously injecting mouse ovarian cancer cells treated by carboplatin in vitro for 24 h into the left flank. The test group mice were vaccinated by injecting Y3-carboplatin co-treated cells. One week after vaccination, untreated live cancer cells were injected into the right flank of both groups. Tumor growth was monitored.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><b> <\/b>Ovarian cancer cell lines pretreated with Y3 showed decreased IC50 values for carboplatin and paclitaxel treatments. The apoptotic cell populations stained by Annexin VI were increased in the Y3 pretreated in comparisons with the single treatment groups. Caspase-3 activity validated the results of Annexin VI\/PI staining assay. AMPK knockdown by siRNAs effectively reduced the levels of phospho-AMPK that was induced by Y3, which also dampened the Y3-promoted chemotherapeutic effects on ovarian cancer cells. In the in vivo vaccination assay, tumor growth in the right flank was suppressed in the mice vaccinated with Y3-carboplatin co-treated cells to an extend that is more significant than the control group.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><b>:<\/b> Y3 pretreatment increased the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines to carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Despite this advance, barriers remain which impede further progress including an incomplete understanding of therapeutic response. Our previous and on-going work shows that PARP inhibition leads to both cell death and a more cytostatic, senescence-like arrest. We hypothesize that persistent cells may later promote progression and treatment resistance. Recent clinical trials such as PROpel and TALAPRO-2 have demonstrated success in combining PARPi&#8217;s with next-generation anti-androgen therapies (NGAT) including abiraterone and enzalutamide. Whether NGAT&#8217;s are synthetic lethal and cell death promoting with PARP inhibition is poorly understood. Additionally, given the evolving clinical landscape for prostate cancer, it is important to test whether prior NGAT exposure may preclude response to combination therapy. In this study, we sought to characterize these combinations to better understand tumor cell response to treatment and the placement of treatment within the overall therapeutic paradigm. We&#8217;ve previously used the C4-2B metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line as a model which responds well to PARP inhibition. Here, we additionally utilize the C4-2B-derived enzalutamide and abiraterone resistant lines MDVR and AbiR, respectively. The combination of olaparib with abiraterone (recently approved from results of PROpel) was significantly more efficacious than either monotherapy in all three models. Additionally, combination of talazoparib and enzalutamide (approved from results of TALAPRO-2) was also more effective than monotherapy. These data suggest that prior development of NGAT resistance does not prevent benefit from NGAT and PARPi combinations. Although both combinations were found to cause significantly less cell growth, cells appeared more cytostatic rather than apoptotic, suggesting NGAT&#8217;s do not induce significant synthetic lethality with PARPi&#8217;s. Our work suggests that combining a PARPi with an NGAT promotes a persistent cytostasis which may give rise to eventual tumor progression and the development of resistance. Future studies are directed at further characterizing combinations with PARPi&#8217;s and the development of novel strategies to enhance their efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Resistance,Prostate cancer,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

Targeted therapies with single agents have shown limited success, and the presence of tumor heterogeneity complicates treatment. Combining multiple chemotherapeutic agents has emerged as a potential strategy to overcome these challenges. 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is a glucose analog known for its ability to disrupt glycolysis, protein folding, and the pentose phosphate pathway. This disruption renders cancer cells more susceptible to further damage from reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. Previous studies have demonstrated synergistic effects when combining 2-DG with chemotherapeutic drugs in various cancers. Our study examines combining 2-DG with DNA-damaging agents for high-grade gliomas to uncover potential synergies, theorizing that this combination enhances cell death and metabolic stress, offering insights for better treatments against these tumors.<br \/>Methods: The cell proliferation, clonogenic growth, and cell migration assays assessed viability, clonogenic formation, and migration. Additionally, the cell cycle and reactive oxygen species analysis were employed to evaluate cell division, oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform measured transcript levels, and Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry analyzed metabolite changes in high-grade glioma cell lines following 2-DG treatment. The Agilent Seahorse Mito Stress Test evaluated alterations in cellular bioenergetics. SYNERGYFINDER 3 quantified synergistic effects of 2-DG with DNA-damaging agents, while the Annexin V-FITC Conjugates and a ROS multiplex assay assessed cell death and metabolic stress.<br \/>Results: Our findings demonstrate that when used as a single agent, 2-DG induces cell senescence and limits cell migration but is insufficient to trigger cell death. Moreover, 2-DG treatment shifts glioma cells towards oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, elevates ROS levels, and hampers DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms. Our synergy study reveals promising synergistic effects when combining 2-DG with DNA-damaging agents, including 5-FU, Methotrexate, Gemcitabine, and Lomustine. This combined therapy leads to significant ROS generation and increased cell death compared to single-agent treatments. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to 2-DG leads to increased levels of both glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids within glioma cells, potentially serving as an alternative energy source. This finding hints at a prospective therapeutic approach for targeting drug-resistant cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest that the anticancer therapeutic effect of 2-DG is enhanced when used in combination with DNA-damaging agents, indicating this strategy as a potential approach for treating human high-grade glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Brain tumors,Drug synergy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Published research shows that ACTs are toxic to cardiomyocytes through decreased viability. However, they have mainly focused on drugs that are phasing out of clinical practice while newly generated tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have rarely been studied, despite their increase in popularity for treating multiple cancers as monotherapies and combination therapies. Additionally, most of the concentrations tested tend to be higher than the concentration that directly interacts with cardiomyocytes, therefore overestimating its effects. The goal of this project is to elucidate whether newly generated TKIs and ICIs, both by itself and in combination, lead to decreased viability in cells. We tested three TKIs (Axitinib, Cabozantinib, and Lenvatinib) and two ICIs (Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab), both solely and together, on rat ventricular myoblasts (H9c2) cells using clinically relevant concentrations by calculating the unbound serum drug concentrations found in cancer patients. After 24 hours, we tested cell viability using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. After 24 hours, neither TKIs nor ICIs by themselves caused decreased viability compared to the control group. However, there were significant decreases in viability when treated with combination of the two, with more than 50% depletion in the Lenvatinib\/Pembrolizumab group. Our study indicates although TKIs and ICIs by themselves do not effect viability, they have significant effects after 24 hours when the drugs are combined, even at clinically relevant concentrations. We plan to further characterize whether these drug combinations lead to cardiomyocyte death and through which pathway. Additionally, our lab has successfully differentiated and validated human-induced pluripotent ventricular myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and testing whether these monotherapies and combination therapies effect viability and functionality on human-induced pluripotent ventricular myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is currently in progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Cardiotoxicity,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Like anti-PD-1\/L1 antibodies, small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors that have been discovered by us and others could also efficiently block PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction and exhibit anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical and clinically settings. In this study, we explore the cellular mechanism of small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors, unveiling their novel mechanisms of action in the regulation of PD-L1 and its functions.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The cellular effects of the small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor on PD-L1 protein and RNA levels were assessed through Western blot and real-time qPCR experiments. HTRF assay and cellular luciferase reporter assay were used to evaluate the blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction <i>in vitro<\/i> and in cells. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the internalization of PD-L1 upon treatment with inhibitors. MSD assay was used to evaluate the alteration of soluble PD-L1 proteins.<br \/>Results: Small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors discovered by Abbisko Therapeutics potently blocked PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction<i> in vitro<\/i> and in cellular system. It could also rapidly and strongly induce PD-L1 internalization in cells. Further profiling suggested that small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors specifically disrupt PD-L1 N-glycosylation, resulting in aberrant PD-L1 glycosylation. This, in turn, may hinder the proper translocation of newly synthesized PD-L1 to the cell surface, thereby abolishing its interaction with PD-1 and functions in immune regulation.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, these results for the first time revealed the distinctive mechanisms of our small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors. With their multi-layer inhibitory effects stemming from various mechanisms, small molecule PD-L1 inhibitors may offer potentially improved activities and an alternative therapeutic treatment for the cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Small molecule inhibitor,Glycosylation,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"W.

Defects in replication stress response represent a promising avenue for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy through DNA damage and the release of immunostimulatory DNA. MUS81, a DNA structure-specific endonuclease involved in resolving replication stress, is upregulated in many cancer types including HNSCC, and MUS81-associated cytosolic DNA is implicated in triggering cGAS-STING mediated innate immunity. The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of targeting MUS81 on HNSCC cell sensitivity to cisplatin, and investigate its role in enhancing immunotherapy response in HNSCC, through the cell viability and cell cycle analysis, differential gene expression, and DNA release within small extracellular vesicles (exosomes).<br \/>Methods and Results: We used HNSCC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to investigate the consequences of CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated MUS81 knockout (KO). We demonstrated that MUS81 KO increased HNSCC cell sensitivity to cisplatin, inducing a G2\/M cell cycle arrest. Transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in MUS81 KO vs control cells highlighted upregulation of <i>ANXA6<\/i> (tumor suppressor gene encoding for Annexin A6), <i>MACROH2A2<\/i> (involved in the quiescent phenotype acquisition of malignant HNSCC cells) and <i>CDA<\/i> (encoding for cytidine deaminase, implicated in replication stress). MUS81 KO was also associated with downregulation of LCP1 (encoding for lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1, upregulated in oral cancer and controlling cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and migratory activities). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data, revealed positive enrichment in MUS81 KO cells treated with cisplatin in genes involved in the hallmark interferon alpha (Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) 3.03, p-value &#60; 0.001) and interferon gamma (NES 2.83, p- value &#60; 0.001) pathways, indicative of innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the pathway of hallmark inflammatory response was positively enriched (NES 2.22, p &#60; 0.001). In addition, cisplatin treatment in MUS81 KO was associated with notable alterations in the concentration and length of exosomal DNA, with implications for immune response modulation within the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study underscores the potential significance of MUS81 as a novel therapeutic target in HNSCC. In addition to sensitizing HNSCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents, targeting MUS81 may influence the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the prospects of immunotherapy in this context. Further in-depth investigations are imperative to validate these observations and facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic strategies tailored to targeting MUS81 in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immune response,MUS81 endonuclease,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
