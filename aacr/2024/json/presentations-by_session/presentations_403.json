[{"Abstract":"Introduction: The factors responsible for NSCLC development in never-smokers remain unclear, thus hindering prevention efforts. Our group is one of the first in the U.S. to build a registry of never-smokers with NSCLC to facilitate research to address this global problem. Given the high prevalence of women among cases, we are investigating the contribution of estrogen metabolism to this disease. CYP1B1 converts parent estrogens to the putative carcinogen 4-hydroxyestrogen (4-OHE), a process further accelerated by tobacco smoke exposure. In contrast, CYP1A1 generates 2-hydroxyestrogen (2-OHE), which may be converted to anti-proliferative derivatives. We determined previously that women with EGFR-mutant NSCLC enrolled in the registry have a 2-fold higher ratio of 4-OHEs to 2-OHEs, as compared to cancer-free controls. While EGFR-mutant NSCLCs are typically thought to be diagnosed in never-smokers, prior data indicate that a fraction of patients report some smoking history. The goal of this current study is to determine the smoking prevalence among women with EGFR-mutant NSCLC in our registry and explore the impact of smoking and hormonal history on estrogen metabolism.<br \/>Methods: The Lung Cancer in Never-Smokers Risk Registry (LCNS-RR) is recruiting patients with NSCLC who are never-smokers (&#60;100 cigarettes\/lifetime) and\/or have tumors with oncogenes characteristically present in never-smokers (e.g., EGFR, ALK). In addition to donating biospecimens (e.g., blood, urine), participants complete a survey on tobacco and environmental exposures, hormonal history, and other factors. Using UPLC-MS\/MS, profiles of urinary estrogens (E<sub>1<\/sub>, E<sub>2<\/sub>, E<sub>3<\/sub>, 4-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>, 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>, 2-OHE<sub>1<\/sub>, 2-OHE<sub>2<\/sub>) were determined for 32 women with EGFR-mutant NSCLC in the LCNS-RR. The proportion of each estrogen species over total estrogen and the ratio of 4-OHEs to 2-OHEs were calculated. Medians were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.<br \/>Results: Among women in this EGFR-mutant cohort, none were current smokers, 16 were former smokers, and 16 were never-smokers. Among the former smokers, median pack-years was 11.6. The ratio of 4-OHEs to 2-OHEs was comparable in former- vs. never-smokers (0.51 vs. 0.49, p-value = 0.956). Twenty-three women (71.8%) had a history of oral contraception use, and 5 (15.6%) reported early menarche (&#60;12 years of age). However, neither of these factors correlated with 4-OHE production. Among 28 post-menopausal women, 7 (25%) reported estrogen use since menopause, an exposure that was not associated with 4-OHE levels.<br \/>Conclusion: This preliminary analysis suggests that smoking history, use of hormones, or early menarche do not enhance the production of 4-OHEs in women with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Recruitment to the LCNS-RR is ongoing and will facilitate future analyses in a larger cohort.

This study aimed to examine whether the association between general obesity and prostate cancer is influenced by abdominal obesity.<br \/>Methods: This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2001-2020, a nationally representative survey. The analysis was restricted to 16,703 non-Hispanic men (10,683 White and 6,020 Black). General obesity was defined by a body mass index of 30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> or greater and abdominal obesity was defined by a waist circumference of 102 cm or greater. Respondents were classified into four mutually exclusive groups according to the body fat indicators: 1) presence of both general and abdominal obesity, 2) abdominal obesity without general obesity, 3) general obesity without abdominal obesity, and 4) none of the two (the reference group).<br \/>Results: The overall prevalence of prostate cancer was 2.25% (95% CI: 2.0-2.5%). Men with abdominal obesity without general obesity have significantly higher prevalence of prostate cancer (4.28%) compared to men with both abdominal obesity and general obesity (2.23%), men with neither abdominal obesity or general obesity (1.70%), and men with general obesity without abdominal obesity (0.18%), P &#60;.0001. Black men with abdominal obesity without general obesity have the highest prevalence of prostate cancer (7.21%), followed by White men with abdominal obesity without general obesity (4.10%). With and without adjusting for age and education, men with abdominal obesity without general obesity had significantly higher odds of prostate cancer, regardless of ethnicity. Black men with both abdominal obesity and general obesity had significantly higher odds of prostate cancer. General obesity without abdominal obesity was inversely associated with prostate cancer in White men but not in Black men.<br \/>Conclusions: This study illustrates that waist circumference is a potential classifier of prostate cancer as it shows variation in prevalence of prostate cancer by general obesity within the same and different racial and ethnic groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Obesity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Understanding the factors that influence awareness and use of genetic testing among survivors is crucial for improving access to this important tool.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed HINTS-SEER data, a pilot project conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2021, that oversampled cancer survivors diagnosed prior to 2018 using three registries from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (Iowa, New Mexico, Greater Bay Area). We examined sociodemographic factors in relation to awareness and use of genetic testing using survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models. We also examined associations among breast and prostate cancer survivors, separately, as these cancer types have guidelines for genetic testing and had sufficient observations (&#62;100) for stratified analyses.<br \/>Results: Of 1232 survivors included in the analysis, 277 (23%) had a history of breast cancer, 285 (23%) had prostate cancer, 82 (6.7%) had colorectal cancer, 25 (2%) had ovarian cancer, and 563 (45.7%) had other cancers. Overall, 76.5% of survivors were aware of genetic testing and 23.5% had used it. Among breast and prostate cancer survivors: 40.0% of breast and 20.6% of prostate cancer survivors were aware of genetic testing, and 21.0% and 2.4% had used it, respectively.<br \/>In multivariable models, female gender (vs. male; OR=3.1, 95% CI: 2.3, 4.2), higher education (high school or less education vs. greater than high school; OR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.9), higher income ($100,000 or more vs. &#60;$20,000; OR=3.2, 95% CI: 1.8,5.7), and family history (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.4,3.0) were significantly associated with higher odds of awareness of genetic testing. Older age (&#8805;65 vs. &#60;40 years; OR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.2,0.6), Asian American race (vs. non-Hispanic white; OR= 0.3, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9), and Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic white ; OR= 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) were associated with lower odds of awareness of genetic testing.<br \/>Female gender (vs. male; OR=5.3, 95% CI: 3.3,8.5) was significantly associated with higher odds of use of genetic testing. Older age (&#62;65 years vs. &#60;40 years; OR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.2,0.7) and unemployed status (OR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6) were significantly associated with lower odds of use of genetic testing.

We previously developed and validated a cross-ancestry polygenic risk score (caPRS) to predict risk of developing breast cancer (BC) in women who do not carry pathogenic variants (PVs) in BC susceptibility genes. Here we aimed to expand upon that study by integrating the caPRS with the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) model to combine the effects of genetic and clinical factors in carriers of PVs in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM.<br \/>Methods. We explored the association of caPRS among 12,525 women from the UK Biobank and the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1\/2. The effect size of the caPRS was evaluated separately for individuals carrying PVs in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM and PALB2. We used a logistic regression model adjusted for age, first-degree BC family history (FHx) and cohort for BRCA1 and BRCA2 to examine the association of the caPRS with BC. The effect sizes were expressed as standardized odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The estimated absolute risks to age 80 of developing BC were calculated for unaffected women by combining the caPRS-based risk with gene-specific clinical risk estimates from the BOADICEA model based on U.S. incidences.<br \/>Results. The caPRS was significantly associated with BC risk across all PV carrier groups. Using BOADICEA alone, the estimated absolute BC risk by age 80 for an average unaffected 20-year-old female in the U.S. with an unknown FHx ranged from 23.8% for CHEK2 carriers to 79.4% for BRCA2 carriers. Integration of caPRS into BOADICEA, yielded the distribution of risk for each gene.

Re-activation of the immune armamentarium by checkpoint inhibitors has improved survival in many types of cancer. However, we still are unable to gauge the response of the innate immune system (InImS) to incipient malignancy. The InImS is likely both a sentient early warning system and an immediately deployed cancer combatant. We describe a potential marker that quantifies the innate immune system response to multiple deadly tumors. Methods: We obtained a database of patients at high risk of colorectal neoplasia and prospectively noted those who contracted cancer on follow up. We contrasted the historic, premorbid biomarker response from the time of enrolment, primarily using the FERAD ratio. This was obtained by dividing the ferritin blood concentration by the denominator of fecal shedding of a Paneth cell marker, p87. We also compared the FERAD response to the absolute neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a known prognostic biomarker, and also the available, known PDL-1 response for each group of cancers. Results: We found that certain groups of cancers historically had very low FERAD ratios while others were high. Using FERAD ratios for lung, gastric, non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, melanoma, thyroid, renal, and head and neck cancers, there is a significant inverse correlation between survival and FERAD (r=-0.8;p&#60;0.025) which is similar to that of NLR (r=-0.7;p&#60;0.035). For prostate cancer, breast, colorectal cancer (CRC), leukemia\/MDS, there is a direct correlation between survival and FERAD (r=0.99;p&#60;0.002). There is also an inverse relationship between NLR and PDL-1 response rates (r=-0.8;p&#60;0.04). An observed mild positive trend for FERAD PDL-1 response rates may bode well for melanoma, lung, head and neck and renal cancers. Conclusions: Since p87 could be manipulated by dietary means to affect the FERAD ratio favorably, this could be incorporated into more effective chemotherapy regimens and result in better cancer treatment outcomes. Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and CRC-liver metastasis appear to be immunological outliers. This will need an additional unique approach such as TIGIT intervention therapy (Zheng et al.. Immune checkpoint targeting TIGIT in HCC. Am J Transl Res. 2020). This may allow modulation of the immune response based on FERAD, NLR ratios, and other considerations of mutational burden and genetic mutations, in patients with selected cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic markers,Innate immunity,Blood marker,Adnab-9\/Ferritin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Myostatin, a TGF-&#946; superfamily member is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, inhibits muscle growth, and causes sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Previously, we had observed liver-specific knockout of the SMAD3 adaptor<i>, <\/i>&#946;II-spectrin -<i>Sptbn1<\/i> (&#946;S-LSKO) or siRNA targeting &#946;II-spectrin blocks sarcopenia, fatty liver disease-MASH and HCC (Sci TM 2021), suggesting that &#946;II-spectrin may be a viable strategy to identify mechanisms, as well as new biomarkers of MASH and HCC.<br \/>Methods: 1. SPTBN1<sup>Flox<\/sup> (control) and liver-specific &#946;II-spectrin knockout (SPTBN1<sup>LSKO<\/sup>) mice were fed Western diet (WD) and treated with Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for obesity-associated HCC. Muscle mass, body weight and multiple enzymes involved in glycolysis as well as sarcopenia were measured in mutant mice. 2. In tumors, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) that mediates inflammation and aerobic glycolysis in Warburg effect. Therefore, we further examined TGF-&#946; pathway-enriched biomarkers such as Myostatin and PKM2 for markers of HCC and whether these could stratify risk in patients with cirrhosis for HCC, in a four-institution cohort, (n=157) compared to cirrhosis patients (n=380).<br \/>Results: 1. Like human fatty liver disease, obese mutant mice show marked sarcopenia with increased PKM2 and Myostatin levels with decreased p-RPS6\/total-RPS6 ratio (indicating mTOR signaling inhibition) in striated muscle tissue. In contrast, levels are restored to normal in the liver specific knockout of SPTBN1. 2. Using the 108 markers as well as PKM2 and myostatin (MSTN), we found 31 markers with false discovery rate (FDR) p values &#60; 0.10 from univariable Kruskal-Wallis tests for the associations of markers with HCC vs. cirrhosis.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results reveal that SMAD3 adaptor, &#946;II-spectrin liver-specific knockout decreases Myostatin and PKM2 expression, providing new insight into molecular mechanisms in MASH and HCC. These studies reflect that these are biologically functional circuits that could provide new serum markers, such as Myostatin and PKM2 for risk stratification of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Smad,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.

This gender disparity is difficult to study since it is believed to be multifactorial, due in part to differences in risk factors, behaviors, and hormones. The liver is a sexually dimorphic organ that is extremely susceptible to interactions with estrogens and androgens. Estrogen has been proven to have a protective effect against HCC with a demonstrable gender&#8208;related hormonal effect on the growth of HCC, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVI) mouse model allows for the induction of liver tumors in the host. Eliminating the social and behavioral aspects of the gender disparity will allow us to determine what role estrogen plays in tumor development. In our study, a gender disparity in tumor development was observed between 6-week-old male and female FVB\/NJ mice injected via HTVI of plasmids expressing c-MET, a mutated beta-catenin (b-Cat) and Sleeping Beauty transposon. HTVI of a Luciferase and Sleeping Beauty transposon expressing plasmid showed no significant difference in photon flux by bioluminescence imaging between male and female mice 24 hours after injection. When imaging was repeated one week after injection, the photon flux reduced by an order of magnitude in both male and female mice with the female mice showing more uniform reduction than the male mice. Similar luciferase gene copy number was detected in the liver tissue of male and female mice. These data suggest that there appears to be no gender difference in the transient expression and stable integration of the transfected plasmid. Plasma alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was used to monitor tumor formation in the mice that were injected with c-MET and b-Cat without luciferase as luciferase is immunogenic. The male mice had significantly higher AFP levels at 3.5 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks post-injection than the female mice. At termination, the liver weight confirmed that female mice had much lower tumor burden than the males. We are currently using quantitative PCR to confirm similar copy number of exogenous c-MET and b-Cat inserted in the tumor cell genome and using RT-qPCR and Western blotting to determine whether the transgene expression is different in tumors from male and female mice. To determine whether estrogen played a role in preventing tumor development and progression in female mice, six-week-old male and ovariectomized female mice have been injected with the same oncogene plasmid combination plus the sleeping beauty. Interestingly, AFP levels between male and ovariectomized female mice were comparable when measured at 3 weeks. We will present our findings at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Oncogene,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) is one of the five rate-limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of serine from glucose that supports cell proliferation. Here, we aim to study the role of PSPH in prostate cancer (PCa) and its tumor microenvironment. We find that PSPH not only is overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and benign prostate epithelial cells (BPH-1), but also exhibits a higher level in patient-derived carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compared to the matched benign associated fibroblasts (BAFs), which are derived from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens of African American (AA) and European American (EA) men. Notably, MDAPCa2b cells derived from an AA prostate cancer patient and AA CAFs have even higher expression of PSPH protein. The mRNA levels of PSPH are also significantly elevated in prostate cancer tissues in AA men compared to EA men and predict poor survival in PCa patients. Knock-down of PSPH expression significantly inhibits the proliferation and colony formation of prostate cancer cells. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from PSPH knockdown MDAPCa2b cells has also been suppressed markedly. Gene expression profiling revealed that suppression of PSPH expression by shRNAs in LNCaP and MDAPCa2b cells is associated with the regulation of gene expression related to metabolism, immunity, extracellular matrix remodeling, and Ion channels. Similarly, analysis of publicly available PCa RNA seq databases also demonstrates that PSPH amplification or over-expression is associated with alterations of gene expression related to metabolism and immunity. Our results suggest that PSPH is upregulated in prostate cancer cells and their surrounding fibroblasts to support tumor growth via reprogramming metabolic pathways and transcriptomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH),Prostate cancer disparity,cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

We performed the first large-scale genomic analysis of CaP across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We evaluated the evolutionary history of CaP-associated loci, generated a novel genomic risk score, inferred ancestry-specific genetic architectures, and fine-mapped disease associations using in 3,963 CaP cases and 3,509 controls recruited in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Uganda through the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) Network. Fifteen independent associations at 8q24.21, 6q22.1, and 11q13.3 reached genome-wide significance, including four novel associations. Multiple lead SNPs were private alleles in SSA, a pattern arising from recent mutations and the out-of-Africa bottleneck. These SSA-specific alleles contribute to haplotypes with odds ratios for CaP above 2.4. The genetic architecture of CaP differs across SSA, with effect size differences contributing more to this heterogeneity than allele frequency differences. Population genetic analyses reveal that SSA CaP associations are largely governed by neutral evolution, as opposed to natural selection. This finding is consistent with the late onset of this disease. Focusing on 2,502 age-matched cases and 2,222 non-cancer controls, we generated a novel genomic predictor of CaP. We then assessed the extent to which this polygenic risk score was correlated with age of onset, PSA levels, genetic ancestry, and family history of study participants. The performance of this novel polygenic risk score was tested on other populations of African descent, as well as populations with non-African ancestry. Our findings emphasize the utility of conducting genetic studies in diverse populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,Genitourinary cancers: prostate,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

We evaluated the role of common and rare variants in the genetic etiology of the more frequent pediatric sarcomas: osteosarcoma (OS); Ewing sarcoma (ES); and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), subcategorized into embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS).<b> <\/b><br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>: We evaluated 4,161 European-ancestry cases with genotype data (1,843 OS, 733 ES, 1,585 RMS, and ~61,000 cancer-free adult controls) and 2,474 cases with exome or genome sequencing (1,002 OS, 579 ES, 893 RMS, and 1,057 controls; jointly called with the same QC). Analyses included: 1) estimating disease heritability for both common SNPs (MAF&#62;3%; genome-wide) and rare loss-of-function variants (MAF&#60;1%; exome-wide); and 2) determining the frequency of rare predicted pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP; ACMG-AMP) variants in cancer susceptibility genes (CSG).<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>RESULTS<\/b>: For OS, we conducted a new GWAS and determined that common variants explained 2.7% (SE 1.1%) of disease heritability, while rare LOF variants explained 12.7% (SE 1.5%; compared to 0.4% for synonymous variants). A similar pattern was observed for ERMS, where rare LOF variants explained a greater proportion of disease heritability (RMS 8.6%, SE 1.2%; ERMS 12.6%, SE 1.7%; ARMS n\/a due to small sample size) compared to common variants from our new GWAS (0.9%, SE 1.6%). Conversely, common variants explained a greater proportion of ES heritability (5.4%, SE 0.5%) and of ARMS heritability (15.5%, SE 6.4%). For 113 established CSGs, and for the 60 moderate-to-high penetrant autosomal dominant (AD) genes, OS and ERMS had significantly (<i>P<\/i><sub>exact<\/sub>&#60;0.01) more rare P\/LP variants overall compared to controls; whereas ARMS and ES had significantly fewer P\/LP variants than ERMS and OS, similar to the controls. We confirmed previously reported AD genes, and identified new genes, with an enrichment of P\/LP variants in ERMS and OS compared to controls. For both ARMS and ES, the only AD gene significantly enriched for P\/LP variants was <i>CHEK2<\/i>. For all cases, patients with a P\/LP variant were significantly younger and had significantly more poor outcomes (ie, metastasis, stage 4 disease, and\/or death) than those without. For 49 autosomal recessive CSGs, heterozygous P\/LP carrier frequencies were similar among all sarcomas (8-11%), and several specific genes had similar P\/LP variant enrichment across sarcomas, and for ES and ARMS only, compared to controls.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b>: In the largest set of pediatric sarcoma cases assembled to date, genetic susceptibility was largely driven by rare P\/LP AD gene variants in tumor types not characterized by canonical somatic fusions (OS and ERMS).

We divided minimal into minimal and almost none (&#8804;5%). We conducted a feasibility study of change in BPE after 6 months of the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene (BZA) 20 mg + conjugated estrogen (CE) 0.45 mg marketed commercially as Duavee&#8482; for relief of hot flashes and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> STUDY00145121 started 5-27-2020 with randomization to 6 months of Duavee&#8482; vs waitlist control but was stopped after 11 entrants because participants were unable to receive follow-up breast MRIs due to COVID and Duavee&#8482; became unavailable. STUDY0014761 was opened in early 2022 when a source of BZA was found. Doses of BZA and CE were the same as Duavee&#8482; but given as two pills instead of one. 16 women have been randomized to 6 months of BZA\/CE vs a wait list control between 2-14-2022 and 9-19-2023.

The most common BCa subtype is the Estrogen\/Progesterone receptor (ER<sup>+<\/sup>\/PR<sup>+<\/sup>) luminal subtype, comprising up to 75% of all newly diagnosed BCa. Although these patients show initial benefit with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, however, 40-50% of them eventually don&#8217;t respond to treatment due to resistance. Thus, the need for additional targeted therapies for this large subset of ER<sup>+<\/sup> BCa patients is critical. Based on recent studies, it is observed that Afro-American (AA) patients experience substantially higher BCa mortality (40% more) than White American (WA) women in ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer. Unfortunately, the cause behind this difference in mortality in AA patients is not well understood. Notch signaling is a highly conserved intercellular communication mechanism critical for many cellular processes and is composed of several receptors and ligands. Recent data show that Notch receptors are overexpressed in hormone treatment refractory ER<sup>-<\/sup> patients of (Afro-American) AA origin, hinting connection of Notch signaling to racial disparity in breast cancer. Notch signaling is also identified in several metabolic disorders involving fatty acids and other lipids. However, function of Notch signaling in context of chemoresistance in AA ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer is still unknown. Using single cell sequencing, we found that chemo-resistant AA ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer patient samples have a distinct Notch signature enriched subpopulations in tumor cells, which was missing in WA patients. Notch signaling happens through juxtacrine signaling of ligand\/receptor signaling. Further analysis in tumor microenvironment shows lipid enriched tumor associated macrophages, which are Notch dependent, suggesting potential crosstalk between lipid heavy tumor-macrophages and tumor cells, which may drive the chemoresistance in AA patients. Further analysis using patient derived explants, an attractive new tool for drug efficacy testing in ex vivo, we found that chemotherapy itself increases Notch signaling in the tumors. Ongoing studies involving scRNAseq, untargeted lipidomics and chemo-resistant PDE will delineate the precise mechanism of action between tumor cells and tumor associated lipid heavy macrophages in context of Notch signaling in chemo-resistant AA ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Macrophages,Chemoresistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

TGF&#946; receptor type-2 (TGF&#946;R2), the ligand-binding receptor, is implicated in various cancers. This study explores the functional role of TGF&#946;R2 in breast cancer (BrCa) progression. Materials and<br \/>Method: Genomic alterations in TGF&#946;R2 were assessed in TCGA samples. TGF&#946;R2 mRNA and protein expression were examined in a panel of BrCa cell lines, including MCF7, MCF12A, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468. Additionally, serum samples from BrCa patients, meticulously categorized into subtypes such as triple-negative (TN), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (Her2+), Luminal A (LA), Luminal B1 (LB1), and Luminal B2 (LB2), were analyzed. BrCa cell lines were treated with TGF&#946; ligand to investigate receptor expression modulation.<br \/>Results: Analysis of genomic alterations in TGF&#946;R2 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=1084, BrCa samples) revealed TGF&#946; copy number amplification in 25% of samples, while less than 1% showed TGF&#946;R2 amplification. Elevated TGF&#946;R2 levels were identified in aggressive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells compared to other tested cell lines. Serum samples from BrCa patients (n=240) demonstrated higher TGF&#946;R2 levels, particularly in Luminal B1 subtype and African American patients. Treatment of BrCa cell lines with TGF&#946; ligand induced TGF&#946;R2 expression, suggesting ligand-induced receptor upregulation.<br \/>Discussion: The findings suggest TGF&#946;R2 as a potential biomarker for BrCa, with higher levels associated with aggressiveness and racial disparities. Ligand-induced receptor upregulation implies a potential oncogenic role.

One feature of this dysregulated metabolism is the increase in lipid storage in the form of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs), although what drives their accumulation or their role in metastasis is not clear. In prior studies, we demonstrated that the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D) downregulates pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a key metabolic enzyme, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a). Additionally, we have demonstrated that both 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D treatment and PC-inhibition reduce breast cancer cell migration. Therefore, the goal of the current research is to identify the proteins associated with CLDs in metastatic MCF10CA1a breast cancer cells following 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D treatment or reduction in PC expression (shPC). Proteins from CLDs and whole cell lysates (WCL) were processed for untargeted proteomic analysis. In the CLD fractions, 1562 identified enriched proteins were common to both MCF10CA1a and 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D treated cells, while 160 proteins were higher in the MCF10CA1a cells, and 550 proteins were higher in the 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D-treated cells compared to MCF10CA1a CLD fraction. In the CLD fractions, MCF10CA1a and shPC cells had a similar level of 380 enriched proteins, although 65 were higher in the shPC compared with MCF10CA1a, whereas 1268 were more enriched in the MCF10CA1a CLD fraction. Hypoxia Inducible Lipid Droplet Associated (HILPDA, known to inhibit triacylglycerol lipolysis) was only enriched in the CLD fraction of the metastatic MCF10CA1a cells. HILPDA was not identified in the CLDs of the 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D treated or the shPC cells, nor in any WCL fraction. Further investigation of HILPDA is important to determine if HILPDA plays a role in dysregulated cellular metabolism, including CLD accumulation, or migration, and may potentially be a target for future therapies to prevent breast cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Lipid metabolism,Proteomics,Vitamin D,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, the mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly understood, especially in postmenopausal women. A predominant contributor to dense breasts and differences between women is the relative amount of fibrillar collagens. Experimental models suggest that changes in collagen properties such as fiber alignment and stiffness promote local stromal fibrosis, which we hypothesize may contribute to the relationship between breast density, aging, and tumorigenesis. Normal breast biopsy samples from the contralateral, healthy breast of 32 postmenopausal breast cancer patients participating in a clinical trial for drug effect on breast density were examined and scored for areas of fibrosis and analyzed using second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) and mass spectrometry proteomics. Our aim was to identify areas of fibrosis and relate the severity of focal fibrosis to the physical properties and peptide composition of collagen fibers. Using GraphPad Prism, we conducted one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests and post-hoc multiple comparison tests. H&#38;E-stained breast tissue samples were scored according to percent fibrosis. The minimum and maximum percent fibrosis were 5% and 100%, respectively, with a median of 60% (95% CI: 97.06%). Out of 31 people, 16 had a higher fibrosis score than the median. Consistent with pathologic scoring of the presence and extent of fibrosis, fiber counts were significantly lower in tissue with lower fibrosis scores than samples with more highly scored fibrosis (p-value &#60;0.001). Distance to the nearest fiber was greater in samples with &#60; 20% fibrosis, whereas greater alignment to the nearest fiber was observed in higher fibrosis percentages. At the molecular level, 22 peptides demonstrated a strong correlation with percent fibrosis (spearman r &#8805; 60), of which 13 peptides were statistically significant (p-value &#60;0.0001). The putatively identified peptides belong to type I, III, IV and VI collagens. Fiber length and straightness, but not fiber width, were higher in tissues with greater percent fibrosis. Significant correlations were identified between collagen physical features and peptides: two distinct peptides correlated with collagen fiber length and straightness while 20 peptides correlated with fiber width. These putative peptides belong to types I, III, IV and V collagens with ~70% of the peptides containing at least one hydroxyproline modification. This study is the first to explore the link between focal fibrosis and collagen-associated peptides in healthy breast tissue of high-risk postmenopausal women. These findings provide novel insights on stromal collagens associated with fibrotic changes in normal at-risk breast tissue that may act in tissue susceptibility to tumor formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast density,Collagen,Breast cancer risk,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Low and middle-income countries (LMICs) especially in Africa, are lagging in realizing these benefits largely due to hurdles in molecular testing. In addition, quality histology and molecular data from LMICs is deficient. The aim of this study is to assess the immediate impact of improved access to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing in Kenya, and to establish a long term-lung cancer data base.<br \/>Methods: Staring mid-June 2023, an in-house PCR-based method was adopted for EGFR testing of NSCLC in order to side step the challenges of out-of-country send outs which was until then, the only option for EGFR testing. Further, a sponsored access program was created. From prospectively accrued samples, we performed a before-and-after assessment of the number of NSCLC cases intercepted, cost and turnaround times (TAT) as measures of impact. Demographic, histopathology, and EGFR mutation profiles were analyzed in comparison to Asia, USA and European data. Whole slide histology scanned images are made to compliment the database.<br \/>Results: Over the four-month period, 62 NSCLC cases were accrued, median age at diagnosis was 63 with a range of 24 - 93. The male to female ratio was 1: 1.5. Adenocarcinomas comprised 89%, squamous cell carcinoma 5% and 3% were not classifiable. Metastatic disease was reported in 14 (22%) with the brain being the commonest site. EGFR mutations were identified in 16 (25%) with exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations constituting 94% of them. Monthly requisitions for EGFR have increased 3-fold, and the average TAT has been halved to 7 days.<br \/>Conclusion: Similarities between our data and global patterns are noted; median age is in the seventh decade, NSCLC is more common in women, and so are the rates of EGFR mutations, adenocarcinomas are the predominant type, and there are high rates of brain metastasis at diagnosis. EGFR mutation rates appear to be higher than USA and European data but lower than Asian data. In-house and sponsored testing has had an immediate impact in reduction of costs and TAT and increased requisitions. Assessment of access to targeted therapy, clinical outcome, survival, expansion of molecular profiling beyond EGFR, and build-up of the database including virtual histology images for exploring artificial intelligence algorithms are our next steps.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Targeted therapy,Databases,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Based on this, we used proteome-wide Mendelian Randomization to determine causal associations between plasma protein levels and the risk of developing lung cancer and subtypes. Methods: We performed a two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis using genome-wide association data for 4907 proteins from the deCODE genetics study and five lung cancer and its subtypes from the FinnGen database. Causal effects were estimated using the Wald-ratio method or the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, with additional analyses using the other four common methods when the number of SNPs was more than one. The Steiger filter method was used to test the correct direction of the causal effect. Multiple corrections were utilized by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results: After filtering, we finally analyzed 4645 proteins for the causal association with lung cancer, and the F-statistic of the instrumental variable for each protein was more than 10. After multiple tests, the levels of four genetically predictive proteins were found to be associated with the risk of lung cancer, and one protein was associated with the risk of small-cell lung cancer. In detail, elevated levels of three genetically predicted proteins were significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer, namely, SYSC (OR:4.75, 95%CI: 2.47-9.16, FDR=0.007), TM11D (OR: 1.34, 95%CI: 1.17-1.53, FDR=0.02), and PDC6I (OR: 2.35, 95%CI: 1.58-3.49, FDR=0.03). Elevated levels of FASLG (OR: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.82-0.92, FDR=0.007) were associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In addition, genetically predicted elevated levels of GRP (OR: 0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.17, FDR=0.02) were associated with an increased risk of small-cell lung cancer. The Steiger filter test showed that all directions were from proteins to lung cancer. Conclusion: In this study, we found that five proteins may have effects on the risk of lung cancer, in which genetically predicted SYSC, TM11D, and PDC6I were significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, whereas FASLG and GRP were associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer, respectively. The above may help to explore the pathogenesis of lung cancer, but further comprehensive studies are still needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Mendelian Randomization,Protein,Association,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

Despite its prevalence, the genetic underpinnings of lymphoma in Black Africans and PLHIV remain poorly defined, contributing to regional disparities. This study aims to elucidate the impact of HIV status and EBV on the genetic landscape, molecular subtypes and survival outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in ethnically diverse SSA patients.<br \/>We established a cohort of 117 newly diagnosed DBLCL cases (55 HIV+, 21 EBV+, 62 Black Africans), with histopathologic and clinical annotation from a public teaching hospital in Cape Town, South Africa (2010-22). Tumor specimens underwent histologic review, whole exome sequencing (WES) and bulk whole transcriptome sequencing. Germline variants were filtered by paired normal WES (when available) and normal references augmented by supervised machine learning in tumor-only specimens. Aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM) was assessed in curated genes within paired samples. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed via MSI-sensor.<br \/>Canonical genetic aberrations reproduced in this cohort included recurrent SNVs in <i>TP53<\/i>,<i> CARD11<\/i>,<i> TET2<\/i>,<i> SOCS1<\/i>,<i> MYD88<\/i>, and <i>KMT2D <\/i>with differences in relative proportion compared to the NCI consortium cohort being more attributable to HIV or EBV status than ethnicity. HIV+ cases harbored frequent mutations in <i>TET2<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, and <i>KRAS<\/i>, with fewer in NFKB pathway genes including <i>CARD11<\/i>, <i>IKBK<\/i>, and <i>BTK<\/i>. ABC-type HIV+ cases manifested higher expression of genes in the JAK-STAT pathway. EBV+ cases exhibited distinct genomic features including amplifications in <i>NOTCH1<\/i>, <i>CARD11<\/i>, <i>NFKBIE<\/i>, <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>CD274<\/i>, and <i>JAK2<\/i>, as well as frequent gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the <i>NOTCH1<\/i> PEST domain (40% vs 3.8% q=0.04). Tumor mutation burden was consistent across ethnic and virological strata (median mutations 139-167, p&#62;0.05). Notably, ASHM was not identified as a predominant mutational signature in either HIV-positive or negative cases, and 4 HIV+ DLBCL cases exhibited MSI, corroborated by protein-affecting mutations in mismatch repair genes. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was less than 40%, markedly inferior to published Western cohorts, even when controlled for clinical prognostic factors and treatment regimen.<br \/>This study highlights genetic and biological distinctions in DLBCL due to HIV and EBV. Key findings include the absence of ASHM correlates of pathogenic driver mutations, challenging a prevailing hypothesis of HIV-associated lymphomagenesis, and the identification of MSI in HIV+DLBCL. The dismal survival of this cohort and distinct genomic features, especially in EBV+DLBCL, highlight the urgency of further biological interrogation and inclusive clinical trials for these demonstrably underserved populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African,AIDS-related malignancies,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Throughout this period, it became evident that increased attention should be addressed towards at-risk groups, particularly individuals with chronic illnesses, including cancer. World widely, lung, breast, and colon cancer stand as the most prevalent types of cancer exhibiting high mortality rates in both men and women. Epidemiological data demonstrate that cancer patients, particularly those with lung, breast, and colon cancer, face elevated risk and severity when infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in even higher mortality rates. However, there is a knowledge gap concerning the interaction between COVID-19 and cancer patients, and thus, the current proposal evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in biopsy cells extracted from lung, breast, and colon cancer patients, cultivated as a patient-derived organoid (PDOs). Additionally, we also evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 3D model of spheroids in LC319, CALU-3, A549, H460, MRC-5, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A and CACO-2 cell lines. Both PDOs and spheroids were infected with the SARS-Cov-2 P.1 strain with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 24 hours. We observed that PDOs and tumoral and non-tumoral spheroids were equally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection showing similar viral load levels. However, we observed a cytopathic effect after SARS-CoV-2 P.1 strain infection only in tumoral cells in comparison to non-tumoral cells from the same tissue. Furthermore, we explored the cytopathic effects caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in PDOs and in tumoral and non-tumoral spheroids by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Interestingly, we observed morphological alterations on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 P.1 strain -tumoral infected cells, with the occurrence of surface projections after 1 hour infection. Finally, we performed an exome sequencing analysis of PDOs and<br \/>tumoral and non-tumoral cells which preliminarily indicated an intriguing and informative crosstalk between cancer-related genes and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways. Here we have identified missense and nonsense mutations in genes involved in PI3K pathway, immune function, and cell cycle regulation. In summary, our study showed that SARS-CoV-2 P.1 strain can infect and directly induce cytopathic effects in lung, breast, and colon tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Lung cancer,Colon cancer,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"T.

Despite aggressive and targeted therapies, patients remain to have the worst prognosis. More than 16% of cancer incidence worldwide has been attributed to infectious agents, raising uncertainties about the role of infections in the development of brain cancer. While numerous studies have suggested potential viral involvement in GB pathogenesis, a common limitation is the reliance on a singular technology, such as DNA\/RNA sequencing or immunohistochemistry, within each study. This approach may restrict the comprehensive exploration of viral contributions, as different technologies offer distinct insights into the complex mechanisms underlying GB development. Utilizing a combination of techniques could provide a more holistic understanding, enhancing the robustness of findings and potentially uncovering nuanced aspects of viral influence that a single technology might overlook. To clarify the role of viruses in GB pathology, our study employs a comprehensive approach integrating three distinct research methods. We screened 178 publicly accessible raw mass spectrometry (MS) data of GB tumors from three independent publications (PMID: 31331834, 31154438, 36720864) by employing our internally developed data identification pipeline. The pipeline transforms raw MS data for downstream analysis, conducts database searches against the latest viral protein databases and undergoes peptide validation for enhanced robustness. Subsequent analysis filters duplicate hits and consolidates nested peptides. The final protein list includes only those identified with two or more peptides of over eight amino acids. The pipeline concludes by inferring and listing the corresponding viruses, ensuring a comprehensive and refined approach to the identification and analysis of viral proteins in the context of MS data. To enhance this dataset, we incorporated whole-genome metagenomics and MS-based proteomics, examining a preliminary cohort of15 GB tumor tissues. This approach explored a wide range of viral encoded proteins. Our comprehensive analysis, integrating bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics, identified multiple herpesvirus species across our cohorts. This potential identification of viruses within GB has the capacity to redefine the stratification of tumor types in GB patients, signaling a significant development in our understanding of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Multiomics,Etiology,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Confounding by population stratification is a major source of bias requiring adjustment in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Previous model- and distance-based methods for bacterial genomes yield varying results depending upon which strains are included for comparison in analyses. We therefore developed a robust classification of <i>H. pylori<\/i> ancestry to facilitate generalizable inferences about disease associations. <b>METHODS: <\/b>GrafGen is an R software package adapted from the GrafPop tool for human ancestry (Jin et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2019). The underlying classification algorithm compares SNPs of an individual genome with frequencies in reference populations to estimate subject ancestry and ancestral proportions based on calculated genetic distances.

Recent studies in relatively small disease specific cohorts have suggested that CHIP may exhibit variations among different races and between males and females raising intriguing questions about potential genetic and environmental influences. Understanding the differences in CHIP across races and between males and females may have implications for personalized cancer risk assessment and targeted therapeutic strategies.<br \/>Methods: Patient&#8217;s data were obtained from the Cancer Therapy and Clonal hematopoiesis via cBioportal. The original study was designed to examine clonal hematopoiesis mutations that were found in blood samples obtained from 24,146 patients with non-hematological cancers and their tumor-blood pairs were analyzed using targeting sequencing data MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-IMPACT). The cohort consisted of 45.7% males and 54.3% females; including 6.8% Asians, 6.2% Blacks, and 76.3% Whites. We examined mutation frequencies among these racial groups and between genders, employing the two-sided Fisher's exact test and adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant when both P value and Q values are less than 0.05.<br \/>Results: <i>DNMT3A<\/i> mutations were substantially more prevalent in females than in males (38.94% vs 31.37%, p-value: &#60;10<sup>-10<\/sup>, q-value: 6.19e<sup>-09<\/sup>), While <i>ASXL1<\/i> mutations were more frequent in males than females (5.82% vs 2.69%, p-value: &#60;10<sup>-10<\/sup>, q-value: 6.19e<sup>-09<\/sup>). In the racial cohorts with sufficient sample sizes, <i>STAT5B<\/i> and <i>CSF1R<\/i> mutations were most frequent in Asian (1.40% and 0.84%), followed by Black (0.98% and 0.24%) and White populations (0.29% and 0.09%), (p-value: 8.099e<sup>-04<\/sup> and 7.490e<sup>-04<\/sup>, q-value: 0.0234 and 0.0232).

On the other hand, <i>H3C1<\/i>, <i>H3C4<\/i>, <i>MYCL<\/i> were enriched in the Asian cohort.<br \/>Conclusion: Our analysis provides insights into the complex interplay of sex and racial factors in shaping CHIP mutation frequencies.

In this study, initiated by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consortium to compare performance of different BCR repertoire profiling technologies, we tested spike-ins in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA and DNA control mixtures prepared from nine different B-cell lines. We measured the sensitivity, linearity and accuracy of AIR RNA and DNA BCR profiling for the IGH, IGK and IGL chains of the spike-in controls. Our comprehensive analysis, encompassing CDR3 profiling and full-length receptor profiling (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) sequencing, revealed a 100X increase in sensitivity of detection of spike-in controls in RNA compared to the DNA assay. The high sensitivity of the full-length DriverMap AIR RNA assay allowed the detection of controls from all nine cell lines, with 8 out of 9 cell lines detected in the DNA assay, which demonstrates the robustness of the DriverMap AIR profiling technology.<br \/>This study highlights the remarkable sensitivity of the AIR RNA assay in quantifying transcripts. This approach enables the detection of low-frequency BCR clonotypes, which is particularly advantageous when working with samples containing low numbers of B cells. Furthermore, our AIR DNA assay in combination with spike-in controls offers a quantitative tool for minimal residual disease (MRD) applications, providing accurate insight into cell numbers, which then facilitates tracking clonal expansion of immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Gene expression profiling,Biomarkers,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We propose a probabilistic and scalable Bayesian approach to model the causal relationships between various types of evidence. A fully quantitative system maximizes the utility and integration of various evidence types, empowering clinicians to make more nuanced management decisions.<br \/>Methods: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are uniquely suited to the needs of clinical VC. Two different component PGMs were developed to model two of the evidence categories that will ultimately be used in a comprehensive VC system: population allele frequency (Population PGM) and reported phenotype observations (Reported Phenotype PGM).<br \/>Results: The Population PGM treats population allele frequency observations as a binomial process. By conditioning the model on partial observations, the probabilistic relationships between pathogenicity and allele frequencies can be estimated while stochastic variational inference allows uncertainty to be efficiently propagated. The resulting model performs well across a large number of genes at inferring pathogenicity of a variant from its allele frequency, with an average precision of &#62;99% for benign variants.<br \/>In the Reported Phenotype PGM, phenotypic features characteristic of a disorder are learned from patients expected to be affected based on genotype. Patient-level predictions are in turn combined at the variant level to derive variant pathogenicity likelihoods. To date, models representing at least 102 inherited conditions and 259 genes have demonstrated high predictive performance (&#62;0.8 AUROC) for both patient-level and variant-level predictions.<br \/>Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how each component PGM can be combined into a probabilistic Bayesian VC framework that also includes protein structure and stability, evolutionary conservation, and sequence context. This framework has high concordance with known, well-accepted pathogenic and benign variants classified with rules-based systems, and could make high-confidence predictions for many variants currently classified as VUS.<br \/>Conclusion: We present a Bayesian approach that can integrate diverse types of evidence to achieve high VC accuracy while quantifying uncertainty. Future expansion of this Bayesian framework to all evidence types relevant to VC may allow for more accurate risk management guidelines and further inform medical and genetic counseling recommendations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,Risk factors,Modeling,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.
