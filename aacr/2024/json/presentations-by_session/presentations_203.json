[{"Abstract":"Targeted protein degradation can be induced with monovalent small molecules, termed molecular glues, that modify the substrate-binding interface of E3 ligases and reroute them to novel targets. Despite there being over 600 E3 ligases encoded in the human genome, most glues have focused on only a few. Expanding to additional ligases and targets is challenging due to the low probability of successful 'glueing.' Many have suggested that a weak basal interaction between a ligase and neo-substrate is an important prerequisite for the function of a molecular glue, but such weak interactions are challenging to discover. To address this need, we have harnessed AlphaSeq, a synthetic biology platform that measures protein-protein interactions at scale and with high sensitivity, to identify and characterize novel E3-target pairs. Our approach is twofold. First, we test for novel weak interactions (~100nM to 10uM) between a panel of E3 ligases and a library of disease relevant target proteins. Second, starting from a weakly interacting protein pair, we build mutational libraries of both proteins and measure their binding strengths. Mutations that strengthen binding serve to validate the weak interaction, provide structural insights into the nature of binding, and help to inform subsequent small molecule discovery. Here, we present our approach to discover and evaluate glueable ligase-target pairs using AlphaSeq, validation through proof-of-concept experiments involving a known interaction agonized by small molecules, and examples of novel glueable ligase-target pairs that we have recently discovered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Proteinâ€“protein interaction networks,Molecular glue discovery,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Overexpression has been reported in hematological and solid tumors, myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia and adenocarcinoma. The first generation of PIM inhibitors to make it to the clinic, including SGI-1776, AZD1208 and PIM447, are known to be pan-PIM inhibitors, while the aim of this project was to identify novel &#38; selective PIM3 inhibitors. To this end, several Hit-finding approaches were employed to rapidly generate novel chemical matter, which were then assessed for their activity against PIM3 using a robust ADP-Glo&#8482; assay. In parallel to this Hit-findings activity, we used AZD1208 scaffold as a starting point to generate PIM3 bifunctional protein degraders and designed a specific screening cascade in order to profile such modalities. The PIM degrader library, synthetized using Automated Robotics Lab, was characterized using ADP-Glo assays. It was then screened on our binding and activity kinase platforms, KINOME<i>scan&#174;<\/i> and KinaseProfiler&#8482;, and then fully profiled including ternary complex formation with biophysics and <i>in vitro<\/i> Safety Pharmacology Profiling Panels. One example is the AZD1208 derivate degrader, i.e. EC108154-1, which showed nanomolar range affinity for PIM3 and the E3-ligase CRBN-DDB1, and its affinity range was also confirmed with the ternary complex in SPR and MST-TRIC. This comprehensive screening cascade ensures an in-depth characterization and optimization of protein degraders, with the possibility of monitoring the ternary complex formation with biophysics methods. It is a good illustration of how this combination of tests can be instrumental in selecting the best degraders to progress to the next step of drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Drug discovery,Drug design,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

L858R\/T790M\/C797S and del19\/T790M\/C797S are commonly observed tertiary EGFR mutants identified in Osimertinib-resistant tumors. As of now, no clinically approved treatment exists that specifically targets these mutants. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of highly effective next-generation EGFR degraders effectively degrading EGFR C797S-containing triple mutants.

Not only C797S but our designed degraders also degraded a wide range of EGFR mutants, including Exon19Del and L858R\/T790M (DC50 &#60;100nM). One representative Compound, HDBNJ2812, strongly degrades L858R\/T790M\/C797S and del19\/T790M\/C797S with DC50 of 34 nM (Dmax 88.5%) and 14 nM (Dmax 99.7%), respectively.

SMARCA2 (BRM) and SMARCA4 (BRG1) are the core catalytic subunits of the SWI\/SNF complexes, containing an ATPase domain and a bromodomain. SMARCA4 protein expression is lost in some cancers due to loss-of-function (LOF) mutations and homozygous deletions, and SMARCA4-deleted cancer cells are highly dependent on its paralog gene SMARCA2 for their survival. Therefore, targeting SMARCA2 in SMARCA4-deficient cancers using selective SMARCA2 degraders induces synthetic lethality while sparing SMARCA4 wild type (WT) normal cells. We have recently identified a series of orally bioavailable SMARCA2 selective degraders that demonstrate robust efficacy in pre-clinical animal models with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles. Our nomination candidate PRT7732 exhibits &#62;1000x selectivity for SMARCA2 over SMARCA4 in cell-based assays, with DC<sub>50<\/sub> values in cancer cell lines in the low nanomolar range. The PRT7732-induced SMARCA2 degradation was rescued by a proteasome inhibitor and neddylation inhibitor, indicating ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. Furthermore, PRT7732 does not change levels of known CRBN ligand neo-substrates such as IKZF2\/3, GSPT1 and SALL4. PRT7732 inhibits only SMARCA4-deficient cancer cell proliferation with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 5.0-50 nM, but not SMARCA4 WT cells in vitro. Oral administration of PRT7732 resulted in near-total degradation of SMARCA2 protein with complete selectivity over SMARCA4 protein in a SMARCA4 WT lung cancer model in mice, consistent with the SMARCA2 degradation kinetics-based pharmacodynamic prediction model. PRT7732 oral daily administration showed significant tumor growth inhibition of SMARCA4-deficient lung cancer xenograft models at well tolerated doses. The treated tumor tissues show robust SMARCA2 protein reduction for 24h post dosing. In summary, our orally bioavailable SMARCA2 degraders induce synthetic lethality in SMARCA4-deficient cancers in vitro and in vivo. Efforts to further evaluate these compounds in additional models and in combination with other agents are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,SMARCA2,targeted protein degrader ,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

While current AR-targeted therapies are effective for the treatment of prostate cancer and improve patient survival, resistance in patients typically develops within 18 months. CBP\/p300 are AR transcriptional co-activators and are promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We developed a series of highly potent, selective, and orally efficacious CBP\/p300 PROTAC degraders, with CBPD-409 being the best compound. CBPD-409 induces robust CBP\/p300 degradation with DC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.2-0.4 nM and displays strong anti-proliferative effects with IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1.2-2.0 nM in VCaP, LNCaP and 22Rv1 AR+ cell lines. It has a favorable oral pharmacokinetic profile and achieves 50% of oral bioavailability in mice. A single oral administration of CBPD-409 at 1 mg\/kg achieves &#62;95% depletion of CBP\/p300 proteins in the VCaP tumor tissue at 3 h and 24 h time points. CBPD-409 exhibits strong and dose\/schedule-dependent tumor growth inhibition and is more potent and efficacious than two CBP\/p300 inhibitors CCS1477 and GNE-049 and the AR antagonist Enzalutamide.<sup><\/sup> To further improve the degradation potency and the oral bioavailability in rats, we developed a new class of CBP\/p300 degraders based on our optimized CRBN ligand TX-16. Our efforts led to the discovery of CBPD-268 as an exceptionally potent, effective, and orally efficacious degrader of CBP\/p300 proteins. In the VCaP, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell lines, CBPD-268 induces consistent and robust CBP\/p300 degradation with DC<sub>50<\/sub> of &#8804;0.03 nM and D<sub>max<\/sub> &#62;95%, leading to potent cell growth inhibition. CBPD-268 has excellent oral bioavailability in both mice and rats and has a good ADME profile. Oral administration of CBPD-268 at 0.3-3 mg\/kg resulted in profound and persistent depletion of CBP and p300 proteins in tumor tissues and achieved strong antitumor activity in the VCaP and 22Rv1 xenograft tumor models in mice, including tumor regression in the VCaP tumor model. CBPD-268 was well tolerated in mice and rats and displayed a therapeutic index of &#62;10. Taken together, CBPD-409 and CBPD-268 are highly promising CBP\/p300 degraders for further extensive evaluations for the treatment of CRPC and other types of human cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CBP\/p300,PROTAC,Orally efficacious,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Consequently, there exists a pressing demand for more permeable agents that target intracellular components as viable alternatives.<br \/>Among the various molecular players involved in immune evasion, PTPN1 and PTPN2, two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), play a non-redundant role in regulating tumor antigen presentation. They achieve this by modulating the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway within tumor cells, with their deletion having been demonstrated to enhance MHC-I presentation across various cell types. Furthermore, PTPN1 and PTPN2 also negatively regulate T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in T cells, as supported by genetic studies. Consequently, these two proteins present as promising targets for the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies due to their dual impact on both tumor cells and T cells. Addressing the intrinsic impermeability challenges associated with macromolecules, we embarked on the development of small molecule agents that specifically target PTPN1 and PTPN2, culminating in the successful creation of a low-nanomolar proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), designated as X1. PROTAC X1 exhibits sustained low-nanomolar binding affinity and exceptional selectivity toward PTPN1 and PTPN2 in in vitro settings. Furthermore, it has demonstrated a nano-molar half-maximal degradation concentration (DC50) in Jurkat T cells and numerous cancer cell lines, while concurrently exhibiting efficacy in eliciting TCR signaling and enhancing MHC-I presentation. Additionally, X1-treated CAR-T cells exhibited augmented cytotoxicity through increased IFN-&#947; secretion, thereby reinforcing its efficacy in T cell activation. To ascertain the anti-tumor efficacy of X1, we administered X1 to C57BL\/6 mice bearing MC38 tumors, resulting in a significant retardation of tumor progression. Subsequent investigations revealed that X1 treatment induced an inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment, characterized by enhanced T cell infiltration and the activation of CD8+ T cells. Notably, no discernible adverse effects, such as autoimmune symptoms, were observed during treatment. Collectively, these findings indicate that X1 represents a potent and safe agent for cancer immunotherapy. This study not only elucidates the mechanism of action of PTPN1B\/TC-PTP pharmacological degradation as a viable approach for cancer treatment but also solidifies the potential of PTPN1B\/TC-PTP degradation as a novel avenue for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein phosphatase,Immunotherapy,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Transcription factor NRF2 is a master regulator of cellular protective response, which provides protective effects in normal tissues. KEAP1, the endogenous NRF2 inhibitor, binds NRF2 and redirect it towards proteasome-dependent degradation. KEAP1\/NRF2 interaction is therefore critical for maintaining NRF2 at a basal level. Accumulated studies revealed cancer cells could hijack NRF2 pathway to confer drug resistance. A number of clinically-relevant KEAP1 mutations were shown to disrupt the KEAP1\/NRF2 interaction, leading to elevated NRF2 level and confer drug resistance. Here, by structure-based drug design approach, we discovered a small-molecule NRF2 inhibitor, R16, which selectively binds KEAP1 mutants and restores their NRF2-inhibitory function in tumor cells. We performed in silico screening against the NCI-open database. Top-ranking candidates were initially evaluated by ARE-luc reporter assays, leading to discovery of R16. Effect of R16 in restoring interaction between KEAP1 mutants and NRF2 were evaluated by BRET2 assays. Among 14 KEAP1 mutations that result in disruption of KEAP1\/NRF2 interaction, R16 is active against 11 of them. A variety of assays, including tryptophan quenching, cellular target engagement, BRET<sup>2<\/sup> and GST-pull down assays, indicated that R16 selectively engage KEAP1 mutants and restore their interaction with NRF2, leading to NRF2 degradation. R16 at 0.5 uM substantially sensitizes KEAP1-mutated tumor cells to cisplatin and gefitinib<i>, <\/i>with no obvious effect in wild-type KEAP1 cells. Importantly, R16 showed significant in-vivo efficacy in sensitizing A549 xenograft bearing KEAP1 G333C mutation to cisplatin, while it has no effect on xenograft with wild-type KEAP1. KEAP1-mutated tumors are emerging as a sub-group with severe resistance to currently available therapies. Here, we have identified a KEAP1 mutant-selective NRF2 inhibitor, which potently sensitizes KEAP1-mutated cells\/tumors to anticancer agents, with little effects on the WT-KEAP1. Our work demonstrated it is feasible to restore the NRF2-inhibitory function of KEAP1 mutants, by targeting the mutants with compounds to repair the disrupted KEAP1 mutant\/NRF2 interactions. The KEAP1 mutant-selectivity is critical, as NRF2 is a master regulator of cellular defense response in WT-KEAP1 normal tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,Drug resistance,Small molecule inhibitor,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

PIM1, an isoform of PIM, is known to regulate cell survival, migration, and proliferation. Uniquely, PIM kinases are constitutively active due to the lack of a regulatory domain. Therefore, PIM protein levels are reflected in PIM activity and are regulated by protein degradation and synthesis. PIM inhibitors have been developed, targeting the PIM kinase activity and inhibiting phosphorylation of downstream targets, but have had limited efficacy. Our lab and others demonstrate that PIM inhibitor treatment increases total PIM protein levels, suggesting that PIM kinases control protein stability via autophosphorylation. To elucidate the mechanism of autophosphorylation dependent regulation of PIM1, we used phospho-proteomics to identify potential autophosphorylation sites on PIM1. We have identified overexpression of deubiquitinase USP28 inhibiting degradation of PIM1, leading to the investigation of the role of F-box protein Fbw7 in regulating PIM1. Dominant-negative expression of Fbw7 results in increased PIM1 total protein. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation of Fbw7 knockdown cells resulted in decreased PM1 ubiquitination compared to control. Therefore, we have identified Fbw7 as a putative E3 ligase responsible for PIM1 degradation. To address the limited efficacy of PIM inhibitors, we have developed the first PIM-PROTAC (PIMTAC) with our collaborators. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a promising approach to eliminating the pro-tumorigenic effects of PIM. The PIMTAC selectively targets PIM kinases for degradation and we have demonstrated <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy. PIMTAC successfully maintains degradation of all isoforms of PIM for over 72 hours. In vitro assessment of anti-tumor efficacy demonstrated increased apoptotic death with PIMTAC alone compared to PIM inhibitor or docetaxel. Furthermore, dual treatment of PIMTAC and docetaxel had more apoptotic death compared to PIM inhibitor with docetaxel. We aim to develop the PIMTAC for pre-clinical testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Phosphorylation,Drug design,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Aberrantly expressed G9a\/GLP has been implicated in numerous cancers, including prostate, lung, and leukemia. The oncogenic activity of G9a\/GLP is attributed to both its catalytic and non-catalytic functions, such as forming co-activator complexes with p300, CARM1, GRIP1, and Mediator to positively regulate gene transcription. As such, current G9a\/GLP enzymatic inhibitors display limited anti-cancer activity. As an alternative therapeutic strategy, PROTAC degraders harness the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to effectively eliminate oncoproteins and abrogate all catalytic and non-catalytic functions. Here, we present the first-in-class G9a\/GLP PROTAC degrader, MS8709, which potently degrades G9a and GLP in a time-, concentration-, and UPS-dependent manner. Moreover, MS8709 induces superior cell growth inhibition compared to its parent inhibitor in prostate, lung, and leukemia cell lines. Overall, MS8709 is a useful chemical tool to investigate G9a\/GLP biology and offers a novel approach for the treatment of G9a\/GLP-dependent cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

MGDs induce close proximity between the target protein and E3 ligase, resulting in the degradation of the target protein. In the wake of the remarkable success of PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, various approaches to modulate the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) activity have been explored. Tregs represent the primary immune suppressor and significantly impede antitumor immune responses. IKZF2, a marker of stable suppressive Treg, is essential for maintaining the stable Treg cell phenotype. Depletion of IKZF2 can induce a transition from Treg to effector T cell (Teff) phenotypes, thereby enhancing anti-tumor responses. Leveraging an Immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), Novartis has developed the IKZF2 degrader DKY709, which is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials, both as a monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. In this presentation, we present the preclinical results of the best-in-class IKZF2 degrader, PRT-101. PRT-101 elicits rapid and robust degradation of IKZF2, demonstrating subnanomolar DC<sub>50<\/sub> and achieving 100% D<sub>max<\/sub> in a proteasome- and CRBN-dependent manner. However, PRT-101 does not induce the degradation of well-known neosubstrates, including IKZF1, IKZF3, SALL4, and CK1a. Global proteomic analysis reveals that PRT-101 exclusively facilitates IKZF2 degradation. The degradation of IKZF2 by PRT-101results in an increase in IL-2 secretion, a marker of T effector function. Furthermore, oral administration of PRT-101 exhibits excellent pharmacokinetics, concurrent with IKZF2 degradation, yielding superior anti-tumor effects compared to DKY709 in the MC38 mouse syngeneic model. In conclusion, our findings underscore the potential of the novel IKZF2 degrader as a promising immuno-oncology target for the treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IKAROS,IKZF2,DEGRADER,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

However, recent advancements in High-throughput Screening (HTS) have yielded a breakthrough, as several YAP binders have been identified, igniting new possibilities in the quest to combat YAP-driven malignancies. Building upon this progress, a novel approach utilizing Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology was employed to design and synthesize a series of YAP degraders. Here, our degraders were created by linking NSC682769, a previously reported YAP binder, with either VHL ligand 2 or pomalidomide using various linkers of different lengths and types. Among these degraders, YZ-6 emerges as the most promising, inducing rapid and sustained YAP degradation via promoting its ubiquitination-proteasome-dependent proteolysis. This process effectively suppressed YAP\/TEAD-led transcription in both YAP-dependent NCI-H226 and Huh7 cancer cell lines. In addition to its degradation capabilities, YZ-6 also exhibited antiproliferative activity in both cell lines. Importantly, YZ-6 efficiently suppressed tumor development in the Huh7 xenograft mouse model, accompanied by a remarkable decrease in YAP levels, without adverse effects on the mice. These findings highlight the potential of PROTAC-mediated degradation as a viable strategy for reducing oncogenic YAP levels and attenuating downstream signaling in cancer cells. Moreover, the development of PROTACs based on NSC672869 holds promise for treating YAP-driven malignancies, opening new avenues for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Yes-associated protein (YAP),Liver cancer,Drug discovery,PROTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is considered a promising target for tumor immunotherapy. PROTAC-involved disruption of HPK1 protein activity enhanced the treatment efficacy of CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapies in different solid tumors and mouse models. Thus, targeting HPK1 by PROTAC to restore T-cell activity is an attractive approach to induce a greater immune responses in cancer.<br \/>Results: We designed and synthesized a series of HPK1 degraders by tethering our previously discovered novel HPK1 inhibitor with CRBN binder through various linkage. The most potent PROTAC effectively degrades HPK1 proteins in the Ramous cell in a dose-dependent manner and achieves DC<sub>50<\/sub> value &#60;50 nM. The maximum degradation (D max ) values achieved are &#62;90%. Our PROTAC showed EC<sub>50<\/sub> value &#60;100 nM for IL-2 and IFN&#947; production. PK studies revealed a low clearance, high plasma exposure and oral bioavailability in mice and rats. Furthermore, our PROTAC is shown to induce robust and statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in the MC38 and CT26 syngeneic model with increased T cell signatures observed within the tumor. The PROTAC in combination with anti-PD1 also resulted in robust anti-tumor activity with TGI &#62; 90%. The 14 days DRF experiment shows that the compound has a great safety window(&#62;200 folds).<br \/>Conclusion: We show here that a potent oral HPK1 degrader demonstrates strong immune cell activation and robust anti-tumor activity in mouse syngeneic tumor models, as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD1. Further evaluation of these potent degraders in additional in vivo studies will continue to build upon our mechanistic understanding of HPK1 degradation as a novel immunomodulatory approach for anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

A limitation arising from inhibiting the MDM2-p53 interaction is the upregulation of MDM2, itself a target gene of p53, and this attenuates the activation of p53 and efficacy of the inhibitors. To circumvent this limitation, we previously reported the first PROTAC based MDM2 degraders. These induced and sustained robust degradation of MDM2, achieved stronger p53 activation, and more potent anticancer activity than MDM2 inhibitors thus representing a new therapeutic strategy for targeting MDM2. Currently, all the PROTAC based MDM2 degraders are all dosed intravenously. Here we describe our design, synthesis, and optimizations that led to the discovery of the first orally bioavailable PROTAC based MDM2 degrader and our investigation of its therapeutic potential and mechanism of action. Consistent with its design to effectively degrade MDM2, our PROTAC effectively induces rapid degradation of MDM2 resulting in accumulation of wild-type p53 protein and activates p53 transcriptional activity in leukemia cells without accumulation of MDM2 protein. Consequently, it potently inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis at low nano-molar concentrations in ALL and AML cell lines &#62;10-100 times more potent than MDM2 inhibitors; and, after 50 mg\/kg oral dose, 5 days\/week for 3 weeks, it increased the median survival by 26 days of mice with disseminated RS4;11 cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,Proteasome-mediated degradation,p53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Despite advances in treatments and significant efficacy of immunotherapy drugs in HNSCC, no effective targeted therapies have been approved in this disease yet. NSD2 is a histone lysine methyltransferase, which is overexpressed in HNSCC and is implicated in tumor growth, cell cycle regulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis not only in HNSCC, but also in many other solid tumors. Development of inhibitors to the catalytic activity of NSD2 has been rather limited to date, which necessitates an alternative approach. To target NSD2, we have recently developed a series of novel proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which chemically degrade NSD2 utilizing native cellular machinery - ubiquitin-proteasome system - with VHL as an E3 ligase. A series of &#62;40 compounds were tested in HNSCC cell lines (JHU-011 and FaDu) and NSD2-dependent multiple myeloma cell line (KMS11) for degradation activity against NSD2 protein, and H3K36me<sup>2<\/sup> chromatin mark reduction, using Western blot. We also tested their anti-proliferative activity in cell viability assay (CTB) and clonogenic assay. Compounds NUCC-0227381, NUCC-0227384, NUCC-0227414 and NUCC-0227383 show promising results by reducing NSD2 and H3K36me<sup>2<\/sup> levels. NUCC-0227383 compound was highly promising, as it was the most potent in reducing NSD2\/K36me<sup>2<\/sup> levels without affecting NSD1\/NSD3 levels and had profound effects on HNSCC cell growth. Lead compound NUCC-0227383 was chosen for further testing and in preliminary testing, showed a dose-dependent, VHL-mediated, and proteasome dependent function. Proteomics analysis, testing for specificity of NUCC-0227383 against a panel of histone methyltransferases, and in vivo testing of this promising compound against HNSCC is planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,NSD2,Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Most ADCs act by delivering cytotoxic payloads into target cells. The activity of most ADCs is predicated upon internalization to release the cytotoxic payloads intracellularly to act on the malignant cells. The degree of ADC internalization is incomplete or absent for many cell surface targets, limiting the activity of ADCs. PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules that result in the polyubiquitylation of their targets by inducing proximity with E3 ligases. The proteasome then recognizes the poly-ubiquitin chains and degrades these targets. We hypothesized that PROTACs that act on the same targets as ADCs could improve the internalization and efficacy of these ADCs.<br \/>Using multiple cell lines derived from breast, lung or pancreatic cancers that express the oncogenic cell surface proteins EGFR (ERBB1), HER2 (ERBB2) or MET (HGF), we measured antibody internalization with live cell imaging. Antibodies were labeled with a pH sensitive reagent that fluoresces red (640 nm) upon exposure to acidic environments. Fluorescence was measured over time to create an area under the curve which was compared between the cell lines that were treated with and without PROTACs. Antibody internalization was observed in all cell lines that expressed the targets recognized by the antibodies. The addition of PROTACs targeting the same oncogenic cell surface proteins as the antibodies significantly increased antibody internalization beyond that observed without PROTACs. Internalization of antibodies was confirmed by measuring intracellular immunoglobulins by Western blot. Antibody internalization with PROTACs was dose-dependent, increased over time and was blocked by either the clatharin inhibitor Dyngo4a or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the case of HER2 for which there are FDA-approved anti-HER2 ADCs, the cytotoxicity of trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1) significantly increased with the addition of a HER2-targeting PROTAC across a range of doses.<br \/>PROTACs that target the same oncogenic cell surface proteins as antibodies improve antibody internalization and ADC cytotoxicity, in a process dependent upon clatharin and the proteasome. This novel application of PROTACs may impact the use of ADCs, and provides a rationale to combine these agents in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,PROTAC,Lung cancer,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

We have previously reported the discovery of SD-36 and SD-91 as potent, selective and highly efficacious STAT3 degraders. In the present study, we report the discovery and extensive evaluation of highly potent, selective and efficacious new STAT3 degraders designed using novel cereblon ligands and novel STAT3 ligands. Our most potent STAT3 degraders are &#62;10-times more potent than SD-36 in inducing STAT3 degradation in cells and demonstrates &#62;100-fold degradation selectivity over other STAT members. They achieve nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in leukemia and lymphoma cancer cell lines with activated STAT3. A single intravenous dose of these STAT3 degraders reduces the STAT3 protein for &#62;48 hrs in xenograft tumor and native tissues, without reducing another other STAT members. Weekly administration of these STAT3 degraders is capable of achieving complete tumor regression in xenograft tumor models without any signs of toxicity. Taken together, these STAT3 degraders are promising lead compounds for extensive evaluation for the treatment of the treatment of human cancers and other human diseases in which STAT3 plays a key role.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,PROTACs,CRBN,Degrader,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.

This study investigated the efficacy of bAP15 against chondrosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. To evaluate bAP15's effects on chondrosarcoma cells, the SW1353 and JJ012 cell lines were employed. Cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were assessed using MTT assay and flow cytometry. Western blotting was utilized to analyze apoptosis, cell stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, a xenograft mouse model was established to examine the in vivo anti-tumor potential of bAP15. Compared to normal cartilage tissue, chondrosarcoma cells exhibited significantly higher expression of the DUB UCHL5, suggesting its potential involvement in chondrosarcoma development. Treatment with bAP15 effectively induced apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells by activating caspases and cleaving PARP. Furthermore, bAP15 enhanced ER stress by activating caspase-4 and CHOP. In the xenograft mouse model, bAP15 demonstrated remarkable anti-tumor efficacy with minimal toxicity. These findings highlight the potential of bAP15 as a therapeutic strategy for chondrosarcoma. Its ability to induce ER stress and cell cycle arrest, coupled with its in vivo anti-tumor activity, provides compelling evidence for its further development as a novel treatment option for this challenging cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.-L.
