[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Higher consumption of dietary sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical found in many cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to be associated with lower risk of lung cancer (LC). SF activates the NRF2-pathway, which initiates cellular detoxification, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory responses. To date, no chemoprevention trial for LC has examined the impact of SFN on LC-related gene expression (GE) as an endpoint in nasal and bronchial tissue. The objective of our study was to examine whether oral intake of SF for 12 months impacts the GE of previously identified LC- and premalignant lesions (PML)-related genes in bronchial and nasal brushing samples.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT03232138) was conducted in former smokers with &#8805; 30 pack-years and quitting smoking for 1-10 years in Western Pennsylvania, USA. Forty-three subjects were randomly assigned to the SFN treatment (n = 21) or placebo group (n = 22) in 2018-2022. Each participant was instructed to take 4 Avmacol<sup>&#174;<\/sup> or identical placebo capsules BID for 12 months. Each Avmacol<sup>&#174; <\/sup>capsule contained 15 mg of glucoraphanin, which yielded a daily internal dose of 120 &#956;mol SFN. Nasal swabs and bronchial brushings were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. Among the 37 participants who completed the study, RNA was extracted from their nasal swabs and bronchial brushings. We constructed single sample gene signature scores (GSS) using the GSVA algorithm for the following: 1) the NRF2-pathway, 2) genes associated with LC risk in bronchial biopsies, and 3) genes associated with PML. The genes in these sets were stratified by their up- or down-regulation in LC or PML. We evaluated the association between the interaction of SFN supplementation over time (pre-\/post-treatment) on GSS using linear mixed models, adjusted for the fixed effects of age at baseline, RNA integrity number (RIN), packyears of smoking, and random effect of participant.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>GE data was available for 31 participant pairs with bronchial and\/or nasal samples. Within nasal tissue, SFN treatment increased both the GSSs of the NRF2-pathway (p=0.0089) and the downregulated LC-risk genes (p=0.0047), and decreased the upregulated LC-risk genes (p=0.012) over time, whereas SFN had no significant impact on GSSs of the NRF2-pathway and LC-risk genes in the bronchial tissue. No association between SFN treatment over time and the PML-related GSS was observed in nasal or bronchial tissue.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our initial analysis indicates that SFN treatment over 12 months impacted LC-associated GE in nasal tissue but not in bronchial tissue from former smokers. The discrepancy results may be due to small sample size and additional studies are warranted to confirm if SFN has direct impact on LC-risk related genes in bronchial tissue (NIH grant No. R01CA213123).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-05 Chemoprevention clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sulforaphane,Gene expression,Chemoprevention,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Puerto Rico (PR) is in the top ten in terms of HIV prevalence in the US, and also has disparities in HPV-related malignancies. The oral microbiome can increase the risk of HPV infection and persistence; however, it has not been investigated in the context of HIV in PR. Therefore, we evaluated diversity and composition of the oral bacteriome of 48 virologically suppressed PWH (men and women &#8805;21 and &#60;64 years old) living in PR in relation to HPV status (HPV+: n=18 vs. HPV-: n=30). We collected saliva (16S rDNA sequencing), oral rinse (HPV genotyping) as well as sociodemographic, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA, acetate, butyrate and propionate) were quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Periodontal disease was assessed by a clinical full-mouth periodontal assessment using the CDC\/AAP guidelines. All analyses were performed using QIIME2 and R-statistical software. There were no significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon, observed OTUs, and Faith) between HPV+ and HPV- groups. Absolute CD4 count was not significantly different between HPV+ and HPV- participants (794 cells\/&#181;L vs. 735 cells\/&#181;L), and did not correlate with either microbial richness or diversity. Higher microbial richness was associated with lower levels of acetate (r=-0.35, p&#60;0.05) and propionate (r=-0.31, p&#60;0.05,). Additionally, higher phylogenetic diversity was also associated with lower levels of acetate (r=-0.38, p&#60;0.05) and propionate (r=-0.35, p&#60;0.05) irrespective of the HPV status. On the other hand, higher levels of butyrate was significantly associated with higher microbial diversity (Shannon index; r=0.33, p&#60; 0.05). Taxonomic analyses showed significantly higher abundance of <i>Dialister<\/i> and <i>Nanosynbacter<\/i> genera in HPV+ participants and higher abundance of <i>Rothia<\/i> genus and <i>Capnocytophaga sputigena<\/i> in HPV- participants. Overall, we found specific prokaryotic profile and associated metabolites associated with HPV infection, which may suggest that the oral microbiome could influence the natural history of HPV infection via SCFA signaling. Members of the <i>Dialister<\/i> genus have been found to be prevalent in Hispanic and Black women cervicovaginal microbiota, and as well as in HPV infection and oral cancer. Understanding the underpinning mechanisms of how the oral microbiome can facilitate HPV infection and persistence in PWH is essential to establish targets for early identification and personalized treatment approaches for oral HPV-related malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-08 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Microbiome,Oral Cancer,Short chain fatty acids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

The gut microbiota may play a critical role in breast cancer etiology, likely through the roles of the gut microbiota in estrogen and nutrient metabolism as well as in immune regulation. However, evidence on associations between breast cancer and gut microbiota is limited and inconsistent. Using resources from the Vietnamese Breast Cancer Case-Control Study (VBCS), we evaluated differences in gut microbiome profiles between women with breast cancer and healthy women.<b> <\/b>Pre-treatment tool samples of 162 incident breast cancer cases (age: 50.0&#177;9.5) and stool samples of 370 age-matched controls (age: 49.7&#177;9.0) were included in the study. The gut microbiome was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Differences in gut microbiome &#945;-diversity and &#946;-diversity between breast cancer patients and healthy controls were evaluated via linear regression models and PERMANOVA testing, respectively. Case-control differences in gut microbial taxa abundance were assessed through the differential abundance analysis with adjustment for potential confounders, including age, income levels, residence, menopausal status, reproductive factors, body mass index, comorbidity, dietary intake, and physical activity.

Not all LS patients develop CRC, and age at diagnosis varies significantly, even among individuals with identical mutations. Although several prospective genetic modifiers have been reported, the contribution of environmental exposures to colorectal carcinogenesis and age of onset is unknown. The gut microbiota composition, influenced by environmental factors, may have a role in CRC development. Dysbiosis, or abnormalities in host-bacteria interactions, can lead to inflammatory bowel disorders and CRC. Certain strains of bacteria, like <i>Escherichia coli<\/i> and <i>Enterococcus sp.<\/i>, harbor pro-inflammatory\/genotoxic genes that promote sustained inflammation in the host- <i>pks, tcpc, gelE, cnf-1, usp, <\/i>and <i>murB<\/i>. The association between inflammation and carcinogenesis is well established, yet the contribution of bacteria-induced inflammation and genotoxicity to CRN is not fully understood. This study aims to investigate if changes in the prevalence of the genotoxic\/pro-inflammatory bacterial genes are associated with CRN in LS patients. Stool samples were collected from 32 LS subjects and 94 age\/gender-matched control subjects without a history of CRC. Qualitative data regarding the six genes in these samples were assessed using RT-PCR with SYBR green. Among LS subjects, 68.8% had two or more of the six genes in their stool samples, whereas controls only had 27.7%. Furthermore, LS subjects had 4.06 times the odds of having &#8805;2 gut bacterial toxin genes in their stool (95% CI: 1.48-11.12) when compared to controls after adjusting by age. The most prevalent gene in LS patients was <i>murB<\/i>, detected in 62.5% of the individuals. The presence of <i>gelE<\/i> and <i>murB<\/i> genes was significantly higher among LS patients (p-value &#60;0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Interestingly, the <i>usp<\/i> gene was absent in any LS patients. Additionally, LS subjects had 4.52 times the odds of having the <i>gel-E<\/i> gene (95% CI: 1.69-12.14) compared to controls after age adjustment. Given the documented evidence about the impact of CRC on the composition of gut microbiota, we performed analysis to assess the prevalence of these genes in LS subjects without a history of CRC, as well as in control subjects. After adjusting by age, LS subjects had higher odds of having &#8805;2 gut bacterial toxin genes in their stool (OR= 2.94, 95%: CI 0.52-16.50) than controls. This study shows that LS patients have a higher prevalence of the genotoxic\/pro-inflammatory bacterial genes.

Potential causal factors are altered diets and gut microbiomes. Yet key signaling pathways, host-microbe interactions, and metabolites such as ammonia in cancer remain unclear. CEACAM1 responds to pathogenic microbes, interacts with the TGF-&#946;\/SPTBN1 and levels are raised in invasive colon cancer. Alterations in the TGF-&#946; pathway occur ~40% of human GI cancers, and mouse models with disrupted TGF-&#946; signaling (<i>Tgfbr2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, Smad4<sup>+\/-<\/sup>Sptbn1<sup>+\/-<\/sup>, and Tgfb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) develop colorectal cancer (CRC) that is dependent upon an altered gut microbiome. Our previous studies indicate the lipid metabolites (reactive aldehydes) form toxic adducts with cleaved SPTBN1 and divert TGF-&#946; signaling to pro-oncogenic process. Poor prognosis CRC is associated with raised levels of microbial metabolites, such as ammonia. Thus, we hypothesized that &#8220;<i>the intricate relationships among pathogen-binding CEACAM1, the gut microbiome, metabolites such as ammonia, and &#946;II-Spectrin drive colon cancer development&#8221;.<\/i><br \/>Methods: We examined gut microbiota composition, immune cell population, inflammation, and cancers in <i>Smad4<sup>+\/-<\/sup>Sptbn1<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Sptbn1<sup>LSKO<\/sup><\/i> mice fed a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). We evaluated CEACAM1 and TGF-&#946; member alterations in in CRCs using TCGA datasets. Alphafold-based molecular modeling predicted interaction sites between &#946;II-Spectrin and CEACAM1 was followed by functional studies.<br \/>Results: Increased CEACAM1 levels with alterations in TGF-&#946; members were associated with lower survival (TCGA). Mice with disrupted TGF-&#946; signaling (<i>Smad4<sup>+\/-<\/sup>Sptbn1<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>) develop CRC, have high CEACAM1 levels, and an altered gut microbiome signature. CEACAM1 interacts with &#946;II-Spectrin, and levels are restored to normal in &#946;II-Spectrin LSKO which restores the gut microbiome and blocks inflammation and cancer. Ammonia induces CASPASE-3 mediated cleavage of &#946;II-Spectrin, forms toxic adducts and divert TGF-&#946; signaling to pathological pro-oncogenic signaling, triggering CRC.<br \/>Conclusion: We have found a critical role for CEACAMs in CRC cancer development, through diverting the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway to a pro-oncogenic phenotype.

As survival gains increase, symptom management is also being considered as an endpoint for treatment success yet there is paucity in the literature regarding biological correlates of symptoms. Pain is a major concern for patients undergoing HCT. Underlying inflammation has been suspected in the pathogenesis of symptoms including pain. Emerging evidence supports the gut microbiota (GM) as a potential pathway for the initiation of inflammation. Diet is a potentially modifiable factor demonstrating a significant impact on GM diversity and amenable to intervention. Understanding the interplay among pain, GM, and diet, particularly macronutrients, may inform the development of a targeted, dietary self-management intervention to mitigate pain symptoms in HCT patients. This investigation uses baseline data from a longitudinal descriptive study to explore associations among pain, GM composition (richness and evenness) using Shannon and Chao beta diversity indices, and macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates and fat), in 47 adults (&#62; 18 years of age) receiving HCT for hematologic cancer. Pain was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory, GM was assessed using 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) amplicons using Illumina MiSeq, and dietary information was collected using the Automated Self-Assessment 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24). Data analysis was performed with the R &#8216;correlation&#8217; package using Bayesian estimation of robust correlations and production of 95% Credibility Intervals (CI) and Bayes Factors (BF).The mean age of participants was 56.21 years + 14.67 years. Participants were diagnosed with myeloma (40%), lymphoma (29%) and leukemia (13%). The majority received autologous HCT (n=30). Macronutrient fat {r=-0.25, BF=1.72} had an inverse association with pain interference. Results provided at least anecdotal (BF &#62; 1) support for a positive correlation between Healthy Eating Index (HEI) {r=0.21, BF=1.08}, total fat {r=0.32, BF=4.50}, carbohydrate {r=0.28, BF=2.47} and fat {r=0.32, BF=4.50}, and GM composition. Also, there was a positive association between the amount of protein {r=0.21, BF=1.03}, carbohydrate {r=0.27, BF=2.22}, and Chao Index. There was an inverse association between total HEI {r=-0.27, BF=1.87} and CRP levels. Taxonomic units {r=-0.41, BF=21.44}, Chao Index {r=-0.41, BF=20.28} and Shannon Index {r=-0.25, BF=1.47} had an inverse association with CRP level. This study associate pain, GM, and dietary macronutrients, suggesting potential GM targeted interventions. More research with larger sample size is needed to understand underlying dietary macronutrients' role in pain through GM diversity after HCT, aiming to ease symptoms and enhance survivorship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-08 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Pain,Diet,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

To address this gap, we assessed the dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome in a large-scale study in Korea. We recruited 287 CRC patients from the Center for Colorectal Cancer, National Cancer Center Hospital, Korea to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. A total of 287 age- and sex-matched healthy participants were selected from 890 cohort of healthy Koreans that are publicly available (PRJEB33905). The microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) was calculated based on the differentially abundant species. The association between MDI and CRC risk was observed using conditional logistic regression. Alpha-diversity indices were not significantly different between CRC cases and controls. The first three principal coordinates derived by a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distance explained 41.24% of the overall microbial diversity, with a significant divergence of the microbial composition between CRC patients and controls (PERMANOVA p=0.001). Three enterotypes were found based on CRC patients&#8217; microbial composition. Those who were in the third tertile of the MDI showed a significantly increased risk of CRC in the total population (OR: 6.59, 95% CI: 3.83-11.33, p-trend&#60;0.001) compared to those in the lowest tertile. Similar results were found for men (OR: 6.58, 95% CI: 3.17-13.63, p-trend&#60;0.001) and women (OR: 6.69, 95% CI: 2.91-15.37, p-trend&#60;0.001). Dysbiosis in the fecal microbiota may be associated with an increased risk of CRC.

Dysbiosis occurs when the gut microbiota environment is negatively altered causing detrimental changes to these functions, which may predispose an individual to breast cancer development. To understand the relationship between dysbiosis and breast cancer development, fecal microbiota samples were collected from 27 post-menopausal breast cancer patients of varying hormone receptor statuses (ER+HER2-, ER+Her2+, ER-HER2+, or ER-Her2-) prior to starting chemotherapeutic treatment. Samples were compared to 25 healthy controls, and all samples underwent 16srRNA sequencing. Samples from breast cancer patients and control groups were compared for significant differences (P&#60;.05) in alpha (within sample) and beta (between sample) diversity. Using the Shannon Index and Generalized Least Squares Model, significant differences in alpha diversity were identified between all breast cancer types vs. controls (P=.0104), and between ER+HER2- breast cancer vs. controls (P=.00153). Healthy controls exhibited a higher mean Shannon Index than breast cancer patients, thus higher within sample diversity. Using principal coordinate analyses, significant differences in beta diversity were identified between all breast cancer types vs. controls (P = .01199), and ER+HER2- breast cancer vs. control (P = .008991). Further analyses identified significant taxa of microbiota with functions related to breast cancer development and progression. Of note, <i>Lachnoclostridium<\/i>, a genus of bacteria that can produce &#946;-glucuronidase, which can deconjugate estrogen, was increased in all breast cancer types and ER+HER2- breast cancer when compared to controls. Deconjugation of estrogen can cause elevated blood estrogen levels, potentially increasing Estrogen Receptor binding in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Additionally, <i>Akkermansia<\/i>, a genus implicated in gut barrier dysfunction, was decreased in ER+HER2- patients, while <i>Parvimonas<\/i>, a tumorigenic cell-cycle regulator, was increased. Elucidating if these effects are causative or reactionary may have important implications for understanding breast cancer etiology. Samples are currently undergoing additional metagenomic analyses using long-read sequencing to identify specific bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and phages that may be contributing to dysbiosis. Overall, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to employ short and long-read sequencing to the fecal samples of untreated postmenopausal breast cancer patients. We provide mechanistic insight into the relationship between microbiota and breast cancer development, with the intent of informing future patient screening and prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-08 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Barrett's Esophagus (BE) serves as a well-established precursor to EAC, presenting an opportunity for proactive screening. The salivary microbiome provides a novel opportunity to identify a high-risk population with early-stage esophageal diseases. Here, we assessed whether the oral microbiome, in combination with lifestyle and clinical data, is associated with esophageal disease progression.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> The study included n=23 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients, n=51 with Barrett's Esophagus, and n=32 healthy controls. Saliva samples were collected along with comprehensive lifestyle, dietary intake, and clinical data. Shotgun Metagenomics Sequencing was employed to investigate the microbiome composition of participants. Comprehensive microbiome analyses were performed to evaluate taxonomic profiles, including microbial abundance, microbiome diversity, and functional\/metabolic insights. A multi-modal data integration strategy was used to incorporate data from the Diet Health Questionnaire (DHQ) and lifestyle and health records, aiming to utilize these multimodal features to predict esophageal disease formation and progression.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> A significant difference was observed in the salivary microbiome beta diversity between healthy controls and esophagus disease groups (p= 0.03). Clustering by microbiome taxonomic composition using the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures (DMM) framework indicates that some microbial signatures are associated with esophageal diseases (p=0.03). Healthy Eating Index Scores, total score (p=0.01); vegetables (p=0.003); greens, and beans score (p=0.009) were significantly different between study groups. Microbial pathways associated with diet, microbial taxa linked to lifestyle and medications, and supervised classification results reveal group characteristics and diversity variations based on key covariates such as B12 and sugar uptakes.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> The study presents an innovative analytic approach to identify high-risk populations for esophageal diseases by integrating microbiome analysis and multi-modal data, providing insights into early detection and prevention.

Even though various bacterial species have been studied, the gut microbiome profile as a representative biomarker in CRC patients remains largely unreported. This study presents a comparative analysis of the microbiome profiles of fecal and mucosal samples from CRC patients, followed by metagenomic profiling investigation to validate dominant bacteria in each sample type of CRC patients.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>The study involved 12 patients receiving CRC resection at Myongji Hospital in South Korea, recruited from May 2020 to June 2021. Fecal samples were collected pre-surgery, and mucosal samples during surgery. Paired-end sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA) platform. 16s rRNA gene-based microbiome profiling was analyzed using QIIME2 (V.2020.11), a plugin-based platform for microbiome analysis.

Previously, we reported that obesity increased mammary tumor development using obese Zucker rat model. Several studies have shown the health benefit of soy protein consumption. However, the effects of soy protein diet on liver of mammary tumor for oxidative stress and DNA reaction is less known. We used DMBA induced-mammary tumor model to investigate the effects of soy protein diet on pro-oxidative environment and oxidative DNA modification in liver of obese DMBA mammary tumors rats. Female obese zucker rats (n=45) were either fed casein as control (OC; n=20) or soy protein isolate (OS; n=25), received DMBA (65mg\/kg BW) at the age 50 days and sacrificed 20 weeks later. We used HPLC-ECD, HPLC-UV and LC-MS techniques for liver metabolic analysis. Comparing liver of OS vs. OC, soy protein 1) decreased the level of Methionine (P&#60;0.02), increased 2) free reduced Homocysteine (P&#60;0.02), 3) S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM, P&#60;0.03), 4) S-Adenosyhomocysteine (SAH, P&#60;0.001) and 5) 5methyl-Cytosine (5mC, P&#60;0.03). Also, soy protein decreased (P&#60;0.003) level of free oxidized Glutathione (GSSG), increased (P&#60;0.02) GSH\/GSSG oxidative stress ratio, without any changes a level of free reduced Glutathione (GSH), followed decrease (P&#60;0.04) in liver DNA level of 8-OH-Guanosine (8-OH-G) and level (P&#60;0.02) of 5hmethyl-Cytosine (5hmC). Our results shows soy protein diet capable change liver metabolism: a. Modify a methylation status by increasing levels of SAM (universal methyl group donor) following global liver DNA hypermethylation (5mC), and SAH (methylases inhibitor); b. Alleviate level of oxidative stress in liver by decreasing level of GSSG (not active glutathione), increasing GSH\/GSSG ratio (antioxidative capacities), following lower ROS liver DNA damages by decrease levels of 8-OH-G and 5hmC.

Disruption of the biological clocks, either by genetic or environmental alteration, disturbs circadian rhythms, which may lead to chronic diseases. Childhood obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer in adult women. Lifestyle changes in the modern world (e.g., energy-dense diets) serve as environmental factors that contribute to alterations in biological clocks and obesity. The present study examined transcriptional rhythmic changes in mammary glands from pubertal MMTV-PyMT mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Three-week-old female mice (FVB background) were randomly assigned into three groups - wild-type (WT) mice fed the AIN93G diet and MMTV-PyMT mice fed the AIN93G diet or an HFD for three weeks. At the end of the study, mammary glands were collected every 4 hours over a period of 24 hours (Zeitgeber time 0-24 hours) for RNA-sequencing analysis. The mammary weight was 0.45&#177;0.02, 0.59&#177;0.02, and 0.67&#177;0.02 g for WT mice fed the AIN93G diet and MMTV-PyMT mice fed the AIN93G and HFD, respectively (means &#177; SEM, all <i>p<\/i>&#38;lt;0.05 when three groups were compared each other). The rhythmicity analysis using R showed that greater than 1,000 transcripts were classified as &#8220;loss of rhythm&#8221; when MMTV-PyMT mice (both AIN93G-fed and HFD-fed groups) were compared to WT mice fed the AIN93G diet. Eighteen transcripts were classified as &#8220;loss of rhythm&#8221; in MMTV-PyMT mice when the HFD was compared to AIN93G diet. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed differentially expressed genes that were significantly altered and KEGG enrichment analysis showed the most upregulated and downregulated metabolic pathways in treatment groups than in the control group at each time point over the 24-hour period. These findings indicates that genetic alterations may have a greater effect than dietary effects on transcriptional rhythmicity in mammary glands from pubertal mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circadian genes,Mammary gland,Diet,Mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Although epidemiology suggests obesity is negatively associated with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the risk, suggesting a possible role of adipose tissue in the initiation and promotion of skin cancer. To gain mechanistic insight into how adipose tissue drives cutaneous carcinogenesis, we cultured non-tumorigenic mouse keratinocytes (JB6 P<sup>+<\/sup> cells) with or without factors released from murine visceral adipose tissue (mFTF) and performed RNA-Sequencing. Published work demonstrated mFTF induces anchorage-independent cell growth, a surrogate marker for malignant transformation. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated a significant induction of <i>Angptl4<\/i> mRNA in JB6 P<sup>+<\/sup> cells cultured with mFTF for 3 and 8 hours compared to the vehicle-treated cells. ANGPTL4 is an endogenous inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase that modulates free fatty acid delivery to adipose tissue and oxidative tissues such as muscle and liver. The C-terminal protein demonstrates tumor-associated activities such as angiogenesis, metastasis, protection against anoikis, and enhancement of cell survival. Therefore, we hypothesized that the induction of this gene promotes malignant transformation. RNA-seq data was validated in multiple cell models, including primary keratinocytes with human adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess ANGPTL4 expression in 37 actinic keratosis (pre-malignant) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) from patients with different BMIs (18.6 - 49.5). Notably, ANGPTL4 was only observed in the suprabasal epidermal layers in normal skin. For samples containing both lesional and perilesional skin, there was an increase in ANGPTL4 expression in the lesional epidermis relative to the normal perilesional skin. Furthermore, ANGPTL4 expression increased from transition to actinic keratosis to cSCC <i>in situ<\/i>, suggesting that ANGTL4 is induced during malignant transformation as observed in our pre-clinical models. Interestingly, once cSCC developed an invasive component, ANGTPL4 expression was lost in the invasive keratinocytes but persisted in the <i>in situ<\/i> component. There was no association between ANGPTL4 expression and BMI in lesional tissue. These data suggest that targeting ANTPLT4 may be a novel therapy for the prevention of skin cancer and that ANGPTL4-high patients or cancer patients with obesity may be a critical demographic for potential risk assessment or therapeutic intervention. Future studies will determine the impact of knocking out ANGTPL4 in our models of malignant transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,Obesity,Body mass index,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Our recent study in Pirc rats revealed that the combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and sodium naproxen exhibited additive tumor protection. While the results from this preclinical study were impressive, showing tumor suppression in excess of 95%, potential mechanisms underlying this tumor protection remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the transcriptomic changes resulting in the tumor suppression afforded by the combination of EPA and naproxen supplementation in the diet.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> Six week-old Pirc rats were fed either a control AIN-93G diet, or AIN-93G diet supplemented with 2% EPA combined with 200 ppm naproxen, for a total of 20 weeks. Global transcriptomic analysis was performed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of colon tumors and tumor-adjacent normal tissue from 26-week-old Pirc rats. 100-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq to a depth of 25 million reads per sample. Reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic-v0.39, and reads were mapped to the mRatBN7.2.105 rat reference genome using HISAT2. Differentially expressed genes were calculated using DESeq2, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using Rstudio.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> DESeq2 identified 809 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 2-fold change &#62; 1, FDR &#60; 0.05) between large tumors from AIN-93G fed rats versus suppressed tumors from rats fed the combination of EPA and naproxen (490 up-regulated, 319 down-regulated). GSEA analysis revealed activation of inflammatory pathways including IL-17 signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, complement activation, cytokine signaling, ribosome biogenesis, and cell cycle were enriched in untreated control. In contrast, suppressed tumors from animals supplemented with EPA and naproxen were enriched in pathways including negative regulation of <i>Wnt<\/i> signaling, cell fate specification, ion channel complexes, and nutrient absorption. Furthermore, suppressed tumors shared significant GSEA pathway overlap with normal tissue, leading us to believe the combination of EPA and naproxen may be preventing tumorigenesis in part by maintaining cells in a differentiated state.<br \/><u>Conclusion and Future directions:<\/u> Inflammation plays a key role in tumorigenesis and promoting cancer stem cell niches in tumors. According to our analysis, the combination of EPA and naproxen attenuated cancer-associated inflammation and reduced proliferation in part by augmenting tumor differentiation. Future studies will utilize single-nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) to determine at a single cell resolution the transcriptomic changes of epithelial and stromal populations within the TME.
