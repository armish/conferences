We previously identified bulk-level molecular and immunological changes that are enriched in normal-appearing tissue (NAT) in the local niche of human LUAD, as well as those that commence in adenomatous premalignant lesions (aPMLs, LUAD precursors) and that are further enriched in LUADs. Yet, in-depth understanding of the identities, states, and properties of specific cell subsets in NAT and precancer that trigger LUAD remain largely elusive due to inherent roadblocks to sampling and characterizing aPMLs that are at the center of this trajectory. Here, we aimed to map molecular profiles, states, and interactions of cell subsets that underlie initiation in lesion-adjacent NAT, and to determine how features of these cells evolve along the aPML-LUAD spectrum. We analyzed an expanding cohort of archived matching NATs, aPMLs and LUADs, including challenging small samples, from up to 17 patients. Samples were analyzed using combined high-resolution, multi-modal Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST, n=17) and proteomics (n=12), as well as single-cell RNA-sequencing of fixed cells (scFFPE-seq) from consecutive sections of the same tissues from 15 patients. We also studied a subset of samples by high-plex spatial proteomics (COMET) or subcellular spatial gene expression analysis (Xenium). In total, we sequenced more than half a million single cells comprising diverse epithelial, immune, and stromal subsets, which were concordant with lineage clusters identified by ST analysis of the same samples. Loss of alveolar differentiation was a hallmark of tumor cell-enriched areas in aPMLs and LUADs, with a more pronounced effect in the LUADs. Alveolar intermediate cells (AICs), which we have previously shown to be involved in LUAD initiation, were found in lesion-adjacent NAT, and their signature was enriched in matching aPMLs and further in LUADs. In line with these findings, trajectory analysis showed that AICs are derived from normal alveolar type 2 cells and likely progress towards tumor cells. Spatial neighborhood analysis pointed towards strong crosstalk between AICs and macrophages. We also noted heterogeneity in immune infiltration including patterns indicative of progressive features along the NAT-aPML-LUAD continuum. For example, B cell lineages were not only increased in abundance in LUADs relative to aPMLs, but they also mobilized into relatively more mature tertiary lymphoid aggregates\/structures. While T regulatory cells aggregated close to LUADs, they were rather scattered in matching aPMLs. Our multimodal and spatial atlas of NAT, nearby aPML and LUAD elucidates the earliest cellular events underlying transition of NAT to LUAD and that could inform of targets for interception of this trajectory.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Premalignancy,Single cell transcriptomics,spatial proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, our understanding of why only certain patients respond, as well as our ability to predict this response, is still quite limited. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which contains cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells. These differing cell types can have context-dependent roles in either promoting or inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses, making it challenging to identify features which reliably correlate with patient outcome. In addition, the roles of these diverse cell types are often influenced by their location within the TME, meaning that assays without spatial information cannot fully resolve this complexity. To address these gaps, we mapped the spatial distribution and phenotype of 21 cell populations across 117 patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer that received nivolumab (anti-PD1) through the TONIC clinical trial (NCT02499367). We collected metastatic samples prior to and during treatment to understand how anti-PD1 reshaped the TME. We also collected archival material from the original primary tumor for each patient. We generated multiplexed imaging data from these samples, identified the location and phenotype of each cell, and then quantified the spatial distribution, diversity, and functional marker status of all cell populations in the TME. We detected numerous features indicative of a productive immune response that correlated positively with clinical benefit, whereas features indicative of a suppressive microenvironment correlated negatively with clinical benefit. We observed significant temporal effects, where many pre-treatment predictive features were not predictive on-treatment; similarly, many on-treatment predictive features had no predictive power prior to treatment. Intriguingly, we found features in the original primary tumors which predicted subsequent (metastatic) response to immunotherapy. We observed substantial differences in predictive accuracy of multivariate models based on timepoint, with on-treatment samples exhibiting the best performance and primary tumor samples exhibiting the worst. Of note, we observed substantially worse predictive performance when using bulk DNA sequencing data to predict outcome from the same patients, highlighting the importance of spatial information. Taken together, we show that the features associated with a productive anti-tumor immune response are temporally structured, and differ based on what phase of response is profiled. Furthermore, using the primary tumor to assess whether metastatic TNBC patients are good candidates for ICI may miss important predictive signals. These findings shed new light on the determinants of ICI outcome, and may shape the design of subsequent trials to better understand the temporal aspects of ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Multiplexed Imaging,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

A shared cancer signal has been detected across &#62;50 cancer types. Most cancer types do not have recommended screening and are diagnosed once symptoms present. Previous analysis of participant outcomes evaluated the prognostic significance of cancer signal detection by an earlier version of the MCED test with 3-year longitudinal follow-up data.

These ML models are trained and validated on subjects whose miRNA sample was drawn proximate to cancer diagnosis (e.g., within one month). Whether these models remain useful remote from the time of diagnosis, when early detection or prevention would be most relevant, is unclear. Therefore, we examine the effect of time between blood draw and cancer diagnosis on miRNA-based ML model accuracy and the relevance of a cancer probability score,<i> P<sub>c<\/sub><\/i>, for estimating long-term cancer risk.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The study is based on the miRNA expression profiles of 2983 total subjects, which is comprised of 1829 subjects collected as part of the Biobank at Mass General Brigham (MGB), 110 samples from the Pelvic Mass Protocol at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Cramer), and 1044 samples which were obtained from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. miRNA expression was measured using a pre-specified panel of 179 miRNAs optimized for serum detection using the Fireplex&#174; circulating miRNA assay. We trained ML models using 1865 controls and 74 ovarian cancer subjects (1829 Biobank + 55 Cramer + 55 PLCO). The training cancer samples were drawn between 1 day and 14 years from diagnosis, most within 30 days. The models were then validated on 769 control and 275 ovarian cancer subjects (989 PLCO + 55 Cramer) whose time to cancer diagnosis ranges between 1 and 1814 days (up to 5 years) after blood draw. Performance was reported as Area Under the receiver operator characteristic Curve (AUC).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Among the validation set cases, we observe a decreasing trend in predicted cancer probability (<i>P<sub>c<\/sub><\/i>) with increasing log time (R = -0.34, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.0001), and we see a similar trend in AUC score with time. On samples drawn within 21 days of cancer diagnosis, the ML model offers an AUC = 0.88, which decreases to AUC = 0.72 on samples drawn between 21 days and one year from diagnosis, and later plateaus at AUC ~ 0.72 up to five years from diagnosis.<br \/>Out of 2928 total subjects considered in the study, 286 had multiple blood draws taken over a 5-year time period. Using this data, we analyze the change in <i>P<sub>c<\/sub><\/i> over time per subject. The results show that <i>P<sub>c<\/sub><\/i>, for the average case subject, increased by 7% per year (<i>p = <\/i>0.02).

Current techniques of detection like magnetic resonance imaging and tissue biopsy are inaccurate or highly invasive, requiring alternatives like liquid biopsy. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles that contain cargo, reflective of their cellular origin and have been used for early diagnosis of cancer. However, in GBM, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leads to a paucity of pathological information in blood. This study investigates the effect of opening the BBB on circulating exosomes and their potential for early detection of GBM using a microfluidic platform (<sup>Glio<\/sup>ExoChip). In 20 patients enrolled in a clinical trial NCT03744026, a pulsed ultrasound emitter- Sonocloud-9 was implanted into their brains to open the BBB. We show that <sup>Glio<\/sup>ExoChip isolates GBM-specific exosomes with a high capture efficiency using phosphatidylserine and Annexin-V chemistry. Further, the amount of circulating EVs increases twofold after opening the BBB. Finally, the correlation between tumor growth rate and the exosome concentrations is evaluated longitudinally.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> <sup>Glio<\/sup>ExoChip is a microfluidic platform with a polydimethylsiloxane top and a glass bottom, functionalized with neutravidin-biotinylated annexin-V. Experiments are performed with GBM cell-line derived exosomes, followed by patient plasma. Isolated exosomes are characterized using Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), scanning electron microscopy, Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay and western blot. Statistical analyses are performed using Student&#8217;s t-test and Pearson correlation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The microfluidic device <sup>Glio<\/sup>ExoChip has a high capture efficiency of exosomes derived from GBM cell lines, <i>i.e., <\/i>93.03&#177;3.31% and 96.77&#177;0.72% for GBM6 and U87, respectively. NTA and BCA showed that 15 times more exosomes were captured from patient plasma when compared with healthy. Further, western blot proved the presence of a glial protein and Flotillin-1 in exosomes isolated from patients. Exosome concentrations varied with different time points after sonication and had an average twofold increase from the BBB opening. In our longitudinal study with 8 patients, an association between the volumetric enhancement of the tumor and exosome concentrations after sonication shows that the average Pearson correlation among short progression-free survival (PFS) patients was 0.73 (avg. p=0.39), while no correlation was seen among long PFS patients (avg. r value=0.10; avg. p-value=0.54).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> A microfluidic approach was used to investigate the role of circulating exosomes using phosphatidylserine-annexin V chemistry in GBM. BBB opening via sonication leads to an increase in the average GBM-specific exosome concentrations in plasma. Thus, exosomes are promising biomarkers for early detection in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Glioblastoma,Microfluidics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Abha Kumari<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Youngblood<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Gould<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoon-Tae Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Karl Habashy<sup>2<\/sup>, Chris Amidei<sup>2<\/sup>, Rachel Ward<sup>2<\/sup>, Cristal Gomez<sup>2<\/sup>, Guillaume Bouchoux<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Canney<sup>2<\/sup>, Roger Stupp<sup>2<\/sup>, Adam M.

For these purposes, a whole genome or exome sequencing approach can be resource prohibitive. Numerous gene panels are developed for adult cancers to address these challenges. Due to the dramatic differences in driver gene landscapes between pediatric and adult cancers, a gene panel for childhood cancers is needed.<br \/>Results: Here, we have developed a gene panel dedicated to childhood cancers. This panel (2.8 Mbp) covers 5275 coding exons of 357 driver genes, 297 introns frequently involved in rearrangements that generate fusion oncoproteins, commonly deleted regions, such as CDKN2A and PAX5 (for B-\/T-ALL) and SMARCB1 (for ATRT), and 7,590 polymorphism sites to detect copy number alterations for interrogating tumors with aneuploidy, such as hyperdiploid and hypodiploid B-ALL or 17q gain neuroblastoma. We used driver alterations reported from an established real-time clinical genomics cohort (n=253) to investigate the effectiveness of this gene panel. Among the 485 pathogenic variants reported, our panel covered 417 variants (86%). For 90 rearrangements responsible for oncogenic fusions, our panel covered 74 events (82%). We re-sequenced 113 previously characterized clinical specimens at an average depth of 2,500X using SJPedPanel and recovered 355 (90%) of the 396 reported pathogenic variants. Among the 30 unique genes of the 41 missed alterations, 29 genes are mutated in pediatric cancers with a low frequency (&#60;0.21%) and hence not covered in the panel. We then investigated the power of this panel in detecting mutations from specimens with low tumor content (as low as 0.1%) using cell line-based dilution experiments and discovered that this gene panel enabled us to detect ~80% variants with allele fraction of 0.2%, while the detection rate decreases to ~50% when the allele fraction is 0.1%. We finally demonstrate its utility in disease monitoring on clinical specimens collected from AML patients in morphologic remission.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, our gene panel enables the detection of clinically relevant genetic alterations including rearrangements responsible for subtype-defining fusions for childhood cancers by targeted sequencing of ~0.15% of human genome. Our panel will significantly enhance the analysis of specimens with low tumor burdens for cancer monitoring and early detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Molecular diagnosis,Early detection,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.
