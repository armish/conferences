Our research, which combines chromatin-focused and genome-wide CRISPR screenings with a range of genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical strategies in both mouse and human models, has led to the discovery of a molecular mechanism that acts as a switch between the MLL1-Menin and MLL3\/4-UTX chromatin modifying complexes, influencing the efficacy of Menin-MLL inhibitors. We demonstrate that the MLL1-Menin complex plays a critical role in maintaining leukemia cell survival by preventing the MLL3\/4-UTX complex from binding to certain gene promoters. Interruption of the Menin-MLL1 interaction results in the UTX-dependent transcriptional activation of a tumor suppressor gene program, which significantly influences therapeutic outcomes in both murine and human leukemia models. Notably, the therapeutic activation of this gene program through CDK4\/6 inhibitors can overcome resistance in leukemia cells that do not respond to Menin inhibitors. The identification of this molecular switch between MLL1-Menin and MLL3\/4-UTX complexes on chromatin highlights the complex roles of these evolutionarily conserved epigenetic regulators and underscores their importance in understanding and addressing the molecular mechanisms underlying response and resistance in leukemia treatment trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Menin inhibitors,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yadira Soto-Feliciano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Applying computational methods for the detection and reconstruction of ecDNA across a retrospective cohort of 481 medulloblastoma tumors from 465 patients, we identify circular ecDNA in 82 patients (18%). Patients with ecDNA-positive medulloblastoma were more than twice as likely to relapse and three times as likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis. Multimodal sequencing, imaging and CRISPR inhibition experiments in medulloblastoma models reveal intratumoral heterogeneity of ecDNA copy number per cell and frequent &#8216;enhancer rewiring&#8217; events on ecDNA. This study reveals the frequency and diversity of ecDNA in medulloblastoma, stratified into molecular subgroups, and suggests copy number heterogeneity and enhancer rewiring as oncogenic features of ecDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Chromosomal instability,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lukas Chavez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
