[{"Abstract":"Background: Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment in the last decade. However, most patients either do not respond to immunotherapy or eventually relapse so there is a need to identify biomarkers of response and understand mechanisms of resistance. Most biomarker studies have analyzed patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) therapy while the few studies of adoptive cell transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL-ACT) have analyzed relatively small patient cohorts.<br \/>Methods: To systematically identify biomarkers of response and resistance to TIL-ACT, we collected published and unpublished whole-exome and transcriptomic data for tumors from 400 patients treated with TIL-ACT from five tumor types across four institutions and processed these datasets using a standardized bioinformatic pipeline.<br \/>Results: To identify biomarkers of response in pre-treatment tumors, we analyzed previously reported biomarkers and performed biomarker discovery in our cohorts. For the subset of 200 patients with T cell reactivities identified from the infusion products and fresh tumor, we refined our biomarkers to include neo-antigen reactivities in addition to identifying both mutational processes and transcriptional signatures associated with neo-antigens reactivity. To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to TIL-ACT, we analyzed 15 patients with paired pre- and post-treatment tumors and found multiple mechanisms of immune evasion specific to infused reactive T cells including loss of heterozygosity of the HLA allele presenting the neo-antigen, genomic loss of the neo-antigen and inactivation of interferon-gamma signaling pathway.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, we will present the biomarkers landscape of TIL-ACT therapy including differences between histology and across treatment modalities to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using (CAR)-engineered cells, strives to enhance antitumor immunity but faces several challenges such as identifying safe antigens, tumor heterogeneity, antigen escape, cell trafficking, and T cell persistence. To address these issues, we explored a new source of T cells from the benign tumor draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) of NSCLC patients. Our initial results have shown that tdLNs is a reservoir for of tumor-relevant 'stem-like' T cells. We posit that employing these pluripotent T cells for ACT could achieve significant tumor rejection in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: Resected tumors, tdLN, non-draining (ndLN), and blood from NSCLC patients, as well as a syngeneic murine lung cancer model (344SQ), underwent analysis. T cells were profiled using flow cytometry, cytotoxicity and proliferation assays. TCR and single cell (sc)RNA sequencing assessed clonal expansion, diversity, and transcriptional profiles of tumor-relevant T cells. T cells were then transduced with an ICAM-1 targeting CAR, in vivo efficacy was evaluated in an A549 murine lung cancer model.<br \/>Results: T cell subsets with stem-cell memory characteristics, as indicated by PD-1+, TCF1hi, CXCR5+, and CD8+ expression, which were not significantly found in the tumor or PB. These T cells exhibited progenitor-like transcriptional signatures, enhanced SELL and TCF-1 expression, fewer exhaustion markers, and superior in vitro proliferation compared to TILs from both a murine lung cancer model and patient-derived tissues. scRNA sequencing, coupled with TCR \"tumor matching\" (TM) techniques, exposed a rich clonal diversity of tumor-relevant clones within tdLNs, which showcased a broader transcriptional memory profile and distinct CD4+ and CD8+ phenotypes. Upon analyzing the top 100 expanded (n&#62;3) TM clones, 47 featured the presence of tdLN-derived T cells, covering progenitor, stem cell-like, and central memory clusters. T cell subsets were then transduced with a CAR targeting ICAM-1&#8212;a cell surface protein frequently overexpressed in NSCLC tumors. Manufacturing protocol yielded high transduction efficiency and T cell expansion within two weeks in 6\/6 patients, consistent with PB-derived CAR T cells and on par with the optimal dosing requirements of an ICAM-1 CAR Phase I trial (NCT04420754). tdLN-CAR T cells showed potent antitumor efficacy compared to the control in an aggressive NSCLC murine model (Median survival 103d vs 66d; respectively; p=0.006).<br \/>Conclusions: This represents the first reported use of T cells from tdLN for genetically engineered ACT. The data indicate that modifying antigen-experienced, stem-like T cells from tdLN with CAR is a promising and efficient method in a NSCLC murine model, warranting further research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Adoptive cell therapy,Lymph nodes,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Therefore, there is a significant need to understand how these cells change at the epigenomic level over time following infusion into the patient.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We analyzed MART-1 TCR-T products from 8 patients treated under a clinical trial at UCLA (NCT00910650). Samples from the baseline infusion product and samples from day +30 recovered from peripheral circulation were sorted for TCR+ cells via flow cytometry, and were then subjected to whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), ATACseq, and RNAseq in parallel. Differential chromatin accessibility and gene expression by the ATACseq and RNAseq datasets, respectively, were analyzed via DESeq2, with P adjusted less than 0.1. WGBS datasets were analyzed via Metilene, and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined as those regions with CpG loci containing a methylation difference &#62;= 10% and a P adjusted &#60; 0.05. Functional DMRs were defined as those repressed over time (increased DNA methylation with decreased chromatin accessibility\/gene expression relative to infusion product), or activated over time (decreased DNA methylation with increased chromatin accessibility\/gene expression relative to infusion product). Functional DMRs were then analyzed via EnrichR to evaluate gene ontology and pathways significantly enriched in gene lists.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We collectively identified three genes with repressed DMR activity and 49 genes with activated DMR activity compared to baseline infusion products. Our findings revealed that genes associated with repressed DMRs included IL2RA, FBLN7, and ZNRF1. These genes were collectively associated with a decrease in T-cell activation, cytokine signaling, and migration activity, potentially impacting the functional capabilities of T-cells in the post-infusion environment. Conversely, genes associated with activated DMRs included PDCD1 (PD1), FGR, KIR3DL1, KIR2DL4, and KLF3, with pathway enrichment analysis indicating a significant shift in the T-cell landscape towards reduced anti-tumor activity, decreased T-cell proliferation, T-cell aging, and the promotion of immune escape tumor phenotypes.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This comprehensive multi-omics approach showcases an atlas of genes in clinical TCR-T cell therapeutics which are subject to functional changes in DNA methylation over time <i>in vivo.<\/i> These findings shed light on the complex interplay between DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression in the context of TCR-T cell therapy, with implications for the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Epigenomics,DNA methylation,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

T cell receptors (TCRs) that confer recognition of public NeoAgs--an elite subset of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted epitopes arising from recurrent hotspot mutations in driver genes that enhance cancer cell fitness and are clonally conserved--are highly desirable and would be effective against many tumors sharing the common hotspot mutation. Tumor suppressor <i>TP53<\/i> is a supreme target for this approach: it is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer yet remains untargetable with FDA-approved therapies. The most common <i>TP53<\/i> alteration (R175H) generates a public NeoAg in the context of <i>HLA-A*02<\/i>, an allele expressed by ~40% of the North American and Western European populations. Earlier work established the immunogenicity of this public NeoAg by isolating a <i>TP53<\/i>(R175H)-specific clone from a colorectal cancer patient. ACT of this TCR in a single patient produced an objective anti-tumor response, but also resulted in multisystem organ failure indicating this receptor might possess off-target reactivity to unrelated proteins in healthy tissue. To discover safe and effective <i>TP53<\/i>(R175H)-specific TCRs, we assembled a unique biorepository of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from <i>n=26<\/i> cancer patients with diverse tumors that co-express <i>HLA-A*02<\/i>\/<i>TP53<\/i>(R175H) and applied a novel high-throughput screening technique to retrieve candidate TCRs. These efforts resulted in a panel of <i>n=9<\/i> genetically distinct and functionally validated receptors, each with NeoAg-specific anti-tumor activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. To define the cross-reactivity profile of these novel TCRs and the benchmark TCR that caused toxicity, we performed amino acid scanning mutagenesis (X-Scan) to identify potential off-targets. Importantly, we identified significant off-target reactivity to normal human proteins for the benchmark TCR, which may explain the lung and kidney toxicities observed in the trial patient. By contrast, a subset of the novel TCRs exhibited exquisite specificity for the <i>TP53<\/i> public NeoAg with no predicted off-targets. Finally, we performed ACT of all TCRs in a mouse xenograft model and identified several novel TCRs that potently eliminated <i>TP53<\/i>(R175H)<sup>+<\/sup>\/<i>HLA*A02<\/i><sup>+<\/sup> tumors in vivo. Based on these data, we are now proceeding with the clinical development of a best-in-class TCR. This work is poised to bring an important new class of precision immunotherapeutics to patients with <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant tumors that presently lack effective molecularly targeted agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Adoptive cell therapy,Neoantigens,TP53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) with TCR-edited T cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with late-stage tumors, but its applicability is limited by the paucity of TCRs targeting relevant tumor antigens and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the safety of the therapeutic cellular products, generated by genome editing tools, is fundamental for an effective and rapid clinical translation. With the aim of improving the safety profile of T-cell based therapeutic products manufactured by genome editing, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of cytosine base editor (CBE). We disrupted the endogenous TCR to redirect T cells specificity toward tumor cells, and TIGIT, a major inhibitory molecule in gastrointestinal tumors to enhancing T cell ability to counteract immunosuppression. Beyond the high efficiency of CBE in simultaneously disrupting the target genes, we observed only marginal sgRNA-dependent and -independent off-target events as measured by targeted sequencing of the top predicted off-target loci and by ultra-deep whole exome sequencing, respectively. In addition, unlike CRISPR\/Cas9-treated cells, we could not detect translocations in CBE edited T cells. To select the antigens to target by engineered T cells, we investigated published datasets and identified 19 relevant tumor-associated antigens. By clonal tracking of the TCR repertoire of T cells stimulated with autologous APCs loaded with the selected antigens, we isolated 5 different TCRs specificities, including mesothelin. Importantly, these antigens are expressed in our cohort of primary and metastatic PDAC and CRC patients. TCR-edited T cells displayed anti-tumor activity against PDAC cell lines, CRC and PDAC patient-derived organoids while sparing HLA-unrelated and antigen-negative controls. To boost the efficacy of anti-tumor T cells, we coupled TIGIT disruption with TCR editing. By challenging TCR-edited TIGIT<sub>KO<\/sub> T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and in an orthotopic model of CRC liver metastases, we observed that TIGIT disruption can ameliorate the ability of tumor-specific T cells to control tumor growth. Our findings suggest that base editors can generate cellular products with a better safety profile and a promising therapeutic efficacy in gastrointestinal tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Engineered T cells ,Base editor,gastrointestinal tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Approximately 30% of sarcomas are associated with oncogenic driver fusion proteins. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a prototypical fusion-driven sarcoma defined by a pathognomonic <i>EWSR1<\/i>-<i>WT1<\/i> fusion event. The resultant EWSR1-WT1 fusion protein contains a shared junctional amino acid sequence that is clonally conserved and significantly divergent from normal human proteins. Consequently, the EWSR1-WT1 fusion might yield a highly immunogenic shared, or public, neoantigen (NeoAg) that may serve as a target for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.Using a functional HLA-immunoprecipitation\/mass spectrometry (HLA-IP\/MS) screen, we identified a 9-amino acid peptide sequence derived from the junction of the most common EWSR1-WT1 fusion protein that is presented in the context of the prevalent HLA-A*03 and -A*11 alleles. We confirmed that HLA-A*03<sup>+<\/sup> DSRCT cells physiologically present the same peptide sequence. Using fluorophore-conjugated HLA-multimers loaded with the HLA-IP\/MS-derived fusion NeoAg, we identified a rare population of circulating NeoAg-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in HLA<sup>+<\/sup> DSRCT patients. Through antigen-directed clonal expansion, we discovered n=3 HLA-A*03-restricted and n=1 HLA-A*11-restricted fusion NeoAg-specific T cell clones and retrieved the paired TCR&#945;&#946; gene sequences of their T cell receptors (TCRs) using 10x single-cell sequencing. Polyclonal CD8+ T cells transduced with candidate TCR&#945;&#946; gene sequences robustly upregulated TNF&#945; after coculture with HLA<sup>+<\/sup>\/Fusion<sup>+<\/sup> target cells but not HLA<sup>-<\/sup>\/Fusion<sup>+<\/sup> or HLA<sup>+<\/sup>\/Fusion<sup>-<\/sup> control cells. Further, T cells expressing candidate TCRs, but not viral-protein-specific TCRs, lysed HLA<sup>+<\/sup> DSRCT cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and controlled established DSRCT tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. Finally, we discovered that one TCR was capable of cross HLA allele fusion NeoAg recognition and could lyse both HLA-A*03<sup>+<\/sup> and -A*11<sup>+<\/sup> DSRCT cells. These findings imply that a single TCR therapeutic could cover &#62;36% of North American DSRCT patients.Collectively, our data establish for the first time that DSRCT cells present a junction-spanning fusion-derived neoantigen in the context of two prevalent HLA alleles that may be therapeutically targeted using TCR gene therapy. These data lay the foundation for first-in-human clinical translation of a T-cell based therapy targeting EWSR1-WT1. More broadly, these findings establish proof-of-principle that recurrent fusion proteins are an actionable source of immunogenic public NeoAgs, providing a framework for developing targeted immunotherapies for other fusion-driven malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Adoptive cell therapy,Neoantigens,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Senescent cell removal by senolytic agents or therapies that inhibit the SASP have demonstrated benefit in both preclinical and clinical models of geriatric decline and chronic diseases. Here, we aimed to screen anti-aging compounds to delay T-cell senescence in TME, and explore novel strategies of reversing tumor induced T-cell senescence to restore antitumor immunity.<br \/>Methods and Results: Using in vitro senescence inducing system, we screened ginsenoside Rb1 from 22 anti-aging compounds as the compound that had the most effective activity to reduce CD8+ T cell senescence, displayed as decreased &#946;-gal, p16, and p21. Further analysis showed that ginsenoside Rb1 promoted anti-CD3\/CD28-induced TCR signaling and the secretion of effector cytokines IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and IL -2 in OTI T cells. Intriguingly, ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly increased TCF-1 in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and ginsenoside Rb1 treated OT-I T cells significantly inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, ginsenoside Rb1 greatly enhanced the efficiency of CD19-CART cells to kill Namalwa tumor cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Ginsenoside Rb1 delays T cell senescence and enhances T cell antitumor activity.

Beyond cell-surface tumor antigens, TCR-Ts can recognize HLA-presented intracellular epitopes which allows them to address a wide range of cancer-specific targets. Existing TCR-T therapies focus on a limited number of epitopes, many of which are restricted to HLA allele HLA-A*02:01. Identification of novel anti-tumor TCRs covering a broad range of HLA alleles is necessary to address unmet clinical needs. Natural T cells undergo thymic selection and present a favorable safety profile for mining such anti-tumor TCRs for therapeutic development. However, discovery of natural anti-tumor TCRs has been challenging due to i) the absence of high-throughput methods for identifying tumor-reactive TCRs in limited quantity human samples and ii) lack of sensitivity in detecting low frequency, naturally occurring tumor-reactive T cells.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> We developed TargetScape&#174; as a part of our Deep Immunomics platform for efficient discovery of natural tumor-specific TCRs in healthy donors and cancer patients. Cells from blood and tissue samples were stained with metal-barcoded peptide-MHC tetramers, containing 500+ tumor-specific antigens, alongside metal-conjugated antibodies, allowing rapid identification and high dimensional phenotypic analysis of CD8+ T cells at the millions of cells scale. Single-cell sequencing revealed paired TCR sequences. Selected TCRs were introduced into luminescent Jurkat reporter cells for validation screening with peptide-pulsed targets and the relevant HLA restriction. TCRs of interest were further integrated into primary T cells and evaluated for their effector function.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> We utilize our sensitive, high-throughput TargetScape&#174; platform to detect and characterize putative cancer-specific TCRs from blood and tissue samples in frequencies as low as ~0.003% of total CD8+ cells. We have functionally validated over 100 TargetScape&#174; derived TCRs with luminescent Jurkat reporters. Validated TCRs cover high prevalence HLA alleles and target a broad range of cancer antigen classes, including tumor associated antigens (TAA), Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), shared splice variants, and frameshift mutations. Several natural TCRs demonstrate recognition of low concentrations of peptide, indicating high functional avidity. Further evaluations of specificity and activity of TCRs of interest transduced into primary T cells are currently in progress.<br \/><b><u>Conclusions:<\/u><\/b> Our Deep Immunomics platform allows us to identify and confirm activity of novel, naturally-derived TCR candidates against therapeutically relevant cancer antigens presented on six common HLA alleles. These findings validate our discovery workflow leading to a portfolio of potential clinically relevant candidates that are currently under preclinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor targeting,Receptors,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells recognize peptides derived from intracellular and surface proteins presented in the context of MHC class I. Targeting mutated oncogenic drivers addresses many of the major obstacles of this modality, in that the antigenic epitope is: 1) tumor-specific, 2) essential for tumor survival, and 3) derived from a stably expressed protein. However, the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment makes further optimization of engineered T cells necessary to bring long-term clinical benefit to patients. For an optimal anti-tumor response, T cells require three signals: TCR, co-stimulation, and cytokine signaling. The tumor suppressor <i>TP53<\/i> is the most frequently mutated gene across human cancers, with a highly recurrent arginine to histidine hotspot alteration in codon 175 leading to novel tumor-dependent functions. Here we report the use of a novel CRISPR-Cas nuclease system to knock-in a six-parameter multi-cistronic cassette into the <i>TRAC<\/i> locus with high efficiency. We employed several strategies to maximize the potency and durability of a TCR-T cell product targeting the p53 R175H oncogenic driver, including: 1) A high-affinity TCR (&#945; and &#946; chains) specific for the p53 R175H mutation presented by HLA-A*02:01 permits the recognition of tumor cells expressing even low levels of the epitope (Signal 1), 2) Inclusion of the CD8&#945;&#946; co-receptor drives stimulation of CD4+ T cells with the MHC class I restricted TCR, allowing for a physiologic coordinated immune response required for maximal efficacy, 3) A FAS-41BB switch receptor acts as a dominant negative to the FASL-inducing apoptotic signal in the tumor microenvironment and drives stimulation and persistence of the T cell product via 41BB co-stimulatory signaling (Signal 2), 4) A chimeric cytokine receptor (constitutive Interleukin Receptor) promotes expansion and survival while avoiding immunologic exhaustion (Signal 3). Together, these strategies deliver the three signals required for maximal T cell function: antigen-driven activation, co-stimulation, and growth\/survival-promoting cytokine signaling. The non-viral <i>TRAC<\/i>-knocked-in T cells demonstrate robust and specific cytotoxicity against endogenously expressing HLA-A*02:01 and p53 R175H cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and effective anti-tumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i> while maintaining a favorable preclinical safety profile. These data support the planned clinical development of a novel non-viral <i>TRAC<\/i>-knocked-in T cell therapy for the treatment of p53 R175H<i>-<\/i>mutant solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

To generate CAR-T-cell products, autologous patient-derived &#945;&#946;T-cells are engineered with a CAR for tumor cell targeting. However, generating autologous T-cell products fails in a significant number of cases due to the poor quality and quantity of blood-derived T-cells and is associated with manufacturing and logistical complexity as well as high product costs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies for off-the-shelf T-cell products as otherwise many patients are left without this treatment option. Manufacturing allogeneic T-cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has a great potential to generate cell products with consistently high quality and scalable quantities. In addition, high fidelity gene-editing can be performed in iPSCs to address tumor resistance mechanisms and to prevent exhaustion of the T-cells. We have established a feeder-free differentiation protocol that enables robust production of iPSC-derived &#945;&#946;T-cells (i&#945;&#946;T). Flow cytometry and single cell transcriptome analysis ensure stringent monitoring of all process stages. To demonstrate functional activity of i&#945;&#946;T, cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays were performed. We compared the differentiation potential of iPSC lines derived from T-cells (t-iPSCs) to a hematopoietic stem cell-derived iPSC line with an &#945;&#946;TCR knock-in. Hematopoietic progenitor cells were induced from the different iPSC lines and differentiated into i&#945;&#946;T. During the differentiation process, surface markers CD45, CD5 and CD7 were displayed, and cells started to express &#945;&#946;TCRs. Importantly, i&#945;&#946;T derived from the different iPSC lines expressed CD8&#945; and CD8&#946; which is crucial for the function of cytotoxic T-cells. The CD4\/CD8 double positive stage is an important step in T-cell development and was observed only when T-cells were generated from t-iPSC, but not from the TCR knock-in cells. Functional analysis of i&#945;&#946;T-cells confirmed their cytotoxic activity and potential to release cytokines after activation. Our scalable process for i&#945;&#946;T differentiation generates CD8-positive T-cells that secrete cytokines and show cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, demonstrating their potential as a promising cell source for TCR-T or CAR-T cancer immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

However, targeting solid cancer patients with CAR-T\/TCR-T cells represents a more challenging approach, due to various factors present within the hostile tumor micro-environment (TME), inhibiting T cell functionality and leading to T cell exhaustion. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is expressed on tumor cells as well as various cell types within the TME and binds to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expressed on the surface of activated T cells, thereby inducing T cell exhaustion and mediating tumor immune escape. To impair this inhibitory mechanism and improve TCR-T cell efficacy for the treatment of solid tumors, we use the chimeric costimulatory switch protein (CSP) PD1-41BB that turns the inhibitory signal mediated via the PD-1-PD-L1 axis into a costimulatory one. The CSP-mediated costimulatory signal is TCR-gated, whereby costimulation can only occur if a specific peptide-HLA complex present on a target cell interacts with a recombinant TCR expressed in T cells. <i>In vitro<\/i> co-cultures of rTCR-T cells expressing the CSP (CSP rTCR-T cells) and antigen-negative or -positive cell lines carrying or lacking PD-L1 demonstrated that CSP rTCR-T cells display functionality only if the respective target antigen is expressed in target cells, but not in the absence of target antigen. PD-L1-positive, antigen-negative tumor cells are not lysed by CSP rTCR-T cells, not even in the presence of antigen-positive tumor cells, showing gated functionality and a favorable safety profile of CSP-armored TCR-T cells. CSP rTCR-T cells displayed enhanced cytokine release and killing after encounter of PD-L1-positive tumor cell lines, compared to tumor cells lacking PD-L1, and showed the capacity to recognize and lyse a large panel of tumor cell lines expressing various levels of HLA-A*02, target antigen and PD-L1 <i>in vitro<\/i>. 3D spheroids derived from PD-L1-positive, target antigen-positive tumor cell lines mimicking cell-cell interactions within a solid tumor mass efficiently triggered CSP rTCR-T cells, leading to specific IFN-&#947; release and lysis of tumor spheroids. Furthermore, CSP rTCR-T cells showed enhanced proliferative capacity and expansion in co-cultures with PD-L1-positive tumor cells, compared to tumor cells lacking PD-L1 expression. Importantly, various target antigen-negative healthy cell types expressing or lacking PD-L1 and representing different vital organs were not cross-recognized by CSP rTCR-T cells <i>in vitro<\/i>.

Although treatment of multiple myeloma with CAR T cells can induce deep responses, relapses frequently occur due to antigen escape and limited CAR T cell persistence. TCR-engineered T cells may show prolonged persistence <i>in vivo<\/i> and could mediate sustained antitumor effects. A further benefit of TCR transgenic T cells is the ability to target intracellular antigens that are inaccessible to CAR T cells, expanding the range of potential targets for immunotherapy. In our project, we propose to identify T cell receptors (TCRs) specifically targeting autologous myeloma cells. Tumor-reactive T cells were identified using the Bruker Cellular Analysis Lightning<sup>&#174;<\/sup> platform, allowing simultaneous functional analysis of up to 1500 individual T cell\/target cell interactions on a chip. Reactive T cells were identified upon detection of secreted cytokines (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL2) and measurement of 4-1BB (CD137) surface expression. Tumor-reactive T cells showing various cytokine secretion patterns and 4-1BB expression profiles were detected in each myeloma patient (on average 11.9 T cells out of 1243 cells tested per assay run). Individual tumor-reactive T cells have been isolated and their TCRs were sequenced. TCR sequences of tumor-reactive T cells were mapped to single-cell RNA sequencing data of T cells from the same patiens to reveal a gene expression signature of myeloma-reactive T cells. TCR genes of reactive T cells were cloned and overexpressed in autologous T cells for functional validation and analysis of tumor derived neoepitope specificity. In summary, we present a pipeline allowing identification of myeloma-recognizing T cells and recovery of <i>bona fide<\/i> tumor-reactive TCRs eligible for patient-individualized T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Multiple myeloma,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Here, we developed a high-throughput approach for highly efficient, massively parallel adenine and cytosine base-editor screening in primary human T cells. We performed multiple large-scale pooled screens editing 108 genes with central functions in T cells and whole-gene tiling mutagenesis of selected genes. All screens were functionally read out to capture the effect of variants on hallmarks of T cell anti-tumor immunity, including activation, proliferation, long-term persistence, and cytokine production. We discovered a broad landscape of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations and characterized their impact across multiple axes of T cell functions. Among others, we identified gain-of-function mutations in <i>PIK3CD <\/i>and its regulatory subunit <i>PIK3R1,<\/i> <i>LCK<\/i>, <i>AKT1,<\/i> and loss-of-function mutants of <i>CTLA-4,<\/i> driving increased T cell polyfunctionality. We validated several of these mutations by probing downstream signaling and functional outputs. To demonstrate the feasibility of using such screen results for improving cell-based cancer immunotherapies, we used human T cells with engineered T cell receptors recognizing specific epitopes in melanoma models. We base-edited these T cells with mutations identified in our screens and demonstrate that these mutations indeed significantly enhance cytotoxic cytokine production and tumor-lytic capacity with minimal off-target activity. Lastly, we also provide proof-of-feasibility for high-efficiency combinatorial base-editing in T cells. This study presents a framework for large-scale base editing screens with multi-dimensional functional readouts in cells that are typically difficult to molecularly engineer in a precise manner. This work also has important therapeutic implications: T cells are the substrate for clinically active cell-based therapies, such as adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or chimeric-receptor antigen T (CAR-T) cells. Our screen-informed base editing to achieve an improved T cell product against melanoma exemplifies the therapeutic power of generating synthetic protein variants that improve a wide range of existing and future T cell-based cancer immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,T cell,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Clinical results from CAR-T cells have demonstrated promising results in treating leukemias, while TCR-engineered T cells, which have the advantage of recognizing intracellular tumor antigens, is still in early development. Here, we report the development of CD4+ or CD8+ TCR&#945;&#946;-KO reporter T cell lines for the screening and characterization of transgenic TCRs. A TCR&#945;&#946;-KO reporter T cell line was first developed by knocking out the endogenous TCR &#945; and &#946; chains in the reporter T cell line using CRISPR\/Cas9. Successful knockout was confirmed by phenotypic assays and TCR v chain locus sequencing. We demonstrated that re-introduction of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide-specific TCR (HA1.7) &#945; and &#946; chains into TCR&#945;&#946;-KO reporter T cell lines results in HA peptide-dependent TCR activation and luciferase reporter expression when HA peptide is presented by a MHCII+ cell line. Similarly, re-introduction of MART-1-specific TCR (DMF5) resulted in MART-1-dependent activation in the presence of MHCI+ cells. The select expression of CD4- or CD8-expressing variants of the TCR&#945;&#946;-KO reporter T cell line enables the development of transgenic TCRs for both MHCI- and MHCII-restricted tumor antigen targets. Further development of CD4\/CD8 double-positive and double-negative cell lines enables screening of low and high affinity TCRs without MHC bias.

Progression of activation intensified the metabolic flux through catabolic and anabolic pathways, with significant fluctuations in metabolites such as glucose, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, branched chain amino acids, and pyruvate. These metabolic alterations were accompanied by a 2 fold increase in the prevalence of Tscm cells, and demonstrated a dependency on media composition. Our findings reveal that metabolic profiling during T cell activation provides early and actionable insights into the enrichment of Tscm, and may serve as a strategic guideline for the enhancement of cancer immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,T cell,Adoptive immunotherapy,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

One of these barriers is a result of poor metabolic fitness of T cells, leading to poor proliferation, persistence, and dampened anti-tumor function. Leveraging T-cell metabolism to improve their function is becoming increasingly important to make significant strides in immunotherapy. Stat5a has been shown to be a master regulator of energy and metabolism in T cells, highlighting it as a promising avenue to improve T-cell metabolism for ACT. We have established that the expression of Constitutively Active Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5A (CASTAT5) on tumor-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells improves their persistence, polyfunctionality, and anti-tumor effects in a mouse model. This study further examines Stat5a and its downstream metabolic targets in the context of ACT. We carried out scRNAseq analysis and found that Stat5a directly interacts with genes involved in polyamine metabolism. More specifically, Stat5a activation increases the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (Odc1), spermidine synthase (Srm), deoxyhypusine synthase (Dhps), and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (Dohh) in a subset of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing CASTAT5. Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (Cut&#38;Tag) analysis of histone H3K27ac also demonstrated increased H3K27ac at promoter and enhancer regions of polyamine pathway genes in CASTAT5 compared to control CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. To further examine the function of Stat5a, the murine pro-B cell line, Ba\/F3, is being used as a model to study Stat5a-mediated signaling. We have found that upon withdrawal of IL-3 from Ba\/F3 cells, Stat5a activation is significantly downregulated. Our scRNA-seq-based metabolic flux estimation showed a significant reduction in metabolic fluxes and related genes, including polyamines, following IL-3 withdrawal. Correspondingly, Stat5a ChIP-Seq and Cut&#38;Tag analyses of H3K27ac revealed Stat5a binding to active enhancer regions in the presence of IL-3 that are lost following its withdrawal. Untargeted metabolomics confirmed the marked Stat5a-mediated reduction in metabolite abundance after IL-3 deprivation, in a time-dependent manner. The polyamine-hypusine axis revealed in our studies is a promising avenue to improve T-cell function. This axis has been shown to regulate T-cell function, and potentially modulate mitochondrial respiration and T-cell activation. Hence, our studies have identified polyamine supplementation and gene modulation as promising strategies to improve the metabolism of Adoptive T cells in a Stat5a-mediated manner. Further studies will evaluate the effectiveness of this avenue in improving T-cell function, improving their efficacy for ACT, and improving patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Metabolism,Polyamines,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, major challenges limit ACT in all tumors including insufficient cell numbers and failure to target heterogeneous tumors. To improve ACT, we developed a novel biomimetic device where patient-derived tumor organoids, enriched with antigen presenting cells, are cocultured with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a microfluidic tumor-on-a-chip system (TOC). As PBMCs circulate through the device, they are exposed to dispersed tumor polyclonal neoantigens, leading to formation of patient- and tumor-specific organoid interacting lymphocytes (OILs).<br \/>Objectives: Demonstrate that a 3D tumor-on-a-chip (TOC) platform generates organoid interacting lymphocytes (OILs) with enhanced antitumor reactivity.<br \/>Methods: Specimens were collected from 15 surgical patients: melanoma (2), mesothelioma (6), and metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma (9). Tumor cells were combined with autologous antigen presenting cells (healthy spleen\/lymph node) in a 3D matrix to generate immune-enhanced tumor organoids in the TOC system. Autologous PBMCs circulated through the system to produce OILs (7 days). Uncirculated PBMCs and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were cultured as controls. Resultant CD8+ controls and OILs were examined by single cell proteomics to compare cytokine secretion polyfunctionality. To assess anti-tumor reactivity, OILs and controls were reintroduced to tumor cells via coculture. Secreted bulk cytokine profiles were compared by Isoplexis CodePlex and confirmed by ELISA. NanoString Geomx spatial proteomic analysis of coculture PTOs identified key lymphocyte activity and phenotypes during anti-tumor reactivity. Coculture cytotoxic lymphocyte activation and tumor cell death was confirmed by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using student <i>t<\/i>-test and differential expression from linear mixed-effect model.<br \/>Results: Compared to controls, CD8+ OILs showed increased polyfunctionality within single cells immediately after training, particularly in effector T-cell associated cytokine profiles (INF-&#947;, Granzyme B, Perforin). Upon re-introduction to PTOs, OILs excreted significantly increased inflammatory-associated proteins IFN-&#947;, MCP-1, and Granzyme A (p&#60;0.05). Furthermore, OIL re-exposure to tumor led to cytotoxic lymphocyte activation (CD8+CD69+) and significantly increased tumor cell death compared to control (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Compared to controls, OILs produced in the TOC system show enhanced cytotoxic lymphocyte polyfunctionality and induce tumor cytotoxicity, independent of tumor type. With further validation of the OILs&#8217; increased tumor-targeting efficacy, we propose a new potential ACT modality to target a broad array of tumors previously untreatable by current therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Organoids,Adoptive cell therapy,Peritoneal metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

While clinical responses to TIL therapy have been observed in metastatic melanoma, efficacy in other tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [SM1] is limited by the intrinsic functionality and persistence of transferred T cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To improve the clinical outcome of TIL therapy, we have developed KSQ-001EX, an engineered TIL therapy using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology to knockout the SOCS1 gene, for the treatment of solid tumors. SOCS1 is a negative regulator of cytokine signaling in T cells that we previously identified as a top target restraining T cell anti-tumor function and persistence using genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screens. To streamline and shorten TIL manufacture, we established a next-generation manufacturing process with resected tumors or core biopsies as starting materials that eliminates the use of feeder cells and REP, shortening the length of manufacture to 22 days. We demonstrated robust manufacture of cryopreserved KSQ-001EX at clinical scale from NSCLC, HNSCC, checkpoint refractory melanoma, and heavily pre-treated colorectal carcinoma (CRC). KSQ-001EX manufactured from clinical-scale runs were highly viable (&#62;90%) following cryopreservation and thaw, with &#62; 90% SOCS1 on-target editing and complete knockdown of SOCS1 at the protein level. Importantly, KSQ-001EX across all indications assessed showed high frequency of CD8 (median ~80%), an attribute associated with TIL clinical responses. KSQ-001EX also retained high diversity of TCR repertoire. Consistent with the biology of SOCS1 editing, KSQ-001EX exhibited greater cytotoxicity and higher IFN&#947; production against tumor spheroids in comparison to TIL and enhanced induction of pSTAT4 upon IL-12 stimulation, demonstrating heightened sensitivity of KSQ-001EX to cytokines. In conclusion, KSQ-001EX, an engineered TIL therapy with CRISPR\/Cas9 mediated inactivation of SOCS1, can be manufactured at clinical doses from surgical resections or core biopsies within 22 days using a simplified feeder-free manufacturing process from multiple indications. KSQ-001EX exhibits heightened anti-tumor activity in preclinical models, with therapeutic benefit to be evaluated in a planned clinical trial in patients with treatment-refractory melanoma, NSCLC, and HNSCC.

Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by distinct genetic mutations in mammary epithelial cells, resulting in significantly different forms of the disease and a need for highly personalized treatment schemes for patients. Hence, it is important to develop and improve (immuno)therapies for breast cancer patients. Adoptive T-cell therapy with autologous CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL) is a promising method that has already shown promising effects in melanoma patients. Unfortunately, there is almost no information about the use in breast cancer patients. We developed an in vitro protocol to generate tumor-specific CTLs by priming on HER2+ breast cancer cell lines JIMT-1 and SKBR-3. Subsequently, these primed CTLs were tested in 2D and 3D immune cell killing assays in a life cell imaging device in combination with an endpoint viability assay. The activity was compared with unspecific CD8+T cells activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or &#945;CD2\/&#945;CD3\/&#945;CD28, HER2-peptide specific T cells and HER2-CAR T cells serving as a positive control. We investigated the feasibility to freeze CTLs for use in subsequent studies and validated the relevance of HER2 as the main druggable target in the tumor lines using an siRNA approach. The CTLs were most effective on JIMT-1 in a 3D setting, whereas the SKBR-3 CTLs displayed similar activity in 2D and in 3D. The respective CTLs were tumor line specific, as SKBR-3 CTLs did not kill efficiently the JIMT-1 cells and vice versa. The same CTLs displayed the same efficacy pattern after thawing but less pronounced. Thus, within one experimental set-up it is recommended to use either one. The Her2 knockdown in the target cells reduced the killing activity of the CTLs slightly. However, this effect was not statistically significant proving the importance of CTLs as treatment option as well as neoantigens as targets in drug development. In summary, the CTLs proved to capture the respective tumor heterogeneity showing high killing rates in both SK-BR3 and JIMT-1 being more active than HER2-peptide specific T cells. The availability of CTLs in a preclinical setting facilitates screening approaches for combinational studies. Beyond that they can serve as starting material to develop cancer vaccines and identify highly immunogenic neoantigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,HER2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"I.

To prevent graft vs. host disease, CAR-T cells are mostly produced from the patient&#8217;s own T-cells and transduced using pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) lentivirus system. Typically, CD8+ effector T cells have relatively low transduction rates, compared with CD4+ T cells, and yet it is the CD8+ T cells that are the dominant effector immune cells in a CAR product. To achieve high efficacy of the CAR-positive effector T cells, a higher number of the patient&#8217;s CD8+ T cells are needed for transduction. However, cancer patients may not have enough T cells by the time they are eligible for CAR-T therapy due to multiple treatment cycles. One potential way to overcome this problem is to achieve a much higher transduction rate of the CD8+ T cells.<br \/>Recently, our lab published the use of pseudotyping CAR lentivirus with baboon endogenous retroviral envelope (BaEV) for the generation of CAR transduced natural killer (NK) cells, exhibiting high transduction rates of above 50%. BaEV lentivirus targets the amino acid transporter, SLC1A5 (ASCT2), to enter the cell. SLC1A5 is highly expressed on activated NK and T cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that CAR-T transduced with BaEV lentivirus will have increased transduction rates compared with VSV-G.<br \/>To assess transduction, we used anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR construct which consists of the mesothelin single chain variable fragment (scFv), CD8&#945; hinge and transmembrane domain, 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and a CD3&#950; activation domain, followed with GFP linked by self-cleavage P2A. The concentrated virus was titrated in Jurkat cells, resulting in 90% transduction efficiency with VSV-G and 50% with BaEV, for the same amount of virus.<br \/>Primary CD8+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of 3 healthy donors and activated with CD3\/CD28 beads for three days prior to transduction. Then, the cells were transduced with either VSV-G or BaEV meso-CAR pseudotyped lentiviruses. Transduction rates were measured by flow cytometry, 3 days post-transduction. In addition, the CAR-T cells were expanded <i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vitro<\/i> to evaluate their cytotoxicity against the mesothelin-positive cell line OVCAR-8, for 24 hours. VSV-G led to 10-20% transduction rates, while BaEV exhibited much higher transduction rates (55-70%), leading to improved cytotoxicity against the tumor cells.<br \/>The successful increase of transduction rates for CD8+ CAR-T using our BaEV lentiviral system can be utilized in the clinic to treat patients that previously didn&#8217;t qualify for adoptive therapy, due to low lymphocyte counts. In addition, higher numbers of CD8+ CAR-T cells may result in better tumor control in both blood and solid tumor settings, compared with the traditional approach for CAR-T production.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,CAR T cells,Mesothelin,Lentivirus,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

The effectiveness of conventional treatments in extending the survival of patients is limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel systemic therapeutic interventions. Adoptive cell therapy has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy by successfully treating B-cell malignancies through chimeric antigen receptor-based approaches. For solid tumors, there is a need to identify a broader spectrum of tumor target antigens, and the field has now shifted towards leveraging T cell receptors (TCRs) which can recognize both intracellular and extracellular antigen-derived epitopes. Our team has established an immunogenic epitope discovery pipeline, followed by a specialized protocol for empiric validation of candidate epitopes. We characterized immunogenic epitopes by coupling tandem mass spectrometry of MHC-eluted peptides with tumor proteome and MHC-peptide binding prediction databases. By integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, and immunopeptidomics) from both in-house and publicly available ATC databases, we find that ATC exhibits significant upregulation of pathways associated with microtubule-based movement, chromosome segregation, and kinetochore complex components. We have identified several HLA-A2- and A24-restricted immunogenic peptides representing these pathway-associated proteins that covered more than 60% of the patient population. These immunogenic peptides were subsequently utilized to isolate antigen-specific T cells from peripheral blood and identify cognate TCR. These peptide-specific T lymphocytes elicit cytotoxicity toward multiple HLA-matched ATC cell lines and tumor samples <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.

The TIL drug product (DP) phenotype was previously assessed and extensively characterized based on the bulk population. The current research further characterizes the TIL DP at a single-cell level using high-dimension multimodal sequencing and explores features that have a potential to inform future development of TIL therapies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Manufactured lifileucel TIL DP from 20 pts (best overall response [BOR]: 6 complete response [CR], 4 partial response, 5 stable disease, 5 progressive disease [PD]) from the registrational melanoma C144-1 trial were analyzed using single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, resulting in 153K single-cell transcriptomes. To aid with cell-type annotation, 130 surface proteins on TIL DP samples from a subset of 4 pts (BOR: 2 CR, 2 PD) were detected via Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing. Multimodal weighted nearest-neighbor analysis combined with manual cluster annotation (via known marker genes and proteins), cell-type-specific gene signatures, and automated annotation were used to develop a single-cell TIL (scTIL) reference map, resulting in high-resolution subsets of cells. TCR clonotypes from lifileucel TIL DP were compared to those from respective pretreatment tumors previously identified by bulk TCR sequencing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Mapping of the full dataset to the novel scTIL reference revealed a CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TIL-dominant composition of responder TIL DP. TIL from pts with BOR PD exhibited reduced CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>effector memory (Tem)-like and resident memory (Trm)-like T cells. Differential expression analysis showed that responder CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TIL had increased expression of TCR signaling genes while responder CD4<sup>+<\/sup> TIL exhibited gene expression consistent with a more cytotoxic-like phenotype. Relative to responders, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TIL of pts with BOR PD had lower expression of the CD39<sup>&#8722;<\/sup>CD69<sup>&#8722;<\/sup> (stem-like) gene signature and higher expression of the CD39<sup>+<\/sup>CD69<sup>+<\/sup> (terminal differentiation) gene signature. Pseudotime trajectory analysis found that both CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> TIL of pts with BOR PD were more terminally differentiated. Single-cell TCR sequencing revealed that CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell clusters had greater clonal overlap than CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell clusters. Expanded clonotypes in pretreatment tumor tissues were more prevalent in TIL TCR repertoires of responders and were more likely to be expressed by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> (specifically CD8<sup>+<\/sup> Tem- and Trm-like TIL) than CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Collectively, these results shed additional light on the cellular and molecular characteristics of ex vivo expanded lifileucel TIL DP and signal additional features with a potential to guide future TIL product development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,RNA sequencing,Single cell,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, artificially mutated TCRs can increase the risk of off-target toxicities due to unexpected cross-reactions, which limits the overall safety of this approach. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel strategy for cloning tumor-specific endogenous therapeutic TCRs from long-term surviving patients who have responded to immunotherapy. Specifically, we have identified a TCR (10F04) that is specific to human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) E7<sub>84-98<\/sub> and restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecular DRA\/DRB1*09:01 from the peripheral blood of a patient with HPV-positive metastatic cervical cancer who received multiple antigens stimulating cellular therapy (MASCT) and exhibited sustained T-cell immunological responses. Upon transduction into human T cells, the 10F04 TCR demonstrated robust antitumor activity in both <i>in<\/i> <i>vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Notably, the TCR effectively redirected both CD4 and CD8 T cells to specifically recognize tumor cells and induced multiple cytokine secretion along with durable antitumor activity. Importantly, no cross-reactivity was detected in toxicity studies. As a result, this TCR is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial for treating HPV18-positive cancers (NCT05787535). The first-in-human infusion had been just completed. No severe adverse event had been observed, while an early proliferation of TCR-T was detected several days after infusion. Our approach of cloning tumor-specific and safe endogenous therapeutic TCRs from long-term surviving patients offers a promising strategy for developing safe and effective TCR-engineered T-cell therapies for solid tumors. These findings provide important insights into the potential of HLA class II-restricted TCR-T therapy as a novel cancer treatment modality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immunotherapy,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

Despite its success in treating various tumor types, such as synovial sarcoma, head and neck tumors, and cervical cancer, its application in liver cancer is limited. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a highly expressed tumor-associated antigen in liver cancer, is an ideal target for TCR-T cell therapy. Although early human trials have confirmed the safety of AFP-targeting TCR-T products, their efficacy is still modest, highlighting the need for further research and development.<br \/>Methods: We developed a robust strategy combining ex vivo stimulation and single-cell paired TCR sequencing to identify AFP-recognizing TCRs in liver cancer patients. To optimize TCR expression and minimize mispairing, we employed codon optimization and replaced the constant regions with murine counterparts. Furthermore, structural analysis guided the affinity optimization of the CDR3 region to enhance the antitumor function of the selected TCR. The anti-tumor efficacy of TCR-T cells was rigorously evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity assays using the Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) system and in vivo antitumor assessment in immunodeficient mouse xenograft models. Antigen specificity, HLA restriction, and other potential toxicity were carefully evaluated in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Results: We successfully cloned a highly effective TCR that recognizes the AFP<sub>158-166<\/sub> epitope presented by HLA-A*0203. After sequence optimization, we further changed a single amino acid on the TCR v&#946; chain based on AI prediction. The expression and functionality of this TCR was significantly improved. When introduced into human T cells, the single amino acid mutated TCR demonstrated robust and specific anti-tumor activity in various models, including cultured tumor cells, patient-derived organoids, and mouse xenografts models. Notably, this TCR also redirected CD4 T cells to recognize tumor cells, induced the secretion of multiple cytokines, and maintained long-lasting anti-tumor effects. Our rigorous screening assays confirmed that the TCR showed no cross-reactivity with the human proteome or major HLA subtypes. Additionally, extensive preclinical safety assessments in tumor-bearing animals treated with ST08A01-AM14 TCR-T cells showed no significant safety concerns.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we have developed an HLA-A*0203 restrict AFP<sub>158-166<\/sub> specific TCR-T therapy, which exhibits exceptional anti-tumor effects while ensuring a favorable safety profile. The promising results support the further investigation against AFP-positive solid tumors in clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immunotherapy,AFP,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chen-Song Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, shudan Ou<sup>2<\/sup>, Jun Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Junjun Chu<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Yanyan Han<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pancreato-Biliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>HRYZ BIOTECH Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"255b0b14-0f18-42eb-b21c-a600acc9278a","ControlNumber":"4469","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.
