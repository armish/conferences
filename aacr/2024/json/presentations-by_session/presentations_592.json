[{"Abstract":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) per high-power field (HPF) as measured by expert pathologists is a useful, independent, validated prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of deep learning (DL) can predict TILs directly from routinely collected, digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) pathology slides, but AI-predicted TILs have not yet been thoroughly validated as clinically relevant biomarker. Here we test whether AI-predicted TILs per HPF can be validated as an independent prognostic biomarker of CRC-specific survival in patients. We constructed an AI model to predict TILS per HPF using a weakly-supervised, transformer-based deep regression model, trained using 5-fold cross validation in a large dataset (n=1,738) and validated in a second independent dataset (n=223) of CRC cases. The model predicted TILs per HPF as a continuous variable, which was carried forward for survival analyses both as a continuous variable and dichotomized at a previously established <i>a priori<\/i> threshold of &#60;2 vs. &#8805;2 TILs per HPF. Using longitudinal data from the population-based Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Study (median follow-up = 95 months), survival analyses were performed using non-parametric and Cox-proportional hazards models, with and without adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, stage, and molecularly measured microsatellite instability (MSI). Two or more AI-predicted TILs per HPF were significantly associated with 5-year CRC-specific survival (p=0.0000037), 5-year overall survival (p=0.00021), and overall survival (p=0.000067). In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, stage, and MSI, &#8805;2 AI-predicted TILs per HPF was significantly associated with improved 5-year CRC-specific survival, with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.62, (95% confidence interval; 0.43, 0.91), p=0.01.<br \/>Our new AI-driven deep learning model, which we call <i>HopeSTIL<\/i>, provides a highly efficient algorithm for analyzing digital pathology images of H&#38;E sections of CRC to quantify TILs per HPF. <i>HopeSTIL<\/i> is a validated prognostic marker for 5-year CRC-specific survival that does not require a pathologist to manually count and score TILs per HPF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Survival,Microsatellite instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, the quantification of TILs remains a strenuous task for pathologists and is susceptible to inter-pathologist variations. Deep learning (DL) can predict cancer biomarkers directly from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) pathology slides, enabling the automated and consistent quantification of TILs for clinical decision-making. Our study focuses on the prediction of TILs per high-power field (HPF) on two large cohorts of CRC patients. We developed a weakly-supervised, transformer-based deep regression model to predict TILs per HPF from routine H&#38;E-stained histology slides. We trained the model using 5-fold cross-validation on a large cohort of CRC patients (n=1,738), and validated its performance on an external cohort of CRC patients (n=223). The model was evaluated using the Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient r. Moreover, pathologist-determined TILs per HPF was categorized into low (&#60;2) and high (&#8805;2), enabling evaluation via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our model achieved a significant correlation coefficient of 0.60 (p&#60;0.0001) for the predicted TILs per HPF in the holdout test sets of the internal cohort, and a significant correlation coefficient of 0.57 (p&#60;0.0001) on the external validation cohort. Using the thresholds for low and high TILs per HPF, we found that the model accurately predicted the presence of high TILs per HPF in both the internal and external test cohorts, yielding AUROCs of 0.76 and 0.81, respectively. These findings underscore the efficacy of our deep learning model in predicting TILs per HPF from routine pathology slides. This approach holds promise for cost-effective, efficient and uniform quantification of TILs per HPF in CRC, potentially across various cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

The first generation TRK inhibitors including larotrectinib and entrectinib have limited applications due to acquired resistance in clinical settings. Multiple on-target mutations occur at the solvent-front, gatekeeper, and xDFG motif inside the ATP binding pocket of the TRK kinase domain. While some candidates under current clinical development aim to address the solvent-front mutation, they are ineffective against the xDFG mutations (e.g.NTRK1.G667X). There is strong unmet medical needs for next generation TRK inhibitors that can address resistance mutations. We employ the synergistic advantages of domain expertise and modern technology to accelerate early stage drug discovery. On our deep learning (DL) centric AI platform, extensive scientific computing supports large scale virtual screening, generative design, drug property prediction and multi-objective lead optimization. Only the optimized candidate compounds are passed along for synthesis and testing to save time and cost. In Ba\/F3-TPM3 cellular assays, LB-2159 showed superior potencies that are hundreds to thousands of fold higher than larotrectinib and\/or entrectinib, with IC50 values of 0.02 nM for NTRK1.WT, 0.3 nM for NTRK1.G595R and 0.88 nM for NTRK1.G667C. Similar cellular potencies were demonstrated for ALK and ROS1. In xenograft models LB-2159 at 10 mg\/kg bid resulted in complete tumor regression in Ba\/F3-TPM3-NTRK1-WT tumors, 96% TGI in Ba\/F3-TPM3-NTRK1-G595R tumors, 84% TGI and 100% survival in mice bearing Ba\/F3-TPM3-NTRK1-G667C tumors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of LB-2159 are overall favorable, demonstrating extended stability and half life. In vitro safety screens yielded clean profiles without any DDI signal or hERG liability. Preclinical safety evaluations exhibited good tolerance in rats. In multiple dose escalation studies LB-2159 was well tolerated at 50 mg\/kg\/day and beyond. Empowered by our proprietary AI platform, we have discovered the novel ALK\/ROS1\/TRK inhibitors that overcome clinically known resistance mutations. Our drug candidate exhibited good tolerance in animals in preclinical safety evaluations. In xenograft models that are resistant to current treatments the compound demonstrates strong tumor suppression efficacy. LB-2159 is advancing through IND enabling studies, and its preclinical profiles support the potential for best-in-class treatment for NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Solid tumors,Drug resistance,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The disease is further characterized by pronounced genomic instability, exemplified by biomarkers such as DNA ploidy. While the Gleason Score effectively assesses the histological changes, the manual evaluation of DNA ploidy is subjective and time-consuming. Addressing the need for an objective diagnostic tool, our study developed a deep learning model aimed at accurately predicting DNA ploidy using publicly available WSI from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).<br \/>Utilizing a ResNet-18 convolutional neural network, we trained the model on WSIs from 200 TCGA patients to extract features and predict total mRNA expression. The model was further refined using data from 19 TCGA patients, focusing on ploidy number prediction. Comparative analysis against a random reference model revealed significant improvements of ploidy prediction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 43.52%, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 43.59%, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 67.86%. These enhancements were statistically validated (p-values: MAE - 7.07E-06, MAPE - 7.69E-06, MSE - 3.14E-05) and substantiated by large Cohen's d values (MAE - 2.88, MAPE - 2.86, MSE - 2.42), confirming the model's advanced predictive accuracy and practical utility.<br \/>This approach, validated further on a separate TCGA hold-out test set, signifies a major leap in prostate cancer diagnostics. By integrating mRNA prediction checkpoints, our model not only refines ploidy assessment but also sets the stage for correlating these predictions with patient clinical outcomes. These developments promise to enhance existing diagnostic methods, offering a more objective and efficient tool for DNA ploidy assessment in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment planning.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Prostate cancer,Deep learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

DeepHRD was compared to four standard HRD molecular tests using breast (n=349) and ovarian (n=141) cancers from multiple external and independent datasets, including clinical cohorts with platinum complete response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints.<br \/>Results: DeepHRD detected HRD from held-out H&#38;E-stained breast cancer slides in TCGA with an AUC of 0.81 ([0.77-0.85]; 95% confidence interval). This performance was confirmed in two independent primary breast cancer cohorts (AUC=0.76; [0.71-0.82]). In an external platinum-treated metastatic breast cancer cohort, samples detected as HRD had a higher complete response (AUC=0.76; [0.54-0.93]) with 3.7-fold increase in median PFS (14.4 versus 3.9 months; p-value=0.0019) and hazard ratio (HR) of 0.45 (p=0.0047) after correcting for PAM50 molecular subtype and age at diagnosis. This deep-learning classifier outperformed four genomic HRD tests used in the clinic, including standard HRD score, <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>, 26-HR gene panel and single-base substitution signature 3 (SBS3). Multiresolution spatial mapping identified morphological features utilized by DeepHRD for detecting HRD, notably enriched for neoplastic and necrotic tissues, and a higher macrophage density. Through transfer learning to high-grade serous-ovarian cancer, DeepHRD-positive samples exhibited better overall survival after TCGA first-line (HR=0.46; p=0.030) and an external neoadjuvant (HR=0.49; p=0.015) platinum-treated cohorts.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, DeepHRD exhibits consistent hazard ratios ranging from 0.45 to 0.49 across the three clinical cohorts and captures 1.8- to 3.1-fold more HRD-positive breast and ovarian cancer patients. DeepHRD-positive breast cancer patients that received platinum exhibited better complete response and PFS. Similarly, DeepHRD-positive platinum-treated ovarian cancer patients had a better OS. DeepHRD&#8217;s ability to detect HRD from digital H&#38;E slides provides an important precision oncology tool that can be utilized in resource-constrained and underserved areas where genomic testing is generally not existent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Deep learning,Treatment response,Digital pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Pathomics, the study of quantitative imaging from such samples, aims to elevate diagnostic accuracy by revealing intricate tissue and cellular details. Our research evaluates how pathomic features from tissue imagery can predict gene expression, as determined by RNA sequencing, offering advancements in the molecular profiling and targeted therapy for invasive breast carcinoma (IBC).<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We conducted an analysis of 90 regions of interest (ROIs) on FFPE tissue slide images from the TCGA registry for patients with IBC. Using HistomicsTK software, we extracted nearly 300 pathomic features depicting cell morphometry, intensity, and gradient from these regions of interest (ROIs). We then assessed the intra-correlation of the pathomic features within the ROIs of the same tissue slide to identify the most heterogeneous and highly correlating features (n=20) across categories&#8212;morphometry, intensity, and gradient&#8212;with a Pearson&#700;s Correlation coefficient (r) greater than 0.9 and a FDR adjusted p-value less than 0.05. Subsequently, gene expression data in the form of FPKM were obtained for the corresponding tissues from TCGA. We trained a Multitask Elastic Net (MTEN) model on these pathomic features using an 80:20 split for the training and testing sets, with a three-fold cross-validation applied to the training set utilizing ImaGene software. The model's performance was evaluated by measuring the AUC and R&#178; value for the predicted gene expression on the testing set.<br \/><b>Result and Biological significance<\/b>: The testing of the MTEN model using a testing set predicted the expression of three genes identified in the literature as prognostic markers in breast cancer, namely ALDH1L2, MFAP5, and MXRA8, with an AUC greater than 0.8 and an R&#178; above 0.5 at a p-value of less than 0.002. According to the literature, expression of genes from the ALDH1 superfamily in breast cancer correlates with the stage of the disease, triple-negative status, and response to neoadjuvant therapy. The upregulation of MFAP5 in invasive breast carcinomas has been associated with high risk prognostic features, such as higher tumor grade and stage and increased angiogenesis, and poorer outcomes, such as lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, MXRA8 is involved in modulating the progression of human triple-negative breast cancer, likely through its influence on the interactions of tumor cells with their microenvironment.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The present study predicts the expression of clinically relevant genes in IBC using a heterogeneous set of pathomic features extracted from FFPE tissue slide imagery. By linking cell and tissue-based morphometric, intensity, and gradient features with gene expression, researchers can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. Digital pathology and pathomics may reduce the need for additional genetic testing in critical patient-cases by providing predictive information from routinely acquired pathology slides. Bridging the gap between phenotypic tissue data and molecular data, the predictive capabilities of pathomic features represent a significant advancement in the field of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Digital Pathology,Pathomics,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Here, we apply a multiomic strategy jointly leveraging plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and multiple extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived analytes to enhance CRC diagnostic accuracy.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>Plasma was collected from 96 individuals, 48 CRC patients (stage II-IV) and 48 CRC-negative healthy controls. EVs and cfDNA were isolated from the same plasma sample to look at complementary information within the sample. We developed an EV RNA sequencing platform targeting mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs and sequenced to a depth of 50M reads per sample; cfDNA methylome profiling was sequenced to an equivalent depth. The Olink platform profiled proteins both directly from plasma and from isolated EVs. Expression of EV-derived RNA, splice variants, and proteins in addition to cfDNA methylation patterns were analyzed using Bio-Techne&#8217;s multiomic platform. Machine learning-based feature selection algorithms identified biomarker signatures from each analyte. Receiver-operator characteristic curves (ROC) were generated utilizing leave-one-out cross-validation of na&#239;ve Bayes classifier models to compute the area under the curve (AUC). Individual signatures were integrated to generate a multiomic classifier.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Differential gene expression (DEx) analysis identified ~1000 DEx genes with significant enrichment of CRC-relevant pathways. Splice variant analysis identified several genes previously implicated in CRC with differential isoform usage. Over 1.7 million differentially methylated bases were detected between CRC-positive and CRC-negative cohorts. Segmentation of the genome using out-of-bag reference data yielded ~1100 genomic segments, many of which overlap previously reported CRC biomarkers and identified unique information about the CRC status. Proteomic analysis identified several differentially abundant markers with high discriminatory power. Following feature selection analysis, AUCs obtained from top 10 features of RNA expression, splice variants, cfDNA methylation, and protein abundance with an integrative analysis identified a multi-analyte signature, with an overall AUC of 0.99.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusion: <\/b>While biomarker signatures obtained from each analyte in this study resulted in effective separation of CRC status, the multiomic signature further improved the discriminatory power&#8212;underscoring the complementary nature of the signals. Thus, a multiomic biomarker discovery strategy leveraging cfDNA and EV cargo holds tremendous promise for minimally invasive screening and potential detection of early-stage cancers, which is currently under further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Multiomics,Exosomes,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Ionizing radiation (IR), in contrast, generates DSBs and other DNA lesions, making it potentially more toxic than CRISPR-Cas9 induced DSBs. Alternatively, CRISPR-Cas9 might be more toxic as the Cas9 activity would continue if the DSB were repaired to wild type, resulting in more scissions per target. We designed multitarget sgRNAs targeting 0-16 sites in the human genome and performed similar dose-response experiments with IR (0-10 Gy) over 21 days on two pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines. Growth inhibition was measured through clonogenicity and alamarBlue assays, and &#947;-H2AX staining performed to calculate DSBs. Surviving colonies from sgRNA transduction underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted deep sequencing to quantify mutations. Cell growth was assessed through cell counting and sgRNA tag survival over time. Chromosomal changes were elucidated through chromosome breakage assays and XY FISH. We found that cytotoxicity increased as a function of both IR dose and number of sgRNA target site. At a comparable number of DSBs, CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity (~44% growth inhibition from 5-target sgRNA, ~15 &#947;-H2AX foci in the PC cells) compared to IR (9% inhibition from 0.5 Gy, ~25 foci). WGS of 5-cutter treated cells also revealed ~13 CRISPR-Cas9 induced DSBs in the PC cells. &#62;99% cytotoxicity was achieved with 12-target sgRNA and 8 Gy. Moreover, sequencing of surviving colonies from sgRNA-treated cells confirmed lack of widespread off-target events. Notably, no surviving colonies could be obtained from the 12- and 16-cutter treated Panc10.05 cells and 8-14 cutters treated TS0111 cells.Both CRISPR-Cas9 and IR assays demonstrated delayed cell death, and cell death began 7 days after transduction of multitarget sgRNAs. Cytogenetic analyses on cells transduced with a 14-cutter sgRNA over 21 days revealed accumulation of karyotypic abnormalities peaking at day 14, and polyploidization peaking at day 10 and decreasing by day 21. Structural variant (SV) analyses from WGS data showed that the number of SVs per colony increased and peaked in 6-cutter colonies (average = 42 SVs), then decreased in 8- and 14-cutter colonies. Finally, surviving colonies that were resistant to 5-, 8-, and 16-cutter sgRNAs were re-challenged with their original multitarget sgRNA, 12-, and 14-cutter sgRNAs. Re-treating with original sgRNA showed no growth inhibition, while &#62;95% cytotoxicity was observed by re-challenging them with 12- or 14-cutter sgRNAs.In conclusion, CRISPR-Cas9 kills pancreatic cancers by inducing chromosomal catastrophe, and resistance to original set of CRISPR-Cas9 induced DSBs can be easily overcome by targeting different sites. For the same number of DSBs, CRISPR-Cas9 was surprisingly more toxic than IR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Ionizing radiation,DNA double-strand break,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
