Among all microorganisms harbored within tumor tissue, bacteria are currently the most studied due to their ability to interact with the host. To date, the tumor microbiome is reported as composed of tumor type-specific bacteria, commonly found within host cells, which can affect tumor biology as well as play a role in cancer formation, progression, and response to therapy. So far, the contribution of intratumoral microbiota in the context of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has been underestimated; therefore, this project aims to characterize the STS microbiota and understand if it can impair the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic regimens. STS are heterogeneous cancers with more than 100 histological subtypes, different in molecular alterations, which make its personalized therapy very complex. Thus, doxorubicin is the gold standard of chemotherapy for advanced STS but it is effective for less than 50% of patients. Doxorubicin is a natural anthracycline produced by different strains of <i>Streptomycetaceae<\/i> which exploit the toxic properties of this molecule for inter-specific competition. Hence, the hypothesis that certain bacteria developed drug-inactivating mechanisms seems evolutionarily plausible. Targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene through a Fluorescence in situ hybridization, we were able to detect bacteria within different histotypes of sarcoma. In addition, we analyzed the microbiome composition of sarcoma tissues and adjacent healthy tissues showing that sarcomas harbor a distinct microbiome composition. Besides, comparison of different sarcoma histotypes revealed that microbiome composition seems to be shaped according to histological features. Moreover, we isolate live bacteria harbored within sarcoma tissues. To date, isolated bacteria were mainly strictly or facultative anaerobes; thus, well adapted to live in the hypoxic environment of tumors. These bacteria gave us the opportunity to investigate their ability to interfere with chemotherapy. We exposed several sarcoma-isolated bacteria strains to doxorubicin, we found that certain bacteria strains were responsible for drug degradation. This result was confirmed with functional experiments evaluating drug toxicity after bacterial exposure. In addition, we showed <i>in vivo<\/i> that the intratumoral presence of doxorubicin-degrading bacteria is sufficient to provoke the occurrence of chemoresistance in a doxorubicin-sensitive mouse model of fibrosarcoma. This study offers new insights about the relationship between the intratumoral microbiota and the occurrence of chemoresistance in cancer therapies, suggesting that microbial communities hosted within the tumor should be deeply investigated, and then manipulated, to improve the outcome of therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Drug resistance,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a pivotal tool in mapping this microbiome, our study delves into the interplay between bladder cancer (BCa), BCG therapy, and the urinary microbiome. We analyzed bacterial profiles in benign and malignant samples, considering various clinical parameters.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: A total of 88 patients participated in the study, comprising 30 individuals with benign diseases and 58 BCa patients. Urine samples were collected from patients with benign conditions and from BCa patients before and after BCG treatment. Malignant samples obtained before the completion of the intravesical BCG induction cycle were labeled 'Pre-BCG', while those collected after this cycle were termed 'Post-BCG'. Following collection, DNA was extracted and underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequencing data was then utilized for bioinformatic analyses, which included metagenomic profiling and metabolic pathway inference.<br \/>Results: Significant differences in bacterial compositions were observed between benign and malignant samples, with a metabolic signature suggesting toluene degradation pathway may mitigate bladder cancer development. In the post-BCG samples, we inferred elevations of 2-oxoglutarate, a BCG derivative, and L-methionine, which is associated with therapeutic benefits, compared to their pre-BCG counterparts. Furthermore, post-BCG samples showed microbial differences in responders and increased quinolone synthesis compared to non-responders. This is of significance due to quinolone's role in modulating DNA topoisomerase and mitochondrial functions, both pivotal in bladder cancer progression.<br \/>Conclusions: Utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we drew comparisons between the urinary microbiomes of benign and malignant samples and suggested a potential pathway for bladder cancer occurrence. Following intravesical BCG treatment, certain microbial metabolic pathways seemed to offer therapeutic benefits to responders. Our study provides insights into the microbial influences on bladder cancer development and the varying responses to BCG treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Urine,Bladder cancer,Bacillus Calmette–Guérin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Kyungchan Min<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xuan-Mei Piao<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Joon Byun<sup>2<\/sup>, Chuang-Ming Zheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Seon-Kyu Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Seong-Hwan Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Sungmin Moon<sup>4<\/sup>, Kyeong Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Ho Won Kang<sup>4<\/sup>, Won Tae Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Seok Joong Yun<sup>4<\/sup>, Hansoo Park<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Science and Technology, Department of Bioscience, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Urology, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7546842-1dcf-421f-9b5c-edc32f907d96","ControlNumber":"1261","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

The tumor microbiome has shed light on its role, influence, and modulation in cancer immunosurveillance, where the tumor-bacterial component emerges as a potential mediator for the antitumoral-immune response. Nevertheless, the complexities and functional mechanisms underlying this interaction remain elusive. Here, we outline how the tumor microbiota can impact the host&#180;s immune response to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We explored the microbiome within LUAD tumors and non-tumoral adjacent tissues (NAT) from Chilean patients. We used 10 paired (LUAD and NAT) fresh-frozen samples, 20 exclusively tumor fresh-frozen samples, and 40 exclusively tumor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed revealed variations in alpha diversity, with an intra-tumoral microbiome enriched in <i>Gammaproteobacteria<\/i> and <i>Actinobacteria<\/i>, particularly genera <i>Pseudomonas<\/i> and <i>Corynebacterium<\/i> in undifferentiated LUAD samples. Notably, a consistent depletion of <i>Verrucomicrobiota<\/i> with genus <i>Akkermansia<\/i> was evident in samples where cell differentiation was lost. Metaproteomics analysis revealed bacteria-associated peptides from <i>Pseudomonas<\/i> and <i>Streptomyces<\/i> enriched in the tumor, linked to Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters and Glutathione S-transferase N-terminal domain-containing protein, both associated with transport activity and negatively correlated with cancer. The bacterial metabolic analysis uncovered 10 enriched microbial-associated metabolites in the tumor, highlighting adenosine and inosine, two known inducers of immunosuppression on T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Host proteomics gene-ontology analysis highlighted an enrichment of proteins in the Interferon pathways. Concurrently, a downregulation of proteins like T-cell surface-glycoprotein CD8 and HLA-class I histocompatibility antigen was observed, linked to MHC protein complex binding function, and associated with immune evasion through diminished antigen presentation. Furthermore, upregulated proteins such as macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) and eIF-2-alpha kinase GCN2, known to stimulate cell proliferation, were identified. In summary, our multi-omics and bioinformatic analyses unveil a distinct intra-tumoral microbiome and microbe-derived metabolites could induce immune suppression, altering the metabolic profile in the LUAD tumor microenvironment and collectively contribute to tumor progression.<br \/>Funding information: This work was supported by FONDECYT1231629 and ANID-Subdirecci&#243;n de capital humano\/Doctorado Nacional\/2023\/21231386.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Microbiome,Microenvironment,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Emerging evidence has overturned this belief unveiling the existence of a specific lung microbiota that plays a pivotal role in modulating lung immune tolerance. Recent research also sheds light on how the tissue microbiota is significantly altered by the presence of a growing tumor. Here, we investigated the compositional changes in lung-colonizing bacterial populations associated with the growth of LLC1 lung carcinoma cells in C57BL\/6 mice, by analyzing the lung 16S rRNA profiling. While overall microbial diversity and structure were similar in tumor-bearing and healthy lungs, abundance analysis of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) revealed that 48 ASVs were differentially modulated at significant level (FDR &#8804; 0.05). Notably, local treatment with aerosolized vancomycin\/neomycin antibiotics starting 4 days after tumor injection caused a different representation of 47 ASVs (FDR &#8804; 0.05), mostly reducing those ASVs specifically emerging in the lung by the tumor growth, belonging to Bacterioidales, Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Enterobacteriales. A different microbial composition was also suggested by the results of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) that clustered lung tumor samples as saline or antibiotic-aerosolized. Based on the reported ability of some bacteria belonging to these orders to induce immunosuppressive cells in the gut, we examined the impact of antibiotic aerosol on tumor-associated Tregs in the lung. The presence of the tumor promoted the appearance of Tregs expressing CD69 and PD-1 activation markers, but vancomycin\/neomycin aerosol treatment strongly dropped Treg frequency in tumor-bearing lungs, compared to saline. In a therapeutic setting, aerosolization of antibiotics starting 4 days after LLC1 tumor intravenous injection significantly reduced the number of lung metastases (p=0.0116). This effect was associated with an increased cytotoxic activity of immune infiltrating effector cells suggesting that the modulation of the lung microbiota impairs tumor growth and enhances antitumor immune response. Some cultivable bacterial strains, that were in agreement with metataxonomic profile results, were isolated from tumor-bearing lungs, but not from healthy lungs. Ongoing experiments suggest an effect of their in vivo transfer in the lung by aerosol on tumor growth and the ability to induce Treg expansion in vitro. Overall, this study unveils that the growth of the murine LLC1 tumor shapes the lung microbial composition by favoring the expansion of microbes with potential immunosuppressive activity eventually affecting the tumor progression. Moreover, our findings unravel the therapeutic potential of localized antibiotics to revert the immunosuppressive microenvironment by targeting tumor-associated bacteria.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Tumor immunity,Immunosuppression,Lewis lung carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Giancarla Bernardo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Valentino Le Noci<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Montanari<sup>2<\/sup>, Emerenziana Ottaviano<sup>3<\/sup>, Giorgio Gargari<sup>4<\/sup>, Elisa Borghi<sup>3<\/sup>, Simone Guglielmetti<sup>4<\/sup>, Federico Ambrogi<sup>5<\/sup>, Tiziana Triulzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Elda Tagliabue<sup>2<\/sup>, Serenella  M.

Furthermore, the presence of specific fungal taxa are associated with tumor hypoxia, tumor progression, therapeutic response, and clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Preliminary data from our group found that the presence of <i>Candida<\/i> species increased tumor hypoxia and decreased overall survival in CRC. However, whether intratumoral <i>Candida<\/i> drive, support, or simply inhabit tumors with poor prognoses remains unclear. Here, we investigate a casual role for <i>Candida albicans<\/i> in tumor progression and therapy response using a syngeneic mouse model of microsatellite-instability high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer.&nbsp;<br \/>We subcutaneously implanted MC38 colorectal cancer cells into C57BL\/6 mice and then orally gavaged these mice with <i>C. albicans<\/i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i>, or PBS. The site of tumor formation was locally irradiated once (7.5 Gy), and growth of the tumor was measured over time. Differences in tumor volume were assessed by longitudinal mixed-effect models. Tumor sections were stained for fungi using calcofluor white (CFW) and underwent bulk RNA sequencing to detect differential gene expression, which were interpreted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).<br \/>Mice gavaged with <i>C. albicans<\/i> showed decreased response to radiation compared to mice gavaged with either <i>S. cerevisiae<\/i> (p&#60;0.05) or PBS (p&#60;0.001). Additionally, hyphae were observed in murine tumors gavaged with <i>C. albicans<\/i>, suggesting translocation of gavaged <i>C. albicans<\/i> from the gut to tumors. Further, tumors from mice gavaged with <i>C. albicans<\/i> displayed unique gene expression profiles, including decreased interferon alpha and IL-6 and STAT3 signaling, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and decreased apoptosis-related gene expression.<br \/>Here, we show that <i>C. albicans <\/i>may confer resistance to radiation therapy and affects immune and cancer cell activity in the MC38 (MSI-H) syngeneic <i>in vivo<\/i> model of colorectal cancer. Further, we show that hyphal fungi can be visualized in heterotopic murine tumors from our <i>C. albicans<\/i> gavage condition.&nbsp;These data establish that fungi can translocate from the gut to distal tumor sites, and that upon translocation, changes in gene expression and therapy response are observed. Future directions will explore the mechanism by which these effects occur and whether these findings can be leveraged to improve radiotherapy outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Gut microbiota,Radiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

The microbiome has emerged as a novel hallmark of cancer, with a prominent role in tumor immunity and response to treatment. However, the role of the microbiome in brain tumors, and in particular brain metastasis, is largely unknown. We hypothesized that distinct microbial communities are associated with alterations in the tumor microenvironment in metastatic brain tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To evaluate the role of different microbial communities in brain metastasis, matched stool, saliva, and tumor samples were collected prospectively from patients with metastatic brain tumors who underwent surgical tumor resection at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Stool and saliva samples were sequenced via metagenomic shotgun sequencing and tumor samples were analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The tumor microbiome was further characterized through confocal and electron microscopy and culture techniques. Lastly, we conducted digital spatial profiling using the NanoString GeoMx<sup>&#174;<\/sup> platform to determine the spatial association of the tumor microbiome with tumor and immune transcriptome. Spatial single-cell transcriptome analysis of bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative cells within the tumor microenvironment is currently in progress using the CosMx<sup>&#174;<\/sup> platform (NanoString Inc.).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our computational and experimental analyses demonstrated that bacterial signals could be detected in metastatic brain tumors and exhibit an intracellular localization. Interestingly, we found that the tumor bacterial signatures in brain metastases were composed of commensal oral bacterial taxa but had limited overlap with the gut microbiome. Spatial transcriptome analysis demonstrated that tumor areas with high bacterial signal were associated with innate-immune mediated anti-bacterial responses, suggesting an active host response to intra-tumoral bacteria in metastatic brain tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Overall, this work demonstrates the presence of intracellular bacterial signal coupled with an anti-bacterial response within the tumor microenvironment of brain metastases. These findings offer a new perspective on the dynamic interaction between cancer, microbiome, and the brain microenvironment and can inform future mechanistic and translational studies to improve the outcome of brain tumor patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Microbiome,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.
