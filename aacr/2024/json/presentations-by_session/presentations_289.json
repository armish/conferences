As <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations are truncal (<i>i.e., <\/i>present in every cell of a tumor), it remains unclear why a fraction of tumor cells can survive in the presence of drug treatment. &#65279;It is increasingly recognized that &#65279;drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPCs) can escape selective drug pressure and are important drivers of therapy failure and tumor relapse. &#65279;The mechanisms underlying tumor cell adaptation and survival of DTPCs during therapy are not fully understood.Using <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUAD cell lines treated with osimertinib, we unexpectedly observed that DTPCs display uncoupled mRNA and protein variations of PBK (PDZ Binding Kinase), a spindle assembly serine\/threonine protein kinase. Mechanistically we discovered that although global protein synthesis is decreased upon osimertinib treatment, <i>PBK<\/i> translation is selectively maintained in DTPCs.The establishment and survival of DTPCs following EGFR inhibition is critically dependent on PBK, as genetic depletion of <i>PBK<\/i> reduces persistence to osimertinib treatment <i>in vitro<\/i>. PBK knockout leads to &#65279;suppression of ERK1\/2 reactivation following EGFR inhibition, and results in decreased expression of ZEB1 and Vimentin, key effectors of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of the DTPC phenotype. &#65279;Consistently, combined treatment with osimertinib and OTS514 (PBK inhibitor) <i>in vitro<\/i>, reduces the DTPC fraction and decreases the enrichment of EMT-related transcriptional signatures<i>. <\/i>Similar results were obtained in LUAD patient-derived organoids, used to recapitulate the phenotype of residual disease in patients. In PDX treated with osimertinib, PBK is activated at both residual disease and acquired resistance. Concordantly, combined EGFR\/PBK pharmacological inhibition was also effective in reverting osimertinib acquired resistance <i>in vitro<\/i>. Finally, &#65279;in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 7 <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUAD patients treated with EGFR inhibitors, &#65279;we observed increased PBK activation at the time of acquired resistance in 5 cases, including 3 EGFR<sup>T790M<\/sup>-positive cases, suggesting that PBK activation may co-occur with genetic resistant alterations.&#65279;Our findings unveil a novel mechanism by which <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer DTPCs selectively translate <i>PBK<\/i> mRNA as an &#65279;adaptive survival mechanism to persist during osimertinib treatment; and provide a therapeutic target of non-genetic drug resistance otherwise unlooked-for in routine transcriptomic analyses. A deeper understanding on the mRNA translational reprogramming in DTPCs is currently performed to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities to reduce residual disease and delay or revert the emergence of acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Translation,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Serine\/threonine kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Although ER+ breast cancers initially respond well to ER-targeted therapies and CDK4\/6 inhibitors, approximately 30% patients acquire resistance to targeted therapies. In addition to intrinsic resistance that tumors develop, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) residing in the tumor microenvironment, also contribute to treatment-resistance<sup> <\/sup>and poor survival. The role of secreted metabolites by CAFs has been poorly studied in the context of targeted drug resistance. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of stroma-mediated resistance to CDK4\/6-inhibitors, we propagated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and CAFs from treatment-na&#239;ve and treatment-resistant ER+ breast tumors. Our data show that the CAF conditioned media containing the polar metabolite fraction stimulates resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Therefore, to identify metabolites that drive resistance, we performed an untargeted metabolomics on CAF conditioned media. We observed that the CAF conditioned media was enriched for TCA cycle intermediates, including succinate. Succinate is an oncometabolite that has an essential function in energy metabolism. Aside from causing metabolic reprogramming, succinate can be transported out of the mitochondria to perform other biological processes, such as epigenetic modifications and pseudohypoxia. Furthermore, succinate in the extracellular space binds to the succinate receptor SUCNR1 and induces G-protein coupled receptor-mediated signaling in cells expressing SUCNR1. To assess mechanism of resistance that these metabolites might induce, we treated breast cancer cells with the most enriched metabolites we had identified in our metabolomics assay. These experiments identified succinate as driver of CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells. Furthermore, treating tumor cells with SUCNR1 antagonist increased their sensitivity to CDK4\/6-inhibitors, showing that succinate mediated resistance is conveyed via SUCNR1. This suggests that CAF secreted succinate plays a role in supporting a pro-tumor environment by promoting drug resistance towards CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Defining this mechanism of resistance will elucidate potential therapeutic targets to augment patient response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Drug resistance,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, the development of Dara resistance and subsequent relapse is common.To identify the tumor-intrinsic genes involved in resistance to NK-mediated cytotoxicity in the presence of Dara in MM cells, we conducted an <i>in vitro<\/i> genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen and found 433 genes exhibiting a positive correlation with MM cytotoxicity elicited by Dara and primary NK cells. Remarkably, 16 of these genes demonstrated a consistent correlation with cytolytic activity across the majority of the 36 cancer types in the TCGA database.The efficacy of Dara is closely linked to the expression of CD38, with nonresponders exhibiting low CD38 expression. Therefore, we conducted another CRISPR screen to identify the genes whose KO resulted in diminished CD38 expression. The genes that overlapped in these two screens are implicated in regulating both Dara-mediated ADCC and CD38 expression. Our focus turned to KDM6A among the overlapping genes. We validated that <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO significantly decreased CD38 expression and that reintroducing <i>KDM6A<\/i> into <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells restored the expression of CD38 and Dara-induced cytotoxicity.KDM6A demethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) to promote gene expression. Our ChIP-seq data unveiled that <i>KDM6A<\/i>-KO cells exhibited an increased H3K27me3 level at the CD38 promoter area than control cells. Remarkably, this pattern was consistent with Dara-resistant cell lines, which displayed reduced CD38 expression alongside elevated levels of H3K27me3 at the CD38 promoter. Interestingly, we found that CD38 overexpression only partially restored the sensitivity of <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells to Dara treatment, implying the existence of an additional mechanism. We performed RNA-seq in<br \/><i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells and found CD48, an NK-activating ligand, was significantly repressed. Overexpression of CD48 in <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells resulted in a substantial increase in the secretion of Granzyme B and Perforin by NK cells and restored the activity of NK cells and re-sensitized <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells to Dara treatment. These data suggest that KDM6A mediates Dara-mediated ADCC sensitivity through the dual regulation of CD38 and CD48. KDM6A acts to oppose the EZH2\/PRC2 complex by demethylating H3K27me3, and we found that Tazemetostat (Taze), an FDA-approved EZH2 inhibitor, increased the expression of CD38 and CD48, especially in <i>KDM6A<\/i>-KO cells. Importantly, Taze also restored the sensitivity of <i>KDM6A<\/i> KO cells to Dara-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity. In summary, our findings illuminate the dual role of KDM6A in enhancing the efficacy of Dara in MM. Imitating KDM6A function using an FDA-approved inhibitor holds promise in overcoming Dara resistance and improving patient outcomes in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Epigenetics,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Given lack of routine screening procedures, ovarian cancer patients are frequently diagnosed with late-stage disease that rapidly progress despite initial responses to front line therapy. PARPi and VEGFi targeted therapies have improved progression free survival in small subsets of patients but have largely failed to improve overall survival. Since the robust uptake of PARPis in the front line setting, resistance to this class of drugs is a growing problem. The literature is filled with many novel treatment approaches, but the vast majority fail to gain traction in pre-clinical models and early phase trials. A contributing factor to these disappointments relates to the prevalent use of 2D monoculture model systems that do not recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. To address this issue, we utilized the Rastrum 3D cell printer to grow ovarian cancer cells and PDX models in bio-functional matrices which provide optimal stiffness and extracellular matrix components specific to the ovarian tumor microenvironment. We found that ovarian cancer cells grown under these conditions exhibit dramatic up-regulation of the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway, including autocrine\/paracrine signaling factors, which correlated with increased sensitivity to JAK\/STAT inhibitors. This affect was lost when STAT1 and STAT3 knockout cell lines were grown in this 3D environment. Ovarian tumors are known to be rich in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We incorporated primary CAFs into this 3D culture system and found they could promote ovarian cancer cell growth only in cancer cells with intact JAK\/STAT signaling further indicating the essential role of this pathway in mediating tumor progression. Co-culture with M2 macrophages was also found to induce ovarian cancer cell growth, particularly in resistant models. Conversely, co-culture with M1 macrophages inhibited treatment na&#239;ve ovarian cancer cell growth but not resistant cell line growth. Single-cell RNAseq of the complex 3D cultures elucidated profound differences in the cross-talk between these cell types that is dependent on cancer cell sensitivity to standard-of-care agents. Finally, the addition of JAK\/STAT inhibitors was found to substantially alter this cross-talk between cell types and inhibit cancer cell viability. These data further implicate the importance of JAK\/STAT signaling, specifically in clinically relevant 3D models, in supporting ovarian cancer progression and response to chemotherapy and PARPi treatment. Ongoing studies are aimed at confirming these findings in pre-clinical mouse models and to elucidate the most effective JAK\/STAT inhibitors <i>in vivo<\/i> with the goal of informing the design of future clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Therapy resistance,JAK\/STAT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

While the development of targeted therapies (MAPK pathway inhibitors) led to a substantial improvement in overall survival of patients with melanoma harboring the BRAFV600E mutation, approximately 40% of treated patients acquire resistance and experience tumor recurrence after one year. Melanoma drug resistance is mediated by drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cell subpopulations present in tumors. DTP cells are either intrinsically rare sub-populations pre-existing prior to therapies, or adaptive sub-populations that acquire genetic and epigenetic alterations during treatments. Our lab has established six PDX models that responded to the treatment of BRAF\/MEK inhibitor combination then relapsed in six to 40 weeks. We combined cell lineage barcoding and single-cell transcriptomics to trace the emergence of DTP cells in melanoma recurrence. The recent development of cellular barcoding facilitates the labelling of tens to millions of cancer clones and enables the identification of the complex mechanisms associated with clonal fate in response to therapy and in different microenvironments. We have constructed a library of approximately 15 million barcodes into a lentiviral vector. Melanoma cells were infected with the barcode library to ensure each cell carried a unique barcode. Labelled melanoma cells were injected into NSG mice, which were then treated with BRAF\/MEK inhibitors, and they developed drug resistance with prolonged treatments. Treated tumors were harvested at different timepoints until relapse. The barcodes are localized close to the polyA tail of the expressed mRNA, the 3&#8217; end sequence of which could be retrieved simultaneously through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Thus, we can trace the clonal information from the relapsed tumor back to earlier timepoints such as the treatment naive tumor and minimal residual disease (MRD) stage. Our data showed that the diversity of barcodes in MRD stage had no significance compared to treatment naive tumor, while the diversity of barcodes in the relapsed tumor decreased around 10-fold from the MRD stage. The most dominant sub-populations in MRD arose from minor sub-populations in the treatment naive tumor, while most of the dominant sub-populations in the relapsed tumor were daughter cells from minor sub-populations in MRD stage. The top three sub-populations dominated 25% of the relapsed tumor. The three dominant drug-resistant sub-populations shared a similar phenotype shown by scRNAseq clusters. The data indicate that the heterogeneity of melanoma is maintained in the early treatment stage but is lost in acquired resistance. And the lineages of DTP cells change continuously under prolonged BRAF\/MEKi drug pressure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Drug resistance,Clonal evolution,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Treatment with mutant-selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies such as osimertinib, the current standard of care for metastatic EGFR-mutant LUAD, results in greater overall and progression-free survival. However, all patients eventually relapse. Uncovering the mechanisms driving primary and acquired resistance to osimertinib is therefore critical to improving disease management. Here, we use clinical genomic sequencing (n=47) and single-nucleus RNA (snRNA) sequencing (n=62) to profile a cohort of unmatched treatment-na&#239;ve (n=26), on-treatment (n=6), and post-treatment relapsed (n=30) EGFR-mutant LUADs treated with osimertinib. Relapsed tumors are marked by increased tumor mutation burden, along with elevated rates of genome doubling and loss-of-heterozygosity. We derived expression-based signatures of LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and applied them to tumor cells across our cohort. Relapsed tumors had a marked decrease in LUAD gene signature expression compared to untreated tumors and accompanying increases in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness markers, consistent with dedifferentiation. Notably, tumors harboring secondary mutations to EGFR, MET, or other MAPK pathway genes and showing sustained MAPK signaling retained a more differentiated state. Patients lacking these secondary on-target or bypass mutations were more likely to experience relapse with histological transdifferentiation, marked by complete loss of LUAD signatures, and accompanying increases in LUSC or SCLC signatures. Phenotype matching of tumor cells to normal cells from the developing fetal lung revealed enrichment of airway progenitor populations in non-histologically transformed treatment-resistant patients, in contrast to a proportion of late bud-tip and club-like epithelial cells which predominated in treatment-na&#239;ve samples. In rare cases, we observed subpopulations of basal stem-like progenitors in otherwise well-differentiated pre-treatment tumors. In summary, single-cell mapping of histological and developmental phenotypes has revealed divergent evolutionary trajectories during the acquisition of resistance to osimertinib, defined by MAPK signaling reactivation or by loss of LUAD identity and histological transformation respectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Single cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

On the other hand, in mutant NPM1 AML cells, wild type MLL1 is the main regulator of HOXA9, MEIS1 and FLT3, promoting self-renewal of myeloid progenitor cells. Menin inhibitors have been developed that disrupt the binding of Menin to MLL1 leading to reduced activity of HOXA9 and MEIS1 and repression of MLL1 or MLL1-FP target genes. Clinical trials have demonstrated that Menin inhibitors (MI) are well-tolerated and clinical remissions have been observed in patients with relapsed\/refractory AML harboring MLLr. Unfortunately, most patients either fail to respond or eventually relapse. MI-resistance in AML with MLL1r or mtNPM1 is either due to recently described mutations in the MI-binding domain of Menin or is non-genetic\/adaptive, due to dysregulated epigenome\/transcriptome\/proteome. In the present studies, through repeated shocks with LD<sub>90<\/sub> dosing of MI, followed by drug washout and recovery, we have generated MLL1r (MV4-11-MITR) and mtNPM1 (OCI-AML3-MITR) AML cell lines that are tolerant\/resistant (TR) to MI with LD<sub>50<\/sub> values greater than 1 &#956;M. Whole exome sequencing confirmed that these cells were lacking in new driver mutations. We determined that resistance in the MITR cells was not due to presence of hotspot mutations in Menin. ChIP-Seq analysis of H3K27Ac showed that the activities of super enhancers and core transcriptional regulatory circuitry was altered in both MITR cell types. Non-genetic\/adaptive resistance to MI also concordantly reduced genome wide ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq peaks in the OCI-AML3-MITR cells with significant depletion of MEIS1, IGF2BP2, BCL2, and PBX3, with concomitant induction of leukemia stem cell associated CLEC12A and CD244 expressions. A domain-specific CRISPR screen in MV4-11-MITR cells identified several druggable co-dependencies (e.g. EP300 and MOZ) and co-enrichments (SMARCA4, CREBBP and BRD4) with MI, suggesting them as potential mechanisms of non-genetic\/adaptive MI resistance. Consistent with these findings, co-treatment with SMARCA2\/SMARCA4 (chromatin remodeler ATPases) inhibitor FHD-286 and the BETi OTX015 or the MI SNDX-50469 exerted synergistic lethality in MV4-11-MITR and OCI-AML3-MITR cells as well as in PD MITR AML cells with MLL1r or mtNPM1. Co-treatment with CBP\/p300 inhibitor GNE049 or GNE781 was also synergistic with MI in these cells. In vivo treatment with FHD-286 and OTX015 or SNDX-5613 significantly reduced the AML burden in mice bearing OCI-AML3-MITR xenografts. These findings underscore preclinical activity of epigenetically-targeted agent-based combinations and highlight their promise in overcoming MI resistance in AML with MLL1r or mtNPM1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.
