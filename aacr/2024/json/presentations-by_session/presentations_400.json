Here, we report the interim results of a first large-scale prospective clinical study in an asymptomatic population with average risk of cancer, the JINLING Cohort (NCT06011694).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This ongoing prospective clinical study is enrolling participants aged between 45 and 75 years old without cancer-related symptoms, initiated in June 2022. Each participant will undergo peripheral blood collection for CanScan test and annual routine physical exams once a year for three consecutive years, with an additional two years of follow-up. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the CanScan test in the early detection of multiple cancers. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of TOO accuracy, its efficiency and clinical utility, lead-time relative to clinical diagnosis, and participants' attitudes and adherence to this test compared to standard care screening methods.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: By June 2023, a total of 3724 participants with analyzable samples were included in the analysis. At the data cut off time of Sept 2023, 29 participants were clinically diagnosed with cancer, including 8 that were not in the 13 targeted cancer types. The majority of the cancers were found in the early stages (Stage I or II; 89.6%, 26\/29). The CanScan test detected a cancer signal at a sensitivity of 55.2% (16\/29; stage I: 10\/21, 47.6%; stage II: 4\/5, 80.0%; stage III: 2\/3, 66.7%). For detected cancers, the prediction accuracy of the top predicted origin was 61.5% (95% CI [38.5%,84.6%]; stage I: 62.5% [5\/8]; stage II: 1\/3, 33.3%; stage III: 2\/2, 100%). The accuracy was 84.6% (95% CI [61.5%,100.0%]; I: 87.5% [7\/8]; II: 66.7% [2\/3]; III: 100.0% [2\/2]) when taking into account the top two predicted origins. Specificity was 97.9% (3619\/3695) in non-cancer participants.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: In this one-year interim analysis of the large-scale, prospective, clinical cohort study, we investigated the efficacy of the MCED test within an asymptomatic population with an average-risk of cancer. the CanScan test demonstrates capability in detecting a wide range of cancer types and predicting TOO at early stages, highlighting an exceptional level of sensitivity and accuracy while maintaining a high level of specificity. Therefore, the MCED test holds significant potential for early cancer screening in asymptomatic populations, potentially transforming preventative healthcare and improving patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Early detection,Liquid biopsies,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

It is thus important to understand detectability of PCa by MCED tests across the spectrum of disease aggressiveness, including detection of indolent disease.<br \/>Methods: PCa detectability by a targeted methylation-based MCED test that interrogates circulating cfDNA was assessed in 2 studies: 1) the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA, NCT02889978), a case-control study (Substudy 3) that demonstrated detection of a shared cancer signal across &#62; 50 cancer types and accurate prediction of cancer signal origin (CSO) with an observed false positive rate of 0.5%; and 2) PATHFINDER (PF, NCT04241796), a return of results cohort study in the intended use population without clinical suspicion of cancer. MCED test performance was assessed by Gleason grade group (GG) and clinical stage, and the association between tumor methylated fraction (TMeF) and cancer detectability was investigated.<br \/>Results: The CCGA3 study included 420 recently diagnosed PCa cases with a median age of 65 years (IQR, 59-70). Test sensitivity for PCa was 11.2% (47\/420), and CSO accuracy was 91.5% (43\/47). Median PSA was higher in detected cases (14 ng\/dL, IQR 7-38 vs 6 ng\/dL, IQR 5-9, p &#60; 0.05). The MCED test detected no low grade (GG1, 0\/58), 1.9% (3\/157) of favorable intermediate grade (GG2), 5.1% (4\/78) of unfavorable intermediate grade (GG3), and 31.9% (36\/113) of high grade (GG4 &#38; GG5) cancers. Clinical staging showed detection of 3.2% (3\/95) of Stage I, 4.7% (11\/235) of Stage II, 14.9% (7\/47) of Stage III, and 81.5% (22\/27) of Stage IV cases. Non-detected cases had better overall survival (HR 0.263, CI 0.104 - 0.533, p&#60;0.05), and detected cases had similar survival (HR 0.672, CI 0.323 - 1.21, p=0.2) compared to SEER estimates matched for age, stage and GG. Median TMeF was higher for detected cases (0.002106, IQR 0.000350 - 0.024376 vs 0.000024, IQR 0.00001 - 0.000038, p &#60; 0.05). Performance was similar in PF (median age 66 years, IQR 58 -70) with overall sensitivity for PCa of 5.9% (1\/17), including no (0\/12) detected GG1-2 cases and one of five GG3-5 cases. No Stage I or II (0\/15) and 1\/2 (50%) Stage III &#38; IV cases were detected.<br \/>Conclusion: In two independent prospective studies, this MCED test preferentially detected high grade, clinically significant PCa. A cancer signal detected test result with a prostate CSO prediction generally indicates the presence of aggressive PCa and should lead to a prompt diagnostic work-up. Use of this test in population-based screening programs is unlikely to exacerbate overdiagnosis of indolent PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cell-free DNA,Screening,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"B.

We searched PubMed to identify RCTs of cancer screening interventions published in English before January 20, 2023. Inclusion required that RCTs report, by study arm, numbers of cancer-specific deaths and cancer cases distinguishable between stages I-II vs. III-IV. Data extraction was done by 2 separate reviewers and included the numbers of cancer cases, deaths, and participants by study arm. For each trial, we calculated the percentage reduction in the cumulative (a) late-stage cancer incidence and (b) cancer-specific mortality between the intervention and control arms. We compared these two endpoints based on Pearson correlation coefficients, fixed-effects meta-analysis, and binary statistical significance.<br \/>Results: We analyzed 41 trials ranging in size from 2,500 to 409,000 participants. Correlation between the reduction in cancer-specific mortality vs. stage III-IV cancer was strong for lung (Pearson&#8217;s &#961;=0.92, n=12), breast (&#961;=0.70, n=6), and &#8216;other&#8217; cancers (&#961;=0.69, n=8) but weak for colorectal (&#961;=0.39, n=11) and prostate cancers (&#961;&#60;0, n=4). The overall correlation by fixed-effects meta-analysis across cancer types was 0.71 (95%CI=0.47-0.86) (<i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=0.55). In larger trials, there was a smaller deviation between the observed reduction in cancer-specific mortality and that predicted, by cancer type, based on the trial&#8217;s reduction in stage III-IV cancer (p=0.02). Of 12 trials demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in stage III-IV cancer incidence (p&#60;0.05), 5 also showed reduced cancer-specific mortality (42%).<br \/>Conclusions: In screening RCTs, reductions in late-stage cancer vs. cancer-specific mortality are correlated, but with important differences by cancer type.

A carefully selected cohort of 3076 cancer patients representing 13 cancer types, in addition to 3477 healthy controls, were pre-specified into the training and internal validation sets to train and internally validate the models to assess cancer and tissue of origin (TOO). The classifier was trained to a target specificity of 99% and locked before analysis of the independent validation set. The independent validation was enrolled prospectively and consists of 1465 participants (cancer: n= 732; non-cancer: n= 733).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The performance metrics in the internal validation set demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection were 0.865 (95% CI [0.840, 0.887]) and 0.989 (95% CI [0.980, 0.994]), respectively. These impressive results were further substantiated in the independent validation set, where the overall sensitivity and specificity were found to be 0.874 (95% CI [0.848, 0.897]) and 0.978 (95% CI [0.965, 0.987]) respectively.

The Focused approach targets specific cancers and populations lacking adequate screening, emphasizing high sensitivity. The Broad approach aims to detect various cancers in the population, prioritizing high specificity to minimize false-positives but potentially compromising sensitivity. The public health impact and testing burden of these approaches remain unexplored.<br \/>Methods: Projected cancer mortality reduction and annual test volumes are based on published data for liquid biopsy tests. Focused screening is modeled for patients not undergoing guideline-recommended screening for lung, liver, and colorectal cancers. Broad screening is modeled for individuals aged 50-80, assuming the detection of all cancer types. Averted deaths are calculated by combining published mortality reduction estimates or assumed at 20% if not available. Reductions are adjusted for reported test sensitivities. Liquid biopsy cannot prevent deaths from cancers recommended for screening if the person has already undergone the recommended test.<br \/>Results: Focused and broad screening strategies annually prevented around 20,000 cancer deaths. Focused screening necessitated testing only one-fifth of the people compared to broad screening (30MM vs. 150MM). The projected reduction in mortality for focused testing relied entirely on randomized studies, while the equivalent statistic for the broad strategy was 53%.<br \/>Conclusions: Equivalent reductions in cancer deaths can be achieved with focused screening at high sensitivity and broad screening at high specificity, with only one-fifth of the testing burden. The influence of false positives in focused testing and false reassurance in broad testing may impact these findings, which could also be influenced by testing and follow-up costs.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7FA47D47-2863-4C01-B67B-2C109296B607}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Annual cancer deaths averted (thousands)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Focused cancer testing<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Broad cancer testing<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10-12<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4-8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Liver<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ee9d64e1-7fff-7d65-3152-8c12c38bae1a\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;

In the US, a significant portion of cancers are still detected at a late stage, for example, 32.1% of breast cancer, 45.5% of lung cancer, 22.8% of colon cancer patients were diagnosed at advanced stage. Early detection is challenging because many cancers are asymptomatic in early stages, although cancer screening can detect cancer before symptoms emerge. Current standard-of-care screening programs are limited and directed to single types of cancer. Non-invasive multi-cancer early detection (MCED) is urgently needed because it can screen for several cancer types with a single blood test, increasing cancer screening coverage while avoiding cumulative false positive rates.<br \/>Developmental MCED approaches usually rely on detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumors. However, ctDNA signals scale with tumor burden limiting sensitivity and specificity, particularly for early-stage cancers, while also limiting applicability to precision oncology.<br \/>Here we report a MCED approach with superior sensitivity and specificity, which can also be used to predict treatment response. We introduce a novel strategy for detecting cancers from blood plasma, profiling the immune response to disease development rather than relying on detection of emerging diseased tissue. The platform is designed to detect alterations in the ratio of immunoglobulins and albumin, as well as class-switching among immunoglobulins, by measuring the overall concentration of amino acid residues incorporated into proteins in patient plasma. By using our biorthogonal chemistry labeling tool, we were able to measure and characterize amino acid concentration signatures (AACS) within the neat blood samples, including cysteine, free cysteine, lysine, tryptophan and tyrosine, which allowed us to observe distinct signatures for varying cancers including breast, prostate, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. We could identify 84% of cancers with &#60;0.5% false positive rate (N=93). In this study, cancer AACS signatures were distinct from signatures measured with non-cancerous immune activation, including autoimmune diseases and infection.<br \/>Moreover, AACS was also correlated to clinical features, such as cancer metastatic statuses and therapy response. With Cyclin-dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors-treated advanced breast cancer patients as an example, we achieved 100% correct prediction of responding patients and 91.7% accurate predictions of non-responding patients by using AACS in treatment-na&#239;ve samples.<br \/>Altogether, the novel AACS approach is a powerful combination of bioorthogonal chemistry and machine learning analysis in clinical practice, and it can be potentially used for cancer screening and support clinical decisions for treatment selection and patient stratification in new indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Chemistry,Machine learning,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Unfortunately, many established cancer screening methods are not suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to cost, complexity, and dependency on extensive medical infrastructure. Nearly 10,000 participants (2003 cancer cases and 7888 non-cancer cases) were divided into one training and five independent validation cohorts across different races, sample types and platforms. One tube of peripheral blood was collected from each participant and quantified using a panel of seven protein tumor markers (PTMs) consisting of AFP, CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, CA72-4, CEA and CYFRA 21-1 by common clinical immunoassay analyzers. An algorithm named OncoSeek was established using artificial intelligence (AI) to distinguish cancer cases from non-cancer cases by calculating the probability of cancer (POC) index based on the quantification of the seven PTMs and clinical information including sex and age, and to predict the possible affected tissue of origin (TOO). The conventional clinical method that relied only on a single threshold for each PTM would make a big problem when combining the results of those markers as the false positive rate would accumulate as the number of markers increased. Nevertheless, OncoSeek was empowered by AI to significantly reduce the false positive rate, increasing the specificity from 54.0% to 93.0%. The overall sensitivity of OncoSeek was 51.7%, resulting in 84.6% accuracy. The performance was consistent in the training and the five validation cohorts from three countries (Brazil, China and United States) including two sample types (plasma and serum) and three different platforms (Roche, Luminex and ELISA). The sensitivities ranged from 39.0% to 77.6% for the detection of the nine common cancer types (breast, colorectum, liver, lung, lymphoma, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas and stomach), which account for 59.2% of global cancer deaths annually. Furthermore, it has shown excellent sensitivity in several high-mortality cancer types for which there are lacking routine screening tests in the clinic, such as the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer was 77.6%. The overall accuracy of TOO prediction in the true positives was 65.4%, which could assist the clinical diagnostic workup. OncoSeek significantly outperforms the conventional clinical method, representing a novel blood-based test for multicancer early detection (MCED) that is non-invasive, easy, efficient and robust. Moreover, the accuracy of TOO facilitates the follow-up diagnostic workup. OncoSeek is affordable (~$20) and accessible requiring nothing more than a blood draw at the screening sites, which makes it adoptable in LMICs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,multicancer early detection,protein tumour markers,artificial intelligence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
