[{"Abstract":"Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of death among women and has disproportionately higher rates of mortality in certain racial groups, including Asian Americans (AA). While differences in BC mortality between AA and other racial groups have been identified, few studies have disaggregated nationwide AA mortality data.<br \/>Methods: Using National Vital Statistics System mortality data, BC-related deaths were analyzed among AA groups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipina, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese), Native Hawiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs), and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) from 2005-2020. We calculated cancer proportional mortality ratios (PMRs), age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs), standard mortality ratios, and used JoinPoint regression for average annual percentage change (AAPC).<br \/>Results: Among 13677 AA, 522 NHPI, 501282 NHW descendants, 14.3% cancer deaths were due to BC. PMRs increased for all racial groups except Filipina. AAMRs significantly decreased in NHWs (AAPC -1.61; CI -1.70 to -1.48) while significantly increasing for aggregate AAs (AAPC 0.45; CI 0.08 to 0.94). Among AAs, Filipinas had the highest AAMR. AAMRs significantly increased for Asian Indians (AAPC 2.05; CI 1.20 to 3.46), Filipinas (AAPC 0.61; CI 0.15 to 1.46), Koreans (AAPC 2.72; CI 1.57 to 4.65) and Vietnamese women (AAPC 3.63; CI 2.26 to 6.20), but significantly decreased for Japanese (AAPC -1.41; CI -2.22 to -0.53).<br \/>Conclusions: We observed heterogenous and converging BC mortality trends across AA groups. These trends elucidate which populations within the broader AA group have disproportionately higher death rates and therefore should be targeted for BC prevention protocols (e.g., Asian Indian and Filipina). Identifying such trends can also help elucidate disparities in cancer care and the overall social determinants that affect women with BC. Understanding disaggregated trends can inform more inclusive screening practices and culturally tailored interventions and treatments to reduce BC deaths in vulnerable populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Mortality,Asian American,Disaggregation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Race was collected by patient self-report and chart review. Symptom burden (fatigue, pain, and physical functioning) was measured by the PROMIS-29 Profile v 2.0). Area deprivation was measured using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Linear mixed models were used to assess racial differences in symptom burden across timepoints, and changes in symptom burden over time, adjusting for ADI.<br \/>Results: A total of 147 patients participated in this study (36% Black and 64% white).<br \/>Pain: Black patients reported significantly higher pain scores than White patients at pretherapy (MD=3.7, p=.034), midpoint (MD=5.8, p: 0.002), and endpoint (MD=7.8, p&#60;.001). Even after adjusting for area deprivation, this disparity persisted (F(1, 390)=29.43, p&#60;.001), with Black patients having higher pain scores at midpoint (MD=4.7, p: 0.02) and endpoint (MD=7.8, p&#60;.001). Pain scores worsened over time for Black patients, increasing significantly by the end of chemotherapy (MD<sub>T1-T3<\/sub> =6.2, p=.010; MD<sub>T2-T3<\/sub>=5.8, p=.024). No significant changes in pain scores were observed over time among White patients.<br \/>Fatigue: After adjusting for area deprivation, fatigue significantly increased at the endpoint (MD<sub>T1-T3<\/sub>=8.9, p&#60;.001) for Black patients. Among White patients, fatigue increased at midpoint (MD<sub>T1-T2<\/sub>=5.7) and continued to worsen at the endpoint (MD<sub>T1-T3<\/sub>=10.1, p&#60;.001; MD<sub>T2-T3<\/sub>=4.3, p=.017).<br \/>Physical Function: Black patients had significantly lower physical function than White patients at the midpoint (MD=4.0, p=.027). By the end of chemotherapy, physical function deteriorated significantly for Black patients (MD<sub>T1-T3<\/sub>=7.8, p&#60;.001), and White patients (MD<sub>T1-T3<\/sub>=7.7, p&#60;.001; MD<sub>T2-T3<\/sub>=4.8, p=.002). Correlations between the ADI and symptom severity and physical function revealed that living in more deprived areas was associated with greater pain severity (r=-.227, p=.002, 56.3 vs. 50.1) and worse physical function (r=-.190, p=-.035, 40.6 vs. 42.4) at the completion of chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: The findings indicate that race and area deprivation are associated with symptom trajectories over the course of ESBC chemotherapy. Further research is warranted on how to best assess and relieve symptom burden among Black ESBC patients so that existing disparities in treatment and treatment outcomes are not perpetuated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Race,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

While an association between social determinants of health and breast cancer disparity has already been established, there is emerging evidence for genetic ancestry dependent variability in normal breast biology impacting breast cancer biology and potentially outcome. Tumor biology studies in the context of genetic ancestry and disparity have often focused on intrinsic properties of tumor cells or tumor infiltrating immune cells. However, other stromal cell types have received very little attention. Through immunohistochemistry of breast tissues from healthy women of African and European ancestry and primary cell culturing system, we had previously demonstrated enrichment of a stromal cell population called PZP cells (<u>P<\/u>ROCR+\/<u>Z<\/u>EB1+\/<u>P<\/u>DGFRA+) with mesenchymal stem-like and fibroadipogenic properties in the normal breast tissues of women of African ancestry. In this study, we used single nuclei ATAC-seq and\/or RNA-seq to further characterize stromal fibroblasts in the breast tissues of women of Ashkenazi Jewish-European, European, Indigenous American, Hispanic-European, African, and Asian ancestry. Among eight fibroblast cell clusters generated from women of African and European ancestry, only three cell clusters overlapped between two groups. While Complement Factor D (CFD, also called adipsin) expression was observed in unique fibroblast clusters of African ancestry, the expression of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) was enriched in clusters unique to European ancestry. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated African ancestry-specific genomic variants for CFD linked to cardiometabolic disorders. Additional genes that showed genetic ancestry dependent variability in expression within fibroblasts include ABCA10, ABCA9, ABCA8, NEGR1 (enriched in African ancestry), MMP16, MAGI1, KIAA1217, PTPRK and SEMA5A (enriched in European ancestry). NEGR1 (Neuronal Growth Regulator 1) is a trans-neural growth promoting factor, whereas PTPRK (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type K) is a negative regulator of EGFR signaling. These results suggest genetic ancestry dependent variability in stromal-epithelial cell communications under normal and cancerous conditions. These genetic ancestry dependent differences could impact intracellular signaling networks in epithelial cells with consequential effects on cancer incidence, mutation patterns, drug sensitivity, and outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Gene expression,Single cell,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"P.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and disproportionately affects BRCA1 mutation carriers and young black women. Black\/African American (AA) patients have the highest mortality and the shortest survival of any racial\/ethnic group in the US. Persistent cancer racial disparities remain due to a variety of risk factors. The SEER\/CDC data show an 8% lower breast cancer incidence rate and a 41% higher mortality rate in Black\/AA patients compared to their white counterparts.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Chart review was conducted using Sentara MD Office\/EPIC and VOA iKnowMedicine portals to update tumor relapse, metastasis, and survival in 577 TNBC patients. Supported by strong evidence in developmental, evolutionary, and cancer biology, we hypothesize<i> <\/i>that persistent EGFR\/K-RAS\/SIAH pathway activation is a major driving force of TNBC malignancy, racial disparity, early relapse, and high mortality.

Encouraged by our preliminary data, we aim to develop a SIAH-centered biomarker panel by measuring the EGFR\/K-RAS\/SIAH pathway activation (ON)\/inactivation (OFF), and use SIAH as a new prognostic biomarker to risk stratify patients, detect cancer racial disparities, forecast tumor relapse, and predict patient survival at 1<sup>st<\/sup>-line neoadjuvant settings.

Further studies showed this is especially true for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Premenopausal AA women (AAW) have a lower prevalence of breastfeeding and a higher incidence of TNBC and mortality. Our previous study compares short-term breastfeeding, abrupt involution (AI) with prolonged breastfeeding called gradual involution (GI), revealing that AI alone induces ductal hyperplasia four months postpartum. Our current investigation delves into early events during AI <i>versus<\/i> GI, employing a comprehensive approach encompassing histology, gene expression, and myeloid cell involvement.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Utilizing FVB female mice, we conducted a comparative analysis of AI and GI. AI involved early pup removal, while GI was achieved through staggered weaning. The evaluation included analysis of histomorphology, gene\/protein expression, and myeloid cell infiltration. Sequential mammary gland (MG) changes were monitored through H&#38;E staining, TUNEL assay, and DNA damage analysis. 3D-organoid cultures of luminal progenitors (LPs) were employed to assess the impact of AI <i>versus<\/i> GI. qRT-PCR, IHC, Western blot, and flow cytometry\/multiplex imaging were employed for the differential expression analysis of molecular and cellular factors associated with AI\/GI.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our research showed that AI had early adipocyte repopulation, rapid cell death, DNA repair, and myeloid cell infiltration, resulting in a chronically inflamed microenvironment. In contrast, the GI triggers a controlled immune response and prolonged cell death, facilitating comprehensive remodeling of the MG. Our flow cytometric or multiplexing imaging analyses revealed that AI-affected glands exhibit an enrichment of CCL9-producing CD206+ M2-like macrophages and CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, exogenous CCL9 treatment on LPs in 3D-organoid culture results in disorganized acinar-type organoids, mirroring morphological differences observed in LPs from AI mammary glands on day56 PPM. Further analysis of CCL9 treated organoids revealed the expansion of Esr1- LPs population in <i>ex-vivo<\/i> organoid culture which might indicate an increase in the putative cells of origin of TNBC.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our studies comparing AI and GI demonstrate that AI is producing a pro-tumorigenic environment in the breast. It is important to note that prolonged breastfeeding protects the breast, although this cannot be a singular risk factor for TNBC.

This disparity persists even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, tumor biology, and quality of care. The study aims to unravel specific molecular mechanisms underlying this disparity, with a focus on Hedgehog signaling pathways in premenopausal NHB women. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches to address these health disparities. Our research utilized a unique cohort of NHB and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women who underwent breast reduction surgery at the Mayo Clinic and donated breast tissue samples for our study. We isolated RNA from whole tissue sections from a cohort of 12 NHB and 40 NHW women who were parous and premenopausal at time of surgery. We performed gene expression profiling using NanoString BC360 and IO360 assays. This allowed us to identify a distinct gene expression signature characteristic of basal-like\/TNBC and indicative of heightened activity in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. We also employed advanced cell culture techniques to generate tissue organoids and subculture human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that preserve the intrinsic characteristics of the original tissue samples. We found that significantly differential expression of IL20RA and SOX10, principal factors in the gene expression signature, were preserved in both the derived organoids and the HMECs. These results suggest a potential intrinsic difference in the activation of the Hedgehog pathway in the breast epithelial cells of NHB women. This activation may contribute to increased proliferation and transformation of basal stem cells within the breast, possibly fueling the development and progression of TNBC. The implication of activated Hedgehog signaling in NHB women opens new avenues for understanding TNBC disparities. IL20RA and SOX10 represent potential biomarkers for TNBC risk that may serve as a stratification tool for NHB women. The results of this study have the potential to improve assessment and management of TNBC risk among NHB women, thereby contributing significantly to reducing health disparities in breast cancer outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Hedgehog,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Adopting a lipidomic approach has revealed sex-specific differences in lipid species but whether there are racial differences in lipid profiles remain unexplored. As a result, we investigated differences in lipid species between Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) vs Non-Hispanic White (NHW) women.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b>:<\/b> We performed lipidomic profiling on 705 premenopausal women who were recruited during their annual screening mammogram at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO. A total of 982 lipid species were profiled at Metabolon (Durham, NC&#174;). 125 lipid species missing in 300 or more women were excluded from the analysis. For the remaining missing values, we employed the nearest neighbor method for imputation. We investigated the race-differentiating lipid species concentrations using linear regression models, adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). To satisfy the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity, we log-transformed the lipid concentrations before performing regression analyses. The linear regression coefficients were then back-transformed as percentage differences. We accounted for multiple testings by applying the Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was defined as a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value &#60; 10<sup>-<\/sup><sup>5<\/sup>.

Puerto Rico (PR) has the highest age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer in the U.S. High-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) have been identified as common causative agents of CC. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of High-Risk HPV (HR-HPV) genotypes among a clinic-based sample of 368 HIV-negative women using a high-resolution approach. We used baseline data from IRB protocol 10510114. Cervical swabs underwent genomic DNA extractions followed by typification of HPV genotypes using a short-polymerase chain reaction-fragment assay (SPF10-LiPA) which detects 14 mucosal HR-HPV types (LiPA-25); 10 types (8 HR and 2LR) included in the 9-valent vaccine and 13 others not included on it. This process uses SPF10 primers to amplify a 65 bp fragment of the L1 open reading frame of HPV, followed by a reverse-hybridizationfor specific HPV genotypes by comparing the results to standardized kit controls. Cervical cytology was acquired for all participants. Data was collected from 186 women negative to intraepithelial lesions (NILM), 65 with low-grade lesions (LGSIL), 23 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and 94 with high-grade lesions (HGSIL).Among study results, the prevalence of any HR-HPV infection was high overall (~71.5%) and higher in women who had either LGSIL or HGSIL. The top leading HR types detected were 51 (20.4%), 16 (18.5%), 52 (13.60%), 33 (13.00%) and 56 (11.00%, with other types including HPVs 35,39, 68 or 59.Nearly 34.00% of the identified cervical HR-HPV types, are not included in the 9-valent vaccine. The most common HPV types in HGSIL, included HR HPV types 16 (30.9%), 52 (18.10%), 51 (14.9%) and 33 (10.60%). In this group, only 35.20% were HPV16\/18. The other 64.80% were other HR-HPV types and, based on the ASCCP guidelines, would not require a colposcopy, and could be observed in one year. Among these HGSIL (n=94) 48.9% of the HPV types were not included in the vaccine. HPV 51 was the most dominant in ASCUS (26.10%), LGSIL (20%), and women who were negative for intraepithelial lesions (NILM 22.6%). Additionally, the most prevalent HPV-HR serotypes across all cytology categories in the vaccinated cohort were 52 (11.14%), 16 (8.02%) and 31 (7.56%), whereas in the non-vaccinated cohort were HPV 16 (20.6%), 51 (17.55%), 33 (13.33%), 52 (12.29%), and 56 (11.94%).In conclusion, the high burden of other high-risk types not covered by the vaccine in women with high-grade lesions suggests that delaying immediate colposcopy might limit the identification of cervical lesions. Even though this is not a population-based study, the high prevalence of these other HR-HPV types calls for their inclusion in future generations of the vaccine.<br \/><i>Study sponsored<\/i> <i>by<\/i> <i>2U54MD007600-36 (8538) <\/i><i>Research Centers in Minority Institutions of the University of Puerto Rico <\/i><i>(NIH\/NIMHD).<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

We explored the spatial distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (&#8220;HR-HPV&#8221;) infection across 23 Chicago Community Areas (CCAs) served by the University of Illinois Health Network (UI Health). Using a modified Warnecke et al Health Disparity Outcomes (HDO) model, we hypothesized that CCAs with higher rates of structural violence, the social, economic, and political systems exposing populations to risks and vulnerabilities, would correlate with increased HR-HPV.<br \/>Methods: Electronic medical records of patients receiving routine cervical cancer screening between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were reviewed. As per the 2014 ACS guidelines. HR-HPV test results were captured as HR-HPV positive, HR-HPV-16, HR-HPV-18 and non-16\/18 HR-HPV, the latter consisting of 12 HR-HPV subtypes. Structural violence variables were used from Chicago Health Atlas (2015-2019) with percent poverty, hardship index score, easy access to fruit and vegetables, routine checkup, homicide, and primary care provider across CCAS. Univariate Poisson regression was used to compare the associations between selected structural violence factors and HR-HPV prevalence. Univariate multinomial logistic regression evaluated associations between structural violence indicators and HR-HPV subtypes Global p-values were obtained using ANOVA at 0.05 significance.<br \/>Results: 8,566 women met inclusion criteria out of 13,466 total women. 75% were Black or Hispanic. Overall prevalence of cervical HR-HPV infection was 20.3% (n=1,737), ranging from 8.7% to 27.2% across CCAs. Median age for women was 36. Percent with primary care provider was negatively associated with HPV infection (IRR = 0.99 with 95% CI (0.98, 1.00), adjusted p-value=0.023), indicating women living in CCAs with higher rates of primary care provider were less likely to have HR-HPV. Easy access to fruit and vegetables (adjusted p-value = 0.007) and percent with primary care provider (adjusted p-value = 0.009) were significantly associated with HR-HPV subtypes. Women living in CCAs with easy access to fruit and vegetables (OR = 0.99, with 95% CI (0.98,0.99)) as well as those with higher rates of primary care provider (OR = 0.98, with 95% CI (0.97,0.99)) were less likely to have non-16\/18 HR-HPV.<br \/>Conclusion: HR-HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and most women clear the infection naturally. As the origin of 99% of cervical cancer, understanding the reasons HR-HPV persists and progresses to cancer among certain individuals and groups is critical. Novel interventions like increasing access to fruit and vegetables could compliment widely available and effective vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Cervical cancer,Race,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

The incidence rates of cervical cancer have increased in Indiana from 7.8 in 2008-2012 to 8.4 in 2013-2017. In 2020, the screening rate for cervical cancer among women in Indiana was 76% when compared to a national average of 78%. Women diagnosed at earlier stages for cervical cancer had higher relative survival of 0.98 than those diagnosed at later stages with a relative survival of 0.43. Health insurance status is an important determinant for health outcomes for patients with cancer. This study aims to assess the extent to which health insurance coverage is a contributing factor to the stage of cervical cancer diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: We examined reported cases of cervical cancer among women (N=2518) using cervical cancer registry data from the Indiana State Department of Health from 2011-2019. Using multinomial logistic regression model, we examined the associations of both race\/ethnicity and insurance status with stage of diagnosis after adjusting for age at diagnosis.<br \/>Results: In this sample, the average age at diagnosis was 48.98 years (SD = 14.98). The largest proportion of the sample was between 45 to 64 years of age (41.7%), Non-Hispanic White (85.5%), had private insurance coverage (41.8%), had cervix uteri, NOS as the primary site of diagnosis (76.5%), lived in a metropolitan area (74.5%) and had squamous cell carcinoma (73.4%). The largest percentage of Non-Hispanic White patients had private insurance (50.9%), whereas the largest percentage of Black patients had Medicaid (39.3%). 20.2% of Hispanic patients were uninsured when compared to 7.7% Non-Hispanic White and 3.6% Black patients. The multivariate analysis shows that women who are uninsured (OR = 2.475) and those who have Medicaid (OR = 2.321) were significantly more likely to be diagnosed at the regional stage than the in-situ stage compared to women with private insurance. Additionally, women who are uninsured (OR = 4.432) and those who have Medicaid (OR = 3.007) were significantly more likely to be diagnosed at the distant stage than in-situ, compared to women with private insurance.<br \/>Conclusion: The findings show that insurance status is associated with the stage of diagnosis for cervical cancer and detection at regional or distant stages often leads to higher morbidity. Impact - Increased coverage for routine cervical cancer screening and preventive care services is recommended, especially for uninsured women and women with public insurance such as Medicaid or Medicare.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Cancer detection,Cancer registry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Background: Research studies have examined the risk factors associated with gynecologic cancers, specifically cervical, ovarian, and endometrial, incidence and mortality. In addition to older age, Black\/African American race, living in south, less income, less education, having comorbidity, stages of cancer, and lack of insurance have reported as risk factors for the incidence and mortality of gynecologic cancers. In addition, prior studies reported the possible effects from the distance to cancer care facilities on gynecologic cancer outcomes indicated varying results. In this study, we explore the impact of distance travelled by region and treatment facility on gynecologic cancer outcomes. Methods: This study aims to assess five-year cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer survival. Data were obtained from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) years 2004-2017, only from patients with a minimum 5-year follow-up. Women with races other than White or Black were excluded from the study. Demographics, region, treatment center type, distance to the treatment center, and cancer stage at diagnosis were analyzed by cancer type and 5-year survival status. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between distance travelled to treatment facility by region and five-year survival. SAS version 9.4 was used for statistical analysis. Results: The distribution of the demographics across the three cancers were similar. Multivariate logistic models showed significant interactions between facility type and region on five-year survival among cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancer patients. Risk factors varied by region and treatment facility type. Age and cancer stage were significantly associated with survival among all cancers. Distance was significantly associated with survival in cervical and endometrial cancers. Conclusion: Cervical cancer patients in the South Atlantic who travel longer distances to Academic\/Research Programs have poorer survival. Likewise, patients with endometrial cancer who live in New England region, and travel longer distances to Integrated Network Cancer Programs, as well as those who live in the West North Central region and travel longer distances to Community Cancer Programs have poorer survival. Further research is warranted to explore the specifics of region and treatment center types among different cancers to get a better understanding of the risk factors. Moreover, to improve the clinical outcomes, further study is needed to aim to identify which of these factors are actionable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Endometrial cancer,Ovarian cancer,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Notably, Black patients have a higher incidence and mortality compared to their White counterparts. However, low representation of Black and Hispanic patients in cancer genomics studies hampers our understanding of genomic factors contributing to differential outcomes. Furthermore, comparisons between racial groups fail to capture differences in genomic ancestry. We studied the associations between genetic ancestry and race\/ethnicity categories with mutational profiles, using a large, diverse real-world pancreatic cancer cohort. We analyzed 9,274 de-identified pancreatic cancer patients (8,483 with ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) who underwent tumor profiling with the Tempus xT 648-gene assay. We used 654 ancestry-informative markers to estimate continental ancestry for five regions: Africa (AFR), Americas (AMR), East Asia (EAS), Europe (EUR), and South Asia (SAS). We imputed Asian (ASN, n=431), Hispanic\/Latino\/Native American (HLN, n=593), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB, n=875) and Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n=7,309) categories from genetic ancestry using a previously published machine learning method. Associations between either race\/ethnicity categories or ancestry proportions and somatic variants (copy number alterations or CNAs, small nonsynonymous, OncoKB L1\/2 &#38; R1, and predicted driver somatic mutations using boostDM) were assessed for 172 pancreatic cancer-related genes or gene sets using logistic regression models. Models with and without race\/ethnicity or ancestry terms were compared with likelihood ratio (LR) tests, and p-values were adjusted to control the FDR at 5%. We tested for associations of race\/ethnicity groups with TMB using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Tests of TMB and small variants used only patients with available matched normal tissue to avoid artifacts from misclassification of germline variants. Among pancreatic cancer patients, having either a CNA or small nonsynonymous mutation in a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene (<i>ERBB2, EGFR, MET, FGFR1<\/i>) was associated with genetic ancestry (LR adjusted p=0.027). Specifically, AMR ancestry was positively associated (OR=1.08 per doubling of ancestry proportion, p=0.004) and EUR negatively associated (OR=0.93, p=0.002). Associations in PDAC were similar but not significant. Race\/ethnicity was associated with RTK changes in both groups, with ASN and HLN having more mutations than NHW, but the associations were not significant after correcting for multiple hypotheses. There was no association of race\/ethnicity and TMB .Somatic changes in RTK genes were associated with AMR genetic ancestry; however, despite the relatively large cohort size, these results are modest, suggesting there is not a large somatic mutation component contributing to differences in pancreatic cancer outcomes by ancestry.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Pancreatic cancer,Somatic mutations,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"B.

Like prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), they localize to the tumor cell surface and are potential theranostics targets. ENO autoantibodies were reported by our group in prostate cancer (PCa) patients but their immunoreactivity to ENO1\/2 isoforms was not defined. Differential ENO immunoreactivity in docetaxel-resistant (DR) PCa cells between African American (AA) and European American (EA) PCa patients was also reported. Our objective was to investigate the role of ENO isoforms in the race-related differential ENO immunoreactivity of PCa patients.<br \/>METHODS: PCa patient sera (41 AA, 68 EA) were obtained from Loma Linda University Biospecimen Laboratory. Western blotting (WB) analysis, using patient sera and monoclonal antibodies to ENO1 and ENO2, was done against lysates from docetaxel-sensitive (DS) and DR PCa cell lines and against recombinant (rec) ENO1 and ENO2 to assess ENO isoform expression and detect ENO autoantibodies. Scratch-wound assay was performed to evaluate AA and EA anti-ENO driven inhibition of DR PCa cell migration. Student&#8217;s T-test and Chi-squared analyses were performed with p&#60;0.05 deemed significant.<br \/>RESULTS: ENO1 expression was robust in all assessed DS and DR cell lines. ENO2 was detected in DS cells but was significantly reduced in DR cells. PSMA expression was lost in cells expressing ENO1 and neuroendocrine markers. Anti-ENO EA sera reacted in WB with the expected 50 kD band in both DS and DR PCa cells, but anti-ENO AA sera reacted preferentially with this band in DS cells. Strong immunoreactivity was noted against recENO1 in AA and EA sera (7% vs 28%, p&#60;0.01) and against recENO2 in AA and EA sera (24% vs 35%, p=0.23). EA, but not AA, ENO autoantibodies significantly inhibited DR cell migration, and their pre-absorption with recENO1 diminished this inhibitory effect.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies to ENO1 and ENO2 were identified in EA and AA PCa patient sera. Weaker ENO1 immunoreactivity was seen in sera from AA PCa patients, corresponding with weaker inhibition of DR PCa cell migration compared to EA patient sera. Unlike PSMA and ENO2, ENO1 expression was robust in neuroendocrine-like DR PCa cell lines. Future studies will correlate the presence of ENO autoantibodies with clinicopathologic parameters in a larger patient cohort. Defining mechanisms underlying the race-related differential ENO immunoreactivity may identify novel biological determinants of PCa health disparities and uncover the theranostic potential of tumor surface ENO1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Theranostics,Tumor antigen,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

These disparities partially stem from environmental, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors. Recent data highlight racial differences in prostate cancer molecular profiles, with tumors from Black men showing increased <i>SPOP<\/i> and decreased <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations and amplified androgen receptor signaling and inflammatory pathway activations. Thus, somatic mutation patterns may also contribute to these disparities. We sought to identify associations of mutational profiles in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) with genetic ancestry instead of race and ethnicity categories, analyzing a de-identified cohort of 5,959 patients who underwent the Tempus xT 648-gene NGS tumor profiling test. We used 654 ancestry-informative markers to estimate genetic ancestry by calculating similarity to reference populations for five regions: Africa (AFR), Americas (AMR), East Asia (EAS), Europe (EUR), and South Asia (SAS). Associations between genetic ancestry proportions and somatic variants were assessed for 67 PRAD-related genes using logistic regression models. Analyses included copy number alterations (CNAs), oncogenic gene fusions, small splice and non-synonymous mutations (NS), OncoKB L1\/2 &#38; R1, and small missense driver somatic mutations predicted with boostDM. Likelihood ratio tests were employed to compare models with and without ancestry terms. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was utilized to adjust p-values and control the FDR at 5%. We confirmed reported associations in PRAD between AFR ancestry and <i>SPOP <\/i>NS mutations (OR=1.03 per doubling of AFR ancestry proportion, p=0.03) and decreased AFR with <i>PIK3CA <\/i>OncoKB and driver mutations (OR=0.94, p=0.02), <i>PTEN <\/i>CNAs (OR=0.95, p=0.0001), and <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusions (OR=0.95, p&#60;0.0001). However, we also observed negative associations between AFR and <i>AR <\/i>CNAs (OR=0.95, p=0.004), EAS and <i>PTEN<\/i> CNAs (OR=0.96, p=0.01), and EAS and <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusions (OR=0.97, p=0.02). Additionally, a negative association was found between EAS and <i>TP53<\/i> driver NS mutations (OR=0.96, p=0.04), while positive associations with driver mutations in <i>FOXA1<\/i> (OR=1.06, p=0.03) and NS mutations in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway genes (OR=1.04, p=0.01) were noted. Lastly, we identified novel positive associations between AMR and driver mutations in <i>PIK3C3A<\/i> (OR=1.12, p=0.0003) as well as small NS mutations or CNAs in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway genes (OR=1.03, p=0.04). By analyzing a large, diverse real-world cohort and leveraging NGS-inferred genetic ancestry, our study confirms known associations between somatic alterations in PRAD cancer genes and race and ethnicity, while unveiling novel associations in understudied populations of potential significance for understanding disparities in disease outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Prostate cancer,Somatic mutations,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Clinically, BA face diagnosis at younger age with worse clinical outcomes. Stromal cells adjacent to the tumor, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), play a critical role in tumorigenesis of PCa. Dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment play a crucial role in mediating prostate cancer tumorigenesis and is emerging as a key target for cancer therapy in solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: To investigate whether DNA methylation varies in tumor adjacent stroma (TAS) among PCa patients with different geographical ancestries, areas immediate adjacent to tumor (i.e., less than 1mm) removed for methylation analysis. A complete genome-wide DNA methylation of PCa stroma using 17 BA and 15 WA patients who had radical prostatectomy was carried out. Methyl-Captured (mCap) sequencing data was generated for TAS of prostate cancer FFPE tissues. Methylated sites were identified with the MACS2 callpeak function using a band width of 300 bp and a false discovery rate of q &#60; 0.05. A consensus peak set was derived from the aligned reads of BA and WA prostate cancer stroma samples that were sequenced. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tools. CAFs from primary tumors of BA and WA was prepared by tissue culture and treated with demethylating agent (i.e., 5-Azacytidine) for 24 hours followed by maintenance of the cells in drug-free medium for 7-10 days and subjected to mCap sequencing.<br \/>Results: We found racial disparities in genome-wide DNA methylation in TAS between the two populations in which BA PCa patients had significantly increased in global DNA methylation as compared to their WA counterpart (p value &#60; 0.001). Hypomethylation occurred in CAFs from BA patients treated with 5-Azacytidine. We identified 1041 methylated sites corresponding to 409 unique genes that were differentially methylated in BA vs WA (p value &#60; 0.05). Pathway analysis identified significant association between methylated genes in BA TAS and immune response pathways including IL-13, JACK\/STAT, T cell receptors, NF-KB, and PD-1, PDL1 cancer immunotherapy. Evaluation of the methylome profile between patients based on the post-prostatectomy resection margins, negative (R0) vs positive (R1), showed that R0 resections had significantly greater (p value &#60; 0.001) methylation than R1 resections. Further analysis identified 984 sites corresponding to 373 differentially methylated, unique genes (p value &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Tumor-adjacent stroma of BA prostate cancer patients has a distinct methylome as compared to WA patients. Differences in immune response pathways suggests a distinct immune response in TAS in men of different races.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,DNA methylation,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Caribbean populations provide an opportunity to identify potential founder mutations that contribute to cancer risk. Jamaica has among the highest rates of prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the world and the majority of the population are of WA ancestry. However, there is a significant amount of genetic admixture of EU and Asian ancestry from historic migration patterns. Thus, the population provides a unique cohort for studying the complex interplay between genetic ancestry and prostate cancer. In this pilot study, we characterized the overall and gene locus-specific ancestry of Jamaican prostate cancer patients to explore potential associations with clinicopathologic disease features. We specifically focused this analysis on the BRCA1 locus based on its known association with inherited prostate cancer risk and also with breast cancer risk in patients from the Caribbean.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective cohort of 31 Jamaican men (non-US citizens\/residents) who travelled to the University of Miami (2015-2020) specifically for robotic prostatectomy were included in the analysis. DNA was prepared from normal prostate tissue and analyzed using the Illumina Global Screening Array version 3 with Multi-Disease Drop-In that includes more than 650,000 genetic markers. Both overall genetic ancestry and allele specific ancestries were determined for each study subject. Clinical and pathological features (age, PSA, stage, grade group (GG)) were also recorded and analyzed using descriptive statistics.<br \/>Results: Median age was 67 years, median pre-op PSA was 6.7. The majority of patients were cT1c (91%) and GG 2 (29%) on biopsy. On final pathology most men were &#8805;pT3 (51%) and the proportion of GG 1, 2 and &#8805; 3 was 3%, 52% and 45% respectively. The mean overall West African genetic ancestry was 51.2% (SD 28.4%). Overall % West African ancestry was not associated with pathological GG. In contrast, 50% of the men who were homozygous for African ancestry alleles at the BRCA1 locus had high-grade prostate cancer (GG 3, 4, 5) versus 37% of the men with non-African or heterozygous BRCA1 genotypes.<br \/>Conclusions: In a select cohort of Jamaican men, we found that half of patients with BRCA1 alleles derived from West African ancestry also have high grade prostate cancer. BRCA1 of African ancestral origin may contribute to the relatively high prevalence of aggressive prostate cancer in men from Jamaica. Work in progress focuses on an expanded study of associations between allele-specific genetic ancestry and prostate cancer in high-risk populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,Genetic susceptibility,Cancer genetics,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Prostate cancer (PCa) of American men of African ancestry (AA) is diagnosed at an earlier median age and more advanced stage with a poorer prognosis and significantly higher mortality than in Americans of primarily Northern European ancestry (EA). The mechanism of how ancestry contributes to aggressive PCa in AA patients is not well understood. Given the inherent heterogeneity and multifocality of prostate cancer, Spatial transcriptomics is of particular interest because it allows distinct cell populations within the tumor microenvironment to be characterized, and their possible effects on local tumors to be identified. Here we compare transcription between four AA and four EA patients in regions of peritumoral stroma, inflammation, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), and Gleason score patterns 3 (G3) and 4 (G4).<br \/>Methods: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy tissue blocks were obtained from 8 patients (4 AA and 4 EA) prior to treatment of the patients and matched for clinical variables (i.e., biochemical relapse, age, Gleason score, and tumor stage). 10um tissue sections were mounted onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides and processed following 10x Genomics protocol. Sample counts were processed through Space Ranger. 18000 unique genes, spatial barcodes, and clinician guided annotations were imported to the R program Seurat. Data was processed using SCTransform. Significance of each transcript differences between each tissue were calculated.<br \/>Results: Digital histologic slides of prostate cancer specimens from AA (n=4) and EA (n=4) patients were annotated by a urologic pathologist to identify regions of peritumoral stroma, inflammation, BPH, G3, and G4. Each spot was interrogated for the expression of 18000 transcripts, with an average of 17796 being detected per spot. Among the largest differences observed between AA and EA, G3 and G4 had distinct transcriptome profiles in the four AA as compared to G3 and G4 in four EA. Also, when differential expression (padj &#60; 0.05) in peritumoral stroma was compared to G4 in AA, we identified 290 differentially expressed genes, whereas the same comparison in EA cohorts identified 600 differentially expressed genes.<br \/>Conclusion: Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed differences in gene expression across multiple tissue types in prostate cancer patients of different ancestries.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Race,Stroma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

However, the interplay between self-reported race and\/or ethnicity (SIRE) and genetically inferred ancestry (GIA) on <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations and allele-specific subtypes is largely unknown.<br \/>Methods: A total of 3918 NSCLC patients from the Chinese OrigiMed (OM) cohort (n=2039) and Boston Lung Cancer Survival (BLCS) cohort (n=1879) were included, all of whom had baseline covariates including age, sex, clinical stage, SIRE, histology and smoking status. <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation and subtypes were determined by targeted NGS panels in each cohort, and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation outcomes, including <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation, <i>KRAS<\/i> subtypes, and <i>KRAS<\/i> transversion and transition were analyzed. GIA was inferred from paired germline data for patients in the BLCS cohort. Multivariable and multinomial logistic regressions were employed to assess the associations between SIRE, GIA and <i>KRAS<\/i> outcomes.<br \/>Results: In the entire cohort, 804 (20.5%) patients harbored <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, with a considerably higher prevalence of 31.5% observed in BLCS compared to 10.4% in OM cohort. Patients with self-identified Asian was associated with a significantly lower rate of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation (OR = 0.44, 95% CI:0.22 - 0.81, P = 0.01), transversion substitutions (OR = 0.24, 95% CI:0.10 - 0.62, P = 0.003) and <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> (OR = 0.17, 95% CI:0.04 - 0.72, P = 0.02) compared to SIRE-White patients after adjusting for confounders including smoking status, sex and histology. The association of SIRE and <i>KRAS<\/i> driver mutation was further modified by sex, with Asian women demonstrating lower risk compared to Asian men, while the opposite trend was observed in SIRE-White patients. Increased European ancestry was associated with a higher risk of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation (OR per 10% increase = 1.05, 95% CI:1.00 - 1.09, P = 0.03), particularly with more transition substitutions (OR per 10% increase = 1.10, 95% CI:1.01 - 1.21, P = 0.03) and <i>KRAS<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> (OR per 10% increase = 1.18, 95% CI:1.04 - 1.34, P = 0.01). This association was even more pronounced in patients of increased Northern European ancestry. Furthermore, even among SIRE-White patients, a 10% increase in European ancestry was associated with an additional 6% increase in the likelihood of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.12, P = 0.03), while a 10% increase in Admixed American ancestry was associated with a 6% decreased likelihood of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.88 - 0.99, P = 0.04). Results were validated in an independent cohort of 1450 patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Self-reported race\/ethnicity and genetic ancestry are both associated with <i>KRAS<\/i> driver mutations and allele-specific subtypes of NSCLC. This work highlights the significance of integrating both into population-based cancer research, aiming to refine clinical decision-making processes and mitigate health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,KRAS,Biomarkers,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Individuals experiencing mental illness use tobacco at an elevated rate and consequently suffer from greater cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, local mental health authorities (LMHAs), a common setting to receive mental health services, do not prioritize tobacco dependence treatment despite robust evidence that tobacco cessation can enhance mental health in addition to reducing cancer incidence. Beliefs (Health Belief Model) and competence (Self Determination Theory) both play an integral role in shaping behavior. Consequently, this study examined employee and provider tobacco-related beliefs and competence in LMHAs to contextualize their tobacco intervention practices. The frequency of beliefs and competence related to provision of evidence-based tobacco cessation care was collected by e-survey from organizational representatives of 30 of the 39 LMHAs in Texas in 2021. Queries included if respondents agreed that patients should concurrently quit drugs\/alcohol and tobacco (N=30 employees) and if they believed patients want to quit cigarette and non-cigarette (i.e., other) tobacco products (n=16 direct service providers). Providers were also asked if they thought that they had the competence to help patients quit smoking and other tobacco use, if they could tailor cessation treatment to patient needs, and about their intervention practices. Only 40% of LMHA representatives endorsed that patients should quit tobacco at the same time as other drugs. Furthermore, only 50% of providers believed that patients want to quit smoking and other tobacco use, respectively. About 70% of providers believed that they have the skills to help patients quit smoking and other tobacco use, respectively, but only 56% reported that they can tailor treatment. Finally, only 56% and 38% of providers recommend that patients stop smoking or other tobacco use, respectively, with 25% recommending smokers switch to vapes or smokeless tobacco products. Contrary to LMHA employee and provider beliefs, research indicates that most patients want to quit tobacco use and that concurrent tobacco use treatment can enhance patient sobriety for non-nicotine substance use disorders. Results demonstrate high levels of misinformation on concurrent tobacco and substance use treatment in LMHAs, which can subvert the provision of evidence-based cessation care. Educational interventions are needed to shift these beliefs, increase competence, and increase tobacco use intervention provision. This will not only help to address cancer disparities among patients but also improve mental health- a critical goal of LMHAs. Future research should investigate how to target tobacco-related beliefs, competence, and intervention behavior in LMHAs to broaden the reach of cancer prevention strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Cancer prevention,Cancer risk,Comorbidity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Therefore, we examined the associations of racialized socioeconomic segregation with risks of extensive-stage diagnosis, non-adherence to guideline-recommended treatment, and mortality among non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with SCLC.<br \/>Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study included patients who were diagnosed with SCLC as a first primary malignancy at age 20 and older between January 2007 and December 2015, followed through December 2016, and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. County-level racialized socioeconomic segregation was measured using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression accounting for county-level clustering was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for extensive-stage diagnosis and non-adherence to guideline-recommended treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) for lung cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality were computed using multilevel Cox regression.<br \/>Results: Among 38,393 patients, 90.1% were NHW and 9.9% were NHB. Patients dwelling in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quartile) had higher risks of non-adherence to guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.40; P<i><sub>trend<\/sub><\/i> &#60;0.01), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.12; P<i><sub>trend<\/sub><\/i> &#60;0.01), and all-cause mortality (HR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.09-1.17; P<i><sub>trend<\/sub> <\/i>&#60;0.0001) as compared with patients dwelling in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quartile).

We assessed self-reported 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence (not smoking any cigarettes in the past seven days) at Month 3, weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), pharmacotherapy adherence, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. At baseline, participants&#8217; mean age was 47.3 years old (SD 16.0), 55% of participants were female, 80% had completed high school or lower educational level, and 60% indicated that Spanish was their language of preference.

Neuro-Oncology clinics are located in densely populated urban areas resulting in additional access barriers, such as longer travel time, for those in non-urban areas. To better understand how proximity to our facility affects patient outcomes among PBT patients enrolled in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Natural History Study (NCT02851706, PI: Armstrong), we assessed the association of population density with symptom duration before diagnosis, time to first treatment, and overall survival among a cohort of 666 adult PBT patients. More urbanized areas were defined as areas with a core population density of more than 1,000 persons per square mile. T-tests and chi-squared tests were performed to assess differences in patient and tumor characteristics based on population density (more urbanized vs. less urbanized). We used ordinal logistic regression (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) to assess the association between duration of presenting symptoms (&#60;6 months, 6 months-1 year, &#8805;1 year) and linear regression (beta coefficient, 95% CI) for time to treatment and population density. We adjusted for age at cancer diagnosis and sex (male, female), and results were stratified according to residential distance to the NIH (short distance=&#60;200 miles, long distance=200+ miles), to control for local referral patterns. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess overall survival by population density levels, overall, and by residential distance. All models were then further stratified by tumor grade (low, high). Among 666 patients diagnosed with PBTs, 401 (60%) lived in more urbanized areas, 40% were long distance, and 24% had low-grade tumors. Patients living in more urbanized areas were more racially diverse (p&#60;0.001), had higher educational attainment (p&#60;0.001), and were more likely to be single (p=0.008). In the overall cohort and when stratified by distance to NIH or tumor grade, there were no associations between population density level and symptom duration prior to diagnosis. Time to treatment for radiation and chemotherapy was longer for PBT patients living in less urbanized areas and longer distances from the NIH (&#946;=0.63; 95%CI=0.08,1.17) compared to those living in more urbanized areas. There were no differences in the 5-year survival rates between more or less urbanized groups. In conclusion, access to care for those in less urbanized areas was demonstrated, although survival was not impacted. Future consideration should be given to novel approaches to increase access to specialized care, particularly for PBT patients living further from urban areas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Early detection,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

According to 2010 data, socioeconomic disparities and reduced access to health care is common in this population with 16 percent of foreign-born elderly living below the poverty threshold in comparison with 8 percent of U.S.-born elderly. Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the U.S despite being easily preventable and treatable. Studies among male African Americans reveal a CRC incidence &#62;20% higher than what obtains among whites. Since, genetic factors are believed to contribute as much as 35% to the overall risk of CRC, male adult immigrants aged 45 years and above from Africa and the Middle East may be at increased risk of developing the disease. Determining CRC screening uptake in this population will be critical in planning interventions which may ultimately reduce disparities in CRC-related morbidity and mortality in the future.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study comprising administration of questionnaires and organizing four Focus Group Discussion (FGD) sessions among adult males in Salt Lake City who identified as refugees from Africa or the Middle East. The sessions were audio-taped, transcribed and coded using the Dedoose software.<br \/>Results: We had thirty-one participants who were between 45 and 64 years of age. Twenty-five of them (83%) reported awareness of the existence of CRC screening tests. Ten participants (33%) had undergone a CRC test in the past. However, only nine participants (30%) indicated that they will be willing to participate (WTP) in CRC screening if offered for free. Increased WTP was associated with younger age (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.23-1.81), length of stay in the United States (OR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.13-1.78) and higher education (OR= 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.37). Three major themes identified in the FGDs include: (1) Mistrust - distrust of the US health system (2) Fear - fear of cancer and nature of test and (3) Fatalism - the belief that screening cannot lead to cancer cure.<br \/>Conclusion: The low level of WTP in CRC screening tests among the respondents may be associated with past experiences. There may be a need to consider the correlates of increased WTP and explore culture-specific CRC prevention measures in planning interventions designed to improve screening uptake in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Prevention,African,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Data was sorted by county and race\/ethnicity and statistically insignificant measures were removed. APC measures were ranked relative to counties across Texas and the US. APC measures with 95% confidence intervals for Hispanic and NHB women in Tarrant, Dallas, and Bexar county were compared for a significant difference. Results from a previous study indicated that the slowest decreases in cervical cancer rates are found among Hispanic and African-American women in Tarrant and Dallas County. We built upon this study to assess if there was a statistically significant difference in the risk of developing cervical and lung cancer between these two groups. In Tarrant County (TC), the cervical cancer APC of Hispanic women was -1.8 [-3.4,0.1] and NHB women was -1.2 [-3.7, 1.3]. In Dallas County, the cervical cancer APC of Hispanic women was -2.1 [-3.4, -0.8] and NHB women was -1.8 [-3, -0.5]. This indicates that for both cities, Hispanic women saw a greater decrease in the APC in cervical cancer rates than NHB women.<br \/>In Tarrant County (TC), the lung cancer APC of Hispanic women was -2.7 [-4.5, -0.9] and NHB women was -2.1[ -3.1, -1.1]. In Dallas County, the lung cancer APC of Hispanic women was -2.3 [-4.2, -0.4] and NHB women was -1.8 [-2.5, -1]. This indicates that for both cities, while Hispanic women saw a greater decrease in the APC in lung cancer rates than NHB women, the decrease is not statistically significant due to the overlap of the confidence intervals. Even though the confidence interval (CI) overlaps indicates insignificance, the APC can still provide valuable information regarding diagnostic trends seen in urban cities. The results showed that there is no significant difference between these two groups, suggesting that other county-level factors may play a role in diagnostic disparities seen between these two racial groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Lung cancer,Hispanic,African American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The incidence of cancer in Africa in 2020 was about 1.1 million new cases, with 711,000 deaths, indicating a mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) of 0.64. These cancer challenges in Africa necessitate a concerted approach towards effective cancer control and management. Here, we present an extensive report of emerging epidemiological cancer trends among West African adults seen between 1972-2022 in Zaria, Nigeria. We used the Zaria cancer registry of the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH) Zaria, Nigeria to obtain information on histologically diagnosed cancers from January 1st, 1972 to December 31, 2022. Records in the Zaria registry are indexed into a register paper-based and 2008 and transferred by CanReg4 software on the computer. We used WHO classification of tumors (WHO Blue Book) 5th edition to classify all the abstracted cancers for the purpose of this study. Time-trend analyses were performed by utilizing linear regression models. In the analysis of the Zaria cancer registry, 12,114 adults (42.2% male, 57.8% female) were diagnosed with histologically confirmed cancer between 1972 - 2022. The most common diagnosis among male cancer patients was prostate cancer, comprising a quarter of all cases. The median age of diagnosis for prostate cancer was 65 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 60 and 70. Among female cancer patients, the most common diagnoses were cervical cancer and breast cancer, together comprising 68.2% of all cases. Median age at diagnosis were 45 (IQR, 40-56) and 42 (IQR, 35-50), respectively. In time-trend analyses, the total number of new cancer cases diagnosed at ABUTH from 1972 to 2022 increased over time (p&#60;0.001). In the analyses of individual cancers, those in which the number of new cases increased over time were neoplasms of the bones and joints, breast, cervix, prostate, colorectum and stomach, head and neck (p&#60;0.001); esophagus (p=0.006); eye and orbit and soft tissue (p=0.002); and ovary (p=0.005). Cancers in which the number of new cases decreased over time were Hodgkin lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma of the skin, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin (p&#60;0.001). The number of new adult cancer diagnoses recorded in the Zaria cancer registry have increased over time from 1972 to 2022. Prostate cancer accounted for a quarter of all cancer cases among males, whereas cervical cancer and breast cancer accounted for nearly 70% of all cases among females. Westernization with associated change in dietary habits, physical inactivity, obesity and reproductive behaviors and changes in the population size and life expectancy may be attributable factors to change in cancer in Zaria. Better understanding of these factors will inform cancer prevention and control strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

For these reasons, an Educational Tool Kit was created for the Community Genetic Navigation Specialists (CoGENEs) program at the Center for Optimizing Engagement of Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Patients in Cancer Genomic Characterization Studies (COPECC) at the University of Southern California (USC). CoGENES is a train the trainer program geared towards the development of a local workforce of trained community engagement specialists, promotores de salud (community health workers) that will act as liaison agents to increase knowledge and create community awareness on genetic research, clinical genetic testing, counseling, biospecimen donation and participation in clinical trials for H\/Ls CRC patients, and community at large.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The Tool Kit consisted of a newly developed educational handbook focused on CRC prevention, genetics, counseling, tumor testing, and patient navigation, as well as existing materials with resources for CRC and counseling.

Optimization probes focused on readability, knowledge, acceptability, barriers, and recommended changes. Content analysis was conducted with focus group transcripts to inform how to optimize the handbook. A Materials Review Optimization Scorecard was developed to evaluate materials on content, literacy, graphics, layout and typography, learning, stimulation and motivation, and cultural and language appropriateness.

Following the principles of precision public health, we used geospatial technologies and population-based health data to identify the locations and socioeconomic status of neighborhoods with high cancer incidences for recruitment of participants in prevention research.<br \/>Methods: Using Florida cancer registry data, geospatial hot spot analyses were carried out to identify statistically significant clusters of census tracts with high incidences of prostate, gastric, and oral cancers within the catchment area of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in South Florida. The locations, social determinants of health (US Census&#8217; American Community Survey), and behavioral risk factor data (CDC&#8217;s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) of these hot spots were analyzed to identify the locations of underserved communities facing high risk for these three cancers.<br \/>Results: Hot spots with high incidences for each of these three cancers overlap in many neighborhoods with high proportions of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black populations and high levels of socioeconomic disparities, such as low income, low education level, rental housing, no vehicles, and no access to health insurance. These neighborhoods also have high rates for behavioral risk factors in smoking, lack of physical activity, obesity, and high incidence of cervical cancer (high risk areas for HPV-associated oral cancers). Mobile screening units called the Game Changer Vehicles have been deployed to the locations to recruit participants who were tested on-site for prostate specific antigen (prostate cancer), H. pylori (gastric cancer), or solCD44 (a soluble tumor marker for squamous cell carcinoma) and total protein levels in oral rinse specimens, which can distinguish individuals with molecular features at risk for oral cancers due to tobacco, alcohol use, and human HPV infection.<br \/>Conclusions: Geospatial analyses of population health data can be used to produce metrics that precisely target neighborhoods with high cancer risk and health disparities to recruit research participants. The same precision approach can also be applied for cancer screening purposes, such as offering cervical self-sample and fecal blood test kits in disadvantaged communities facing heightened risk for cervical and colorectal cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-13 Recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved populations in clinical prevention trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cancer prevention,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Although the Florida State Cancer Registry&#8217;s primary role is cancer surveillance and control, it can also aid in population-based epidemiologic studies of cancer survivors. This study aimed to evaluate the viability of using the Florida Cancer Data System&#8217;s (FCDS) patient recruitment methods to enlist Hispanic women with breast cancer for a cross-sectional survey.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>During August 2023 - November 2023<b>, <\/b>we recruited adult (age &#8805; 20) women who were diagnosed with breast cancer at least six months ago before enrollment, self-identified themself as Hispanic, and currently living in Central Florida, using state-mandated recruitment procedure which includes two invitation letters sent via mail three weeks apart and calling to non-responders after three weeks, but up to 4 times. Potential interested participants were asked to complete a survey in English or Spanish via print or online packet, providing data on demographics, health, lifestyle, and quality of life. An Excel log was used to track the response and return dates.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As of October 25, 2023, we sent the invitation letters to a total of 667 participants deemed eligible per FCDS. Most of them did not respond to the letters or follow-up telephone calls, with 364 being unreachable due to incorrect contact information, which led to 303 accessible participants. The accessible sample included 22 Cubans, 73 Puerto Ricans, 65 South\/Central Americans, 20 Dominicans, 39 Mexicans, and 83 Other Hispanics, with 48.7% speaking Spanish. Among the accessible participants, 113 refused to participate, 34 were not eligible, 13 have not decided yet, 118 agreed to participate but have not completed the survey yet, and 25 agreed to participate and completed the survey as of November 15. Common reasons for not qualifying included &#8220;not being Hispanic,&#8221; &#8220;dead,&#8221; &#8220;not living in Central Florida,&#8221; &#8220;not having cancer,&#8221; or &#8220;inability to read English or Spanish.&#8221; The most common reasons for refusal were &#8220;too sick,&#8221; &#8220;too old,&#8221; or &#8220;not interested.&#8221; The average response time to the first and second invitations was 20.1 and 19.6 days, respectively, and most participants responded to the second or third call within 8.3 days of the first call.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: The FCDS can be used to recruit Hispanics for epidemiology studies. However, the state-mandated patient recruitment procedure needs improvement. For example, the procedure should collect participants' email addresses in addition to their mail and telephone numbers, allow researchers to contact participants via email instead of written mail, and remove all dead individuals before sending the contact information to researchers.<br \/>(Supported by Florida Breast Cancer Foundation Scientific Research Grant 2023 and UCF SEED grant).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-13 Recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved populations in clinical prevention trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hispanic,Recruitment,Survivorship research,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Collectively, Black Americans have the highest cancer death rate and shortest survival of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. The drivers of cancer and other health conditions among Black women are likely multi-level, complex, and include contributions from environmental, behavioral, community, and system-level factors. Inadequate representation in research has limited the understanding of drivers of disparate outcomes, which, in turn, has hindered our ability to identify successful, culturally appropriate strategies for intervention.<br \/>Approach: The American Cancer Society is establishing a cohort of at least 100,000 Black women to better understand cancer risk and outcomes in this population. The cohort will include two recruitment arms: (1) an &#8220;at risk&#8221; group of 85,000 participants between the ages of 25-55 years old with no prior cancer history and (2) a &#8220;survivorship&#8221; group of 15,000 participants previously diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or endometrial cancers. Pilot enrollment of the &#8220;at risk&#8221; group launched in October 2023 and will focus on understanding the disproportionate burden of early-onset cancer among Black women. For the &#8220;survivorship&#8221; group, pilot enrollment will launch in late 2024. The cancers of focus account for 95% of the absolute cancer mortality rate difference for Black vs. White women and offer the greatest opportunity for learning how to reduce cancer mortality disparities. Enrollment will focus on Black women who reside in the District of Columbia or one of 20 U.S. states representing &#62;90% of the U.S. Black population.<br \/>Results: Approximately 200 women were successfully consented into the cohort between October-November 2023. Study activities are conducted through an online portal optimized for mobile use. Through the portal, participants confirmed eligibility by completing an electronic survey, and reviewing and signing the informed consent. Upon consent, participants will complete a baseline survey and be sent follow-up surveys twice per year for at least 30 years. These surveys will track exposures, health outcomes, and participants&#8217; lived experiences.<br \/>Conclusions: Pilot work in 2023 demonstrated feasibility to engage Black women into a prospective cohort study.

Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH) is a mechanism implicated in these disease states, partially driven by epigenetic regulatory genes, including <i>TET2<\/i>. Yet, there is not much known about how epigenetic modulations of <i>TET2<\/i> itself may relate to the immune system and subsequent disease development.<br \/>Hypothesis: We hypothesize that socioeconomic status (SES), as a SDOH marker, relates to epigenetic modulation of <i>TET2.<\/i><br \/>Methods: 60 African American adults (93.3% female, mean age 61) with CVD risk, living in the Washington, D.C. area self-reported their SES as household income. Immune system activity was assessed via splenic activity (SpleenA) by <sup>18<\/sup>FDG PET\/CT. Serum cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and DNA methylation analysis evaluated the epigenetic modulations of <i>TET2<\/i>. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for ASCVD 10-year risk score and BMI was used to examine associations.<br \/>Results: Out of 33 <i>TET2 <\/i>methylation sites, we found 3 sites that were significantly related to SES. Notably, only <i>Tet2cg09666717<\/i> (SES &#946;=0.310, p=0.038) was also associated with SpleenA (&#946;=-0.453, p=0.036) and several cytokines: IL-17A, IL-1&#946; and TNF&#945; along with trending to significance with IFN-&#947; (Table).<br \/>Conclusion: Thus, we found that SES associates with hypomethylation of <i>Tet2cg09666717, <\/i>which further related to SpleenA and inflammatory markers. Our findings are hypothesis generating and suggest that lower SES may relate to inflammation and immune system dysregulation by the way of epigenetic modulation of TET2. These results should be examined in larger, functional studies with diverse population-based cohorts to determine the potential relationships of both SDOH and epigenetic markers in CH and cardio-oncology outcomes.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{6394FC3E-1B93-405C-BF16-C00471634D20}\"><caption>Associations between TET2 methylation sites, SpleenA, SES and Cytokines in DCCNHA cohort, 2014-17<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Tet2cg09666717<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tet2cg05094833<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tet2cg10594473<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SES<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.310 <b>(0.038)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.405 <b>(0.006)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.283 <b>(0.060)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Splenic Activity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>-0.453 (0.036)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.004 (0.985)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.097 (0.654)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.078 (0.558)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.211 (0.108)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.222 (0.084)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.199 (0.153)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.024 (0.865)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.004 (0.979)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-17A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>-0.373 (0.010)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.134 (0.370)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.434 <b>(0.017)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IL-1&#946;<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>-0.382 (0.003)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.042 (0.757)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.143 (0.275)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TNF&#945;<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>-0.456 (0.000)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.157 (0.244)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.005 (0.969)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IFN-&#947;<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.258 (0.062)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-0.037 (0.790)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.022 (0.876)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Data are presented as standardized &#946; coefficient (p-value).
