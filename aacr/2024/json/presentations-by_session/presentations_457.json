[{"Abstract":"Immunotherapy is increasingly popular as a type of cancer treatment. These therapies include the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-engineered T-cells (CAR T-cells), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and other genetically modified T-cells to specifically target the cancer cells. Although much success has been achieved with immunotherapy for treatment of blood cancers, its efficacy remains limited in solid tumors. One of the reasons for the low success rate is attributed to the solid tumor microenvironment (TME) where suppressive cytokines limit the tumor killing ability of T-cells. Thus, understanding the role the TME plays in T-cell responses is essential for the development of effective cancer therapies. The benefits of using 3-dimensional (3D) PDOs lie in the physical and chemical cues present within the TME that cannot be mimicked in traditional 2D monolayer cultures. Studies show that PDOs show similar responses to drugs as original tumors, suggesting the value of using PDOs to improve therapeutic outcomes. Thus, PDOs can provide more relevant physiological and pathological cancer models that recapitulate the basic features of primary tumors and is more suited for assessing the effectiveness of T-cell killing than 2D cell models. Despite the benefits associated with the use of PDOs, there are significant barriers to widespread adoption of PDOs in drug discovery. Organoid production is a costly and highly labor-intensive process. Moreover, organoid culture is a skilled manual process, and thus there can be significant variability between operators. To address the challenges associated with the use of PDOs in large scale applications, a semi-automated bioprocess has been developed for the large-scale expansion of assay ready organoids. Here, we developed a method to assess the effectiveness of T-cell invasion in solid tumors using patient derive organoids (PDOs). Using bioreactor expanded patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids (CRCs), activated PBMCs (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) stained with CellTracker were added to CRCs (stained with MitoTracker) in a 96well microtiter plate and monitored on every 4 hours for 3 days using high content imager. To quantify T-cell invasion, we developed an image analysis method to measure the distance of each T-cell to the nearest organoid (interaction distance). We find that stimulated T-cell resulted in smaller interaction distance than non-stimulated T-cells. The results demonstrate the utility of the bioreactor-expanded organoids in large scale T-cell based screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,T cell,Image analysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

In this study, we generated multi-regional genomic and transcriptional data coupled with digital pathology from 28 long-term survivors (LTSs) and 34 stage-matched short-term survivors, with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Our investigation unveiled that mature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) within the tumors of LTSs exerted significant immune pressure on the tumor, leading to the restriction in generating clonal mutations and increased subclonal diversity. Employing single-cell profiling, we identified significant enrichment of IgM<sup>+<\/sup> na&#239;ve B cells and TCF7<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in TLS-positive tumors. Spatial profiling further highlighted that TCF7<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells preferentially localized in TLS, facilitating reduced vulnerability to unfavorable environmental factors. Functionally, TCF7<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells displayed strong capacity to differentiate into effector subsets while maintaining a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. Mechanistically, we identified that na&#239;ve B cells promote activation and differentiation of stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells within the TLS niche through IgM-Fc&#956;R axis, which primed these T cells for enhanced anti-tumor immunity. In summary, our findings underscore that TLS plays a pivotal role in orchestrating enduring and effective anti-tumor immunity, which yield strong immune stress on cancer evolution and ultimately contributing to better prognosis of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,T cell,B cells,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Thus, quantifying the clonal distribution of T-cells in cancer tissue from patients might provide prognostic and predictive information, particularly in high immunogenic tumors like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated TCR clonality in the tumor microenvironment of NSCLC, its relation to the <i>in situ<\/i> immune phenotype, and its clinical impact in a cohort of 182 resected NSCLC patients. The &#945; and &#946; TCR clones were determined based on RNA sequencing data, and the Gini index was used to weight individual clonal distribution. We used matched FFPE cancer tissue for multiplex immunofluorescence cell analysis and <i>in-situ<\/i> sequencing of T-cell clones. The analysis revealed a broad spectrum of TCR clonality patterns, including tissue with high TCR diversity and high evenness (low Gini coefficient) and tissue with clonal dominance with low evenness (high Gini coefficient). Highly expended clones were detected in 15\/182 patients, whereas 43\/182 revealed no clonal enrichment. A low TCR clone evenness (high Gini coefficient) was significantly more frequent in normal lung areas than in the corresponding tumor areas (n=20, p=0.02). In the cancer tissue, a high Gini index further correlated with high tumor mutational burden, indicating neoantigen-induced T cell clone expansions. Correspondingly, high TCR clonality was associated with an inflamed tumor phenotype associated with PD-1+ immune cells, CD3+, CD8A+, CD163+, and CD138+ cells, as well as higher expression of genes connected to immune activation (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH) and T cell exhaustion (PD-L1, LAG3, TIGIT). Cancer tissue with dominant T-cell clones also showed higher numbers of mature tertiary lymphoid structures with germinal centers. <i>In situ<\/i> sequencing suggested a close spatial relation between specific T cell clones and tumor cells. Finally, NSCLC patients with dominant T-cell clones showed strong responses and longer survival when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests that TCR clonality analysis is a strong candidate for precision diagnostics. Plausibly, the dominant clones found in NSCLC are responsible for a specific but malfunctioning anti-tumor response that can be unleashed by immune checkpoint inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immune response,Immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), only around 5 % of patients showed a durable response to ICIs. While the response rates were increased up to 10% by combining ICIs with conventional chemotherapy, the majority of the patients did not respond to the treatment. Thus, there is a need to improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying unequal response to ICIs in TNBC and develop\/discover new treatments to improve patient outcomes. The lack of response to ICIs has been attributed to the increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (including MDSCs, neutrophils and TAMs), as well as the presence of additional immune checkpoint receptors\/ligands that may further suppress cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is one of the immune checkpoint molecules attracting increasing attention in the context of anti-tumor immunity due to its broad expression across various cancer types and increased expression upon development of immune checkpoint resistance. However, the role of VISTA in the anti-tumor immune response and its therapeutic potential in TNBC remains unclear. In our study, we observed that VISTA is expressed in TNBC patients, with higher expression in neutrophils and macrophages. In the Py230 murine breast cancer model, VISTA expression increased upon paclitaxel (PTX), anti-PD-L1 and paclitaxel combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment compared to the control group, suggesting its potential role as a resistance mechanism in further inhibiting T cells. In the Py230 model, VISTA blockade increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells, as evidenced by the higher number of CD8+ T cells, increased CD69+CD8+ T cells, and Granzyme B production, indicating that VISTA blockade improved CD8+ T cells mediated anti-tumor immunity. To functionally test the role of VISTA, we stimulated CD8+ T cells and co-cultured them with na&#239;ve macrophages or tumor educated macrophages in the presence or absence of VISTA blocking antibody. Tumor-educated macrophages showed increased immunosuppressive activity which is abrogated with VISTA blockade. Moreover, we found that the immunosuppressive effect of macrophages on T cell activation needs direct cell interaction between VISTA on macrophages and T cells. In conclusion, this study shows the mechanism of action of VISTA in the regulation of T cells mediated anti-tumor immune response, and provides the rationale for blocking VISTA in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunesuppression,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Obesity-associated cancers are related to the overproduction of hormones, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by free fatty acids, and changes in the gut microbiome. Obesity also promotes immune cell dysfunction in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The increase of fatty acid levels due to obesity causes metabolic reprogramming and decreases the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells, which accelerate tumor progression. However, the impact of obesity on CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in the TIME remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify how obesity affected the number and the anti-tumor activity of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in CRC using mouse models.<br \/>Methods: Seven-week-old male C57BL\/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed the control diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for nine weeks. Blood samples were collected from the buccal vein of the mice every four weeks after feeding for analysis. MC38 CRC cells of 4 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> were subcutaneously inoculated in the middle of the backs of mice to analyze tumor progression. Three weeks after tumor cell inoculation, the mice were sacrificed, and the immune cells of the tumor, blood, and various organs were analyzed.<br \/>Results: After nine weeks of feeding, the HFD-fed mice had a significantly increased body weight compared to CD-fed mice. Flow cytometry results revealed that the number and frequency of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in the blood were significantly reduced in HFD-fed mice compared to those in CD-fed mice, and the expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) in CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in HFD-fed mice was significantly higher than that in CD-fed mice at eight weeks. Three weeks after tumor inoculation, HFD feeding accelerated tumor growth and decreased the survival rate. The number of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in the tumors was significantly reduced in HFD-fed mice compared to that in CD-fed mice (55.9 vs 18.2 cells\/mg; 95% CI 14.9-60.3 cells\/mg; <i>P<\/i> = 0.006). The number of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumors was also reduced, which was more pronounced for CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells than for CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells. In addition, the production of cytokines such as IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; was significantly reduced in CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells of HFD-fed mice. In a depletion analysis of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells, the feeding-dependent acceleration of tumor growth was not observed in each group.

In this context, immune cells, including the adoptive T cell transfer treatment, become the focus of interests. Notably, alpha\/beta TCR<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>-<\/sup>CD8<sup>-<\/sup>T (DNT) cells is a subgroup of T cells that is ignored for a long time but was re-focused recently. These DNT cells are a group of cells with opposite functions in different condition, including pro-inflammatory or suppressive functions and possibly originated from over-stimulation of peripheral CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells or a special group of T cells formed in thymus. In our research results, we have found these DNT cells increased in murine hepatoma model, especially in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, these DNT cells from tumor microenvironment of murine hepatoma possessed potent tumor-killing ability. Furthermore, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of T cells in tumor microenvironment by single cell RNAseq approach (CITE-seq). We found DNT cells could be categorized into two main clusters, one is cytolytic DNT cells, resemble the potent CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, and another is the CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cell-like DNT cells. These cytolytic DNT cells are not exhausted but with high expression of cytolytic molecule and low hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1a) expression. By trajectory analysis, cytolytic DNT cells come from the conventional CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells but following a unique developmental pathway that is different from the exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells. Interesting, these cytolytic DNT cells also expressed high level of Fcer1g molecule, a marker of innate CD8+T cells. In addition, these DNT cells could be generated and expanded in-vitro by IL-15 without TCR activation. In conclusion, we identified a cluster of cytolytic DNT cells, originated from CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, exhibits innate T cells behavior and potent killing ability. In addition, these cytolytic DNT cells could be generated and expanded in-vitro for the adoptive T cell transfer treatment of hepatoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,immunotherapy,DNT cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Cheng-Heng Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Te-Wei Tseng<sup>2<\/sup>, Chen-Yang Huang<sup>3<\/sup>, Ping-Hsun Ou<sup>4<\/sup>, Yi-Chen Lin<sup>4<\/sup>, Pin-Jung Chen<sup>4<\/sup>, Po-Ting Lin<sup>4<\/sup>, Chan-Keng Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Wei Teng<sup>4<\/sup>, Tsung-Han Wu<sup>5<\/sup>, Yung-Chang Lin<sup>3<\/sup>, Chun-Yen Lin<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology\/Hematology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Gastroenterology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>5<\/sup>General Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan,<sup>6<\/sup>College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"56183951-1bac-472a-adc8-aff09c6dfff0","ControlNumber":"4025","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying chromatin remodeler assembly and actions remains unclear. Actin-like gene family members have been implicated in the organization of chromatin landscapes, however their role in T cell functional regulation remains unknown. We identified Actin-like protein 6A\/Actl6a as the most upregulated gene within actin-like family members upon CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation across multiple species. Additionally, <i>ACTL6A<\/i> is highly expressed in human tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> mitotic tissue-resident memory T cells, suggesting a functional importance of <i>ACTL6A<\/i> in this subset. Deletion of mouse <i>Actl6a<\/i> in mature T lymphocytes impairs immune responses to transplanted syngeneic mouse tumors. T cell-specific <i>Actl6a<\/i> deletion mice exhibit a reduced effector memory population and attenuated cytotoxicity in their tumor infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Heterozygous deletion of <i>Actl6a<\/i> displays an intermediate reduction of effector memory population and cytotoxicity between that of wildtype and homozygous knockout, indicating that ACTL6A acts in a dose-dependent manner to promote CD8<sup>+<\/sup> effector cell fate. T cell adoptive transfer further corroborates a CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-intrinsic role of <i>Actl6a<\/i> on antitumor adaptive immunity. Currently, we are investigating the chromatin landscape and transcriptomic changes upon loss of <i>Actl6a<\/i> using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq.

Recent studies have shown the efficacy of anti-PD1 inhibitors which improved overall survival. However, this efficacy is limited to a subset of patients due to the intrinsic tumor resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our group recently demonstrated that tumor-associated fibrosis negatively correlates with T cell-mediated immune response in lung cancer. This is largely dependent on Col13a1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which result in recruiting the immunosuppressive macrophages and regulatory T cells while limiting dendritic cells and CD8 T cell infiltration. Here, we characterize the effect of fibrosis on the TME including TILs and macrophages using an orthotopic KRAS and P53-driven murine NSCLC model (KPL86-mCher model) with FITC-induced fibrosis.Fibrosis significantly increased the number of cancer-associated fibroblasts and collagen density in KPL86-mCher lung tumors. Following carboplatin + pemetrexed and Anti-PD1 treatment, we observed no increase in tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells or decrease in tumor burden when compared with the non-fibrotic tumors. Rather, we observed a significant increase in exhausted T cells marked by high Tim3, PD1, and TOX in fibrotic KPL86-mCher tumors. Corresponding to these impaired T-cell responses, we found an increase in tumor-infiltrating alveolar macrophages with immunosuppressive phenotype under fibrotic tumor conditions. Our data suggests that tumor-associated fibrosis leads to an increase in CD8+ T cell exhaustion as well as immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration in our spontaneously derived murine model on NSCLC. Overall, this indicates that targeting tumor fibrosis may significantly improve the efficacy of immunotherapy which would have translational implications for patients with immunotherapy-resistant NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Fibroblasts,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>U.

While CD8-T cells remains to be focus, emerging evidence suggests role of other immune cell subtypes in favorable outcome of patients. This study presents the abundance of gamma-delta T (gdt) cell subpopulations in responders and non-responders. The analysis further contrasts differential abundances under immunotherapy and non-immunotherapy regimens across diverse cancers.<br \/>Methods: We performed joint analysis of data from 250 non-immunotherapy cohorts and 17 ICB cohorts. To infer differential abundance in each cohort, we first identified genes robustly upregulated in tumors of patients with favorable outcome, and then unbiasedly evaluated upregulated genes for enrichment for immune cell populations. The topmost differential abundant subpopulations were validated by de novo assembly and single cell analyses.<br \/>Results: Our analysis revealed similarities in the immune microenvironment across responders, irrespective of immunotherapy or non-immunotherapy modalities, strongly suggesting shared factors influencing response. Notably, gdt cells emerged as consistent predictors of better prognosis, being associated with favorable responses to ICB therapy and improved long-term survival in non-immunotherapy-treated cancer patients. Two independent validation approaches reinforce these findings. First, taking advantage of the fact that gamma and delta receptors are unique to gdt cells, we obtained precise estimates of gdt cells in tumors from their RNA-seq using de novo assembly. The assessment recapitulated our finding that favorable prognosis of tumors with of gdt cell levels. Second, analysis of several single-cell RNA-sequencing cohorts showed that patients with favorable prognoses consistently exhibit high gdt cell levels within tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: The study underscores a strikingly consistent responder immune microenvironment, whether under immunotherapy or non-immunotherapy setting, suggesting a shared response and resistance mechanisms. The likelihood of cross-resistance has implications when clinicians decide whether immunotherapy should be administered before or after the traditional therapies for patients. Our study also elucidates the role of gdt cells as potent biomarkers for ICB therapy and their broader significance in enhancing patient survival across various cancer types. Ultimately, these insights may refine patient selection and inform tailored treatment strategies, could elevating clinical outcomes in the realm of precision oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune cells,T cell,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

For decades, AML treatment has centered around intensive chemotherapy frequently followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allo-SCT). The power of Allo-SCT to induce lasting remission has been attributed to a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect and has inspired efforts to stimulate host immunity against AML via immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Thus far, these studies have yielded mixed results. While tumor-infiltrating T-cells have long been the focus of immunotherapy investigations, a growing body of data points to a central role of B-cells in mediating anti-tumor immunity, and a comprehensive assessment of B lymphocytes within the AML immune microenvironment has never been carried out with single cell clonal resolution. We performed paired single-cell transcriptomic and B cell receptor (BCR) analysis on 52 bone marrow aspirate samples. These samples included 6 from healthy bone marrow donors (normal), 24 from newly diagnosed AML patients (NewlyDx), and 22 from 8 relapsed or refractory AML patients (RelRef), who underwent assessment both before and after ICB with azacitidine\/nivolumab. We first used transcriptomic data to delineate canonical B-cell subpopulations and observed a reduction in nascent B cells and an expansion of differentiated B cells in AML patients (RelRef&#62;NewlyDx). Overlaying BCR sequencing and clonotypic analysis revealed clonal expansion, low clonotypic diversity, and extensive somatic hypermutation in the RelRef samples, suggesting antigen-driven affinity maturation within the tumor microenvironment.<b> <\/b>Furthermore, we identified robust AP-1 expression (a marker of activation) in B-cells from NewlyDx patients and a marked loss of AP-1 in RelRef patients, suggesting that B-cell exhaustion may be a key immunologic feature of AML relapse. Importantly, we observed that AP-1 activity is restored and that specific B-cell clones expand after ICB, but only among patients who clinically respond to ICB. In line with these observations, we also noted the clonal expansion of AML-associated plasma cells and loss of clonotypic diversity among ICB clinical responders, pointing to an antitumor role for these clones. Finally, we characterized atypical memory B cells which demonstrate high antigen presentation activity, close interaction with AML cells and are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, suggesting that they play a direct role in aiding AML survival and immune escape. Collectively, our findings establish the dynamic landscape of AML-associated B-cells while identifying specific B-cell subpopulations and B-cell-AML interactions that may be targeted by the next generation of AML-directed immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Single cell,B cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

While immunotherapies that target these interactions have reshaped cancer treatment, the variable efficacy in patients is not fully understood.

Proximity Ligation Assays, detecting spatial interactions between ligand-receptor targets, provide insights into the activation of signaling pathways. Coupled with high-plex spatial phenotyping with tumor and immune profiling biomarkers, the integration of cellular and functional information will be beneficial for a deeper characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME), understanding immune responses, and identifying spatial signatures for patient stratification and targeted treatment strategies.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we phenotyped biopsies from head and neck cancer patients enrolled in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses were conducted for whole-slide segmentation, identifying cellular phenotypes, spatial neighborhoods, functional interactions, and distinct spatial signatures via the open-source image analysis software QuPath.<br \/>Results: Our analyses revealed key differences in the localization of the PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions within the TME of head and neck cancers. Areas of PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions are associated with immune cell types on the periphery of the tumor and some within the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The PhenoCode Signature panels helped resolve the localization of PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions to immune cell types within the TME and provided a dual workflow for spatial co-localization of interacting receptor\/ligand interactions and cell phenotypes within the TME.<br \/>Conclusions: By combining spatial immune profiling with Akoya&#8217;s PhenoCode Signature panels&#8239;and protein-protein interaction data from Navinci&#8217;s Naveni&#174;&#8239;PD-1\/PD-L1 assay, deep correlative insights of the TME can be applied to improve predictions of clinical outcomes.&#8239;This innovative approach enriches our comprehension of underlying mechanisms and stands as a promising tool for refining patient selection and optimizing treatment outcomes in immunotherapy.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Protein-protein interactions,PD-1,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

We aimed to explore the expression and clinical significance of PVR (CD155), the ligand of TIGIT, within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of advanced HCC.<br \/>Methods: All HCC tumor specimens were obtained at the advanced stage of HCC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate membranous staining of PVR and PD-L1 of tumor specimens, and semiquantitative scores with IHC 0, 1, 2, or 3 were given if &#60; 1%, &#8805;1% but &#60; 5%, &#8805;5% but &#60; 10%, or &#8805;10% of tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) were PVR or PD-L1 positive. Selected tumor specimens underwent immune gene expression profiling using the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, Inc.) with the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel.<br \/>Results: The study enrolled 67 advanced HCC patients, with median age of 59.2 years (male:female = 57:10). Forty-eight (71.6%) of the patients were hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen positive, and 23 (34.3%) had received sorafenib before the study. Thirteen (19.4%) and 18 (26.9%) tumor tissues showed positive PVR expressions (IHC scores &#8805;1) in TCs and ICs, respectively; Seventeen (25.4%) and 36 (53.7%) tumor tissues showed positive PD-L1 expressions in TCs and ICs, respectively. The expressions of PVR in TCs or ICs showed no association with clinical factors, such as sex, age, HBV infection, sorafenib treatment, or overall survival. Interestingly, in both TCs and ICs, the intensities of PVR and PD-L1 expression were inversely correlated for those with at least IHC scores &#8805;1 in either PVR or PD-L1 (TCs, n = 26, r = -0.6966, p &#60; 0.0001; ICs, n = 46, r = -0.4548, p = 0.0015). Immune profiling of the selected tumor specimens showed that those with high PVR but low PD-L1 expressions had significantly lower CD8 T cells scores, lower cytotoxic cells scores, and lower CD8\/Treg ratio than those with high PD-L1 but low PVR expressions.<br \/>Conclusions: There was an inverse correlation observed between expressions of PVR and PD-L1 in the advanced HCC tissues. The TME of those with high PVR expression was distinct from those with high PD-L1 expression. These findings may have important clinical implications for developing combination immunotherapy in advanced HCC.

However, surgery is the only hope for most patients with cholangiocarcinoma, but the effectiveness of treatment is not outstanding. Even though other methods of treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, have limited effects. The immunotherapy and precision treatment have become the latest expectations of patients. Here, we analyzed the TCGA and GEO database to classify the cold and hot tumor using hierarchical clustering. The MCP counter results demonstrated that two genes, MS4A1 and CD79A, could identify the hot and cold tumor subgroups after TCGA data training and similar results show in GEO database. We also performed the tissue array for 105 cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples and found patients with high expression levels of MS4A1 or CD79A have better disease free survival (DFS) and progression free survival (PFS) (p value =0.0131 and 0.0017). In addition, we tested the tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) signatures in tissue array sections, which is associated with the present of MS4A1 and CD79A. The results shows that patients who received the immunotherapy with TLS signatures have longer overall survival (OS) and PFS (p value =0.017 and 0.006). Collectively, B cell lineages or TLS could be an ideal biomarker to lead the clinical treatment and wish can broader applications in other diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tetiary lymphoid structure,B cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

Modelling of the TME represents an attractive approach to understand how PC evolves and spreads. Flow cytometry is a technique for quantitative measurement of single cell profiling based on the cell surface as well as intracellular markers. We designed a flowcytometric based approach to investigate the interplay between the PC cells and immune cells in a direct coculture. Cells are fluorescently tagged with a cell tracer and the analysis is performed separately on the adherent and non-adherent cells. To optimize the readout method, we investigate the interplay between Jurkat cells and PC cells (LNCaP) as well as immortalized prostate epithelial cell models modified to mimic early events in prostate carcinogenesis (RWPE-1 cells overexpressing androgen receptor, RWPE-1-AR, and having PTEN deletion, RWPE-1-AR-PTENdel).Jurkat (suspension culture) cocultured with LNCaP (adherent culture) exhibited 40% decrease in viability but only 30% of LNCaP dying cell in the floating population compared to LNcaP only which is 60%. When Jurkat were activated using Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), we observed an increase in LNCaP cell death<b>. <\/b>Jurkat viability was not impacted in presence of RWPE-1 neither when exposed to RWPE1-AR-PTENdel.

We have previously shown B cell recruitment into the tumor associates with OS on tebe [1]. We explored further the formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA) within the tumor microenvironment in response to tebe. HLA-A*02:01+ 2L+ adult patients (pts) with mUM were treated with tebe (NCT02570308). Paired tumor biopsies were collected at baseline (n=70), after 3 doses of tebe (n=48), and at radiographical progression (n=17). Presence of B cells, T cells and macrophages was assessed by immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against CD20, CD3 and CD163 respectively, and digitally quantified. Using digital density analysis, aggregates of &#8805;10 CD20+ B cells within CD3+ T cell area in a 100&#181;m radius were defined as LA. At progression pts were categorized by OS &#8805;12 or &#60;12 months. Mean fold change (FC) was used. At baseline, B cells were detected in 90% of pts (median 5 B cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>) with those pts having no more than 2 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> (17% pts with 1 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> and 3% pts with 2 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>). The median number of B cells in the biggest LA per sample was 24.B cells were recruited into the tumor after 3 doses of tebe (median 32 B cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, FC 3, p=6.5e-05). The LA density increased up to 6 LA\/mm2 (23% pts with 1 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, 8% pts with 2 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, 6% pts with 3 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> and 2% pts with 6 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>) with a trend for an increase in LA size (median B cell number in biggest LA = 30, p = 0.67). Tumors with a low baseline CD163+ macrophage to CD3+ T cell ratio, which was previously associated with longer OS on tebe, tended to have more LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> at baseline and on-treatment than those with a high ratio. At progression, pts with long OS had more B cells in the tumor compared to short OS (median 20 vs 2 B cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; FC 5, p=0.05). Additionally, more pts with long OS had LA than pts with short OS (6\/12 pts vs 1\/5 pts respectively) with a density not exceeding 1 LA\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>. LA size was larger in pts with long OS compared to short OS (median B cell number in biggest LA 30 vs 10 respectively). LA in the short OS patient was found in the normal adjacent tissue compared to the LA in long OS patients which were located in the tumor and invasive margin. Tebe enhanced the formation of LA in the tumor microenvironment, notably in the low immunosuppressed tumors, which is consistent with the hypothesis that it results in epitope spread. These observations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of action of tebe and helps to explain prolonged survival of mUM pts beyond radiographical progression.

BRGSF (Balb\/C Rag2<sup>-<\/sup>\/<sup>-<\/sup>, IL2R&#947;<sup>-<\/sup>\/<sup>-<\/sup>, SIRP&#945;NOD and Flt3<sup>-<\/sup>\/<sup>-<\/sup>) is a highly immunodeficient mouse featuring reduced murine myeloid cells. BRGSF mice reconstituted with human cord blood CD34<sup>+ <\/sup>cells (BRGSF-HIS) develop functional lymphoid and myeloid compartments. This engraftment is stable for over a year (Labarthe <i>et al.<\/i>, 2019) and mice do not develop GvHD. Myeloid compartment can be transiently boosted with exogenous human Flt3L injections. In contrary to other models overexpressing human cytokines to develop human myeloid cells, Flt3L-treated BRGSF-HIS mice do not show side effects. BRGSF-HIS mice are permissive to mouse and human cancer cell lines engraftment and represent a valuable preclinical model to study cancer development and test novel therapeutics. Effect of Flt3L-induced boost on myeloid compartment is seen in a non-small cell lung cancer (A549) tumor model. A single boost prior to tumor cell inoculation associates with increased tumor-infiltrating T-cells (mainly CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells) and myeloid cells, and reduced tumor-infiltrating NK cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Human triple negative cancer cell (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and human pancreatic adenocarcinoma HPAFII cell lines are widely used in cancer research and drug development. We show that upon implantation in BRGSF-HIS mice, <i>in vivo<\/i> growth of human cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) is CD34<sup>+ <\/sup>donor independent and the TME composition varies according to cell line used. As seen in TNBC patients (Zheng <i>et al.<\/i>, 2021); TME of MDA-MB-231 bearing BRGSF-HIS mice is enriched in myeloid cells, mostly CD206<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD163<sup>+<\/sup> M2 macrophages. CD163-expressing M2 macrophages represent the main tumor-associated macrophages, and are known to promote breast cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis by generating an immunosuppressive TME. Interestingly, TME composition evolves over time, with increased T cells frequency in later stage (tumor volume over 1000 mm<sup>3<\/sup> compared to 500 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) depicting cancer cell plasticity. Conversely, TME of HPAFII bearing mice is mainly composed of T cells enabling T cells-based therapy. Treatment of BRGSF-HIS mice bearing HPAFII tumor cells with combotherapy based on CD3xTAA + CD28xTAA efficiently reduces tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> compared to vehicle-treated mice or mice injected with CD3xTAA alone.

One of the major mechanisms underlying this resistance is alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) profiling changes after anti-PD1 treatment. To better understand the mechanism of PD-1 resistance, characterization of TILs in the tumor microenvironment was explored. First, immune cell profiling was performed in syngeneic tumor models established by 19 cancer cell lines without anti-PD-1 treatment. Depending on the tumor model, absolute numbers of CD45<sup>+<\/sup> cells and immune cell subsets varied. Moreover, stratifying the analysis based on tumor size (100 mm<sup>3<\/sup> to 3000 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) revealed alterations in the proportion of immune cell percentages in MC38 tumors, which implies alterations in TIL frequency during cancer progression. Next, we investigated the TIL profile in two PD-1 resistant models: a hPD-1 antibody-induced resistant model and a syngeneic model in aged mice. The hPD-1 antibody resistant model was induced by multiple rounds of hPD-1 antibody retreatment on MC38 tumor-bearing humanized B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1 mice. Efficacy results from this model further validated their resistance to hPD-1 treatment (0% tumor growth inhibition (TGI)), while the control group, which was not serially treated, showed substantial tumor inhibition (82.2% TGI). Next, mPD-1 antibody resistance was evaluated in aged wild-type mice. While mPD-1 efficacy on MC38-bearing young mice was approximately 85.5% TGI, the efficacy of this treatment in aged mice yielded only 6% TGI. TIL analysis in these models was subsequently performed: in the hPD-1-treated control mice that were responsive to anti-PD1 treatment, the numbers of total T cells, cytotoxic T cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>) and MHC II positive cells were increased, while the anti-tumor effector cells in the serially treated resistant mice were either unchanged (total T cells and MHC II positive cells) or decreased (CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells); strikingly, an increase in inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations was also observed in the resistant model post-treatment. In the anti-PD1 treated aged mice, the frequency of TILs was unchanged upon mPD-1 treatment, suggesting that resistance in aged mice may be due to non-responsiveness of the immune cells. In sum, our results demonstrate different mechanisms underlying anti-PD-1 resistance, and suggest that a more thorough analysis of the TILs present in the tumor microenvironment could predict the responsiveness to PD-1 therapy and inform treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,Anti-PD-1,Resistance,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

In the context of immunofluorescence detection, however, endogenous autofluorescence of FFPE tissues can significantly reduce or mask immunofluorescent signals. The autofluorescence of FFPE tissues is caused by a variety of factors, including the presence of endogenous fluorophores, tissue fixation, and processing. While there are several methods that can be used to quench autofluorescence in FFPE tissues, chemical quenchers, which absorb or scatter light, are most frequently used for multiplex IF. Examples of chemical quenchers commonly used in manual multiplex staining include Sudan Black B and TrueBlack; however, these are not chemically compatible for use on automated platforms such as the Leica Biosystems BOND RX. Due to the need for increased throughput and decreased hands-on time, automation has risen in popularity versus manual staining, leading to a need for a versatile quenching solution compatible with automation. Here we demonstrate that NovaPlex Quenching Solution (NPQS), a novel proprietary quenching agent, reduces the background caused by autofluorescence and enhances the signal of the Cell IDx UltraPlex multiplex immunofluorescent (mxIF) assay across tissue types. Qualitative studies showed a decrease in autofluorescent signal in FFPE mouse spleen stained with antibodies against B220\/Foxp3\/CD3e, suggesting the utility of NPQS in mouse models of cancer and immunity. Similarly, nonspecific background was decreased across FFPE human tissue types, including lung adenocarcinoma stained for CD8\/Foxp3\/CD3e\/CD4 and tonsil stained for CD8\/Foxp3\/PD-1\/CD4. Further statistical studies in FFPE human tonsil tissue stained with CD8\/Foxp3\/PD-1\/CD4 showed there was no significant decrease in dye intensity across all four markers and channels, resulting in a significant increase in signal-to-noise ratio for both CD8 at 490nm and PD-1 at 650nm (p&#60;0.05). These experiments using Cell IDx\/LBS UltraPlex mxIF technology demonstrate an effective method to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of fluorophores without reducing signal intensity from any of the target proteins in these parallel multiplex immunofluorescent assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Multiplex automation,Fluorescence imaging,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Accordingly, inactivation of p53 in tumor cells shapes interactions with the immune system and influences the anti-tumor immune response. Mutation or deletion of p53 in immune cells also favors tumor development and progression. However, to date, a comprehensive study of immune cell populations and the anti-tumor immune response has not been undertaken in the context of LFS. We hypothesized that germline <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation carriers possess dysfunctional immune cells and\/or immune responses, supporting LFS-associated tumor progression. Our preliminary data indicate a profound defect in tumor-immune surveillance in an LFS murine model. We observed that MC38 cancer cells develop significantly faster into tumors when injected into LFS mice (harboring a gain-of-function mutation <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H\/WT<\/sup>) compared to wildtype (WT) control<sup> <\/sup>mice. Importantly, we identified significant alterations in immune cell compositions and phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as well as immune organs using flow cytometry.

Altogether, an improved understanding of anti-tumor immune dysfunction in the context of germline <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation may reveal the potential for innovative therapies to target different facets of the immune system to intercept cancer progression in LFS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,p53 mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Camilla Giovino<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Fischer<sup><\/sup>, Noel Ong<sup><\/sup>, Ashby Kissoondoyal<sup><\/sup>, Ran Kafri<sup><\/sup>, David Malkin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"28e1dc42-8f85-4a49-80a9-9d3ff23155cc","ControlNumber":"916","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Tissue slides were stained with multiplex Opal immunofluorescence for CD8, CD68, CK, PD-1, PD-L1, FoxP3, and DAPI using a Leica Bond automated stainer. Slides were scanned at 20x magnification by Akoya Polaris whole slide scanner and spectrally unmixed.

There is abundant CD8 T cell infiltration in the tumor at early stage I and this decreased significantly (p=0.05) at higher stages. PD-1&#8722; CD8 T cells significantly dropped with higher stage, while PD-1+ CD8 T cells did not. On the other hand, macrophage infiltration increased as stage increased, with most of the increase driven by PD-L1&#8722; macrophages.

Several studies have already highlighted the importance of TME in dictating progression steps and response to therapies; however, a transcriptome-based molecular subtyping of patients in lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs) can further determine the distinct tumor immune microenvironment (TiME), which can eventually provide a systematic overview to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients.<br \/>Material and method: To elucidate such nature of interactions between tumor cells and cells comprising the TME, we exploited the transcriptome of 300 early stages (Ib-IIIa) NSCLC recruited in the prospective observational clinical trial PROMOLE. With the help of a clustering approach, initially we performed a molecular-based virtual stratification\/dissection on the NSCLC patients. Next, to elucidate the relative cell-type abundance, a deconvolution approach was applied to identify the possibility of tumor infiltrating immune cells within these subgroups. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was then used to substantiate these predictions on tumor cells.<br \/>Results and discussion: The resulting subgroups of LUADs and LUSCs are biologically well-characterized by mutational and gene expression profiles. Cell-type abundance approach identified samples which are enriched with tumor infiltrating immune cells like Neutrophils, Tcells, macrophages, etc. These findings were positively confirmed by IHC with multiple cell markers such as MPO, CD4, CD8, CD68, etc. Integrating these two results highlighted the proportion of TiME in the two different sub-populations along with shedding some light on the crosstalk happening between different cancer-\/immune- cell lines.<br \/>Conclusion: The in-silico predictions on bulk RNA data by virtual micro-dissection, distinguished the two distinct NSCLC subtypes, each associated with clinical and molecular features.

Over the last decade, new therapies have allowed long-term survival for patients even in advanced stages. However, only a minority of patients benefits from these therapies and patients often grow resistant over time. An important mechanism that contributes to cancer growth and the development of therapy resistances is the cross-talk between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironment, in particular fibroblasts and macrophages. In this context, we explored whether the tetraspanin CD63 - which is commonly found on intra- and extracellular membranes - stimulates cancer growth and mediates pro-tumorigenic functions of the tissue microenvironment in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed patient tissue via immunohistochemistry and in-situ-hybridization. We deleted CD63 in cancer cell lines (A549, H810, LC19) and primary fibroblasts via CRISPR-Cas9. To assess phagocytosis, we used in vitro EdU assays and adaptive transfer models in vivo, and identified changes in cell signaling via mass spectrometry. We used an in vitro phagocytosis assay to determine the effect of CD63 on cancer cell phagocytosis through macrophages and analyzed the expression of M1 and M2-associated surface markers through flow cytometry upon co-culturing PBMC with cancer cells over one week.<br \/>Results: In patient sections, cancer tissue did not only express more CD63 on the gene expression and protein level but a stronger CD63 expression also correlated with a denser macrophage infiltrate. Looking for pro-tumorigenic functions, deleting CD63 in three cancer cell lines reduced cancer cell growth both in vitro and in an adaptive transfer model in vivo. Additionally, deleting CD63 impaired the pro-tumorigenic focal adhesion signaling in primary fibroblasts. Concerning the interaction between cancer cells and macrophages, deleting CD63 reduced the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells and co-culturing primary monocytes with CD63-deficient lung cancer cells induced the expression of M1-associated surface markers on the PBMC.<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the tetraspanin CD63 drives NSCLC growth by stimulating cancer cell proliferation - in part by interfering with focal adhesion signaling - and facilitating immune evasion by preventing cancer cell phagocytosis through macrophages and inducing an immunosuppressive phenotype in macrophages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,Tumor associated macrophages,Innate immunity,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and treatment efficacy, but it remains unclear whether CRP can directly impact the efficacy. Therefore, we investigated the imapct of CRP on the efficacy of ICIs in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: The tumor growth model was established in CRP knockout and wildtype mice by injecting LLC cells to evaluate the effect of CRP on tumor proliferation. The frequencies and phenotypes of macrophages and T cells in mouse tumors were detected by flow cytometry. The impact of CRP on macrophage polarization was evaluated using flow cytometry and IF, while its impact on T cell chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 was analyzed by ELISA and qRT-PCR. mCRP and &#945;-PD-1 were implemented in C57\/BL6 mice injected with LLC cells to evaluate the effect of mCRP on tumor immunotherapy. The frequencies of T cells in mouse tumors were detected by flow cytometry. Expression of mCRP and infiltration of immune cells in human NSCLC tissues were analyzed using IHC.<br \/>Results: We found that tumor progression was enhanced and the proportion of tumor-infiltrated M1 macrophages was decreased in CRP knockout mice. Using human PBMC-derived macrophage and RAW264.7 cell lines, we demonstrated that the monomeric form of CRP, known as mCRP, induced M1 polarization of macrophages, leading to increased secretion of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10. In tumor bearing mice, mCRP treatment enhanced anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression by increasing CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recruitment. Surprisingly, the combined treatment of mCRP and &#945;-PD-1 induced more significant tumor regression than &#945;-PD-1 treatment alone. Additionally, high level of mCRP in NSCLC tissues is correlated with a more inflamed tumor microenvironment phenotype.<br \/>Conclusion: mCRP can enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC by activating anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Macrophages,Chemokines,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Careful optimization of multiplex antibody panels for specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility is crucial to achieving robust data and is a precondition for assay repeatability and standardization. We describe our validation procedure for VistaPlex&#8482; multiplex assay panels.<br \/>Methods: Experiments were performed using the CellScape&#8482; platform for precise spatial multiplexing. The platform enables automated cyclic mIF for readily available fluorophore-conjugated antibodies compatible with fresh frozen or FFPE tissues. The use of high dynamic range imaging further facilitates quantitative phenotyping, while excellent imaging resolution provides single-cell discrimination with high accuracy. To design a ready-to-use panel for immune cell phenotyping, individual antibodies were first screened for specificity and then optimized for labeling sensitivity. Signal-to-noise, inter-assay reproducibility, and intra-assay precision were evaluated across serial sections in a multi-stage testing matrix to validate each antibody in isolation and assembled into a panel. Resulting from this effort, we introduce a 15-plex ready-to-use VistaPlex immune profiling panel for human FFPE tissues.<br \/>Results: Image analysis of signal-to-noise ratios demonstrated robust performance of multiplexed antibodies across multiple tissue sections and tissue types. Measurements of both signal and quantitative immune phenotyping across technical replicates showed a high degree of intra-assay precision and inter-assay reproducibility. The 15-plex panel was validated on human tonsil, lung, breast, and colon tissues.<br \/>Conclusions: The CellScape platform enables simultaneous detection of multiple protein biomarkers on a single tissue section for deep immune cell profiling in the TME. Rigorously validated VistaPlex panels further streamline this spatial biology workflow and will aid in the generation of consistent and reliable results for end users.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Multiplex automation,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In both mouse and human, DNGR-1 (a.k.a. CLEC9A) is a dedicated cDC1 receptor that, upon binding to its physiological ligand filamentous-actin (F-actin) exposed upon cell death, prime cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells specifically against dead cell-associated antigens. Here, we interrogate the role of DNGR-1 in shaping the tumor microenvironment during carcinogenesis.<br \/>Methods: We utilized two models of chemical carcinogenesis: 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcoma, and azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate colitis (DSS)-associated carcinoma. <i>Rag1<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>(no B and T cells), <i>Clec9a<sup>gfp\/gfp<\/sup><\/i>, <i>Clec9a<sup>cre\/cre<\/sup><\/i> and WT (wildtype) mice on C57BL\/6 background were used. Primary MCA-sarcoma cell lines were generated and subsequently tested in a series of transplantation experiments in na&#239;ve syngeneic WT mice. Whole exome and RNA sequencing were performed to elucidate the mutational landscape and decipher the immunopeptidome of these primary cell lines.<br \/>Results: Upon challenge with MCA, there is shorter latency for tumorigenesis in DNGR-1-deficient mice (<i>n<\/i>=46), like in <i>Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice (<i>n<\/i>=43), in contrast to immunocompetent WT hosts (<i>n<\/i>=59) (median: 95 vs 113 days, hazard ratio: 1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.68, <i>p<\/i>=0.008). DNGR-1-deficient mice also display increased susceptibility to AOM-DSS carcinogenesis compared to co-housed WT mice. Majority (<i>n<\/i>=16\/24, 68%) of MCA-induced primary sarcoma cell lines derived from DNGR-1-deficient hosts are highly immunogenic and were controlled\/rejected at a similar rate, upon challenge in secondary na&#239;ve WT recipients, like those derived from <i>Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice (<i>n<\/i>=13\/19, 68%). Whole-exome sequencing of cell lines derived from DNGR-1-deficient hosts revealed that they harbor high mutational burden, including mutations in F-actin-binding proteins that have been previously associated with better survival outcomes in patients with cancer (Giampazolias <i>et al. Cell<\/i>, 2021). Collectively, these data argue that DNGR-1 protects against carcinogenesis and selects for less immunogenic tumor cells. To evaluate the degree of immunoediting which occurred in the respective primary host mice, we applied the evolutionary metric based on the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN\/dS), and found that they are less immunoedited compared to cell lines derived from WT hosts.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings highlight DNGR-1 as a novel immune checkpoint that couples cell death sensing and (neo-)antigen cross-presentation to functional tumor-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses during cancer immunoediting. Understanding the mechanism by which DNGR-1 sculpts the mutational landscape of tumors may further inform the dynamics of cancer evolution and may have translational therapeutic implications in directing effective immunotherapy strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Death receptors,Chemical carcinogenesis,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

It is however under-explored in BC, especially HR+ BC. Emerging data from recent trials (KEYNOTE-756 and CheckMate 7FL) have shown the potential benefits of ICI for treating early HR+ BC. This prompted the need for better insights into the biological link between obesity and HR+ BC, particularly its tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).<br \/>Patients &#38; Methods: A monocentric cohort of 33 patients (11 lean, 11 overweight, 11 obese) with early HR+ BC was selected for the study, whose tumor tissues were collected and subjected to snRNA-seq. Unsupervised clustering and cluster annotation were performed on the processed data leading to identification of cell types and subtypes. We then performed differential gene expression (DGEA) and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) according to BMI category for each of the immune cell types.<br \/>Results: We identified a total of 76,773 immune cells belonging to six major cell types, namely B\/plasma cell, dendritic cell (DC), mast cell, monocyte\/macrophage (mono\/macro), T cell, and natural killer (NK) cell. Their proportions varied between patients, however immune cellular composition was not associated with BMI. DGEA and GSEA revealed highly cell type-specific obesity-associated differences in the expression profile of immune cells. Notably, an enrichment of B cell-mediated immune activities, substantiated by the upregulation of Ig genes, was observed in B cells and plasma cells. This was however coupled with an overexpression of the checkpoint <i>BTLA<\/i> in B cells. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells showed a lower level of activation (higher <i>LEF1<\/i>, <i>TCF7<\/i>, lower <i>ANXA1<\/i>, <i>IL4R<\/i>), and NK cells a decreased cytokine production (<i>CD96<\/i>, <i>CD226<\/i>) and conflicting differential expression of cytotoxic molecules (lower <i>NKG7<\/i>, higher granzymes). Checkpoint genes such as <i>PDCD1<\/i>, <i>CTLA4<\/i>, <i>TIGIT<\/i>, <i>LAG3<\/i>, <i>HAVCR2<\/i> did not show significant changes in their expression in T\/NK cells. Mast cells displayed a downregulation of antigen presenting genes (<i>CD74<\/i>, <i>HLA-A<\/i>\/<i>B<\/i>\/<i>E<\/i>). DC and mono\/macro populations also exhibited both up- and down-regulation of genes involved in different immune pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: Our current data suggested that obesity was associated with multi-directional changes in the immune activities, possibly implying an unresolved inflammation in the HR+ BC tissue. Further investigation incorporating other cell types and their interaction with immune cells in both tumor and matched normal mammary tissues is warranted and on-going, which could provide more understanding of HR+ breast TIME and lead to speculation on therapeutic implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Obesity,Tumor immune microenvironment,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-L.

Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been implicated in cancer progression and recurrence, but targeting them with therapeutics is a major challenge. It is known that EpCAM is highly expressed in CSCs of different cancer types. Here, we studied the role of EpCAM in colorectal cancer (CRC) stemness. First, we show that the extracellular domain of EpCAM (EpEX) functions as a ligand for Wnt receptors, frizzled6\/7 and LRP5\/6, while the intracellular domain (EpICD) upregulates transcription of these receptors. Further, EpEX-induced Wnt signaling activates TACE and &#947;-secretase enzymes to augment shedding of EpEX and EpICD, establishing a positive feedback loop. Importantly, we show that the EpCAM-neutralizing antibody, EpAb2-6, targets the Wnt pathway to attenuate stemness characteristics in colorectal cancer (CRC). Our EpCAM-neutralizing antibody (EpAb2-6) and a porcupine inhibitor (LGK974) each partially attenuated cancer stemness, while their combination abolished stemness-related endpoints, induced apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> and markedly diminished tumor progression in animal models of human CRC. From these findings, we conclude that EpCAM stimulates Wnt signaling to promote cancer stemness, and the combination of EpAb2-6 and porcupine inhibitors may represent an effective CRC treatment, including for KRAS-mutant cancers. Our findings reveal an opportunity to combat drug resistance in tumor stem cells. Thus, the mechanistic insights gained from our study may be useful to improve existing treatments or to develop novel anticancer therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ep-CAM,Wnt pathway,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-C.

Synergistic agents often induce systemic changes in leukocyte abundance\/function due to targeting, dosage, or delivery, necessitating multi-tissue analyses to decipher immune response mechanisms. We set out to dissect leukocyte composition in lymphoid tissues and tumors by using spectral cytometry, a multiplexed, high-throughput technology.<br \/>Methods: We engineered a 40-color spectral flow cytometry panel to immunophenotype all major leukocytes and their functional subsets. Na&#239;ve and tumor-burdened C57BL\/6 mice treated with combinations of agonist CD40 (aCD40) and checkpoint inhibitors were sacrificed, and tissues were processed. Stained cells were acquired on a 5-laser CyTEK Aurora. Unmixing accuracy and resolution was validated via 780 NxN plots, and high-dimensional analysis was performed.<br \/>Results: Spectral cytometry affords resolution of 43+ parameters compared to 26 or less in conventional systems. We first designed a 25-marker backbone panel to identify all immune lineages. Additional channels were assigned to functional markers, allowing for profiling of migration, maturation, and activation in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). In na&#239;ve secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs), 35 distinct CD45<sup>+<\/sup> populations were resolved. Germinal center B cells (17% vs. ~0.3% of CD45<sup>+<\/sup> in other SLTs) and T follicular cells (31% vs. ~1-5% of CD4+ T cells in other SLTs) were mostly found in the Peyer&#8217;s patches, representing a hypothesized model tissue for studying tertiary immune structures in tumors. Peripheral blood contained the highest frequency of NK cells (4%), monocytes (6%), basophils (0.3%), eosinophils (4%), and neutrophils (7%) as a percentage of CD45<sup>+<\/sup> cells. The spleen held the largest reservoir of CD4\/8 central\/effector memory cells (5% of CD45<sup>+<\/sup>) while ~80% of all T cells in the lymph nodes were na&#239;ve. In primary lymphoid tissues (PLTs), 12 distinct thymocyte and 7 B cell populations were resolved. Wanderlust trajectory analysis revealed CD24 and CD127 as key developmental regulators in lymphocyte differentiation. Autofluorescence extraction was essential for myeloid phenotyping. With this approach, we found monocytes comprised ~60% of TILs following aCD40 treatment (~8% in non-treatment and checkpoint only controls) and had altered macrophage differentiation fates. aCD40-treated tumors also contained higher frequencies of activated CD40\/80\/86<sup>+<\/sup> DCs (~80\/86\/60% vs. ~60\/51\/50% of DCs in NTCs).<br \/>Conclusion: This work describes a novel tool that efficiently resolves leukocytes on the axes of time, tissue, and treatment. Applications range from serial monitoring of circulating blood, endpoint analysis, validation of multiplexed-IHC, and cell sorting. PLT and SLT data has been made publicly available to serve as a training tool and reference proteomic atlas in future work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunoassay,Full Spectrum Flow Cytometry,Innate and Adaptive Immunity,Primary and Secondary Lymphoid Tissues,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Aris John Kare<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lisa Nichols<sup><\/sup>, Ricardo Zermeno<sup><\/sup>, Marina  N.
