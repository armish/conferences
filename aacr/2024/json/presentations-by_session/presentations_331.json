Instrumentalizing this, TCBs have clinically proven to elicit efficacious target cell killing and anti-tumor efficacy, but they encountered hurdles related to cytokine release. Recent studies suggested that reducing CD3 binder affinity could lead to an efficient tumor killing with lower cytokine levels. However, the answer to whether cytokine release is mainly dependent on CD3 binder affinity or a multifactorial phenomenon remains ambiguous. Here, we aim to characterize the efficacy-safety relationship of different TCBs through investigating the interplay between CD3 binder affinity and the affinity of the tumor target-specific binder. For that purpose, a series of TCBs with varying CD3 affinities, and two target binders of high and low affinities were generated in the 2:1 TCB format, resulting in a bivalent binding to the tumor antigen and a monovalent one to CD3, which offers a unique opportunity to enhance the activity of TCBs.<br \/>Methods: Firstly, 2:1 TCBs comprising either the high or low affinity target binder and varying CD3 binder affinities were co-cultured <i>in-vitro<\/i> with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and human tumor cell lines, in order to assess T cell mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine release at different time points. Additionally, the impact on<i> in-vivo<\/i> efficacy, cytokine release, and pharmacokinetics was assessed in humanized mice implanted with a patient-derived xenograft model.<br \/>Results: Based on the dose-response in the cytotoxicity assay, the CD3 binders were classified into high, intermediate, and low levels of affinity. As expected, we observed that the<i> in-vitro <\/i>T cell cytotoxicity,<i> in-vivo<\/i> tumor growth inhibition (TGI), and cytokine release levels were maximal with the highest affine CD3 binder. Simultaneously, we have observed a decrease in cytotoxicity response with decreasing CD3 affinity compared to the high affinity binder. However, this was accompanied by an atypical decrease in cytokine release. Particularly, the TCB comprising the intermediate CD3 affinity binder illustrated a comparable <i>in-vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity and <i>in-vivo<\/i> TGI to the high affinity binder with a marked decrease in cytokine release [4x reduction <i>in-vitro<\/i> and 6x reduction<i> in-vivo<\/i>]. Upon testing the TCBs comprising the low affinity target binder with the same CD3 binders, we observed an additional decrease in cytokine release with the decreasing CD3 affinity.<br \/>In conclusion, we designed and generated TCBs with varying affinities in both the CD3 and target binding arms. Reducing cytokine release while maintaining adequate efficacy is feasible through CD3 binder affinity attenuation; however, the target binder affinity should be taken into consideration when interpreting our findings and designing new molecules.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,T cell Bispecifics,CD3,Affinity Attenuation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Targeting HLA-restricted peptides (pHLA) derived from intracellular cancer antigens provides an opportunity to explore the entire cancer proteome. CG1 (FLLPTGAEA) has been validated as an HLA-A*02:01 restricted leader peptide from Cathepsin G (CTSG) and is abundantly presented by leukemic versus normal myeloid cells. TCR-mimetic (TCRm) antibodies are ideally suited to target pHLA with high potency and specificity and can be engineered and manufactured using standard antibody technologies. Here we report the preclinical characterization of CBX-250, a novel CG1\/HLA-A2 TCRm-CD3 bispecific T-Cell Engager (TCE).<br \/>CBX-250 induced potent T-cell activation and T-cell mediated killing of leukemia cell lines with varying levels of target antigen density with sub-nM EC50<i> in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, a closely related precursor of CBX-250 demonstrated potent tumor control in various AML and CML CDX models at doses as low as 0.01mpk.<br \/>Although CTSG is a serine protease stored in neutrophil azurophilic granules, the CG1 peptide is preferentially presented by leukemia cells, as validated by mass spectrometry. Moreover, when co-culturing PBMCs with HLA-A2 neutrophils, we did not observe any CBX-250-mediated T-cell activation or IFN&#947; production.<br \/><i>I<\/i><i>n silico<\/i> predictions identified HLA-A2-restricted human peptides that share sequence or structural similarity to CG1. We determined the cross-reactivity risk of CBX-250 to be low, based on T-cell activation and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity assays against cells pulsed with supra-physiological concentrations of these peptides. Moreover, we observed no activity against target-negative cancer cells, including a CTSG-KO cell line. To further assess the specificity of CBX-250, we screened a panel of normal cells and found no meaningful T-cell activation or IFN&#947; production at CBX-250 concentrations exceeding its EC90. Finally, the CBX-250 precursor molecule demonstrated favorable safety in a double transgenic mouse model expressing human HLA-A2 and CG1.<br \/>Following sequence optimization, CBX-250 demonstrated robust serum and pH stress stability and a favorable melting temperature, while retaining excellent potency and specificity. A full suite of analytical and biophysical assessments supports CBX-250&#8217;s favorable developability profile.<br \/>In summary, these data provide strong preclinical evidence of the potency, specificity, safety, and developability of CBX-250, a novel, first-in-class, off-the-shelf, TCRm-based TCE for the treatment of myeloid malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Leukemias: acute myeloid,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

CD38 is an attractive therapeutic target for MM due to its high expression on plasma cells, but it is also expressed on multiple subsets of normal immune cells. Approved therapies including anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab are available, however resistance inevitably develops, and toxicities such as reduced immune cell counts put patients at increased risk for infections. To address this and other issues associated with current therapies, we are developing IGM-2644, an engineered high affinity, high avidity bispecific anti-CD38xCD3 IgM T cell engager (TCE) antibody for the treatment of plasma cell disorders. IGM-2644 kills CD38-expressing tumor cells through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC). Live cell imaging of tumor cells in the presence of normal human serum as a source of complement has shown that IGM-2644, compared to daratumumab, has exhibited superior CDC with faster kinetics and higher maximal killing, as well as increased activity on tumor cell lines that express low levels of CD38. IGM-2644 also has displayed enhanced cellular dependent cytotoxicity over daratumumab across tumor cell lines with a range of CD38 expression levels in vitro. In ex vivo assays with MM patient bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC), IGM-2644 has shown superior tumor cell depletion compared to daratumumab even with low T cell to tumor cell ratios. Furthermore, IGM-2644 can deplete tumor cells in BMMC from daratumumab-refractory MM patients. Similarly, using in vivo humanized xenograft tumor mouse models with various levels of CD38 expression, greater anti-tumor activity with IGM-2644 over daratumumab was observed. When compared to daratumumab, IGM-2644 demonstrated lower immune cell fratricide in an in vivo xenograft tumor mouse model, suggesting a potentially differentiated safety profile. In summary, IGM-2644 is a bispecific anti-CD38xCD3 IgM TCE antibody that demonstrates superior tumor cell killing when compared to daratumumab in vitro and especially in xenograft tumor models in vivo with low CD38 expression while having low immune cell depletion, potentially reducing the risk of infections. The safety and efficacy of IGM-2644 has been initially studied in a phase 1 clinical trial for relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) MM. Applicability of IGM-2644 for the treatment of other plasma cell disorders is currently being explored, including autoimmune diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Multiple myeloma,CD38,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, durable responses are still limited<sup>1 <\/sup>potentially due to expansion of clones with low target expression<sup>2<\/sup> We have previously demonstrated that simultaneous targeting of BCMA and CD38 on MM tumor cells with heterogenous expression of these antigens using dual targeting ISB 2001, enables superior killing relative to mono-targeting T cell engagers (TCE) <sup>3<\/sup>. Here we present a further characterization of a dual targeting TCE utilizing bone marrow aspirates from multiple myeloma patients. In relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) patients, which received CD38 targeted therapy, daratumumab cytotoxicity was substantially reduced due to low CD38 expression. Teclistamab is considered the next line of treatment in such patients. However, ISB 2001 consistently demonstrated increased cytotoxicity compared to teclistamab in both newly diagnosed patient and r\/r patient samples. Remarkably, ISB 2001 also induced stronger cytotoxic response in one patient relapsing after BCMA targeted therapy, suggesting that the dual targeting ISB 2001 TCE can overcome the escape mechanisms. ISB 2001 was also compared to the combination of teclistamab and daratumumab in cytotoxic assay using healthy donors. ISB 2001 shows superiority to both teclistamab and daratumumab as single agents, as well as when they were used in combination. Additionally, ISB 2001 was compared against a combination of daratumumab and teclistamab in a humanized mouse model of multiple myeloma with a low expression of both CD38 and BCMA, mimicking potential tumor escaping clones. ISB 2001 induced complete eradication of the tumors in almost all animals, whereas the combination only showed partial tumor protection, underscoring that dual targeting by a TCE is superior to two therapeutic agents individually targeting the same antigens. Based on the promising preclinical in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data, we have advanced ISB 2001 into clinical studies. For calculating the first-in-human (FIH) dose, we have developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model. The calculated FIH dose was 50-100 fold higher than that generated by a traditional minimum anticipated biological effect level calculation. Therefore, using this approach will substantially reduce patient exposure to sub-efficacious doses of ISB 2001.

This makes it an ideal target for cancer therapy. Although several therapeutic modalities targeting CLDN6 are currently under investigation&#8212;including T cell engagers (TCE), CAR-T, and antibody drug conjugates&#8212;a more potent therapeutic option is still desirable. TCEs are a promising avenue within cancer immunotherapy, but their current efficacy and safety must be improved, particularly against solid tumors.<br \/>Methods and Results: To enhance immune activation and achieve successful clinical outcomes against solid tumors expressing CLDN6, we generated SAIL66, a CLDN6-targeting next generation TCE, using a new technological format called Dual-Ig<sup>&#174;<\/sup>. SAIL66 is a tri-specific monoclonal antibody designed to bind to CLDN6 on cancer cells with one Fab arm and to both CD3 and CD137 with the other Fab arm. The preclinical characterization of SAIL66 was performed in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies which included comparisons to a conventional TCE targeting CLDN6 and CD3. SAIL66 demonstrated high specificity for CLDN6 despite its similarity to CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN9, suggesting a lack of off-target toxicity in patients. Using a Jurkat cell system harboring NFAT or NF-&#954;B reporter genes, we confirmed that SAIL66 exerts CD3 and CD137 signal induction activity depending on CLDN6 expression. SAIL66 induced activation of T cells, release of cytokines, and lysis of CLDN6-positive cancer cells. In vivo studies with a humanized mouse (huNOG) model showed that SAIL66 had better anti-tumor efficacy in eliminating CLDN6-positive cancer cells than a conventional TCE. Flow cytometry analysis in the huNOG model revealed that SAIL66 also more significantly increased CD3+ T cell infiltration of tumor tissue and resulted in a smaller percentage of exhausted T cells in tumor. Moreover, transcriptome analysis in the huNOG model showed that both SAIL66 and the conventional TCE increase expression of genes associated with immune activation, with a durable increase observed especially with SAIL66. Further, we clarified that T cells repeatedly stimulated with SAIL66 had a greater ability to inhibit the growth of CLDN6-positive cancer cells than T cells stimulated with the conventional TCE in vitro.<br \/>Conclusion and Discussion: Our study shows that SAIL66 has better anti-tumor efficacy against CLDN6-positive cancer cells than a conventional TCE. This is due to effective immune activation by SAIL66 which triggers CD3 signaling (signal 1) combined with CD137 co-stimulatory signaling (signal 2) in T cells. Thus, SAIL66 represents a promising therapeutic option for solid tumors expressing CLDN6. A clinical trial for CLDN6-positive cancer patient is now ongoing (NCT05735366).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,CD137,CLDN6,tri-specific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

However, NK cell function is hindered in the immunosuppressive and hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) of mCRPC. To improve NK cell-mediated responses against mCRPC, we designed a novel Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE&#174;) that engages with NK cell activating receptor CD16, binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) that is highly and specifically expressed on mCRPC, and has an interleukin (IL)-15 moiety that is essential for NK cell survival, proliferation, and priming.<br \/>Methods: PSMA TriKE was produced using the mammalian expression system and tested using healthy donor and prostate cancer patient-derived NK cells. Flow cytometry-based functional and dye dilution proliferation assays were used to compare activation and proliferation of NK cells treated with PSMA TriKE or IL-15. NK cell cytolytic capacity against C4-2 cells, a PSMA-expressing prostate cancer line, was measured using IncuCyte live cell imaging. In various assays, hypoxic (1% oxygen) culture condition and cytokine-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were incorporated to better examine PSMA TriKE function in the physiological setting of mCRPC. In vivo testing of the PSMA TriKE was performed using C4-2 xenograft model and expanded NK cells in NSG mice.<br \/>Results: PSMA TriKE significantly enhanced expansion of peripheral blood NK cells derived from healthy donors up to 8-fold. Additionally, PSMA TriKE induced significantly higher NK cell degranulation and intracellular IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; buildup, when compared to IL-15 treatment, after incubation with C4-2 cells. Responses of NK cells derived from prostate cancer patients were equivalent to healthy controls. Although NK cell activation was not observed against PSMA knockout (KO) C4-2, indicating specificity of PSMA TriKE treatment, bystander killing of PSMA-KO C4-2 was achieved with PSMA TriKE treatment when wildtype C4-2 cells were cocultured. This suggests potential PSMA TriKE benefit in controlling tumor antigen escape, through natural cytotoxicity once primed. In settings that mimic the TME of mCRPC, NK cells treated with PSMA TriKE in prolonged exposure to hypoxia showed retention of cytotoxicity against C4-2 while IL-15 treated NK cells showed greatly impaired cytotoxicity. Similarly, MDSC suppressed NK cell cytotoxicity in the presence of IL-15, but PSMA TriKE treatment abrogated MDSC-induced suppression. Finally, PSMA TriKE enhanced tumor control and improved survival of mice as compared to IL-15 and no treatment groups in vivo.<br \/>Conclusion: PSMA TriKE demonstrates potential in overcoming suppression of NK cells in the TME of mCRPC and is a promising candidate for advanced prostate cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Hypoxia,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are used to treat HNC patients with modest and variable clinical success. However, these treatments prove less effective for human papillomavirus negative (HPV-) HNC patients, a subset of HNC patients with markedly worse prognosis. While significant advancements have been made in cancer immunotherapy over the past decade, its success also remains elusive for HNC due to factors such as the hypoxic solid tumor microenvironment (TME). To address the critical need for an improved therapeutic intervention, we leveraged the ability of natural killer (NK) cells in killing cancer cells without prior sensitization by developing a novel tri-specific killer engager (TriKE) that can direct NK cell killing of tumor within the hypoxic solid TME. The TriKE is composed of three domains: a humanized nanobody arm binding the activating receptor CD16 on NK cells, an interleukin (IL)-15 moiety that can drive expansion of NK cells, and a nanobody arm binding B7H3, a protein which high expression can be negatively correlated with overall survival of HPV- HNC patients. B7H3 is a prime target candidate because it is highly expressed on HPV- HNC cells, but minimally expressed on healthy tissues. <i>In vitro<\/i> testing using HPV- HNC patient blood samples revealed that B7H3 TriKE enhances activation (measured by NK cell degranulation and interferon-gamma production) and expansion of NK cells from these patients at levels equivalent to those observed in healthy controls. Furthermore, B7H3 TriKE is efficacious in its ability to drive high NK cell cytotoxicity in both acute (&#60;48-hours) and prolonged (7-days) hypoxic (1% oxygen) models of HNC. Under acute hypoxia, B7H3 TriKE induces significantly more killing of targets by NK cells compared to IL-15 treatment, where NK cell cytotoxicity is impaired. In addition, B7H3 TriKE can boost the killing efficacy of NK cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia, surpassing limitations seen with IL-15 treatment. These findings strongly suggest that the B7H3 TriKE can bypass hypoxic suppression of NK effector functions in the solid TME. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies using immunocompromised mice engrafted with HPV- HNC cells revealed that B7H3 TriKE treatment significantly extends the survival of mice, compared to IL-15 treatment. Moreover, NK cells persisted in the blood of B7H3 TriKE-treated mice 28 days post-NK cell injection, highlighting the promising clinical translation of this immunotherapy. More in-depth characterization of NK cells from HPV- HNC patients are underway but altogether, these robust pre-clinical data present a novel avenue for the management of HNC for these patients. We plan to translate results from these studies to clinical trials in fall 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Natural killer cells,Tumor microenvironment,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
