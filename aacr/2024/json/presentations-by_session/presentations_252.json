First-line treatment of AML patients consists primarily of chemotherapy, sometimes combined with a targeted therapy. However, elderly patients unfit for chemotherapy receive venetoclax, a BCL2 inhibitor, combined with azacitadine or decitabine. While responses in these patients are high (50-70%, with median OS of 10-17 months), around 30-50% of them do not respond and most relapse within 1-10 years. Increased MAPK pathway activity or low frequency RAS pathway mutations have been identified as key mediators of resistance to standard-of-care targeted therapies for AML, including venetoclax. Here, we found that in DepMap whole-genome CRISPR screens, leukemia cell lines, including AML, show a particular dependency on SOS1. A subsequent PRISM screen with a selective inhibitor of SOS1 confirmed these results. To validate these results in vitro, we treated 7 AML cell lines showing strongest dependency on SOS1 based on DepMap and PRISM screens, with SOS1i or a SHP2 inhibitor. We found that in 4 of 7 cell lines treatment with SOS1i or SHP2i strongly impaired proliferation. In 3 of 4 responding cell lines, the anti-proliferative effect with either SOS1i or SHP2i was stronger than azacytidine single agent treatment. We next treated 29 primary ex vivo cultures of AML with SOS1i and found that the treatment induced strong or intermediate anti-proliferative effect in 21 of 29 models (72%). In two AML PDX models, treatment with SOS1i as a single agent resulted in approximately 25% reduction of human CD45+ AML blast cells in both models. Venetoclax treatment led to approximately 75% decrease in AML blasts, while the combined venetoclax and SOS1i treatment resulted in near complete eradication of the disease. Annexin V staining of AML monoblasts demonstrated that this decrease was due to an increase in apoptosis in the combination groups. In summary, we demonstrate that SOS1 inhibitor treatment may be used to improve responses to venetoclax in AML patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Acute myeloid leukemia,Targeted therapy,Venetoclax,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

We have previously identified high activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 within AT\/RT and shown that the highly brain penetrant PI3K inhibitor paxalisib is capable of simultaneously inhibiting mTORC1\/2 by acting upstream of both complexes. In two orthotopic xenograft models, paxalisib slowed tumor growth and significantly extended survival (CHLA-06: 40 to 54 days, p=0.001; BT-12: 21 to 35 days, p=0.02). RNAseq analysis following mTOR inhibition in AT\/RT cell lines showed an upregulation of genes involved in the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) (<i>ATF4<\/i>, <i>CHOP<\/i>, <i>PPP1R15A<\/i> <i>t<\/i>-test p&#60;0.05). Analysis of primary pediatric brain tumors through the Children&#8217;s Brain Tumor Network showed increased levels of <i>ATF4<\/i> mRNA and eIF2&#945; protein and mRNA in AT\/RT compared to other indolent pediatric brain tumors. Increased expression of ISR components suggests this pathway may be a dependency in AT\/RT. Activation of this pathway is known to be cytoprotective, however persistent over-activation drives cell death through induction of pro-apoptotic factors. Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analog functioning to inhibit DNA synthesis and induce DNA damage; notably, recent literature has correlated DNA damage to activation of the ISR with downstream phosphorylation of eIF2&#945;. We hypothesize that due to high baseline activation of ISR for AT\/RT, paxalisib combined with gemcitabine will result in an over-activation of the ISR leading to AT\/RT cell death. Western blot analysis of combination therapy compared to DMSO control showed induction of phospho-eIF2&#945;, ATF4, and CHOP, denoting an activation of the ISR. Combination therapy in AT\/RT cells induces cell death (Western blot analysis cPARP, MUSE Annexin V assay, SynergyFinder BLISS score [viability] CHLA-06: 21.50, CHLA-266: 22.60) and synergizes to decrease cell growth (SynergyFinder BLISS score [inhibition] CHLA-06: 16.80, BT-12: 14.30, CHLA-266: 13.90, BT-37: 11.40, CHLA-05: 10.40). Paxalisib\/gemcitabine combination therapy in murine orthotopic xenograft models of AT\/RT has slowed tumor growth (bioluminescent imaging) and led to significant extension of survival. Mice bearing BT-37 orthotopic xenografts and treated with vehicle control had a median survival of 56 days, while all of the paxalisib\/gemcitabine treated mice were alive at 100 days of treatment (p&#60;0.0001). In CHLA-06 orthotopic tumors combination therapy extended median survival from 22 days for control to 82.5 days (p&#60;0.0001). Based on these findings, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) is planning to include paxalisib\/gemcitabine combination therapy in the next international clinical trial for patients with relapsed\/recurrent AT\/RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Gemcitabine,Pediatric cancers,Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

First line treatment for most STS is anthracycline-based, with gemcitabine-based combinations, pazopanib or ifosfamide as treatment options in refractory\/relapsed STS. There is a clinical unmet need to improve treatment options for STS as median time to progression following second- and third-line treatments is less than 4 months. We have previously demonstrated in a 71-patient relapsed\/refractory non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma clinical study that a functional precision medicine platform can effectively guide treatment, with several exceptional responders (Science Translational Medicine, 2022). This ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP), analyses a predesigned array of 155 test combinations performed on a primary patient sample to rank and compare all possible therapeutic combinations from a 12-drug set. In this study, we evaluated clinical concordance of QPOP to predict treatment outcomes in an STS cohort. We also explored QPOP&#8217;s combination therapy ranking function to identify novel combinations that may benefit larger groups of STS patients when appropriately guided.<br \/>Experimental Detail: A 12-drug set comprised of STS standard of care, FDA approved drugs and promising investigational drugs was evaluated in QPOP analysis of primary STS tumor samples. Ex vivo cultures of primary STS samples were treated with a predesigned array of 155 test combinations to provide a quantitative phenotypic output for each test combination. This dataset was analyzed by QPOP to rank all possible drug combinations towards a predicted treatment outcome. Concordance analysis was then performed comparing patient sample results with either parallel treatment initiated at time of sample collection or physician choice to use QPOP-guided treatment. Validation of QPOP-derived top-ranked drug combinations was also performed.<br \/>Results: 12-drug, 3-level QPOP was successfully performed on 45 of 51 primary patient samples. Clinical concordance analysis showed QPOP had a total predictive value (TPV) of 76.9% and an AUC<sub>ROC<\/sub> of 85.7%. Exceptional responders to guided treatment with pazopanib or eribulin were observed. Additionally, top-ranked epigenetic-based combinations were identified as effective across multiple STS subtypes and validated preclinically.<br \/>Conclusion: The results show the potential for QPOP to predict clinical response in solid cancers, such as STS. Furthermore, QPOP can improve drug development pipelines through patient samples-based design of effective combinations with investigational drugs or underutilized drugs that may benefit larger populations of patients or specific subgroups of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Ex vivo,Combination therapy,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Targeted degradation strategies encompass relatively large hetero-bifunctional small molecules (hSMs) that are built from target and effector ligands joined by a linker to much smaller molecular glues that have limited affinity for the target or effector proteins outside of a ternary complex. There is good reason for medicinal chemists to move from linkered hSMs toward glue-like scaffolds. Molecular glues can be considerably smaller, e.g., the IMiDs, and thus are less likely to possess atoms and functional motifs that add up to poor permeability and higher protein binding.<br \/>Guided by the principle that hSMs with reduced molecular weight will have superior druglike properties, we have used SMARCA2, a potential therapeutic target in patients that have both copies of SMARCA4 inactivated, as a test of our own ability to drive rapid target degradation in relevant models. The hetero-bifunctional degraders that resulted from our work trade conventional linkers for chemical spacers that orient SMARCA2 and VHL to promote fortuitous protein-protein contacts in the ternary complex. Following in the footsteps of previously published works, we employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR), x-ray crystallography, and molecular modeling to understand the relationships between our cell-based metrics of degrader activity and the biophysical parameters that describe the ternary complex. Consequently, we found that cooperativity (&#945;) and ternary complex affinity (K<sub>LPT<\/sub>) correlated well with both DC50 and initial rate of degradation. Within our series of novel SMARCA2 degraders, compound 1 exhibited exceptional cooperativity and ternary complex affinity, &#945; = 12.8 and K<sub>LPT<\/sub> = 4.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1. The result of high cooperativity and enhanced affinity was rapid and near complete SMARCA2 degradation. Treatment of a cancer cell line with compound 1 resulted in 50% of SMARCA2 being degraded<br \/>in under 30 minutes, and greater than 90% degradation in 2 hours. Most importantly, the near complete degradation of SMARCA2 resulted in potent effects on SWI\/SNF dependent transcription in vitro and in inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Small molecule drugs,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

Recurrent fs events involved S1203Afs*52 (24%; n=150) and R1308Efs*64 (14%; n=89), among others. When comparing monoallelic (monoall) vs biallelic (biall) <i>PTCH1<\/i> alterations through FACETS annotation, monoall showed a strong association with higher TMB (p&#60;0.01) whereas biall were associated with higher loss of heterozygosity (LOH; p&#60;0.01). In the 16 non-BCC patients treated with HPIs, histologies included lung squamous cell cancer (SCC; n=4), cutaneous SCC (n=2), medulloblastoma (n=2), carcinosarcoma (n=2), osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, sebaceous ADC, anal SCC and CRC (each n=1). TMB &#8805;10 was seen in 31% (n=5), all of which were MSI-low. Tumor regressions on HPI were seen in 50% (n=8), including lung SCC, cutaneous SCC, sebaceous ADC and medulloblastoma, with median time to response of 3.6 months (mo). Median PFS on HPI was 3.9 mo and median OS was 22.7 mo. Median PFS was higher in patients with TMB &#8805;10 vs TMB &#60;10 (11.8 vs. 1.8 mo, p=0.02).<br \/>Conclusion: <i>PTCH1<\/i> LOF alterations appear actionable in non-BCC cutaneous\/adnexal primaries, lung SCC and medulloblastoma, including TMB-high tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sonic hedgehog,Precision medicine,Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Antoine Desilets<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Matteo Repetto<sup><\/sup>, Soo Ryum Yang<sup><\/sup>, Monica Chen<sup><\/sup>, Dazhi Liu<sup><\/sup>, Nikhil Rizvi<sup><\/sup>, Ezra Rosen<sup><\/sup>, Alan  L.

Thus, there is an unmet need to develop therapies that are uniquely cancer specific and unhindered by the emergence of resistance. We have developed an RNA therapy approach based on CRISPR technology, known as &#8220;KLIPP&#8221;, that targets cancer-specific structural variant junctions (SVJs), a so far untapped cancer &#8220;Achilles heel&#8221;, that are highly abundant across cancer types. KLIPP uses a &#8220;split enzyme&#8221; system consisting of dCas9 conjugated to an endonuclease, Fok1, that requires dimerization for its activity. By designing sgRNAs that bind to sequences flanking the cancer-specific SVJs, Fok1-dCas9 dimers are formed, leading to the induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) specifically at SVJs in cancer cells. We verify induction of DSBs by &#947;H2AX foci staining in the nucleus of KLIPP-treated cells and resulting loss of clonogenic survival and induction of apoptosis, while cells lacking the targeted SVJs are unaffected. Importantly, we show elimination of orthotopic bladder cancer tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> after turning on expression of the KLIPP reagents by doxycycline in the drinking water. Finally, we show successful lipid nanoparticle delivery of KLIPP reagents to orthotopic bladder tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> using catheter-mediated delivery, leading to specific targeting of bladder cancer cells. Independently of the cancer-driving mutations, the omnipresence of cancer-specific SVJs is exploited by KLIPP to force cancer cells into apoptosis while leaving normal cells unperturbed. We believe that the successful implementation of precision KLIPP therapy could be transformative for the treatment of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Precision medicine,Bladder cancer,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

We investigated the utility of a clinical-grade NGS assay for this purpose.<br \/>Methods: HLA class I genotypes were determined on an investigational basis by MSK-IMPACT (FDA-authorized hybrid-capture, tumor and matched normal DNA-based NGS) using POLYSOLVER for patients with cancers of any histology between March 2014 and September 2023. Patient <i>HLA<\/i> genotype matches for phase I clinical trials were identified; for a subset of patients, concordance between <i>HLA<\/i> genotyping was compared to a CLIA-certified laboratory test.<br \/>Results: 60,565 patients successfully underwent complete class I <i>HLA<\/i> genotyping (two alleles each of <i>HLA-A, HLA-B<\/i>, and <i>HLA-C<\/i>). The median age at diagnosis was 64 years old and most patients were female (55%) and white (76%).
