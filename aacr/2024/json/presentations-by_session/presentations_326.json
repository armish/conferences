[{"Abstract":"The Hippo pathway regulates critical cellular processes during development. In ~10% of human cancers, Hippo pathway dysregulation results in YAP\/TAZ overactivation and increased TEAD-dependent transcription that promotes tumor growth and therapy resistance - often by supporting drug-tolerant persister survival. In 40% of malignant mesotheliomas (MM), neurofibromatosis 2 (<i>NF2<\/i>) gene mutations inactivate the Merlin protein, an upstream negative regulator of TEAD. Preclinical studies indicate high TEAD dependency in <i>NF2<\/i>-mutant MM. We have discovered an array of potent covalent and non-covalent small molecule inhibitors that occupy the palmitate-binding pocket of TEAD proteins, with varying paralog selectivity profiles. OPN-9840 is an oral non-covalent pan-TEAD inhibitor displaying dose-dependent and on-target <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy for NCI-H226, an <i>NF2<\/i>-mutant MM cell line. OPN-9840 showed equivalent binding in thermal shift assays (10<sup>o<\/sup>C delta Tm) for depalmitoylated TEAD1-4 proteins, and blocked TEAD reporter activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 100nM) and NCI-H226 cell growth (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 400nM). In an NCI-H226 xenograft model, OPN-9840 dosed orally for 14 days exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) from 5 to 50 mg\/kg PO (88 to &#62;100% TGI) with tumor regression in the 15 (2\/8 mice) and 50 mg\/kg (4\/8 mice) dose groups. qPCR of OPN-9840-treated tumors confirmed 50-70% downregulation of canonical TEAD targets, <i>CTGF <\/i>and <i>CYR61<\/i>. OPN-9840 shows a favorable safety profile, including a lack of cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#62;50&#181;M) in HEK293T and HepG2 cells. Additionally, OPN-9840 caused no body weight loss in the NCI-H226 xenograft model following 14 days of dosing. <i>In vitro<\/i> evaluation of OPN-9840 in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) specific parallel artificial membrane permeability assay exhibited high BBB penetration potential (-Log P<sub>e<\/sub> = 4.7). High oral exposure was achieved at all dose levels (AUC<sub>0-24<\/sub> &#62; 100,000 h&#8226;ng\/mL) after 14 days in the NCI-H226 study. We next investigated synergy between TEAD inhibition and targeted therapy in MM. Combined treatment of one of our pan-TEAD covalent compounds, OPN-9652 (from a separate chemical series to OPN-9840), at 50 mg\/kg with 1 mg\/kg trametinib resulted in NCI-H226 xenograft tumor regression (130% TGI) whereas trametinib alone only led to decreased tumor growth (74% TGI). RNA-Seq of treated tumors revealed that OPN-9652 and trametinib synergistically inhibited TEAD downstream target genes, including <i>ANKRD1<\/i> and <i>CTGF<\/i>. OPN-9652 as a single agent caused significant downregulation of E2F targets, such as <i>MYC<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>, suggesting decreased proliferation. In summary, OPN-9840 is a potent pan-TEAD inhibitor that shows monotherapy efficacy in MM. As we observed synergy between another pan-TEAD inhibitor, OPN-9652, with trametinib, we are exploring synergy of OPN-9840 with additional targeted therapies in tumor types beyond MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Hippo pathway,Mesothelioma,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.-Y.

Aberrant activation of YAP\/TAZ has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, metastasis and the resistance to targeted therapeutics, including MAPK and RTK inhibitors. Among the four TEAD paralogs, TEAD4 is found widely overexpressed in various solid tumors and potentially less associated with YAP\/TEAD-related renal toxicity. Here we reported the identification of ETS-005, a highly selective TEAD4 small molecule inhibitor that shows preference for binding to the palmitoylation pocket of TEAD4 than other TEAD paralogs over 15 folds. ETS-005 displayed low nanomolar inhibition of cell proliferation in NF2 or LATS1\/2 mutant mesothelioma in vitro, and robust anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. ETS-005 showed favorable oral availability, high brain penetration capability and broad safety window. Moreover, ETS-005 had relative long projected T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> in human, supporting a more convenient clinical QD dosing schedule. Our study demonstrated that selective TEAD4 palmitoylation inhibitor ETS-005 exhibited potent anti-tumor activity as much as pan-TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors while may gain broader therapeutic index.

It is executed through YAP1\/TAZ co-activators and the TEAD transcription factor family (TEAD1-4), driving expression of tumor-promoting genes. Palmitic acid site TEAD inhibitors have shown strong pre-clinical and clinical activity, but identification of genetic markers of vulnerability and patient selection remain an urgent and open question. Sporos undertook a broad bioinformatic analysis of Hippo pathway components and regulatory genes to identify genetic alterations that drive TEAD activity and potentially act as targetable vulnerabilities. Here, we present a key finding from this investigation. The 3p25 locus undergoes frequent homozygous deletion in solid tumors especially lung squamous cell carcinoma. While <i>VHL<\/i> was long assumed to be the target tumor suppressor gene of this deletion - we show that <i>VGLL4<\/i> is in the only gene in the peak of GISTIC statistically significance in lung squamous cell carcinoma and <i>VGLL4<\/i> and <i>ATG7<\/i> are both in the peak in Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (RCC). These data unambiguously establish that <i>VGLL4<\/i> deletion is a major oncogenic driver in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and a contributor in RCC. Because VGLL4 is the major negative relator of the YAP\/TEAD transcriptional complex and directly competes with YAP for TEAD binding - we hypothesize that Lung SCC with <i>VGLL4<\/i>-homozygous deletion would be uniquely dependent on YAP\/TEAD activity and show selective sensitivity to TEAD inhibitors. While we were unable to locate a Lung SCC <i>VGLL4<\/i>-deleted PDX, we identified a <i>VGLL4\/ATG7<\/i> homozygous deleted RCC PDX, KI2552, in the CrownBio collection. We show that treatment with SPR1, Sporos&#8217;s novel TEAD1\/4 inhibitor, decreases tumor growth and dramatically extends survival of mice bearing <i>VGLL4\/ATG7<\/i>-deleted KI2552 RCC PDX. On the other hand, VT103, a strong TEAD1 inhibitor which shows comparable pre-clinical activity to SPR1 in the NCI-H226 mesothelioma CDX - did not show any activity in KI2552 PDX. These data emphasize the importance of targeting paralogs besides TEAD1 to broaden anti-neoplastic activity beyond mesothelioma and suggest that <i>VGLL4<\/i>-homozygous deletion confers TEAD inhibitor sensitivity even in carcinomas where it isn&#8217;t the principal driver and portent exceptionally anti-neoplastic activity in neoplasms where it is. Given the wide distribution of the 3p25 homozygous deletion - our findings open a large new potential responder population to TEAD inhibitors and warrant inclusion of <i>VGLL4<\/i> in NSG diagnostic sequencing panels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,Targeted therapy,Renal cell carcinoma,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

While targeted therapies are approved for patients harboring mutations in <i>KRAS <\/i>G12C in advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, there remains a need for an effective therapy for cancers characterized by additional RAS-MAPK pathway mutations across cancer types. Previous studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) demonstrates antiproliferative activity in cancer cells addicted to KRAS signaling, including cell lines with oncogenic mutations in <i>KRAS, SOS1, PTPN11, <\/i>or<i> EGFR<\/i> or a loss-of-function mutation in <i>NF1<\/i>. These genetic alterations each function to increase SOS1-mediated GTP-loading of KRAS and increase signaling flux through the MAPK pathway. Inhibition of SOS1 by MRTX0902 is anticipated to shift the tumor cell equilibrium of KRAS towards the inactive GDP-bound KRAS, leading to MAPK pathway inhibition. MRTX0902 is a selective inhibitor of SOS1 under evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic cancers with mutations in the KRAS-MAPK pathway. In the present studies, we have shown that MRTX0902 demonstrates single-agent anti-proliferative activity and modulates ERK1\/2 phosphorylation (pERK) across a panel of human tumor cell lines harboring oncogenic mutations in <i>SOS1<\/i>, <i>PTPN11<\/i>, <i>BRAF <\/i>(class III) and <i>NF1<\/i>. Furthermore, oral administration of MRTX0902 as a monotherapy in preclinical human tumor cell-derived xenograft models harboring these oncogenic mutations results in significant tumor growth inhibition. Additionally, combination with the RAF\/MEK clamp avutometinib demonstrated greater antitumor activity versus either monotherapy treatment. These data support the clinical utility of MRTX0902 as a single agent or combination partner of avutometinib for the treatment of human cancers harboring oncogenic mutations implicated in dysregulation of RAS-dependent signaling including <i>SOS1<\/i>, <i>PTPN11<\/i>, <i>NF1<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> (class III).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Son of Sevenless homolog 1,Neurofibromin 1 (NF1),BRAF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Actually, KPNA2 is upregulated in various types of cancer tissues and serum from cancer patients. In particular, it is associated with cancer invasiveness and poor prognosis in patient. Here, we tried to present the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of KPNA2 in lung cancer progression and metastasis.<br \/>Method: First, we retrospectively analyzed the data extracted from EMR for patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving curative surgical resection in Uijeongbu and Bucheon St. Mary&#8217;s Hospitals (n=165). Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on the tumor microarray samples using antibodies against KPNA2. The functional assay and gene silencing was conducted.<br \/>Result: The clinical and pathological information of the experimental group is as follows. Based on the TMA staining, mean KPNA2 score was 36.5 [0-240] and median value was 10. Based on the TMA staining, patients with high KPNA2 expression were related to lymphatic invasion (p = 0.00782), advanced stage (p = 0.0202), and current smoker (p = 0.0074). KPNA2 expression was higher in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma histotype. Patients with high KPNA2 expression showed shorter survival than those with low KPNA2 (median OS (months), 72.8 vs 42.2, P &#60; 0.0001; median RFS (months), 72.8 vs 32.1, P &#60; 0.0011) and relevant to high recurrence (recurrence rate (%), 24.7 vs 44.7, p = 0.007). Further, high KPNA2 expression was associated with poor survival outcomes. Knockdown of KPNA2 in lung cancer cells suppressed the invasion and migration of lung cancer cells and inhibited metastasis in a mouse model of lung cancer. Inversely, KPNA2 overexpression promoted cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration. Moreover, ectopic expression of KPNA2 made lung cancer cells less sensitive to<br \/>anticancer drugs, Talazoparib and Olaparib, indicating that KPNA2 enhances drug resistance in lung cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, this study suggest that KPNA2 promotes invasiveness and metastasis and is associated with poor patient outcomes; therefore, KPNA2 will be a good therapeutic target or a biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Lung adenocarcinoma,Invasion,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

Despite the fact that androgen deprivation therapy is the first-line option to initial responses, most PCa patients invariably develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is a lethal type of malignancy, therefore, novel and effective treatment strategies are needed. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combination treatment of small molecule inhibitors, SZL-P1-41, a SKP2 target and PBIT, a KDM5B target on PCa growth and progression; as well as to delineate the underlying mechanisms of suppressing CRPC. Literature reports that S-Phase Kinase Associated Protein 2 (SKP2) is upregulated in PCa and Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) serves as a histone demethylase with a crucial role in cancers. Studies showed that KDM5B is increased in human PCa and KDM5B knockout decreases carcinogenic properties of PCa cells. We previously reported that SKP2 loss partially decreases the growth of prostate tumors and that KDM5B levels are reversely regulated by SKP2 in PCa cells. However, the mechanisms of KDM5B and SKP2 interplay on PCa malignancy is unknown. We hypothesize that combination of PBIT and SZL-P1-41 treatment will enhance anti-cancer effects on PCa progression by inducing cellular senescence. Here, we showed that inhibition of KDM5B and SKP2 decreased the proliferation of PCa cells, and KDM5B KO cells were more vulnerable to SKP2 inhibition. More importantly, a combined inhibition of KDM5B and SKP2 significantly blocked malignant progression and migration of PCa cells. Mechanistically, combined inhibition of KDM5B and SKP2 in PCa cells abrogated AKT activation, resulting in an induction of cellular senescence, which was measured via Western blot analysis and senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-Gal) staining. Taken together, our results show that combined inhibition of KDM5B and SKP2 is more efficacious in inhibiting proliferation and migration in CRPC cells, and this regimen would be an ideal therapeutic approach for treating CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skp2,Prostate cancer,Akt,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Notably, the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is frequently altered in more than 50% of CCA clinical specimens. PTEN deficiency enhances proteasome subunit expression and proteasome proteolytic activity, and facilitates the potential therapeutic efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in CCA. The proteasome inhibitor FHND6091, a novel drug developed by Jiangsu Chia Tai Fenghai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., has obtained IND approval from NMPA and is currently undergoing a first-in-human phase 1 trial for multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).<br \/>Method: This study employed a comprehensive approach, encompassing both in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies. The investigation involved purified human proteasome activity assays, cell viability assays, and in vivo anti-tumor activity studies utilizing a cholangiocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (CCA PDX) model with PTEN deficiency.<br \/>Results: FHND6091 exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the &#946;5 subunit of the 20S proteasome, with IC50 value of 2.22 nM. In cell viability assessments, FHND6091 demonstrated selective efficacy in PTEN-deficient CCA cell lines, with IC50 value of 5.87 nM in HCCC-9810 (<i>PTEN<\/i> deletion, homozygous loss of<i> <\/i>exon 6 to 9) and 10.08 nM in RBE (<i>PTEN<\/i> intact expression). In a PDX xenograft model with PTEN deficiency, gavage administration of FHND6091 BIW at 1.0 mg\/kg (first week) \/ 1.5 mg\/kg (subsequent two weeks) exhibited advanced anti-tumor activity (TGI = 52.32%) compared to intraperitoneal administration of Bortezomib at 0.5 mg\/kg BIW (TGI = 31.88%). Tissue distribution studies in rats revealed the preference of FHND6091 for liver accumulation, with an exposure (AUC0-t) approximately 44 times that of plasma after a single dose. These data corroborated that FHND6091 could achieve a specific level of exposure in the target organ liver.<br \/>Conclusion: FHND6091, characterized by its irreversibility, high potency and oral bioavailability, emerges as a promising proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of both hematologic and solid tumors. These findings strongly support FHND6091 as a potential candidate for the treatment of CCA in clinical settings. Furthermore, the regulating of sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors by the PTEN status extends beyond cholangiocarcinoma to encompass various human cancers, such as ovarian, prostate, and digestive system malignancies. This broader implication establishes a theoretical foundation supporting the potential efficacy of FHND6091 as a therapeutic agent for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-09 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Proteasome inhibitors,PTEN,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Yet, PP2A is commonly inactivated in cancer, likely due to its role as a tumor suppressor. Due to the important role PP2A plays in many cellular processes, including those involved with tumor progression, there is a current need for novel therapeutics capable of targeting PP2A in cancer. Currently, none of the current PP2A modulators have made it into approved clinical use. As such, we have recently synthesized the PP2A activators, PPA24 and PPA27, using molecular docking and fragment-based drug design based on the structures of recently reported PP2A activators, iHAP1 and NSC49L. We were previously able to establish PPA24 as the lead compound in treating colorectal cancer (CRC) <i>in vitro<\/i>, compared to PPA27 and the parent compounds. Nevertheless, a single dose NCI-60 screen of both PPA24 and PPA27 indicated the cell selectivity present in both compounds and revealed the potential effect these compounds could have in other cancers. Further evaluation with an extended NCI-60 5-dose screen of PPA24 and PPA27 demonstrated a strong potential for both compounds in treating melanoma. Overall, the NCI-60 screen displayed PPA27 as most effective in melanoma across all cell lines screened, while PPA24 was found to be effective in both CRC and melanoma cell lines, agreeing with our previous findings. A cell viability screening of PPA24 and PPA27 in our laboratory across 5 melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-28, A375, Mel1241, and 451Lu) identified IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the range of 3.45-8.94 &#181;M for PPA27 and 5.99-14.45 &#181;M for PPA24. The parent compounds, iHAP1 and NSC49L, were also evaluated and NSC49L was found to be less effective in melanoma than previously found in CRC cells. Both PPA24 and PPA27 were found to be effective in cell lines with and without BRAFV600E mutation, though it appears the metastatic cell line, 451Lu, required an increased concentration for all compounds as compared to the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values found in the other melanoma cell lines. Further evaluation revealed PPA24 and PPA27 as dose-dependently inducing apoptosis in cells with BRAFV600E (A375) and BRAF WT (SK-MEL-2). Together, these findings show the potential of PPA24 and PPA27 as therapeutic treatments for melanoma with or without BRAF mutations and are currently being further evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo melanoma models in our laboratory.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Protein phosphatase,Small molecule drugs,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, clinical response has been limited. Responders eventually develop adaptive resistance by gaining additional MAPK pathway mutations, resulting in limited therapeutic benefit. High-dose pulsatile treatment with MAPK pathway inhibitors has been proposed as an alternative strategy to alleviate adaptive resistance while maintaining tumor control. The sensitivity of tumor cells to pan-inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, crucial for proliferation, creates a therapeutic opportunity window for immune cells to restore their function during an intermittent regimen. Congruently, we have previously shown that intermittent pan-MAPK pathway inhibitor treatment delays drug resistance, supports T cell activation, and enhances tumor delay when combined with immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of continuous and pulsatile KRASG12C inhibition on tumor and immune cells in order to design combinatorial strategies with immune-modulating agents that overcome drug resistance. Our data suggest that a weekly single high-dose regimen of AMG-510 is less effective at achieving tumor control in preclinical mouse models of KRAS mutant lung cancer compared to daily treatments. However, supplementing this pulsatile regimen with lower maintenance doses markedly slows the growth of LLC KRASG12C lung cancer. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that high-dose pulse regimen enhances T cell activation, evidenced by increased expression of TCF-1, Ki67, PD-1, and GITR, along with lower expression of co-inhibitory molecules Lag-3 and Tim-3, 3 days after treatment. In vitro, AMG-510 also improves the antigen presentation of OVA-expressing LLC-KML lung cancer cells via MHC class I and, to a lesser extent, MHC class II. Furthermore, we found that while combinatorial therapy with PD-1 blockade alone does not significantly impact tumor control, the combination with CTLA-4 blockade shows efficacy across pulsatile and continuous AMG-510 dosing cohorts. Overall, our findings suggest that the utilization of intermittent dosing regimens for selective KRASG12C inhibitors is a promising approach for improving clinical responses in lung cancers with KRAS mutations. Future experiments will aim to delineate MAPK pathway behavior in vivo and in vitro under pulsatile and continuous treatment, assess immunogenicity, and further characterize immune changes in the different treatment regimens, with the goal of designing more efficient cancer therapies utilizing selective KRAS inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Resistance,Immune response,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Valeria Estrada Navarro<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Vincent Panneton<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Dong<sup><\/sup>, Hyejin Choi<sup><\/sup>, Divya Venkatesh<sup><\/sup>, Rachana Maniyar<sup><\/sup>, Isabell Schulze<sup><\/sup>, Jedd  D.

However, mutation of TP53 and the resultant inactivation of p53 allow evasion of tumor cell death and rapid tumor progression. The oncogenic Y220C mutation is the ninth most frequent p53 missense mutation in cancer. Y220C mutation creates a narrow, hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the p53 DBD that reduces its thermal stability. As a result, the Y220C mutation causes a rapidly unfold of the p53 protein under physiological conditions, abrogates p53 signaling and drives tumorigenesis. There are approximately 100,000 new Y220C mutation cancer cases per year worldwide with limited treatment choices. The initial clinical evaluation of PC14586 that can restore missense-mutant p53 protein has seen efficacy in patients harboring p53 Y220C mutation even though there is still room for improvement. Here we report a brain-penetrable, highly potent p53 Y220C reactivator which has great <i>in vitro<\/i> activity as well as induce tumor shrinkage in multiple tumor models at a much lower systematic exposure comparing to PC14586. <i>In vitro<\/i>, GS-P-328 could bind to p53 Y220C protein with a single nM potency and potently induce cell death in a wide range of p53 Y220C tumor cells while have no anti-proliferative effects with p53 WT cells. GS-P-328 is also active in patient-derived cell (PDC) models in various tumor background including SCLC, gastric, ovarian and colon.<i> In vivo<\/i>, GS-P-328, at approximately 1\/3 of systematic exposure comparing to a leading clinical reactivator, causes tumor shrinkage in multiple CDX models.

More importantly, in a NUGC3-luc intracranial model, GS-P-328 could strongly inhibit growth of cancer cells in the mouse brain.

Recently, BCV has been demonstrated to display potent anti-proliferative and immunogenic properties in NK\/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL). However, its effect on other lymphoma types remain unclear.<br \/>Methods: We investigated BCV in an expanded cohort of B-cell lymphoma cell-lines (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], n = 16; Burkitt lymphoma, n = 2; Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 1), in comparison with NKTCL cell lines (n = 11). Mouse xenograft models were deployed to assess <i>in vivo<\/i> effects. Whole transcriptomic sequencing (RNAseq) was performed to examine Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and explore potential mechanisms of action.<br \/>Results: BCV inhibited viability in all B-cell lymphoma cell-lines in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 0.0798 to 8.414 &#181;g\/ml). Marked sensitivity (IC50 &#60; 1 &#181;g\/ml) was demonstrated in nine cell-lines, including the <i>MYC<\/i>\/<i>BCL2<\/i>-rearranged double-hit DLBCL cell-line OCI-LY18 (IC50 0.5 &#181;g\/ml). Intraperitoneal BCV (40 mg\/kg, 2X per week) inhibited tumor growth in NOD\/SCID mice OCI-LY18 xenografts, compared with vehicle alone (<i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001, two-tailed t-test). RNAseq showed that most cell-lines (n = 16) were EBV negative. Interestingly, the transcriptional repressor <i>TLE1 <\/i>was amongst the top upregulated genes in the BCV-sensitive cell-lines (log2foldchange = 8.12, adjusted <i>p<\/i> = 0.0004). DLBCL patient samples from two independent datasets showed that <i>TLE1<\/i>-high tumors conferred worse overall survival (GSE11318, n = 200: HR 2.77, 95%CI 1.78 to 4.30, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001; GSE10846, n = 414: HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.35 to 2.80, <i>p<\/i> = 0.0004). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation and oncogenic signaling were significantly upregulated in the BCV-resistant cell-lines compared to the rest. Notably, these findings are in stark contrast to NKTCL, in which TLE1 loss instead confers BCV sensitivity <i>in vitro<\/i> and is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients (n = 36; HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.23-10.49, <i>p <\/i>= 0.0301).<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that BCV may be a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas.

These tumors harbor large numbers of frameshift and single-nucleotide variants and are characterized by a high tumor mutational burden (TMB). The clinical benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy on MSI-H cancers were well-demonstrated, however, 50% of these cancers are intrinsically resistant to PD-1 therapies and resistance inevitably develops with prolonged treatment. Thus, a novel efficient therapeutic strategy for MSI-H cancer is still needed. Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) is a member of the RecQ helicases family and has recently emerged as a promising synthetic-lethal target in the treatment of MSI-H tumors. In MSI-H tumors, microsatellite sequences consisting of repeated nucleotides are unstable, and replication slippage causes a unique secondary structure that hinders the progression of replication forks. With its helicase activity, WRN unwinds this secondary structure to restart DNA synthesis and sustain MSI-H tumor cell growth. WRN knockdown or helicase enzyme-dead effectively inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth in multiple preclinical MSI-H models. Here we identified ZM-3329, a novel and highly potent WRN inhibitor. Helicase activities were efficiently inhibited by ZM-3329 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> less than 30 nM, and equal potency was identified on HCT-116 cell proliferation inhibition. In a panel of 124 tumor cell lines, ZM-3329 only specifically inhibited the growth of MSI-H but had no significant effects on the MSS (Microsatellite stable) tumor cell lines, indicating high selectivity against MSS. Additionally, ZM-3329 strongly inhibited the growth of MSI-H patient-derived organoids. The intracellular mechanism of action study revealed that inhibition of WRN by ZM-3329 in MSI-H cells led to the accumulative DNA damage signatures which was demonstrated by the increase of &#947;H2AX and P21 expression, and arrested cell cycle to G2\/M. ZM-3329 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in pre-clinical species, supporting oral administration in humans. ZM-3329 showed robust anti-tumor activities in multiple MSI-H xenograft models with significant tumor regression observed. Meanwhile, mice were tolerant well in all tested doses, and no abnormality was observed. In conclusion, a novel WRN inhibitor was developed, and robust antitumor activities were demonstrated in xenograft tumors and PDOs with different tissue types. In terms of synthetic lethality between MSI-H and WRN as well as broad anti-tumor activities across different tumor types, ZM-3329 would be developed as a tissue-agnostic therapy for MSI-H patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microsatellite instability,WRN, helicase,antitumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

As the most common KRAS alteration, KRAS G12D mutation occurs in approximately 35%, 13%, and 4% of pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers, respectively. It was worth noting that the clinical PoC of KRAS G12D inhibitor has been preliminarily validated by intravenous administration of HRS-4642 weekly. However, there still represents an extraordinary unmet clinical need requiring an oral KRAS G12D inhibitor featuring higher potency and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. We disclose herein the development of an orally bioavailable, highly potent and selective KRAS G12D inhibitor, SHR1127.SHR1127 demonstrated picomolar binding affinity, with a K<sub>D<\/sub> value of 0.06 nM in a SPR binding assay with GDP-loaded KRAS G12D protein. SHR1127 significantly inhibited ERK phosphorylation with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 0.05 nM and 0.19 nM in GP2d and AGS cell lines, respectively. More importantly, 3D viability assay showed that SHR1127 displayed extremely high anti-proliferative activity against GP2d, AGS and AsPC-1 cell lines with the IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 0.05, 0.83 and 0.92 nM, respectively. The selectivity over KRAS WT PC9 cells, KRAS G12C and G12V mutant cell lines was more than 500-fold. Additionally, SHR1127 displayed excellent human hepatocyte stability (T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> &#62; 1000 min) and desirable physicochemical properties. Moreover, SHR1127 exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic profiles with dose-dependent exposure and acceptable oral bioavailability. In the GP2d xenograft model, SHR1127 showed a robust anti-tumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, leading to tumor regression (TGI = 125%) as low as 5 mg\/kg (p.o. dosage, bid), without body-weight loss during 21 days of treatment. Furthermore, SHR1127 demonstrated no off-target activities at 1000 nM in 97 kinase panel and 78 safety panel screening. SHR1127 showed good safety window in the 14-day toxicology study in rat and dog.<br \/>In summary, SHR1127 has been successfully developed as an orally bioavailable KRAS G12D inhibitor, exhibiting excellent cellular activities with good selectivity over KRAS WT. More importantly, SHR1127 showed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles across species, and robust tumor regression in a GP2d xenograft model at the dose of 5 mg\/kg. In addition, SHR1127 demonstrated no off-target toxicity and good safety window. An IND submission for SHR1127 is planned in the first half of 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Oral,G12D,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Although a number of reports in the area of small molecules targeting YAP\/TAZ-TEAD complex is exponentially increased, there is a lack of understanding regarding how TEAD subtypes may contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, TAZ-CAMTA1 gene fusion is a driver oncogene expressed in more than 90% of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), a vascular sarcoma<sup>5)<\/sup>. Here, we explore the potential of anti-cancer efficacy on our established TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion-driven EHE model. Our TEAD inhibitor effectively suppressed TEAD reporter activity in MCF7-TEAD-luc cells and induced 10~100 nM range of growth inhibition in NF2 or LATS mutant mesothelioma by disrupting YAP-TEAD1\/3 protein-protein interactions (PPI). We found that knockdown TEAD1 as well as TEAD3 downregulate growth ability of NF2 altered solid cancer cells such as LOU-NH-91 and YD8.<br \/>Our TEAD inhibitor, showing TEAD1\/3 isoform specificity, exhibited a superior anti-proliferative effect in broader range of Hippo-altered solid cancer cells than of selective TEAD1 inhibitor. This highlights the importance of targeting TEAD1 and suggest that TEAD3 inhibition can enhance anticancer effects.<br \/>We established the TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion-expressing cells, demonstrating its oncogenic function through increased anchorage-independent growth and upregulation of TEAD target genes, CTGF and CYR61, compared to parental NIH3T3. Our TEAD inhibitor suppressed TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion-TEAD1 PPI in NanoBRET system. It also inhibited TAZ-CAMTA1 driven colony formation. Our inhibitor more greatly prevented the growth of TAZ-CAMTA1 expressing NIH3T3 cells than parental cells and exhibited mRNA expression inhibition of CTGF and CYR61 on qRT-PCR, showing superior effects compared to the selective TEAD1 inhibitor.<br \/>In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of TEAD inhibition for the treatment of Hippo-altered cancers including NF2 mutant solid cancer and TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion-driven EHE, highlighting the advantages of our TEAD1\/3 inhibitor over the selective TEAD1 inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,Small molecule inhibitor,YAP\/TAZ,TEAD,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

YAP\/TAZ activation and functional requirement have also been linked to resistance to targeted therapies by providing the essential survival signal in drug-tolerant persister\/dormant cells. As the main drivers for YAP\/TAZ recruitment to chromatin, TEAD transcription factors are the major effectors of the Hippo-YAP\/TAZ pathway involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and cell migration. There are four members in the TEAD family: TEAD1, TEAD2, TEAD3, and TEAD4. All four members have a conserved cysteine residue that gets auto-palmitoylated and a highly conserved central pocket in which the palmitate is buried. TEAD auto-palmitoylation is required for TEAD interaction with coactivator YAP\/TAZ and transcriptional activity. We have discovered and developed highly potent and selective TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitors that interact directly with TEAD by occupying the central palmitate pocket, disrupt YAP\/TAZ-TEAD protein interaction, suppress TEAD transcriptional activity, and selectively block <i>NF2<\/i>-deficient mesothelioma proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and inhibit <i>NF2<\/i> mutant tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. One of these compounds, VT3989, is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial, where partial responses in mesothelioma patients have been demonstrated, showing for the first time that the Hippo pathway is druggable and that the Hippo pathway is now a validated target for cancer therapy. It remained a question, however, which TEAD members are more important and whether it would be safer and as efficacious to inhibit one TEAD member than multiple TEAD members. Thus, we utilized our TEAD inhibitors with differential TEAD selectivity to determine the importance of TEAD1 selectivity in anti-tumor efficacy and in renal safety. We evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of several potent TEAD1-selective and pan-TEAD inhibitors in <i>in vivo<\/i> combination studies using EGFR mutant \/ KRAS mutant xenograft models. We found that TEAD1-selective TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors are less efficacious than pan-TEAD\/multiple-TEAD inhibitors in combination studies with targeted therapies (as such EGFRi and KRASi). In 14-day\/28-day rat studies, TEAD1-selective TEAD inhibitors also exhibited proteinuric nephropathy similar to that observed with pan-\/multiple-TEAD inhibitors. Therefore, based on our findings, we can conclude that TEAD1-selective TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors can have similar on-target effect on kidneys as TEAD inhibitors with broader TEAD selectivity while having reduced anti-tumor efficacy and durability of response in combination with targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,TEAD,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
