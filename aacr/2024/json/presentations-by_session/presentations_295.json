[{"Abstract":"Melanoma has been at the center of revolutions in both targeted BRAF therapy and immune therapy. However, the resistance to current therapeutic drugs has been a formidable obstacle to continuing benefit to patients. Overcoming resistance and new therapeutic agents and strategies are the primary goals of current cancer research. We currently found that metabolic pathways altered significantly in BRAFi-resistant melanoma. We hypothesized that BRAFi-resistant melanoma rewires its metabolic routes to reach its needs in energy and biosynthetic precursors, both essential for escaping the BRAFi attack. We found that five amino acids transporters and metabolic enzymes (ASNS, slc7a11, slc7a5, slc3a2, slc4a7) were the significant increase in resistant melanoma. Knockdown by shRNA or knockout by crispr\/cas9 of these amino acids transporters or\/and metabolic enzymes enhanced the sensitivity of BRAFi resistant melanoma to BRAFi. In contrast, overexpression of these amino acid transporters or\/and metabolic enzymes promoted the ability of resistance of BRAFi in parent melanoma cells. Moreover, the inhibition of these amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes by small molecular inhibitors significantly attenuated the resistance of the BRAFi-resistant melanoma whereas less affected the parent melanoma. Notably, we confirmed that blocking these amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes by shRNA and\/or small molecular inhibitors could rescue the sensitivity of resistant melanoma cells and inhibit resistant-melanoma cell growth in the preclinical mouse model in vivo. Importantly, we found that overexpression of slc7a11, slc7a5 and slc3a2 correlated with worse survival in melanoma in SK-TCGA data. Our findings uncovered the mechanism of how metabolic reprogramming fueled melanoma cell growth and proliferation for escaping drug attacks and offered a rational strategy to guide clinical treatment. The identified novel molecular proteins represented a promising therapeutic target for BRAF mutant melanoma patients with resistance to current therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metabolism,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The ever-climbing incidence rate of OC makes it the most lethal female reproductive disorder. Triggering apoptosis is one of the potential strategies to overcome chemoresistance. Recent evidence suggests that the failure of drug-induced apoptosis may be an underlying cause of drug-resistance. Molecular mechanisms of failed apoptosis in chemoresistant OC cells include p53 mutations, abnormal expression of the Bcl2 family proteins, and upregulation of other inhibitors of apoptosis that block caspases and stabilize the mitochondrial permeability pore. RalBP1 (Ral-binding protein) is a required stress-defense protein for OC, and its specific depletion or inhibition will cause apoptosis in cancer cells expressing RalBP1. RalBP1 is a multifunctional 76 kDa protein encoded as a splice variant in the human <i>RALBP1<\/i> gene (18p11.22). RalBP1 is an ATP dependent efflux transporter for glutathione (GSH) conjugates (GS-E) of products of oxidative stress, like 4HNE and GSH-conjugates of chemotherapy drugs. Our recent studies indicate that upon depletion\/inhibition of RalBP1, malignant cells are significantly more sensitive to apoptosis than non-malignant cells, suggesting that the stress-protective, anti-apoptotic activity of RalBP1 is necessary for malignant cells. This differential sensitivity to RalBP1 translates into tumor regression, a lack of toxicity, and the prolonged survival of mice bearing subcutaneous OC cells in which RalBP1 is inhibited by anti-RalBP1 IgG or depleted using RalBP1 antisense oligonucleotides. These studies demonstrate that inhibition or depletion of RalBP1 exerts anti-neoplastic effects in OC and indicate that this GS-E and xenobiotic transporter occupies an important position in the hierarchy of stress defense mechanisms necessary for cancer cell survival. Overall, the present research focuses on hypothesis-driven studies to define novel relationships between RalBP1 and signaling pathways, and to determine the suitability of RalBP1 as an anticancer target for OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-02 Drug transport and metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Liposomes,Oxidative stress,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, the tumor almost inevitably relapses due to acquired resistance. To date, several EGFR-TKIs have been approved, and the third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib, has been widely used both as first-line therapy and for patients with the EGFR-T790M mutation after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR-TKI therapy. However, the EGFR-T790M+C797S compound mutation confers resistance to all approved EGFR-TKIs. In our previous study, we experimentally demonstrated that brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody was effective against osimertinib-resistant EGFR-C797S and EGFR-T790M+C797S mutants, and is currently undergoing clinical studies. However, the tumor would relapse because of the acquisition of additional resistance mutations. Here, we first demonstrated the binding mode of brigatinib to the EGFR-T790M\/C797S mutant by crystal structure analysis and predicted brigatinib-resistant mutations through a cell-based assay, including N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. We found that clinically reported L718 and G796 compound mutations appeared, consistent with their proximity to the binding site of brigatinib, and brigatinib-resistant quadruple mutants, such as EGFR-activating mutation\/T790M\/C797S\/L718M, were resistant to all clinically available EGFR-TKIs. BI-4020, a fourth-generation macrocyclic EGFR inhibitor plus anti-EGFR antibody, overcomes the quadruple and major EGFR-activating mutants in vitro and in vivo, but not the minor mutants such as L747P. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations revealed the binding mode and affinity between BI-4020 and the EGFR mutants. This study identified potential therapeutic strategies using new-generation macrocyclic EGFR inhibitor to overcome the emerging resistance mutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Mutagenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Our previous work showed that the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) selumetinib (AZD6244) prevents lung metastasis in a xenograft model. However, clinical studies have shown that MEKi&#8217;s as single agents have only modest activity against solid tumors. Using a genome-wide synthetic lethal siRNA screening, we identified myeloid cell leukemia-1 (<i>MCL1<\/i>) as a potential contributor to selumetinib resistance. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein associated with cell immortalization, transformation, and chemoresistance in numerous cancers. We hypothesized that MCL-1 promotes MEKi resistance in TNBC\/IBC and inhibition of MCL-1 in the presence of AZD6244 overcomes this MEKi resistance.<br \/>Methods &#38; Results: To understand MCL1&#8217;s role in MEKi resistance, we established two AZD6244 -resistant TNBC\/IBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231-R and SUM149-R. These cells showed increased cell viability, colony formation, migration, cells in G1 phase, CD44<sup>+<\/sup>CD24<sup>low<\/sup>, mammosphere count, anchorage-independent growth and high MCL-1 expression. MCL-1&#8217;s biological role was evaluated by transient and stably knock down (KD) of MCL-1 in the resistant cells which showed decreased cell viability, colony formation, and increased apoptosis. To understand the mechanism mediating apoptosis, we examined the expression of MCL-1&#8217;s binding partners in the MCL-1-KD-R cells in the presence of AZD6244. These cells showed a high expression of the PUMA, NOXA, BAK, and BAX in the presence of AZD6244. Further, we treated resistant cells with MEKi AZD6244 and an MCL-1i (AZD5991) that confirmed restoration of MEK sensitivity in both resistant cell lines, resulting in decreased cell viability, colony formation and increased apoptosis. We compared tumor formation capability between SUM149 parental and SUM149 resistant cells by injecting them in <i>nu\/nu<\/i> mice and observed a time-dependent increase (avg. 4-fold) in tumor growth with SUM149-R cells compared to parental cells (P&#8804;0.0001). Moreover, IHC analysis showed high expression of MCL-1 (P&#8804;0.01), Ki67 (ns), CD44 (P&#8804;0.0001), and ALDHA1 (P&#8804;0.0001) in the mammary gland tumor tissues of SUM149-R-injected mice compared to SUM149-P-injected mice. Next, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of AZD6244 in mice harboring SUM149-R - MCL-1-deficient tumors. AZD6244 treatment significantly reduced tumor development in mice harboring SUM149-R - MCL-1-KD tumors compared to control mice (P&#60;0.0001), suggesting that MCL-1 mediates MEK resistance in triple-negative\/inflammatory breast cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that MCL-1 is important for inducing acquired MEK resistance and combining an MCL-1i with a MEKi could improve treatment outcomes of patients with TNBC or IBC who have developed resistance to single-agent MEKi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),MEK inhibitor,Mcl-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

To develop more pro-active strategies to improve clinical outcomes, our research focuses on drug-tolerant persister cells that constitute a reservoir of cancer cells that survive and adapt during the initial stage of therapy. These cells typically display therapy resistance in a reversible manner and set the stage for the subsequent emergence of cells with full acquired resistance. We utilized quantitative proteomics to characterize persister cells generated from EGFRmut, KRASmut, and ALKmut non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines after treatment with osimertinib, sotorasib, and lorlatinib, respectively. Integrating proteomics data with network analysis revealed a decrease in the signaling network associated with cell cycle regulation and DNA replication. Meanwhile, persister cells exhibited an enrichment in proteins linked to lysosomes, amino acids, and fatty acid metabolism. The data revealed a consistent metabolic shift in persister cells, with an increased dependence on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation. Small-scale drug screening was performed based on findings from proteomics and confirmed that persister cells are vulnerable to inhibitors of OXPHOS mitochondrial complexes. Combination treatment of OXPHOS inhibitors and each targeted therapy delayed the emergence of resistance. One complex V inhibitor, Gboxin, selectively inhibited the growth of persister cells. The therapeutic potential of complex V was further validated by CRISPR-based genetic knockdown studies. The metabolic transition in drug tolerant persister cells may serve as a critical adaptive resistance mechanism to provide a survival advantage under targeted therapy-induced stress. Understanding this metabolic shift may lead to new treatments that aim to prevent or delay the onset of acquired resistance in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Using novel technology that selects for rare clonogenic cells which recapitulate HGSOC in immunodeficient mice, we have identified, in therapy-naive HGSOC, a minor population of clones that are intrinsically resistant to paclitaxel\/carboplatin as well as to a broad spectrum of oncology drugs. These intrinsic \"polyresistant\" cells are a common, albeit minor, component of clonogenic cells in all therapy-naive tumors analyzed. Importantly, the polyresistant clonogenic cells share a gene expression signature distinct from the majority of clonogenic cells that are exquisitely sensitive to paclitaxel\/carboplatin, and this gene signature of polyresistant cells extends to all polyresistant clones within a patient and across HGSOC cases. We have exploited these polyresistant clones to perform high-throughput screening of small molecule \"bioactive\" libraries to identify compounds that circumvent this resistance. While single agent \"hits\" were obtained, these showed minimal therapeutic windows relative to normal stem cells of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Adaptations of synthetic lethal strategies have yielded lead drug combinations that eliminate polyresistant clones from all four cases tested at low nanomolar concentrations <i>in vitro<\/i>. We have improved these combinations via the synthesis of new chemical entities that show potent effects against both subcutaneous and peritoneal tumor models in immunodeficient mice derived from polyresistant HGSOC clones. Clonogenic analyses of these treated and untreated xenografts support the notion that these drug combinations are targeting the stem cell populations within these tumors. We anticipate that these drug combinations will assist in preventing or treating recurrent HGSOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Resistance,Cancer stem cell,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Wa Xian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Frank McKeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Crum<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaffer Ajani<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Davies<sup>3<\/sup>, Matthew Vincent<sup>4<\/sup>, William Bachovchin<sup>5<\/sup>, Hung-Sen Lai<sup>5<\/sup>, Shuang Pan<sup>5<\/sup>, Melina Khorrami<sup>1<\/sup>, Melika khorrami<sup>1<\/sup>, Raul caballero Montes<sup>1<\/sup>, Paria Mosaffa<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Hoffman<sup>1<\/sup>, Amber Su<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Houston, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Texas A&M, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Tract Bio, Houston, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Tufts University, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"859effef-f159-4ba9-ba59-af082ca63354","ControlNumber":"1109","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

However, there are still numerous patients refractory to the therapy, indicating that the efficacy of ADCs may need to be further optimized. Here, we report that the excessive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can serve as a fibrotic barrier, to the detriment of anti-tumor effects from ADCs by alleviating their tissue penetration. Mechanistically, the cancer cells can transform the normal fibrotic cells into CAFs which are featured by the hyperactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. The fast-growing CAFs would decrease the tumor uptake of the big molecules, conferring drug resistance of ADCs to the cancer cells. Targeting FAK with a small molecule inhibitor IN10018 is capable to reduce CAFs associated tumor barrier, elevating the tissue penetration of different types of ADCs regardless their respective targets. The combination regimen comprising IN10018 and the ADCs targeting either HER2 or TROP2 outperformed each monotherapy with respect to antitumor outcomes in different animal experiments. The preclinical evidence for the dual regimen of IN10018 and ADCs warrants a further validation in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Current therapies, including nonsteroidal antiandrogens and chemotherapy drugs, provide limited effectiveness and are often accompanied by severe side effects. Recently, statins have gained attention as antitumor agents, demonstrating chemopreventive effects on a range of human cancers while maintaining a well-established safety profile. However, the use of statins as standalone treatment is limited by insufficient cancer cell targeting.<br \/>Methods: We synthesized a DZ-simvastatin (DZ-SIM) conjugate that combines a near-infrared heptamethine carbocyanine dye (DZ) with simvastatin for selective tumor cell targeting. Cancer cell survival was measured by crystal violet and MTT assay. Co-localization of DZ-SIM with mitochondria and lysosome in cells was detected under confocal microscope using Mitotracker and Lysotracker. Cellular and mitochondrial cholesterol levels were detected by LC-MS. Male nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 22Rv1-Luc cells as a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. We used Swiss-PDB and Rosetta algorithms to model the structure of the OATP1B3 channel. Oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were measured by Seahorse assay. After treatment with DZ-SIM, differentially expressed genes profiling of prostate cancer cells was performed using RNAseq.<br \/>Results: Our research demonstrates the conjugate's ability to effectively kill androgen-independent and metastatic PC cells without harming normal cells. Furthermore, DZ-SIM has been shown to kill multiple human PC cell lines, regardless of androgen receptor status or therapeutic resistance. DZ-SIM has been shown to inhibit growth in human prostate cancer cell line xenograft models. NIR fluorescence imaging showed specific localization of DZ-SIM to cancer, but not to normal cells and tissues. It could localize into cancer cells by binding the transmembrane transporter OATP to primarily target subcellular organelle mitochondria, decreasing the OCR and ECAR of cancer cells. DZ-SIM can bind to multiple cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins as detected by NIRF imaging. Cholesterol levels also decrease in whole cells and mitochondria. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of RNAseq showed that the four signaling pathways in the DZ-SIM treatment group are significantly enriched in genes related to cholesterol synthesis.<br \/>Conclusion: DZ-SIM specifically targets PC cells and their mitochondria, resulting in loss of mitochondrial function and consequent cell death. With a unique subcellular targeting strategy, the conjugate holds the potential to outperform existing chemotherapeutic drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Drug resistance,Mitochondria,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yan Ou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adrian Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Ning Zhai<sup>1<\/sup>, Mouad Edderkaoui<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Pandol<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruoxiang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi Zhang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4d3d6530-b955-4277-85ed-505e85c9b241","ControlNumber":"804","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the major hurdle of targeted therapies for melanoma is resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, either intrinsic- or acquired- resistance. PHI-501 is an orally bioavailable and highly effective pan-RAF inhibitor. PHI-501 has dual inhibition activity against pan-RAF and discoidin domain receptor (DDR), a collagen-activated receptor tyrosine kinase. In this study, we evaluated the ability of PHI-501 to overcome drug-resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors in melanoma harboring NRAS or BRAF mutations.<br \/>Methods: Three drug-resistant cell lines were established by long-term treatment of belvarafenib in SK-MEL-2 (SK-MEL2BR) and each of dabrafenib and trametinib in SK-MEL-3 (SK-MEL3DR and SK-MEL3TR, respectively). RNA-seq of each resistant cell line and in-depth analysis of sequencing data was conducted, including GSEA. The anti-proliferative activity and signaling inhibition of PHI-501 were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and western blots. A long-term clonogenic assay was performed to confirm cell survival upon PHI-501 treatment. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in SK-MEL-3DR cell line xenograft models.<br \/>Results: PHI-501 demonstrated significant anti-proliferative effects (GI50 &#60; 1 &#181;M, Mean GI50: 0.3 &#181;M) in all 12 melanoma cell lines tested in this study. PHI-501 exerted cell growth inhibitory activities at least 3 to 50 times stronger than other RAF or MEK inhibitors in each of the resistance cell lines. Moreover, PHI-501 doses of less than 100 nM, significantly inhibited the colony formation of drug-resistant cells. Western blot revealed that PHI-501 retained strong inhibition of both ERK and AKT phosphorylation through downregulating pDDRs. In the SK-MER3DR xenograft mouse model, treatment of PHI-501 alone induced a rapid tumor reduction (TGI 72.1%), whereas the vehicle or dabrafenib did not display an anti-melanoma effect (TGI -7.4%). A comprehensive pathway analysis showed the TNFA-NFKB, IL6-JAK-STAT3, and KRAS signaling enriched in drug-resistant cells compared to the parental cells. PHI-501 treatment effectively downregulated those pathways in all three drug-resistant cells. In particular, PHI-501 downregulates the geneset in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling more effectively in SK-MEL2BR, SK-MEL3DR, and SK-MEL3TR (Adjusted P=&#60;.0001, and NES: -2.01, -1.72, -2.30, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: Novel pan-RAF\/DDR dual inhibitor PHI-501 has greater anti-tumor activity in RAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma, which is through downregulation of MAPK signaling and EMT-related genesets and promoting apoptosis. These data support that the clinical development of PHI-501 for melanoma refractory to MAPK inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,RAF kinase,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Sue Min Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sungmin Cho<sup>1<\/sup>, Gi-Jun Sung<sup>2<\/sup>, Ky-Youb Nam<sup>2<\/sup>, June Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Sang Joon Shin<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharos iBio CO., Ltd., Anyang, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2d5af784-125d-4392-aac2-6d960f31d0b9","ControlNumber":"1243","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3&#946; (GSK-3&#946;) is a target in PDAC and the GSK-3 inhibitor, elraglusib, has been shown to improve chemosensitivity of PDAC and survival in preclinical cancer models. In addition, data from phase II clinical trials in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer is demonstrating preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine\/nab-paclitaxel. While this early evidence is highly encouraging, the biological determinants of elraglusib response are unknown. Using genome wide CRISPR\/Cas9 library screening, we identify aurora kinase A (AURKA), an oncogenic kinase with major roles in mitosis, as a critical regulator for elraglusib sensitivity. Elraglusib treatment activates AURKA by inducing a G2\/M cell cycle arrest. We show that knocking out AURKA reduces the phosphorylation of polo like kinase 1 (PLK1), arresting cells in mitosis, and leading to mitotic catastrophe and significant apoptosis after elraglusib treatment. Strikingly, the AURKA inhibitor, alisertib, works synergistically with elraglusib to inhibit PDAC cell line growth and induce apoptosis. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting AURKA is an effective approach to sensitize PDAC tumors to elraglusib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle arrest,CRISPR\/Cas9 library screening,Aurora Kinase A,GSK-3 inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Targeted pharmacological disruption of the <i>IDH1<\/i> mutation demonstrates tumor growth inhibition in <i>IDH1<\/i>-mutated cholangiocarcinoma. However, the efficacy of an IDH1 inhibitor (AG-120) as monotherapy for <i>IDH1<\/i>-mutated cholangiocarcinoma has been proven clinically insufficient, suggesting a need for investigating predictive biomarkers. In this study, we employed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to pursue resistance mechanisms to pharmacological IDH1 inhibition.<br \/>Methods: The screening utilized SNU1079 cells harboring the <i>IDH1<\/i> R132C mutation and the Brunello genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) pooled library (Addgene #73178, Broad Institute GPP, 4 guides\/gene). The read couns of sgRNAs were normalized to reads per million, and then log2 was transformed. The log fold change (LFC) of each sgRNA of the AG-120-treated group was determined relative to that of the DMSO-treated group.

It is strongly expressed in about 20% of breast cancer (BC), known as HER2-positive BC (HER2+ BC), due to gene amplification. HER2 amplification or overexpression is a strong predictor of poor disease prognosis. HER2-targeted therapies are the linchpin of treating HER2+ BC. However, drug resistance is common. The main resistance mechanism is unknown. We exploited cell lines and mouse models (orthotopic patient-derived xenografts, and metastatic lesions in the brain and lung of therapy-resistant HER2+ BC) for experiments of genetic and pharmacologic depletion of HER2 and its family member EGFR, analysis of RTKs and no-RTKs, and evaluation of cell and tumor growth, to delineate the mechanism of HER2+ BC resistance to HER2 inhibitors and assess the therapeutic activity of PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>. PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>, a recombinant human protein, is the first-in-class dual degrader of HER2 and EGFR.<br \/>Results: Trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BC cells and tumors are highly vulnerable to targeted degradation of HER2 and EGFR. Trastuzumab is the most commonly used HER2 inhibitor in the clinic. Targeted degradation of HER2 and EGFR by PEPD<sup>G278D<\/sup>, which binds to their extracellular domains, causes extensive inhibition of oncogenic signaling proteins in HER2+ BC cells resistant to trastuzumab. This is accompanied by strong growth inhibition of cultured cells, orthotopic patient-derived xenografts, and metastatic lesions in the brain and lung of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BC. siRNA knockdown shows that eliminating both HER2 and EGFR is important to maximize therapeutic outcome. Collectively, our results reveal the key vulnerability of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BC and shows a promising strategy that overcomes trastuzumab resistance by targeting this vulnerability.<br \/>Conclusions &#38; Therapeutic Relevance: This study identifies a key therapeutic vulnerability of drug-resistant HER2+ BC and shows that an agent that targets this vulnerability is highly effective in overcoming drug resistance in this disease. The findings provide new insights and innovations to advance treatment of drug-resistant HER2+ BC that remains an unmet problem.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB2,EGFR,Drug resistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Lenvatinib, a multi-TKI inhibitor, is used as a first-line therapy for liver cancer patients who cannot receive immunotherapy, which is a component of the current standard of care. Unfortunately, lenvatinib efficacy is short. Understanding why liver cancers become resistant and identifying interventions to restore sensitivity can help prolong the clinical efficacy of lenvatinib. A panel of 20 liver cancer lines was screened to identify four lenvatinib-sensitive lines. These lines were subsequently conditioned to grow under increasing lenvatinib concentrations to generate lenvatinib-resistant (LR) models. One such model, Hep3B LR, exhibited a stable resistance to lenvatinib for up to 12 weeks in culture. Hep3B LR showed cross-resistance to selective inhibitors of FGFR4 and FGFR1 but not of MAPK14 and PDGFR, suggesting that the resistance phenotype may result from FGFR dysfunction. Unlike parental Hep3B, Hep3B LR exhibited a 3.4X increase in migration. Western blot detected an increase in pAKT, a survival marker. Additionally, proteins associated with cancer drug resistance were higher in Hep3B LR cells: Notch receptors and ligands, pStat3, and Axl. To identify means of overcoming lenvatinib resistance in Hep3B LR, a Cell-Titer Glo high-throughput assay was developed to measure the growth inhibition of candidate drugs in the presence and absence of lenvatinib. Preliminary results from the first 24 drugs screened reproduced known drug sensitivities associated with lenvatinib resistance (i.e., MEK\/ERK, EGFR, GPX4 inhibition) but also identified novel sensitivities to inhibition of PKMYT1 or &#947;-secretase, the latter a cleavage enzyme involved in Notch signaling activation. Validation of these candidate hits using a grid-based titration of both drugs showed additive growth inhibition of lenvatinib in combination with ERK, EGFR, or GPX4 inhibitors but not with PKMYT1 or &#947;-secretase inhibitors in resistant cells. Interestingly, EGFRi and lenvatinib were substantially synergistic in parental cells, suggesting that an upfront combination of these inhibitors could potentially be used before the emergence of lenvatinib resistance in liver cancer. We have established a lenvatinib-resistant liver cancer cell model and validated a drug screening assay to identify potential combinatorial therapies to overcome lenvatinib resistance in liver cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lenvatinib,Liver cancer,Drug resistance,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, the role of PRMT5 in modulating EGFR TKI resistance is minimally studied. We hypothesize that over-expression of PRMT5 could promote tumorigenesis and TKI resistance by activating PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathways. Hence, modulating this key biomarker may help reduce tumorigenicity and overcome TKI resistance. We performed qPCR to study the expression of PRMT5 in normal lung cells and NSCLC cell lines. We also compared the expression of these biomarkers in erlotinib resistant (ER) and Osimertinib resistant (OR) cells using Western blotting. PRMT5 was inhibited using GSK591 (PRMT5i) to evaluate its sensitivity to EGFR TKIs (ER and OR). PRMT5 expression in normal lung cells and NSCLC cells treated with Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) were also studied and correlated with immunostaining results from smoker and non-smoker lung tumor tissue samples. Changes in PRMT5 expression were analyzed in WT-EGFR lung cancer cell lines (H358, H2170), mutant EGFR lung cancer cell lines (H3255, H1975, PC9) and normal lung fibroblast cells (HLF). PRMT5 expression was upregulated by 1.6-2.1 fold in HLF, H2170 and H358 cells after 1 week of treatment with CSE. CSE treatment also upregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#946;, IL-8 and TNF-&#945;) in H358 cells by 1.6-7 fold as analyzed by qPCR. PRMT5 expression was upregulated in EGFR-TKI resistant cell lines, by 1.5-1.9 fold in PC9ER, PC9OR and H2170ER cells, compared to parental cells. Similar results were found using qPCR, with 1.6-2.3 fold increase in PRMT5 mRNA expression in H2170OR, PC9ER\/OR and H3255OR cells compared to parental cells. An MTT assay was done to assess percentage viability of cells after treatment of PRMT5i. While 2&#956;M PRMT5i treatment of PC9OR cells decreased cell viability by 42%, an inhibitory effect that was more than additive was seen with a combination of 2&#956;M of PRMT5i and 21nM of OR. Similar results were also observed in H2170ER cells. Migratory properties of OR resistant cells, were studied by wound healing assays. Percentage wound area in PRMT5i treated PC9OR cells was 29.3% as compared to 6.1% and 10.5% in diluent and OR treated cells respectively after 48 hrs. Combination treatment of PRMT5i and OR further inhibited cell migration with higher wound area of 41.7%. Immunostaining of lung tumor sections from smokers and non-smokers showed high expression of PRMT5 localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Microscopic analysis of 20 tumor sections from smokers showed higher expression of PRMT5 (p&#60;0.05) compared to non-smokers. We can conclude that PRMT5 is upregulated in TKI resistant cells causing tumorigenesis. Modulation of PRMT5 can prove to be groundbreaking and revolutionary, as it may increase the efficacy of EGFR TKIs.<br \/>[S.N.A. and M.P. contributed equally to this work.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumorigenicity,Smoking,Osimertinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Syed  N.

Mutations on the <i>TP53<\/i> gene occur in 5% to 10% of patients with <i>de novo<\/i> AML, with higher frequency in patients with relapsed and refractory (R\/R) AML. Patients with<i> TP53<\/i>-mutated AML typically exhibit a poor response to conventional induction therapy and have a short overall survival (OS) rate, with a median duration of 5-9 months. Although various target agents have been developed for the treatment of AML, treatment options for <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated AML remain limited. Here, we have discovered a novel drug combination that can enhance the efficacy of the conventional therapeutic regimen for <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated AML patients. For <i>in vitro<\/i> analysis, we used the human AML cell line Kasumi-1(AML-M2), which harbors a homozygous <i>TP53<\/i> R248Q mutation. We treated kasumi-1 cells with a combination of cytarabine and Idarubicin to produce drug tolerant persisters (DTPs) which is a minor population that survived the drug treatment. The Kasumi-1 DTPs displayed temporal G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest and significant resistance to further repeated drug treatment. To discover drug candidates targeting <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated DTPs, we first examined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated AML patients using patients&#8217; RNA expression data deposited in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Using selected DEGs, drug candidates potentially affecting <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated AML cells were extracted from the connectivity map (CMap build 02) database. In addition, through a literature search, drugs with the ability to reactivate mutant p53, drugs that directly target mutant p53, synthetic lethal partners with mutant p53, and drugs that target leukemia stem cells were selected as candidate groups. As a result, we selected 46 drug candidates that would be effective for <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated AML through <i>in silico<\/i> analysis and therapy strategies targeting p53. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity assay, we screened 46 candidate compounds at multiple doses and confirmed several drugs that effectively eliminate DTPs. The drug screening showed that cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors not only resulted in a significant reduction of G2\/M phase arrested cells but also induction of apoptotic cells at the subG1 phase. Furthermore, the zero interaction potency (ZIP) model of SynergyFinder (https:\/\/synergyfinder.fimm.fi) analysis showed that cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine on Kasumi-1 DTPs.

However, the key molecules and mechanisms remain unclear. We previously performed a genome-wide in vitro screen of Anlotinib resistance-related genes in human MTC cell line TT using CRISPR-dCas9-SAM system and identified ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) as a key molecule mediating Anlotinib resistance in MTC. However, its downstream mechanism needs further clarification. Based on the high-throughput DNA sequencing results of the control group and the Anlotinib screening group, a group of key genes related to Anlotinib resistance in MTC was screened through the MAGeCK algorithm and the enrichment ratio of sgRNA in the Anlotinib screening group. Among them, USP18 ranked first in the enrichment results. Analysis of the correlation between the expression level of USP18 in MTC patient specimens and survival revealed that patients with high USP18 expression in tumor cells had poorer prognosis. Overexpression of USP18 in MTC tumor cells significantly promoted the growth of subcutaneous xenograft tumors in NOD\/SCID mice treated with Anlotinib. In vitro cell experiments also showed that overexpression of USP18 promoted the proliferation of MTC tumor cells and significantly inhibited the proportion of cell apoptosis after Anlotinib treatment. Further research found that USP18, as a deubiquitinating enzyme that can specifically remove ISG15-like ubiquitin-like proteins from substrate proteins, can improve the kinase stability of Aurora B by removing ISG15-like ubiquitin modification and promote MTC tumor cell proliferation through the activation of PI3K-Akt signaling regulated by Aurora B kinase. Application of Aurora B kinase inhibitor in Anlotinib-resistant MTC cell lines significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, and Aurora B kinase inhibitor significantly increased the proportion of cell apoptosis in MTC tumor cells overexpressing USP18. In the subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of MTC in NOD\/SCID mice, the growth of xenograft tumors in the Anlotinib combined with Aurora B kinase inhibitor treatment group was also significantly inhibited. In summary, overexpressed USP18 can activate PI3K-Akt signaling and promote tumor cell proliferation by increasing the stability of Aurora B kinase, ultimately leading to the formation of Anlotinib resistance in MTC patients. Combined use of Aurora B kinase inhibitor is a potentially effective combined treatment strategy for Anlotinib-resistant MTC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,CRISPR\/Cas9,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Ubiquitin-specific protease,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Osimertinib is used as the first- and second-line treatment for EGFR exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, and acquired T790M mutation. Resistance is driven by both EGFR-dependent and independent events, such as gene amplification and upregulation of HIF1&#945;. Metabolic events also drive resistance by increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) caused by osimertinib-induced glycolysis inhibition. HiberCell has developed HC-7366, a GCN2 activator currently being investigated in a Ph1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors (NCT05121948). GCN2 activation by HC-7366 drives the integrated stress response (ISR) by inducing the expression of ATF4. This results in translation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, HIF1&#945; suppression, and apoptosis in cancer cells. Our preclinical data suggest HC-7366 can reduce glycolysis, TCA cycle metabolites, and OXPHOS, thereby causing mitochondrial dysregulation. We hypothesized that combination of HC-7366 with osimertinib could reduce resistance by evading the adaptive resistance mechanisms. We treated the NCI-H1975 xenograft model with HC-7366, a clinically relevant dose of osimertinib, and the combination for 21 days and then followed for tumor regrowth. At day 21, the HC-7366 group showed efficacy with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 55%, while osimertinib resulted in tumor regression of 97% with 8\/10 CRs and 2\/10 PRs. The combination had tumor regression of 99% with 10\/10 CRs. After treatment cessation for 74 days, tumors in the osimertinib group quickly regrew with 6\/10 tumors progressing and 4\/10 mice tumor-free. In contrast, the combination group had only 2\/10 tumors regrow with 8\/10 mice tumor-free. In an EGFR-dependent resistance model NCI-H1975 (EGFR C797S), combination achieved 63% TGI versus 31% with osimertinib. In an EGFR-independent resistant PDX with EGFR exon 19 deletion, combination benefit was seen at 70% TGI compared to 40% for osimertinib, while a PDX with EGFR L858R showed a trend for combination benefit. To understand the mechanism of action, we examined osimertinib-resistance pathways to determine how GCN2 activation could affect them. Combination with HC-7366 reduced the expression of short-lived proteins involved in osimertinib resistance, including HIF1&#945;, MET, cyclin D1, and CDK4. Combination decreased TIM17A and TIM23, proteins essential for mitochondrial protein translocation, potentially causing mitochondrial dysfunction. We found a proliferation reduction by Ki67 and an increase in apoptotic proteins CHOP, PUMA, and cleaved caspase 3. Taken together, these data reveal that combination of HC-7366 and osimertinib, and potentially other EGFR TKIs, may be an effective treatment strategy at targeting adaptive resistance mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osimertinib,Resistance,GCN2,Adaptive Stress Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Osimertinib was originally designed to target the T790M mutation, which is clinically the most frequently observed resistance mechanism to treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR inhibitors. Osimertinib has a high selectivity for the classical EGFR driver mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R) compared to wild-type EGFR. Due to this favorable selectivity profile, osimertinib has become the standard first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Common resistance mechanisms following osimertinib treatment are <i>MET <\/i>oncogene amplification, and cysteine-to-serine substitution at position 797 (C797S) of EGFR, which precludes binding of osimertinib. Fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors and combinations with other targeted agents are potential strategies to overcome osimertinib resistance or to increase its efficacy.<br \/>Three fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors were profiled in biochemical and cell-based assays: BDTX-1535, BLU-945, and JBJ-09-063. The binding kinetics for wild-type and C797S mutant EGFR were determined in surface plasmon resonance binding experiments on a Biacore 1S+ (Cytiva). The effect on osimertinib-resistant cells, generated using two different approaches, was studied in cell viability assays. In the first model, subclones of the NSCLC cell line PC-9, harboring an exon 19 deletion activating EGFR mutation, were selected for osimertinib resistance by <i>in vitro<\/i> drug selection [1]. In the second model, the EGFR C797S mutation was introduced into the NSCLC cell line NCI-H1975, which expresses both the L858R activating mutation and the T790M resistance mutation, by gene-editing with CRISPR-Cas9. Synergies with fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors were determined by profiling combinations in a 6-by-6 matrix, and quantifying synergistic effects using the Excess over Bliss score.<br \/>We will present a detailed comparison of the binding kinetics of the three fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors on wild-type and C797S-mutant EGFR, and their ability to compete with osimertinib for binding to the kinase domain of EGFR. The different fourth-generation inhibitors show various selectivities for the various EGFR mutants and differences in their ability to spare wild-type EGFR. Profiling results of the three fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors in the osimertinib-resistant cell lines and on a panel of more than one hundred human cancer cell lines will be presented.<br \/>Reference: [1] Bertran-Alamillo <i>et al.<\/i> Nature Communications 10, 1812; 2019","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,EGFR TKI resistance,Osimertinib,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We evaluated preclinical activity of BTKis (ibrutinib [Ibr], acalabrutinib [Acala], zanubrutinib [Zanu], and pirtobrutinib [Pirto]) against multiple clinically relevant <i>BTK <\/i>mutations and report on the clinical impact of <i>BTK <\/i>C481S in patients (pts) treated with Ibr.<br \/>Methods: Inhibition of kinase activity by BTKis was evaluated in a cell-free kinase activity assay (Nanosyn). Cell-killing activity on CRISPR-generated <i>BTK <\/i>mutant knock-in TMD8 cells was assessed after 3 days of BTKi treatment. Time from first detection of C481S mutation to progressive disease (PD) was evaluated in pts treated with Ibr with previously untreated (n=247) or relapsed\/refractory (R\/R; n=172) CLL using pooled data from 5 clinical trials.<br \/>Results: In vitro kinase activity was highest for Ibr compared with Acala or Zanu against C481S (Ibr IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 26.3 nM; Zanu: 84.8 nM; Acala: 338 nM) and T474I (Ibr: 1.2 nM; Zanu: 4.4 nM; Acala: 43.6 nM). Ibr maintained cell-killing activity against all tested <i>BTK <\/i>mutants, whereas limited activity was seen with Acala against C481S and A428D; with Zanu against C481S, L528W, and A428D; and with Pirto against T474I, L528W, V416L, and A428D (Table). In pts treated with Ibr, C481S was detected prior to clinical PD in 3 previously untreated pts and in 26 pts with R\/R CLL; median (range) time from first detection of C481S to PD in these pts was 17.0 mo (11.2-34.3) and 10.0 mo (2.6-35.7), respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrates activity of Ibr against all evaluated <i>BTK <\/i>variants, which are associated with resistance to covalent and noncovalent BTKis.

Our prior research showed that the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 can result in resistance to the chemotherapy drugs bortezomib and venetoclax. In order to overcome the issues posed by resistance, this study investigates the possibility of a small chemical called KS18, a novel Mcl-1 inhibitor. KS18 outperforms other Mcl-1 inhibitors such as S63845, VU661013, and AZD5991, according to the findings of our research, which shows that it is extraordinarily effective against MM cells that have become resistant to bortezomib. We establish the selectivity of KS18 through tests employing Mcl-1 knock-down (KD), and we find that it is both effective and efficient. In addition, we used immunoprecipitation (IP) and protein-protein interaction analysis (PPIs) to investigate the dynamic connections that exist between Mcl-1 and pro-apoptotic proteins. The KS18 therapy exhibits an outstanding ability to cause complete apoptosis, as seen by the remarkable 88.8% apoptosis rate recorded in MM patient samples. Not only does KS18 restore apoptosis in bortezomib-resistant MM cells, but it also synergizes with venetoclax to enhance the apoptotic response. This is an important finding. It has been demonstrated through both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> research that KS18 can re-sensitize MM cells to the effects of bortezomib, which represents a potential step forward in the treatment of the disease. In bortezomib-resistant MM cells, treatment with KS18 led to a remarkable 92% reduction in colony formation compared to untreated controls. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments that were performed on mice models that were resistant to bortezomib provide additional evidence that KS18 is effective. The extraordinary reduction in tumor weight of 55% that occurred as a direct result of treatment with KS18 at a dose of 1 mg\/kg for a period of 15 days exemplifies the powerful anti-resistance characteristics of this compound. These intriguing findings highlight the potential value of KS18 as an adjunct to therapies aimed at overcoming bortezomib resistance in MM and other associated cancers. Bortezomib-resistant malignancies provide a challenge for patients, but additional research into the clinical value of KS18 holds the potential to improve treatment outcomes and broaden the range of therapeutic alternatives available to these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Bortezomib,Venetoclax,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Although most OvCa patients initially respond to frontline platinum-based therapies with approximately 80% of patients experiencing remission, approximately 75% of those women experience a recurrence with only approximately 50% of patients alive 5 years following diagnosis. There is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic agents or methods to overcome chemoresistance and toxicities experienced with conventional chemotherapy regimens used for OvCa patients. Repurposing drugs is a promising strategy to safely and more rapidly evaluate potentially effective treatment regimens. Over the past two decades, Mebendazole (MBZ), an anti-parasitic drug, has gained much attention in oncology due to its favorable biosafety profile and potent anti-cancerous activity seen in several human malignancies. Therefore, we examined the efficiency and mechanism of MBZ against OvCa.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The i<i>n vitro<\/i> efficacy of MBZ was evaluated in cisplatin-resistant (CPR) and parent (WT\/sensitive) OVCAR-8 cell lines as well as in ascites samples collected from chemo-resistant OvCa patients by using 2D and\/or 3D cell viability assay and invasion assay. The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of MBZ was assessed in orthotopic animal models, utilizing CPR-OVCAR8 spheroids, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models with specimens from chemo-resistant ovarian cancer patients. Molecular mechanisms were investigated through western blot and immunofluorescence analysis.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Our results confirmed that MBZ efficiently decreased cell viability, spheroid size, and the invasion ability of OvCa cell lines and ascites samples. OvCa cells treated with MBZ demonstrated downregulation of proliferation markers and upregulation of apoptosis markers indicating inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, MBZ inhibited the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway by downregulating the expression and nuclear localization of &#946;-catenin and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Preclinical studies showed that MBZ at 50 mg\/kg\/day dose for 28 days significantly reduced tumor growth in PDXs and orthotopic tumor models without any evidence of toxicity.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Collectively, our study strongly supports the therapeutic potential of MBZ against OvCa particularly, which warrants further clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Wnt signaling,Chemoresistance,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells is one of the major mechanisms associated with drug resistance. In this study, we aim to identify gene targets that enhance the drug response of drug-resistant breast cancer cells through downregulation. We hypothesized that metabolic perturbation in drug-resistant breast cancer cells could revert their metabolic features to those of drug-sensitive cells. To predict such gene targets, we used a computational model known as a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM). A GEM simulates the entire metabolic reaction fluxes of a cell under varying genetic and\/or environmental conditions. We specifically targeted two engineered MCF7 breast cancer cell lines: one resistant to doxorubicin and the other to paclitaxel. First, we generated proteome data from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant MCF7 cell lines, and used them to construct the cell-specific GEMs. Subsequently, single-gene knockout simulation was conducted using these cell-specific GEMs. The initial list of the gene knockout targets was subjected to pathway analysis involving proteome and metabolome data to finalize the gene targets. The final gene targets were expected to lead to metabolic features similar to those of drug-sensitive MCF7 upon the downregulation. <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments using inhibitors were conducted to validate these predicted gene targets. This study provides a computational approach that can also be applied to other types of drug-resistant cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Breast cancer,Genome-scale metabolic model,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Treatment with EGFR-TKI (epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase) inhibitors initially decrease tumor growth, but often leads to TKI resistance. According to studies, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors express more SphK2 (Sphingosine kinase 2) than normal lung tissue and patients with overexpression have worse survival chances. However, SphK2's role in TKI resistance is unclear. We hypothesize that inhibiting\/downregulating SphK2 could reduce tumorigenicity and overcome ER (Erlotinib) and OR (Osimertinib) resistance. We studied the expression of SphK2 in both drug-resistant (OR\/ER) and drug sensitive (parental) H358, H2170, H3255, and PC9 NSCLC cell lines using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. H3255OR cells were also bioprinted with GelMA hydrogel using an R-Gen 200 bioprinter to mimic the physiological tumor environment and treated with SphK2 siRNA or ABC294640 (SphK2i). Immunoblotting was done to analyze changes in the expression of SphK2 in H358 (WT-EGFR) and H3255 (mutant EGFR- L858R) parental and OR-resistant cell lines. Results indicated a 1.5-1.8-fold upregulation of SphK2. Increased SphK2 gene expression was observed using qPCR in TKI-resistant H3255OR (4.3-fold), PC9ER\/OR with mutant EGFR (E746-A750del) (1.8-3.3-fold), and H2170ER\/OR with WT EGFR (1.3-1.5-fold) compared to parental cells. Immunofluorescence studies showed increased fluorescence of SphK2 in H3255OR (2.6-fold), H358 ER (2.4-fold) and OR cells (2.3-fold) compared to parental cells. Spheroids formed from single cancer cells can \"re-create\" the growth of a tumor. The spheroid count of H3255OR was reduced by 73.98% and 56%, respectively, when SphK2i was added to the 3D-cell culture with Matrigel, compared to the diluent and OR alone (p&#8804;0.01). We used 3D bioprinting to precisely stack cells on biological scaffolds to recreate lung tumors from patients and boost the therapeutic efficacy of these findings. When bioprinted spheroids of H3255OR were treated with SphK2i in combination with OR, the number of spheroids per microscopic field were reduced by 87.3% compared to OR alone. Bioprinted H3255OR spheroids treated with SphK2 siRNA and OR revealed a 75.8% and 84% reduction of spheroid count, respectively, compared to treatments with siRNA alone or OR alone (p&#8804;0.05). This data supports the hypothesis that SphK2 suppression or downregulation can assist in mitigating oncogenesis. We also used H3255OR transwell migration assays to examine how SphK2 inhibition affects cell migration. Combining OR with SphK2i resulted in a 94.7% and 91.4% decrease in cell migration compared to diluent and OR alone (p&#8804;0.01). In H358OR-resistant cells, combining OR with SphK2i resulted in a 94.97% inhibition compared to diluent (p&#8804;0.01). These results suggest that targeting SphK2 could be a valuable approach for treating lung cancer.<br \/>[A.K. and B.D. contributed equally to this work.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Osimertinib,EGFR TKI resistance,Erlotinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Ayesha Khan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bamby Dieng<sup><\/sup>, Namrata Dube<sup><\/sup>, Mohammad Fazle Alam<sup><\/sup>, Neelu Puri<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Illinois College of Medicine (Rockford), Rockford, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd8c3d74-9de2-4829-9124-a730bb879525","ControlNumber":"7299","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We have performed MTT viability assay and clonogenic assay to demonstrate that MT2-alone is non-cytotoxic, but the cytotoxicity of the paclitaxel+MT2 combination treatment was more significant than that of paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent. The underlying mechanism of such growth inhibition is contributed by the down-regulation of the pro-survival signaling and up-regulation of the apoptotic signaling such as an increase in cleaved caspase 3 and decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins when cancer cells are co-treated with MT2+paclitaxel. More importantly, intraperitoneal administration of the combination treatment 5 times of MT2+paclitaxel (30mg\/kg, 8mg\/kg) has a more significant anti-tumor effect than the paclitaxel-alone (8mg\/kg) or MT2-alone (30mg\/kg) treatments using the wild-type hepatic HepG2 xenograft model in nude mice. Besides the wild-type HepG2 cancer cells, we have further demonstrated that MT2 is able to resensitize paclitaxel-resistant HepG2 cancer cells by inhibiting the activity of p-glycoprotein (Pgp), a key drug efflux transporter in chemotherapy resistance cancer cells. Also, the combination treatment has shown a significant anti-tumor effect in HepG2\/DOX Pgp-overexpressed xenograft in nude mice. Taken together, MT2 is a novel chemosensitiser in combination use with paclitaxel to treat cancer.

It is currently being investigated as an anti-cancer neoadjuvant for pancreatic cancer (PC). In phase I clinical trials, P-AscH<sup>&#173;<\/sup> has generated encouraging results in terms of efficiency and safety. However, 50% of patients do not respond to P-AscH suggesting that resistance occurs in a subset of patients. We have generated PC cell lines resistant to P-AscH to characterize mechanisms of resistance.<br \/>Methodology: PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 PC cell lines were treated with a stepwise progression of increasing concentrations of P-AscH until 10-fold IC<sub>50<\/sub> concentration was fully tolerated (AscR, ascorbate resistant) as determined by clonogenic survival. Once resistance was achieved, various redox enzyme protein expression and activity were measured to determine their role in resistance to P-AscH. Proliferation and cell cycle analysis were conducted on resistant and sensitive cells. An RNA sequencing screen was conducted as an unbiased approach to identify potential candidates crucial for resistance. Finally, phenotypes associated to increased metastatic potential, including collagen invasion and in vivo tumor colonization were explored for characterization.<br \/>Results: PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 AscR cells developed unique mechanisms to tolerate high levels of P-AscH. PANC-1 AscR cells almost exclusively rely on catalase to detoxify H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2 <\/sub>generated during P-AscH treatments, while MIA PaCa-2 AscR cells do not. It is interesting to note that not every redox enzyme was upregulated in response to P-AscH treatments, including GPx1\/4. The AscR cell lines also differed in growth rates. PANC-1 AscR cells developed a faster proliferation rate, whereas MIA PaCa-2 AscR cells significantly decreased their growth. This is consistent with a shortened G1\/G0 cell cycle phase and an accumulation in G2\/M, respectively. The RNA sequencing screen revealed a metastatic signature in association with resistance to P-AscH, including upregulation of the PI3K\/AKT axis. We observed a significant increase in collagen matrix invasion, as well as metastatic colonization in vivo. Additionally, we have observed increased expression of active AKT in both AscR cell lines, indicating a potential mechanism for the increased metastatic phenotype.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate distinct mechanisms for AcsR cells to tolerate high doses of P-AscH. Although catalase has demonstrated to be a key factor in controlling redox flux, it may not be necessary for all cell types. Not only can P-AscH resistance alter redox enzyme expression, but we have also observed substantial increase in metastatic potential to drive invasion and tumor colonization. In summary, our data indicate a potential route for PC to tolerate high levels of P-AscH and may explain how some patients do not respond to this treatment regimen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Pancreatic cancer,Redox,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
