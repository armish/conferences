[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Emavusertib is a novel potent oral inhibitor of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) with additional inhibitory activity against FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and CDC-like kinases (CLK1\/2\/4). Inhibition of these onco-proteins may induce remission thereby addressing a critical unmet need for novel therapies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinical studies with emavusertib monotherapy have demonstrated a significant reduction in AML blasts with clinical and molecular responses, including patients with relapsed or refractory AML, previously treated with an HMA and\/or FLT3 inhibitors (Metzeler 2022).<br \/>Azacitidine + venetoclax (aza+ven) has been approved in newly diagnosed, unfit patients with AML. In the VIALE-A study, composite complete response (CRc) (CR, CRh, or CRi) in the absence of measurable residual disease (MRD) of &#60;1 residual blast\/1000 leukocytes (MRD negative [MRD&#8722;]) resulted in longer duration of response (DOR), event-free survival, and overall survival (OS), and better HSCT outcome compared with patients who achieved CRc but were MRD+ (Pratz, 2022). In pre-clinical studies, emavusertib in combination with aza+ven demonstrated synergistic antileukemic effects in AML cell lines, including azacitidine- or venetoclax-resistant cell lines. Adding emavusertib to aza+ven in MRD+ patients at the time of CR may convert MRD status without adding significant toxicity and confirm that emavusertib can be safely added to aza+ven as a potential new regimen in front-line therapy.<br \/><b>Study Design: <\/b>This is a single-arm, open-label Phase 1b trial evaluating safety and tolerability, PK, and conversion of MRD status with emavusertib as an add-on agent to aza+ven in AML patients who achieved CR or CRh with MRD+ based on local testing (EU CT Number 2023-505828-58-00). The primary objective of the study is to determine a safe and tolerable dosing schedule for the triple combination. Secondary objectives include MRD conversion rate, DOR, OS, and pharmacokinetics. The study will enroll approximately 24 patients at 5 to 10 sites globally. Patients will have received azacitidine and venetoclax as first line therapy and achieved CR or CRh after 1-6 cycles of aza\/ven. If MRD status remains positive, emavusertib will be added to the existing well tolerated aza+ven regimen. The starting emavusertib dose is 200 mg BID for 7 days per cycle of 28 days. If well tolerated, duration of emavusertib treatment will be extended to 14 and 21, respectively; no intra-patient change of emavusertib dosing duration is planned. The patients will continue triple treatment (emavusertib+aza+ven) until consent withdrawal, disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or not achieving MRD- within 6 cycles of triple treatment. In this Phase 1b trial, MRD can be evaluated by local testing of bone marrow. Key exclusion criteria include residual toxicities and significant comorbidities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Interleukin-1,FLT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Reinhard von Roemeling<sup>1<\/sup>, Adolfo De La Fuente<sup>2<\/sup>, Claudio Cerchione<sup>3<\/sup>, Sebastian Scholl<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Nitika Fnu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Moritz Middeke<sup>5<\/sup>, Gaurav S.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the best curative option for hematologic malignancies but ~40% of patients relapse post-HCT with up to 90% mortality due to residual disease post-HCT. A key challenge in non-B cell malignancies is identifying the right antigens for T cell targeting. Cancer-associated antigens are heterogenous, enabling rapid escape of malignant cells with low antigens, while targeting lineage-specific antigens without distinct expression in malignant versus normal myeloid cells can cause prolonged neutropenia. A potential solution is targeting minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) that are homogenously expressed on all hematopoietic cells and are genetically mismatched between donors and patients undergoing HCT. These mismatches enable T cells to selectively eliminate residual patient hematopoietic cells, normal or malignant, leaving donor cells untouched. TScan has developed allogeneic donor derived T-cell products TSC-100 and TSC-101, targeting MiHAs HA-1 and HA-2 respectively, both presented on HLA-A*02:01. By choosing HCT patients who are HLA-A*02:01 positive (&#62;98% of whom are either HA-1 or HA-2 positive) and donors who are either HLA-A*02:01 or MiHA negative, TSC-100 or TSC-101 can potentially eliminate all residual patient-derived hematopoietic cells after HCT, to prevent disease relapse.Study NCT05473910 is a multi-center, multi-arm, non-randomized controlled Phase 1 umbrella study evaluating the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of TSC-100 and TSC-101. Inclusion criteria (Figure 1) include adults with AML, MDS or ALL eligible for reduced intensity conditioning-based haploidentical donor transplantation from HLA or MiHA mismatched donors. HLA-A*02:01-positive patients undergo HA-1\/ HA-2 testing and are assigned to either TSC-100 or TSC-101 treatment arms in addition to HCT. HLA-A*02:01-negative patients in the control arm receive HCT alone. Upon count recovery after HCT, patients in treatment arms receive either TSC-100 or TSC-101, administered as single or two doses. Primary endpoints include adverse event profiles and dose limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints include relapse rates, disease-free survival and overall survival. Exploratory endpoints include surrogates of efficacy such as minimal residual disease (MRD) rates and donor chimerism rates and kinetics. MRD is measured before and after HCT using flow cytometry, NGS and ddPCR. Donor chimerism is measured by standard STR-based and novel high-sensitivity NGS-based assays to quantify residual patient-derived hematopoietic cells. Together, these assays measure elimination of residual patient hematopoietic cells, malignant or normal, and could provide early evidence of biological activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Minor histocompatibility antigen,Adaptive cell therapy,T cell receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Furmonertinib is approved in China for first-line advanced NSCLC with EGFR Ex19del or L858R mts based on the positive Phase 3 study (FURLONG) versus gefitinib. Furmonertinib has also demonstrated promising interim efficacy and safety in patients (pts) with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mts with a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 78.6% (n=28) by blinded independent central review (BICR) with a preliminary median duration of response (DoR) of 15.2 months in the front-line setting (FAVOUR study; see Han et al., WCLC 2023). Furmonertinib recently obtained FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of pts with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins mts. P-loop and &#945;C-helix Compressing (PACC) mts represent another subset of uncommon EGFR mts (Robichaux et al., 2021) that are similar to ex20ins mts in narrowing the drug-binding pocket; including G719X, S768I, E709X, L747X, V774M. Preclinical data indicating that furmonertinib is potent in models harboring EGFR PACC mts will be presented at this meeting (Nilsson et al., Abstract #4174). Developing efficacious, well-tolerated, and CNS-penetrant medicines for NSCLC pts with EGFR ex20ins mts and PACC mts remains an unmet need.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>FURTHER (FURMO-002) is the first global trial evaluating furmonertinib in NSCLC pts with EGFR and HER2 mts in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific. FURTHER is a phase 1b, open-label, multicenter study in which pts will be treated orally with furmonertinib daily. For Stage 1 dose-escalation, the primary endpoint is incidence and severity of adverse events, including dose limiting toxicities and has been completed. For Stage 2 dose expansion, approximately 120 pts will be enrolled across 4 expansion cohorts. Stage 2 Cohorts 1-3 dose expansion cohorts will enroll pts with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC pts with either EGFR ex20ins mts, HER2 ex20ins mts, or EGFR activating mts, respectively. Cohorts 1-3 allow enrollment of pts with prior EGFR or HER2-directed therapy. Stage 2 Cohort 4 will enroll EGFR TKI-na&#239;ve NSCLC pts with EGFR PACC mts. Key inclusion criteria include documented EGFR or HER2 mts by local testing and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. Stage 2 primary endpoint is ORR using RECIST v1.1.

One potential approach to improve immune checkpoint efficacy in these patient populations is to promote cytolytic T cell infiltration into tumors. This can be accomplished via <i>in situ<\/i> vaccination with chemokine gene-engineered functional antigen presenting cells (APCs) which can take advantage of the full repertoire of tumor antigens and convert the tumor into a lymph node-like environment to promote both local and systemic antitumor responses. The chemokine CCL21 promotes co-localization of naive T cells and antigen-experienced dendritic cells (DCs) to facilitate T cell activation. Our preclinical studies and phase I trial of intratumoral (IT) administration of DC genetically modified to overexpress CCL21 (CCL21-DC) revealed augmentation of tumor antigen presentation <i>in situ<\/i>, resulting in systemic antitumor immunity. However, increased PD-L1 expression was observed in some patient tumors, suggesting that tumor-mediated impairment of T cell function may be forestalling a more robust CCL21-DC mediated antitumor response. Similarly, improved PD-(L)1 inhibitor efficacy may be possible with enhanced T cell infiltration and augmented APC function following IT CCL21-DC. Therefore, we are conducting a phase I trial, combining IT CCL21-DC with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.<br \/><b><u> <\/u><\/b> <b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b><b>: <\/b>Phase I, dose-escalating, multi-cohort trial followed by dose expansion. Maximum of 24 patients (9-12 escalation + 12 expansion) with stage IV NSCLC will be evaluated who have tumors accessible for IT injection and are either (1) EGFR\/ALK wild-type after progression on a PD-(L)1 inhibitor or (2) EGFR\/ALK mutant after progression on TKI therapy. Three IT injections of autologous CCL21-DC (days 0, 21, 42) will be concurrently administered with pembrolizumab, followed by pembrolizumab once every three weeks for up to 1 year. Primary objective of dose escalation is safety and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IT CCL21-DC when combined with pembrolizumab. Primary objective of dose expansion is objective response rate at MTD. Secondary objectives include adverse event profiling and determination of drug target activity by immune monitoring studies. This trial, NCT03546361, is currently open for enrollment, and this updated abstract will highlight the feasibility of repeated IT injections in treated patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,PD-1,Dendritic cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the recommended front-line option for EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients, but patients invariably develop acquired resistance and face disease progression. JIN-A02, a 4th generation EGFR-TKI intended for oral administration, selectively and reversibly binds to EGFR mutations, including the C797S and\/or T790M mutation that causes resistance to 3rd generation of EGFR-TKIs. Pre-clinical studies with EGFR C797S and\/or T790M mutated cell lines showed that JIN-A02 can inhibit cell growth in a dose dependent manner and has a high degree of selectivity over wild-type EGFR. In vivo studies showed that administration of JIN-A02 dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in the C797S+ xenograft mice model. Moreover, JIN-A02 shown to penetrate blood-brain barrier and exhibit anti-tumor activity in an intracranial tumor model. The strong potency and high selectivity of JIN-A02 for mutant EGFR may offer improved therapeutic window in the clinical setting vs available EGFR-TKIs.<br \/>Methods: JIN-A02 is being evaluated in this Phase 1\/2, multicenter, an open-label trial (NCT05394831) for subjects with advanced NSCLC harboring C797S and\/or T790M mutation as a monotherapy. The primary object of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor effect for determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JIN-A02. The inclusion criteria are that the subject (&#8805; 18 years) must have an advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed progress disease (PD) after receiving approved standard EGFR-TKI therapies and\/or platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy is allowed up to 1 time after using EGFR-TKI treatment with ECOG status 0 or 1. Before enrollment in the study, the EGFR mutation status is determined using either tumor tissue and\/or plasma ctDNA. This study comprises three parts, dose escalation (Part A), dose exploration (Part B), and dose expansion (Part C). In Part A, dose escalation, comprised of 5 cohorts ranged from a starting dose of 12.5 mg P.O, QD to a top dose of 150 mg P.O, QD with every three subjects, is carried out where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is evaluated in subjects with 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are evaluated for 21 days. In Part B, dose exploration is carried out to evaluate the safety of JIN-A02 further and to determine the RP2D using 2 preliminary effective dose levels from Part A in subjects. In Part C dose-expansion study, subjects (n=36 for each cohort) are divided into 5 different cohorts based on the EGFR mutation (both or single positive of C797S and T790M), and the anti-tumor activity of JIN-A02 is evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 at RP2D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),EGFR TKI resistance,C797S mutation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The development of drugs that inhibit BTK has transformed the management of patients with B-cell malignancies. However, therapy using covalent BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib, and non-covalent inhibitors such as pirtobrutinib, can still result in resistance, primarily due to the development of mutations in BTK including residues C481 and L528. AC676 was designed as a chimeric degrader to target and degrade BTK using Accutar's proprietary Protein-Protein Interaction Targeting Chimeras (PPI-TAC) platform. By effectively linking a BTK ligand to the cereblon E3-ligase recruiting ligand, AC676 brings BTK in proximity to cereblon, thereby inducing subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of BTK. AC676 degrades BTK proteins irrespective of mutations; including C481, kinase dead L528 and others, and thus may be effective for the treatment of patients who progress on both covalent and non-covalent BTK inhibitors. Notably, it is also effective in cell lines expressing gain of function PLCG2 mutants, suggesting that it removes BTK&#8217;s scaffolding function. AC676 does not degrade cereblon neo-substrates, so neutropenia is not expected to be an on-target effect. This abstract describes an ongoing first in human Phase 1 trial of AC676.<br \/><b>Study Description <\/b>AC676-001 is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of AC676 administered orally once daily as monotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies.

Patients must have received at least two prior systemic therapies or have no other standard of care therapies to provide significant clinical benefit. Patients must have measurable disease per disease-specific response criteria and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status&#8804; 1. Dose-escalation will begin with an accelerated titration phase, followed by a standard 3+3 phase. AC676 is administered orally once daily on a 28 day per cycle schedule at doses ranging from 50mg to 600mg. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AC676.

E6201 is an intravenous (IV) MEK inhibitor with activity against BRAF V600-mutated MM cell lines, including MAPK resistance alteration.<br \/>A previous phase I trial demonstrated activity of E6201 in BRAF V600E mutated MM with a Maximal Tolerated Dose of 320mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> given IV once a week x 3 weeks q 28 days. 2\/23 (8.7%) of patients had a PR, 8\/23 (34.8%) had SD. Two patients with MM and brain mets achieved near-CR which led to preclinical studies that demonstrated E6201 is unaffected by P-gp and BCRP transport and achieved higher brain to blood concentration (266%).In this trial, patients with BRAF mutation + MM with brain mets, single agent E6201 given at 320mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> twice weekly x 3 weeks q 28 days was determined to be safe. One patient had CNS SD and a PR in lung mets, and a second patient achieved CNS stable disease and CR in a leg melanotic lesion. The drug was well-tolerated with one reversible AE thrombocytopenia (Gr 2). The final review showed intracranial response of SD in 2\/4 (50%) patients and systemic SD in 3\/4 (75%) patients.<br \/>Methods: We are currently accruing to the dose escalation cohort of E6201 with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily orally (n=up to 22 evaluable patients). E6201 is administered IV at 320mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> twice weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days. Patients must have stage IV melanoma with BRAF mutation with at least one active lesion in the brain. Prior local therapy is allowed if done at least 3 weeks prior to cycle 1. Participants must be on a stable dose of steroids for at least 7 days and have an ECOG &lt;!--=2. The study allows one prior BRAF\/MEK inhibitor therapy.<br \/>The primary objectives are to determine the MTD of E6201 when combined with dabrafenib and the response rate of brain mets. The secondary objectives include duration of response,<br \/>extracranial response, progression free survival, overall survival, and impact of BRAF mutation subtype and safety of the combination.<br \/>Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05388877<br \/>References:1.Gampa G, et al.

MYC deregulated solid tumors including non-small cell (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and ovarian cancer are known for their aggressiveness and frequent relapse. Analysis of a real-world solid tumor cohort including NSCLC (n= 20,470), SCLC (n=1,517), TNBC (n=2,576) and ovarian cancer (n=1,667) demonstrated MYC family overexpression and\/or genomic amplification in 47% to 87% of patients. Although MYC remains difficult to drug, targeting of its cofactors has emerged as an attractive strategy to inhibit MYC oncogenic activity. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a MYC cofactor, is a critical regulator of oncogenic MYC expression and activity. KB-0742 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of CDK9 with a long plasma half-life. KB-0742 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 \/ 2 study in advanced solid tumors (NCT04718675).<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>The Phase 1 \/ 2 study is being conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. Part 1 dose escalation comprises patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Part 2 dose expansion comprises patients with solid tumors that have a high prevalence of MYC overexpression including ovarian cancer, NSCLC, TNBC and SCLC. KB-0742 is dosed orally once daily for 3 consecutive days followed by 4 days off on a weekly basis in 28-day cycles until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Eligibility criteria include age <u>&#62;<\/u> 18 years acceptable organ function and ECOG PS &#60; 2. Up to 170 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study.<br \/>Primary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity with the goal of identifying a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Plasma PK measurements include C<sub>max<\/sub>, t<sub>max<\/sub>, AUC<sub>0-last<\/sub>, accumulation ratio (R<sub>acc<\/sub>) and t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>. Safety data will be evaluated per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0.<br \/>RP2D is informed by PD in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using assays to evaluate phosphorylation of the CDK9 substrate serine 2 on the RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain (pSER2) and CDK9-responsive gene expression.<br \/>Radiographic tumor response is assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exploratory objectives include assessment of KB-0742 PD in tumor tissue and profiling of treatment-related genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that has been approved by the FDA for HER2-overexpressed advanced breast, gastroesophageal cancers, HER2-low breast cancer, and <i>HER2<\/i>-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. However, some patients do not derive clinical benefit from T-DXd, and drug resistance is inevitable. Preclinical studies demonstrated that neratinib, an oral irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can increase uptake of HER2-targeting ADCs, including ado-trastuzumab emtansine and T-DXd, <i>in vivo<\/i>. Enhanced uptake of ADC is postulated to be secondary to hindering HSP90 binding to the HER2 receptor, thereby inducing receptor ubiquitination and internalization. This finding was further confirmed in patient-derived xenograft models from two patients with <i>HER2<\/i>-mutated, but non-amplified, low-expressing advanced breast cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of T-DXd and neratinib in patients with advanced solid tumors with a HER2 alteration will enhance the efficacy of T-DXd. As T-DXd and neratinib may have overlapping toxicities in patients, a phase I study to establish the safety of the combination is warranted.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This is a multi-center, phase I clinical trial (NCT05372614, NCI 10495) with a 3+3 design to study the safety and tolerability of T-DXd and neratinib. The trial is supported by the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. Eligible patients have advanced solid tumors with HER2 overexpression, amplification by ISH\/NGS, or an activating <i>HER2<\/i> mutation. Up to 18 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation portion (Part 1), and 12 patients will be enrolled in the pharmacodynamic cohort (Part 2). During Part 1, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose will be determined for neratinib. The dose of T-DXd is fixed at 5.4 mg\/kg. We are actively enrolling patients in Part 1. The primary endpoint is dose-limiting toxicities of the combination during the first 2 cycles of treatment (42 days). Key secondary objectives of the study include T-DXd payload (DXd\/MAAA-1181a) in tumor tissue obtained before and after co-treatment with neratinib to assess the potential enhanced payload concentration with the combination and quantitative HER2 assessed by mass spectrometry using multiplex reaction monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phase I,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Limitations of ACTs include difficulty identifying suitable tumor antigens for solid tumors, the ability to target only one antigen per construct which commonly results in secondary resistance due to antigen escape, and largely autologous approaches which are challenging in heavily pre-treated patients with poor marrow function and those with rapidly progressive disease who may not receive their personalised cellular products in time. This is a phase I study evaluating a novel off-the-shelf allogenic mRNA-electroporated NKG2D ligand-targeting CAR-grafted &#947;&#948; T cell therapy. NKG2DLs are a group of 8 types of stress-induced cancer antigens which are preferentially and widely expressed on tumor cells from diverse tissue origins but are not typically present on normal tissue. NKG2DL-targeting &#947;&#948; T cells will be manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors enrolled on the donor protocol of the ANGELICA trial.

STING is widely expressed and targeting it directly poses many challenges, including systemic activation of interferon. Therefore, alternative approaches to activate STING in a controlled manner may generate a better therapeutic response in cancer patients. Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase\/Phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) is the direct negative regulator of the STING pathway that hydrolyzes 2&#8217;3&#8217; cGAMP, the direct activator of STING. Highest levels of 2&#8242;3&#8242; cGAMP can be found in tumors and recent evidence suggests that 2&#8242;3&#8242; cGAMP acts locally, as a paracrine immune transmitter. Recent studies have also reported elevated ENPP1 expression in metastatic tumors. We hypothesize that inhibiting ENPP1 with a small molecule inhibitor may produce superior outcomes by activating STING in the tumor microenvironment. We have developed SR-8541A, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ENPP1. Our initial work to support the development of SR-8541A consisted of pharmacodynamics studies, bioanalytical development, pharmacokinetics (PK) and non-GLP toxicology studies in three species, a GLP repeat dose dog telemetry study, and 28-day GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs including toxicokinetic (TK) analyses. Here we report initial findings from our ongoing first in human, phase I trial of SR-8541A in advanced metastatic solid tumors.<br \/><u> <\/u><b>Methods<\/b>: This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SR&#8209;8541A administered orally as a monotherapy in subjects with solid tumors which are refractory to standard therapeutic options, or for which there are no standard therapeutic options (NCT06063681). The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, DLTs, maximum tolerated dose and RP2D and schedule for future studies of SR-8541A. Secondarily, the study aims to evaluate the PK and efficacy per RECIST of SR-8541A. SR-8541A is administered orally in 28-day cycles and is following an accelerated titration dose (ATD) escalation. Blood samples are being collected for PK assessment, target engagement, and biomarker assessment.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Sample analysis from a subject treated with SR-8541A (5 mg) in the ATD portion of the study is ongoing. No treatment-related adverse events have been reported. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred during the 28-day DLT period. Plasma drug levels collected for the PK show cMAX concentrations in the projected therapeutic dose range. Biomarker assessment is ongoing and will be included in the presentation. The SR-8541A dose has escalated and the study is currently enrolling at the 10 mg dose.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: The first evaluated dose of SR-8541A has shown to be safe and well tolerated.

KO-2806 is a next-generation FTI that has increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic properties. In preclinical studies, KO-2806 has been shown to: (1) enhance tumor growth inhibition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including cabozantinib, in multiple clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models; and (2) enhance activity of KRAS inhibitors, including adagrasib, in <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse models.

In addition, despite advances in NHL therapies, TP53 mutations and double rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. LP-284, a DNA damaging agent with nanomolar potency in NHL cells, is agnostic of TP53 mutation status. In a TP53-mutated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) xenograft model, LP-284 inhibited tumor growth at least 3-fold more than ibrutinib and bortezomib. Furthermore, LP-284 resulted in near complete tumor regression in a MCL model that is refractory to ibrutinib and bortezomib. In a high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangement xenograft model, LP-284 led to 99% tumor growth inhibition when used as a single agent and showed synergistic effect with rituximab. The above data strongly suggests that LP-284 is a promising therapy for aggressive R\/R NHL, especially subgroups with TP53 mutation and\/or MYC\/BCL2 rearrangements. LP-284 also showed promise in the setting of solid tumors, as evidenced by strong anti-tumor potency in a spectrum of solid tumor cell lines and sarcoma xenograft models.<br \/>Methods: This Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation study assesses the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of LP-284 in adult pts with R\/R lymphomas and solid tumors. Up to 30 adult pts will be enrolled in the Phase 1a dose escalation study. After completion of Phase 1a, up to 40 pts with R\/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and MCL, each, will be enrolled for a dose expansion Phase 1b study.<br \/>The primary objectives of the Phase 1a study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of LP-284 and to determine the MTD and RP2D. Participants will receive LP-284 via i.v. infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. A Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design is being used to determine the MTD. Dose escalation involves single patient cohorts for the first 2 dose levels and at least 3 pts\/cohort for subsequent dose levels. The secondary objectives are to characterize the PK and to assess the clinical activity of LP-284. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the association between tumor response and changes in ctDNA and importantly to identify potential genomic features associated with LP-284 response, particularly those related to DNA damage response pathways.<br \/>The primary objectives of Phase 1b are to obtain preliminary estimates of clinical activity in adult patients with R\/R DLBCL and MCL, and to determine the dose of LP-284 for further development based on exposure-response\/safety relationships derived from the totality of the data obtained from both Phase 1a and 1b.

In rapid proliferating cancer cells, PS externalizes to the outer cell membrane and has the potential to act as a tumor biomarker and therapeutic target. T-1201 is a small molecule drug conjugate comprised of a phosphatidylserine-targeting head, Zinc (II) bis-dipicolylamine (Zn-DPA), linked to bioactive topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38. Once T-1201 via Zn-DPA targets tumor cells, then enzymatic cleavage releases the cytotoxic payload of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan.

With 100% dose increment for the next cohort. If 1 subject experiences any &#8805; Grade 2 AE or DLT at any dose level during first cycle, the dose escalation will transit to 3+3 design where dose increment will follow a modified Fibonacci sequence. Starting with Cycle 2, the dosing interval can be adjusted to once every two weeks (Q2W) and the dose level after switching to Q2W schedule will be half of that at Q4W. Intra-subject dose escalation is permitted to maximize the likelihood of responses while keeping toxicity acceptable for individual subjects. The dose can be increased after subjects complete at least 2 treatment cycles at a particular dose level without experiencing any &#62; grade 2 drug-related toxicity. The primary endpoints are the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and adverse event rate as measured by CTCAE v5.0.

Such disruption leads to abnormal mitosis followed by apoptosis of cancer cells and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. T-1101, with growth inhibition concentrations (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) ranging from14 to 74 nM across various human cancer cell lines, exhibited potent anti-liver and breastcancer activities<i> in vivo<\/i>, and highly active (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 7-19 nM) in MDR (multiple drugresistance) expressing cell lines. The effective inhibitory dose of T-1101 was determined to be between 10 and 25 mg\/kg twice a day in xenograft animal models. Moreover, T-1101 has synergistic activity when combined with other anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, topotecan and paclitaxel etc. Clinically, oral powder for constitution (OPC) form was first used in the initial study.

The secondary objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and therapeutic response after receiving treatment. DLT was determined within the first treatment cycle. Patients showing clinical benefit after first 2cycles of T-1101may enter extension cohort to continue the treatment. In OPC 3+3 escalation study (NCT03195764, NCT03349073), T-1101 was administered orally once daily, days 1 to 14 every 21 days per cycle with 8 planned dose levels at dose of 9, 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108 to 126 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. The OPC study was terminated at 36 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> before the primary endpoint (determination of maximum tolerated dose; MTD) was reached and subsequent dosing level will be evaluated with the CAP formulation. Based on the 52% of relative oral bioavailability (%F) of CAP versus OPC in preclinical Beagle dogs&#8217; PK study, the starting dose of CAP form of T-1101 was determined at 100 mg daily forconsecutive 28-day per cycle for 2 cycles with dose levels of 100, 200, 225, 250, 300 and 350 mg\/day.

Deficiency of HR-mediated DNA repair plays a role in the initiation and progression of many tumor types. In tumors with HR deficiency, PARP inhibition leads to generation of DSBs that cannot be effectively repaired because of the HR defect, resulting in synthetic lethality. This finding has led to the clinical development and approval of several PARPi for the treatment of various tumors including certain ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers that are prone to display HR deficiency (HRd). DNA polymerase theta (encoded by <i>POLQ<\/i>) mediates an alternative DNA repair mechanism, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). DNA polymerase theta is generally not detectable in normal tissues but is upregulated in many tumor types. In preclinical studies, POLQi plus PARPi treatment demonstrated superior efficacy to PARPi alone in preventing the growth of HRd tumors. To evaluate the clinical potential of combining POLQi and PARPi, this first-in-human study investigates treatment with GSK4524101, an investigational POLQi, with or without the PARPi niraparib, in patients with solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This open-label, multicenter, phase 1\/2 study (NCT06077877) opened in October 2023 and comprises dose-finding (part 1, including a food-effect cohort) and dose-expansion (part 2) parts.

A potential solution for patients lacking functional endogenous anti-tumor T cells is engineering their T cells with exogenous T cell receptors (TCRs) to target and kill tumor cells. Initial clinical trials with TCR engineered T cell therapies (TCR-Ts) targeted single tumor antigens on single HLA and produced partial, short-lasting responses. Solid tumors are notoriously heterogenous with highly variable antigen expression. Recent discoveries also identified HLA loss of heterozygosity in up to 40% of solid tumors, allowing tumor cells to evade T cell attack. To overcome this heterogeneity, TScan has developed T-Plex, a multiplexed cell therapy comprising 2-3 different TCR-Ts, chosen from a collection of TCR-Ts called the ImmunoBank, to target different tumor antigens on different HLA types with confirmed tumor expression. To deepen clinical responses, TCR-T cells are engineered to express CD8&#945;\/&#946; co-receptors that, in preclinical experiments, enable CD4+ helper T cells to have &#62;100-fold improved cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion over CD4+ cells expressing the TCR alone. Finally, to allow T cell persistence despite immunosuppressive TGF-&#946; in the solid tumor microenvironment, TCR-T cells also express the dominant negative TGF-&#946;receptor, enabling ~10-fold improved proliferation in the presence of TGF- &#946; compared to T cells expressing the TCR and CD8&#945;\/&#946; co-receptors alone. A proprietary transposon vector with larger cargo limit enables the inclusion of these additional genes. The Phase 1 study utilizes a separate screening protocol to pre-identify patients with head and neck, cervical, anogenital cancers, NSCLC, and melanoma, any time during standard clinical care, enabling rapid enrollment into the treatment protocol upon disease progression. Screening comprises germline HLA testing, and archival tumor testing for antigen expression and exclusion of HLA loss. Treatment includes standard non-myeloablative lymphodepletion followed by one or 2 doses of T-Plex infused 28 days apart. Dose escalation under the interval 3+3 design starts with testing single TCR-Ts in dose levels 1 and 2. Thereafter, TCR-Ts are combined and escalated in dose levels 3 and 4. TCR-Ts currently in the master protocol target PRAME, MAGE-A1 or HPV16 on HLA-A*02:01 or MAGE-A1 on HLA-C*07:02. Additional TCR-Ts added to the ImmunoBank and master protocol go through dose levels 1 and 2 as single therapies before becoming available for multiplexed dose levels 3 and 4. Primary endpoints include safety, feasibility and identifying the recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints are rates and durations of response and exploratory endpoints measure T cell activation and persistence. Two additional TCR-Ts are on track to be added to the ImmunoBank, which could allow 50-80% of common solid tumor patients to qualify for multiplexed TCR-T therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Adoptive Cell Therapy,Phase 1 clinical trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Justin Moser<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Pico<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Henick<sup>3<\/sup>, Rom Leidner<sup>4<\/sup>, Jared Weiss<sup>5<\/sup>, James Isaacs<sup>6<\/sup>, Jaspreet Grewal<sup>7<\/sup>, Michael Hurwitz<sup>8<\/sup>, Jim Murray<sup>9<\/sup>, Marlyane Motta<sup>9<\/sup>, Yun Wang<sup>9<\/sup>, Shrikanta Chattopadhyay<sup>9<\/sup>, Debora Barton<sup>9<\/sup>, Gavin MacBeath<sup>9<\/sup>, Sajeve Thomas<sup>10<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>HonorHealth Research & Innovation Institute, Scottsdale, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Columbia University, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Providence Cancer Institute, Earle A.
