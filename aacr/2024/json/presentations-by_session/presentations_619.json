[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Endocrine therapy (ET) + cyclin dependent kinase 4\/6 inhibitor (CDK4\/6i) is the mainstay for the management of ER+\/HER2- mBC as 1<sup>st<\/sup>-line therapy. However, tumors eventually develop resistance to ET, leading to disease progression. In the EMERALD phase 3 trial, single-agent elacestrant was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and a manageable safety profile vs standard of care (SOC) ET, leading to the first oral SERD approval. Patients receiving elacestrant experienced a median PFS (mPFS) of 3.8 months vs 1.9 months with SOC (Bidard, 2022). Patients who received &#8805;12 months of prior CDK4\/6i experienced a mPFS of 8.6 months with elacestrant vs 1.9 months with SOC (SABCS, 2022). Currently, there are no approved systemic treatments for patients with ER+\/HER2- BC who have brain metastasis. The rationale for the ELECTRA study is to combine elacestrant with abemaciclib in patients with brain metastasis, given both compounds have demonstrated the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (Conlan, 2020; Tolaney, 2020).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: ELECTRA (NCT05386108) is an open-label phase 1b\/2, multicenter study evaluating elacestrant in combination with abemaciclib. Eligibility includes patients with ER+\/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic BC and measurable brain metastasis. For phase 1b, the presence of brain metastasis is not required for eligibility. For phase 2, patients must have &#8805; 1 active and measurable brain metastasis per RECIST v1.1. Patients must have received prior therapy in the metastatic setting, including &#8805; 1 endocrine therapy, &#8804; 2 chemotherapy regimens, and 0-2 prior CDK4\/6i (excluding abemaciclib). The phase 1b primary objective is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); secondary objectives include safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), PFS, and overall survival (OS). The phase 2 primary objective is ORR per RECIST v1.1; secondary objectives include intracranial response rate, DoR, CBR, PFS, OS, PK, and quality of life. The phase 1b portion of the trial is actively ongoing to determine the RP2D with study sites open worldwide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and selective ER degraders (SERDs) such as fulvestrant, and more recently elacestrant, are integral components of the therapeutic strategy for patients with ER-positive breast cancer. However, unmet medical need persists in this patient population, due to suboptimal clinical outcomes and the development of resistance to therapy. E3 ligase-engaged chimeric degraders represent a technological advance with the potential to induce potent and deeper ER degradation. Utilizing Accutar's proprietary Protein-Protein Interaction Targeting Chimeras (PPI-TAC) platform, AC699 was designed as a novel chimeric degrader targeting ER&#945;. By effectively linking an ER ligand to an E3-ligase recruiting ligand, AC699 brings ER&#945; in proximity to an E3 ligase, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ER&#945;. Chimeric ER degraders possess the unique advantage of degrading the ER protein without the inherent risk of activating an ER signal. Moreover, these molecules are not degraded alongside the target protein, allowing for their efficient recycling within the cell. This direct mechanism enables chimeric ER degraders to achieve potent ER degradation with increased specificity, thereby potentially providing a higher therapeutic index compared to SERDs.<br \/><b>Study Description<\/b> The AC699-001 trial is a first in human Phase 1 dose escalation study (NCT05654532) which will enroll up to 60 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, breast cancer. Patients must have received at least two prior lines of endocrine treatment, or at least one prior line, if combined with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor. Prior chemotherapy is not required but must not exceed three prior lines of cytotoxic treatment. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion. AC699 is administered orally, once daily, with doses ranging from 100 mg to 600 mg in a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. The primary objective is evaluation of the safety and tolerability of AC699. Secondary objectives include assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity and characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of single and multiple doses of AC699. Enrollment began in December 2022 and a total of 5 sites have been activated in the United States.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Targeted therapy,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Patients with KRAS driver mutations have a poor prognosis, and most KRAS-mutated cancers lack effective therapies. T cell receptor (TCR)-T cell therapies targeting mutant KRAS have demonstrated proof of concept in the clinic, but duration of response remains a challenge. AFNT-211 represents a novel strategy to address the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve response rate and duration in solid tumors.<br \/><b>Rationale:<\/b> AFNT-211 autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are engineered to express a high avidity HLA-A*11:01restricted, KRAS G12V-specific, transgenic TCR; the wildtype CD8&#945;\/&#946; coreceptor; and a FAS-41BB switch receptor. The intended mechanism of action is recognition and elimination of KRAS G12V-mutated tumor cells by AFNT-211. AFNT-211 is designed to enhance anti-tumor activity via the following mechanisms of action as shown in preclinical models: (1) the CD8&#945;\/&#946; coreceptor enables MHC-I-&#8205;restricted TCR recognition of the KRAS G12V target by CD4+ T cells; (2) engaging CD4+ helper T cell responses drives enhanced CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity and prevents T cell exhaustion; (3) the FAS-41BB chimeric switch receptor drives increased T cell activity, circumventing native FAS apoptotic signaling.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This ongoing Phase 1, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label study of AFNT-211 (1) evaluates safety\/tolerability, (2) determines the optimal biological dose (OBD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and (3) assesses preliminary antitumor activity. The study consists of 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. Dose escalation is guided by the Bayesian optimal interval Phase 1\/2 (BOIN12) design to determine the OBD. The BOIN12 design quantifies the desirability of a dose in terms of toxicity-efficacy tradeoff and adaptively allocates patients to the dose with the highest estimated desirability. The RP2D will be selected based on the BOIN12 design and the totality of benefit\/risk assessment. Patients enrolling in dose expansion will be treated at the OBD\/RP2D in indication-specific cohorts. This study is conducted in patients aged &#8805; 18 years who are HLA-A*11:01-positive with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12V mutation, and intolerance of\/progression on at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect T cells for the manufacturing of AFNT-211 and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to AFNT-211 infusion. This is followed by a 28-day dose-limiting toxicity observation period (dose escalation only) and a post-treatment follow-up period for 24 months\/until disease progression.

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is highly expressed across multiple solid tumors, such as CRC, GC, PDAC, and NSCLC. Restricted normal tissue expression and efficient lysosomal trafficking of CEACAM5 highlight its potential as an anticancer target.<br \/>SGN-CEACAM5C is a novel investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed to CEACAM5 composed of the humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG1) anti-CEACAM5 monoclonal antibody tusamitamab chemically conjugated to 8 molecules of the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor 7-aminomethyl-10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin (AMDCPT). SGN-CEACAM5C selectively binds to CEACAM5 present on the cell surface and is internalized via the endo-lysosomal pathway, with subsequent release of the payload through enzymatic cleavage. Release of the cytotoxic payload induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest in S phase, and apoptosis in tumor cells. In vitro bystander activity was observed against tumor cells without CEACAM5 surface expression. SGN-CEACAM5C is highly active in multiple patient-derived xenograft models, including CRC, GC, and NSCLC, across various levels of CEACAM5 expression (Baudat 2023; Baudat 2024). These preclinical findings justify evaluation of SGN-CEACAM5C in a clinical trial setting.<br \/>Methods<br \/>SGNCEA5C-001 (NCT06131840) is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of SGN-CEACAM5C in adults with select advanced solid tumors. This study consists of dose escalation (Part A), dose and schedule optimization (Part B), and dose expansion (Part C). Eligible pts are adults &#8805;18 years of age with confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid tumor malignancy, measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, an ECOG PS of 0-1, and 1 of the following tumor types: CRC, GC\/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJ), PDAC, NSCLC (squamous\/non-squamous), or SCLC.<br \/>Primary endpoints include incidence of AEs, laboratory abnormalities, dose modifications due to AEs, dose-limiting toxicities, and cumulative safety. Secondary endpoints include estimates of PK parameters, incidence of antidrug antibodies, objective response rate and best response per RECIST v1.1 by investigator, duration of response, PFS, and OS. Safety and antitumor activity endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Recruitment is ongoing for Part A in North America.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,CEACAM5,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Gamma delta (&#947;&#948;)-T cells represent a conserved T cell subset that can induce cell death in a wide range of malignancies. The presence of &#947;9&#948;2-T cells in solid tumors strongly correlates with better patient survival (Gentles 2015; Tosolini 2017). In addition to direct, potent killing by release of cytotoxic molecules, activated &#947;9&#948;2-T cells process and present antigen and contribute to a cascade response resulting in downstream activation of innate and adaptive immune cells to mediate further tumor cell killing (Brandes 2005; Devilder 2006; Vantourout 2013). Novel approaches that improve targeting and activation of &#947;9&#948;2-T cells may lead to the development of effective and safe cancer treatments. SGN-EGFRd2 is an investigational, bispecific humanized heavy chain-only antibody (HcAb). Advantages of HcAbs include their small size, high solubility, high stability, and excellent tissue penetration in vivo (Bannas 2017). SGN-EGFRd2 simultaneously binds EGFR and the &#947;9&#948;2-T cell receptor, resulting in the conditional activation of &#947;9&#948;2-T cells. Importantly, full activation of &#947;9&#948;2-T cells requires a secondary phosphoantigen stress signal present only in malignant and certain infected cells (Deseke 2020; Herrmann 2020; Rigau 2020; Vantourout 2013), but not normal healthy cells, conferring preferential tumor-directed cytotoxicity. The proposed cytotoxic mechanism of action is independent of KRAS and BRAF mutations (King 2023) known to confer resistance to approved anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer (CRC). This first-in-human study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of SGN-EGFRd2 in patients with advanced solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>SGNEGFRd2-001 (NCT05983133) is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation and expansion study evaluating SGN-EGFRd2 monotherapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) CRC, head and neck squamous cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 3 parts: dose escalation (Part A; n ~ 75), dose optimization (Part B; optional; up to n = 40), and dose expansion (Part C; up to n = 160). Patients must have R\/R disease, or be intolerant to standard of care therapies, with no appropriate standard therapy available. Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients are eligible regardless of tumor EGFR expression or EGFR\/KRAS\/BRAF mutation status. Patients will receive SGN-EGFRd2 as an intravenous infusion. Primary study objectives are safety and tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended dose and schedule. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity. Tumor samples will be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers. Accrual is ongoing in the US. Additional sites in Europe and Canada are planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Antitumor activity,T cell,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Complete surgical removal and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy cures approximately half of the patients, but patients with recurrent or non-resectable disease have no efficacious treatment options. These patients have a high unmet need for novel treatment options, and in the Pseudovax trial we will explore a novel therapeutic concept. A main molecular driver of PMP (in up to 90% of cases) is otherwise rare mutations in the <i>GNAS<\/i> oncogene, coding for the Gs&#945; protein. We hypothesized that mutated Gs&#945; would be a tumor neoantigen, and in T cells isolated from peripheral blood of PMP patients, a strong T cell proliferative response was observed. In the corresponding tumors, T cells with up-regulated immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and TIGIT were detected.<br \/><i>Study hypotheses<\/i>: Patients with <i>GNAS<\/i>-mutated PMP has a preexisting, attenuated immune response directed against mutated Gs&#945; protein. Vaccination with mutated Gs&#945; peptides can be combined with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) with acceptable toxicity. The vaccine will reactivate the immune response and ICI will restore measurable anticancer immunity in patients.<br \/><i>Study design<\/i>: The Pseudovax trial is a small (10 patients) first-in-human, proof-of-concept, prospective, open label, phase I trial. Patients with recurrent or non-resectable PMP are eligible for inclusion. During a treatment period of 12 months, a mutated Gs&#945; peptide vaccine + adjuvant (GM-CSF) will be administered as intradermal injections. After 12 weeks, treatment with ICI will be initiated. The primary endpoints are toxicity and circulating immune response against the vaccine, measured as increase in interferon-gamma production or proliferation of circulating vaccine-specific T cells compared to pre-vaccination baseline. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (abdominopelvic CT scans, blood levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and\/or detection of <i>GNAS<\/i> mutation by ctDNA analysis).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Effective approaches to achieve durable local control are urgently needed. Metabolic reprogramming and enhanced mitochondrial function are known contributors to chemo- and radio-resistance in PDAC. CPI-613, a lipoic acid analog that selectively inhibits components of the Krebs cycle in tumors, showed promising preclinical synergy in combination with gemcitabine and radiation (gem-RT). We initiated a phase I study (NCT05325281) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when used with gem-RT. Here, we present the results from the first cohort of this study.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Adult pts with inoperable PDAC that, by institutional multidisciplinary review, were considered to benefit from definitive local control of the primary tumor were eligible for the study. CPI-613 was administered once weekly by intravenous infusion over ~ 2 hours at a starting dose of 500 mg\/m2 and dose-escalated using a Bayesian optimal interval design. Gemcitabine was given once weekly at 400 mg\/m2 and RT at 45-54 Gray (Gy) in 25-30 fractions.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>By Jan 7, 2024, six pts were enrolled, and five completed the treatment and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period.<br \/><b>Table 1<\/b> describes the characteristics of these five pts. As CPI-613 was not associated with any additional toxicities, specifically cytopenia(s), after the first two pts, the study protocol was amended to allow CPI-613 to be administered on weeks gemcitabine was held for cytopenia(s). The study, therefore, enrolled five pts in the first cohort. All pts received &#8805; 16 weeks of systemic chemotherapy with at least stable disease per imaging prior to enrollment. None of the pts experienced DLTs. All treatment-related toxicities were expected from gem-RT, unrelated to CPI-613, and manageable.

This exposure profile illustrates the potential of CLDN18.2 as a candidate for targeted therapy. To date, there are no approved therapeutic agents directed against this target. The T cell antigen coupler (TAC) technology is an approach to modifying T cells <i>ex vivo<\/i>, which allows recognition and cytotoxicity of tumor cells by co&#8209;opting the natural T cell receptor. TAC T cells demonstrate a safer profile than chimeric antigen receptor T cells. TAC01-CLDN18.2 is an autologous T-cell product comprising T cells expressing CLDN18.2 TAC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is a first-in-human study (NCT05862324) to investigate the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TAC01-CLDN18.2 in CLDN18.2+\/HER2- solid tumors. Subjects will undergo leukapheresis and may receive bridging anticancer therapy, if deemed necessary by the Investigator, during cell manufacturing. Prior to TAC01-CLDN18.2 infusion, subjects will undergo low-intensity lymphodepletion chemotherapy. In Phase I dose escalation, TAC01-CLDN18.2 will be administered at increasing doses (Cohorts 1-3) in adult subjects after &#8805;2 lines of therapy using the classic 3+3 dose escalation study design. Subjects with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may have been treated with 1 line of prior therapy. CLDN18.2 expression levels will be determined centrally using a clinical trial assay validated across relevant indications. Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed up to 28 days from TAC01-CLDN18.2 infusion. A second dose may be administered, according to preidentified clinical and safety criteria. In Phase II, dose expansion groups will further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the optimal TAC01-CLDN18.2 dose, with the option of redosing. Indications will include gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma (group A), PDAC (group B) and ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer (group C) in subjects after &#8805;2 and &#60;4 lines of prior therapy (subjects with PDAC may have been exposed to 1 therapy). Definitions of eligible CLDN18.2 expression levels will be based on retrospective analysis of data from Phase 1 in association with clinical efficacy. A Simon 2-stage design will be used to enroll &#8804;57 subjects in Group A and &#8804;22 subjects in Group C.

However, skin toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperglycemia are clinically significant toxicities with EV. LY4101174 (ETx-22) is a next-generation nectin-4 targeting ADC comprising a humanized IgG1 Fc-silent monoclonal antibody linked to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan, via a maleimide-&#223;-glucuronide poly-sarcosine linker with improved stability and a homogeneous drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Preclinically, LY4101174 has demonstrated robust <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in tumor models across a range of nectin-4 expression levels and in the nectin-4-MMAE ADC treated resistant tumor model.<sup>2<\/sup><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> LOXO-ENC-23001 is a global, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human phase 1 study of LY4101174 in patients (pts) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors known to express nectin-4. LY4101174 will be administered intravenously and evaluated initially on either every 2 weeks or 3 weeks schedule. Eligible pts (&#8805;18 years) must have good performance status (ECOG PS 0-1) with metastatic UC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal, pancreatic, prostate, non-small cell lung, cervical, ovarian, or triple-negative breast cancer, and must have received or not be a candidate for available standard therapies. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: phase 1a dose escalation\/dose optimization and phase 1b dose expansion. Dose escalation will utilize a Bayesian optimal interval design. Additional pts will be allowed to backfill to previously cleared dose levels that demonstrate therapeutically relevant exposures or direct evidence of clinical activity. The dose-limiting toxicity evaluation period will be 21 or 28 days based on dosing schedules. Phase 1b dose expansion cohorts will enroll pts with selected tumor types: mUC with no prior EV treatment (cohort B1), mUC with prior EV treatment (cohort B2), and other selected non-UC tumors (cohort C). Primary objectives are to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the safety of LY4101174. Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of LY4101174 per RECIST v1.1.

A potential cause for this difference may be androgen signaling.<br \/>Testosterone receptors are present in up to 53% of UC in men and women. Androgen signaling promotes proliferation and chemotherapy resistance, while blocking androgen has been shown to sensitize UC to chemotherapy. When exposed to a chemical carcinogen, castrated male mice and androgen receptor (AR) knockout mice are less likely to develop UC. Additionally, men taking testosterone lowering agents for prostate cancer, who are concurrently treated for UC, have a 50% lower UC recurrence rate than men with normal testosterone signaling. In a study of 9 men and 1 woman with metastatic UC, all patients were treated with gemcitabine\/cisplatin and concurrent enzalutamide. Patients&#8217; testosterone levels were not medically lowered. Importantly, dihydrotestosterone, the native ligand for the AR, has higher affinity for the AR than enzalutamide. Interestingly, the only woman in the study (with presumably low dihydrotestosterone levels) had a complete response to therapy. No other complete responses were observed.<br \/>The standard therapy for non-metastatic muscle invasive UC is chemotherapy followed by cystectomy. Currently this results in about a 35% pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. pCR is associated with improved overall survival. In our study (TASUC; NCT05839119), we add degarelix to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat men and women who have AR positive UC.<br \/>Methods:<br \/>The main eligibility criteria are:<br \/>(1) Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (2) AR positive disease by nuclear staining on immunohistochemistry (3) pT2 - T4, N0 - N1, M0 (Stage II or IIIA disease) (4) Eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy (5) Eligible for cystectomy<br \/>In this single-arm study, all patients receive standard of care gemcitabine\/cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles) with the addition of monthly degarelix during chemotherapy. The primary outcome is pCR rate at cystectomy. We are employing a Simon 2-stage minmax design. In stage I we will enroll 20 patients. If there are at least 7 pCRs (35%) we will enroll an additional 12 patients in stage II, for a total of 32 patients. This design will provide 80% statistical power to detect a change in pCR rate from 35% to 50% with a significance level of less than 0.20. If we observe at least 14 pCRs (of 32 patients) the study will be considered positive and we will plan a follow-up randomized, controlled phase II (or phase III) study.<br \/>Exploratory outcomes include correlation of AR positivity with proliferation at diagnosis, identification of oncogenic androgen response elements from matched pre- and post- treatment tissue, and identification of gene signatures associated with pCR. We will also measure 2- and 5-year disease free survival.<br \/>TASUC opened to accrual on October 2, 2023 and is actively recruiting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Androgen deprivation therapy,degarelix,urothelial cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

However, prior agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies have encountered limited clinical success and significant toxicity. Our previous studies demonstrate that interactions between the antibody Fc domain and the inhibitory Fc-gamma receptor Fc&#947;RIIB are critical for efficient CD40 multimerization and enhanced antitumor activity. To optimize this interaction, we developed 2141-V11, a novel anti-CD40 antibody Fc-engineered to increase binding affinity for Fc&#947;RIIB, resulting in effective antitumor activity in both <i>in vivo <\/i>and in a recent first-in-human phase I trial (NCT04059588). Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is the most common presentation of bladder cancer, with a high risk of recurrence and progression despite optimal surgical interventions and standard therapies. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical treatment has been the standard of care for NMIBC over the last five decades. However, 75% of patients ultimately become unresponsive to this therapy, leaving limited curative options aside from complete radical cystectomy. Using several preclinical bladder cancer models, including BCG-unresponsive disease, we found that intravesical administration of 2141-V11 induces durable anti-tumor immunity without systemic toxicity. Based on these findings, we initiated a Phase I study of intravesical 2141-V11 for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is an investigator-initiated Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravesical 2141-V11 in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (N=25) who are ineligible for or decline radical cystectomy (NCT05126472). Following complete transurethral resection, intravesical 2141-V11 is administered once weekly for three doses, with re-treatment eligibility at week 13 and 25, based on disease status determined by on-treatment biopsies. The study follows an MCRM dose escalation design with five dose levels (0.7, 2.0, 7.0, 21.0 and 70.0 mg).<b> <\/b>Primary endpoints include safety and dose tolerability to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and\/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints involve pharmacokinetic profiling and preliminary evaluation of clinical activity. Exploratory objectives include investigation of biological markers of drug activity in pre- and post-treatment tissue biopsies and urine biospecimens. As of the data cutoff on 12\/20\/23, 80% of the planned patients (n=20) have been enrolled, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. Accrual completion is expected by the first quarter of 2024, with ongoing analysis of urine immune profiling, cytokine analysis, as well as single-cell spatial phenotyping in pre- and post-treatment samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,CD40,Bladder cancer,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that AR and PI3K - AKT - mTOR (PAM) pathways interact through reciprocal negative feedback, whereby inhibition of one pathway activates the other. Thus, combining a PAM inhibitor with an ARSi may deliver improved anti-cancer activity in patients with mCRPC. A Phase 2 trial in 129 patients with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone demonstrated improved median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) when samotolisib, a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, was added to enzalutamide. These results form the basis for this clinical trial of gedatolisib, a potent PAM inhibitor, in combination with darolutamide in men with mCRPC who have previously progressed on ARSi (NCT06190899).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><br \/>This open-label, multicenter, Phase 1\/2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide in men with mCRPC who have progressed on ARSi. In Phase 1, 36 patients will be randomized to one of two dose arms to evaluate dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Gedatolisib will be administered once weekly for 3-weeks-on\/1-week-off: Arm 1 - 120 mg and Arm 2 - 180 mg, with darolutamide 600 mg orally administered twice daily. Arm 2 may be dose de-escalated depending on the number of DLTs observed. In Phase 2, 12 additional patients will be enrolled at the RP2D (n= 30).<br \/>Key inclusion criteria include adult males (&#8805; 18 years) with mCRPC who have progressed on or after treatment with one next-generation ARSi. Key exclusion criteria include males with adenocarcinoma with a small cell component and with &#8805;10% neuroendocrine type cells; prior treatment with PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitor; prior chemotherapy or radiopharmaceutical therapy for mCRPC; uncontrolled type 1\/2 diabetes; or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases.<br \/>Primary endpoints for Phase 1 are safety and tolerability (incidence of DLTs, adverse events, and determination of maximum tolerated dose) determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), PK, and Bayesian Optimal Interval utility score. Primary endpoints for Phase 2 are rPFS rate at 6 months based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 with modifications as specified in Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria.

In <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, T-1301 effectively inhibited growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells carrying mutations that are resistant to KIT-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in clinical use. In animal studies, tumor regressions were observed in AML and GIST xenograft models, while growth inhibition were observed in various other types of solid tumor models.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>This is an open label, multi-centered Phase 1 dose escalating study (NCT05156203). The primary objectives are to establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to assess the safety and tolerability of T-1301. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and therapeutic response after receiving treatment. Eligible Patient should have histologically and cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors (including lymphoma) with measurable or evaluable target lesion(s) per RICEST v1.1 and refractory to or without standard treatments, ECOG performance status 0-1, and adequate organ function. The dose escalation begins with accelerated titration and switch to the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design when either one of the following events is observed in Cycle 1: the first instance of DLT, or any Grade 2 or higher drug-related adverse event (AE) in any patient. Then, at least 2 additional subjects are treated at the current dose level and the dose escalation will follow the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with cohorts of size 3-6.T-1301 is orally administered daily in a 28-day cycle (a 21-day consecutive dosing followed by a 7-day rest). The dosing schedule is once daily (QD) at the initial dose level and could be QD or twice daily starting with the second dose level according to the safety review committee (SRC) decision after reviewing the safety and PK data from each dose level. AEs are assessed according to CTCAE v5.0 and occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is determined during the first cycle of treatment. The safety findings are reviewed by the SRC, which will determine the MTD and RP2D. Tumor response evaluation is performed after 2 cycles of treatment and assessed according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. For those who benefit from the study medication after 2 treatment cycles, intra-subject dose escalation for multiple times is allowed in extension study period. Patient recruitment began in December 2021 and is ongoing in Taiwan.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I clinical trials in progress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Kinase inhibitors,Solid tumors,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.-S.
