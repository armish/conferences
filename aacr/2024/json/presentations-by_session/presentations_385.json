[{"Abstract":"T cell exhaustion resulting from chronic antigen stimulation and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limits the efficacy of T cell therapies in the solid tumor setting. The onset of T cell exhaustion is associated with distinct epigenetic and transcriptional changes. We hypothesized that genetic perturbations which shift T cells away from exhaustion associated states could increase the potency of immunotherapies. To this end, we utilized pooled, <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR\/Cas9-based screening paired with deep sequencing readouts to characterize perturbation dependent T cell states in the context of chronic antigen stimulation. In order to achieve this, we developed a lentivirus-based workflow to perform CRISPRko, CRISPRi and CRISPRa pooled screens in human CAR T-cells that allowed for assessment of T cell phenotypes mediated by knockout, knockdown or overexpression of a large pool of target genes with single cell transcriptome readout. Subjecting these engineered CAR T-cells to an antigen-specific, cell-based repetitive stimulation assay (RSA) led to the progressive loss of T cell proliferation and effector function enabling <i>in vitro<\/i> modeling of T cell exhaustion. Moreover, characterization of the CAR T-cells by single cell sequencing recapitulated key hallmarks of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion. We also discovered T cell intrinsic gene perturbations that govern T cell states in the context of chronic antigen stimulation. These results demonstrate the power of pooled CRISPR screening with single cell readouts to identify novel target genes to enhance CAR T-cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,T cell exhaustion,CRISPR Screening,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, with a five-year overall survival rate of less than 20% for advanced-stage cases. Even the most advanced immunotherapy for HCC has disparate response rates in each patient with HCC, which has led to efforts to unravel the underlying factors in the progression of HCC using bioinformatic approaches. In recent decades, numerous studies have explored T-cell subtypes with tissue-specific residency, suggesting their early protective functions and therapeutic potential within tumor microenvironment (TME). This study aimed to understand inter-individual and intercellular TME through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) in five recurrent\/non-recurrent HCC patients. We identified tumor-associated tissue-resident memory T (TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub>) cells and investigated the heterogeneous characteristics of two T<sub>RM<\/sub> clusters (CD69<sup>+<\/sup> and CD103<i><sup>+<\/sup><\/i>). Whereas CD69<sup>+<\/sup> TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> showed high expression of genes associated with immunological activation, CD103<sup>+<\/sup> TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> exhibited upregulation of genes related to proliferation capacity. To validate the unique molecular patterns, we analyzed an independent HCC dataset (GSE140228) and observed high concordance of significant core marker genes for TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> clusters between the two datasets. Moreover, we assessed the association of gene expression in TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells with overall and recurrence-free survival by conducting survival analysis in two independent large-scale cohorts. The cross-validation approach was applied to estimate risk scores for patients with primary HCC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the trained model was evaluated using the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data. The result of calculating the risk scores clearly indicates that TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells are associated with survival in HCC. Therefore, our study characterized two distinct subtypes of TA-TRM cells in HCC, delineated their unique molecular signatures, and established their relevance to survival outcomes. The findings can potentially enhance the understanding of the roles of TA-T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells in the context of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,T cell,Single cell,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.-S.

However, its efficacy in gynecologic (GYN) cancers has been limited, with response rates of 11-17% in recurrent cases. Only a minority of patients with DNA mismatch repair deficiencies exhibit favorable responses to PD-1 inhibitors. The predictability of PD-L1 expression in GYN cancers remains inconsistent. Our research aimed to identify and prioritize biomarkers and mechanisms linked to ICI resistance in GYN oncology, targeting those who could benefit from these treatments.We gathered clinical and pathological data from 49 patients with ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers at various stages, all treated with ICI. We performed comprehensive analyses, including transcriptome-based immune cell abundance estimation, signaling pathway enrichment, and correlation with ICI treatment responses and survival outcomes. Our previous work highlighted TGF-&#946; and CD47's roles in immunotherapy resistance, facilitating an immunosuppressive environment within our GYN cancer cohort. Moreover, we conducted a stoichiometry constraint-based genome-scale metabolic model and computed correlation-grouped metabolic activity scores (cgScore) using metabolic enzyme gene expression as constraints. Among 1533 metabolic reactions, pyruvate transport and folate metabolism stood out as the most upregulated in responders versus those who progressed.Upon identifying several promising biomarkers, we used logistic regression classifiers to decipher the predictive value of each. Our model included clinical-demographic (age, BMI, cancer type, stage) and molecular-genomic features (immune marker gene expression, TopTGF-&#946; score, immune cell abundance from transcriptomic deconvolution, and the top 2 cgScores). Analysis divided into training and testing sets highlighted features such as stage, BMI, eosinophils, CD274, CD47, and the pyruvate transport reaction as significant predictors of ICI response. The model achieved an 80% accuracy rate on the test set, confirmed by permutation importance from scikit-learn. We also used a Regularized Cox model to link predictors with progression-free survival, emphasizing the roles of BMI, plasma cells, CD276, pyruvate transport reaction, and folate metabolism. In conclusion, there are immunological and metabolic markers have the potential to serve as predictive indicators for ICI treatment response and survival in GYN cancers. Understanding these predictors can profoundly influence clinical decision-making in immunotherapy, ultimately leading to enhanced patient outcomes and personalized treatment approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Gynecological cancers: other,Immuno-oncology,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical highly heterogeneous solid tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in China, however, the immune microenvironment of HCC, especially which caused by cancerogenic substance has not been clarified so far. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced mouse HCC model to dissect the immune cell dynamics during tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal distinct immune profiles in both precancerous and cancerous lesions, indicating early tumor-associated immunological alterations. Notably, specific T and B cell subpopulations are preferentially enriched in the HCC TME. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of na&#239;ve B cells with high CD83 expression, correlating with improved prognosis in human HCC. These signature genes were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC RNA-seq dataset. Moreover, cell interaction analysis revealed that subpopulations of B cells in both mouse and human samples are activated and may potentially contribute to oncogenic processes. In summary, our study provides insights into the dynamic immune microenvironment and cellular networks in HCC pathogenesis, with a specific emphasis on na&#239;ve B cells.

Despite several well-known driver mutations, more evidence has shown that genetic alterations in cytoskeleton organization enhance tumor aggressiveness and promote cancer progression, suggesting their roles as potential drivers. In this study, pan-cancer genetic analyses by using TCGA cohorts, more frequent mutation events were found in cytoskeleton-related genes as compared to total annotated genes, especially in cancers derived from hollow organs. High-dimensional analysis of molecular alterations in cancer (HD-MAC) suggested gene mutations in SPTAN1 and its partner SPTBN1 as potential prognostic biomarkers for clinical outcomes of patients with bladder cancer. Gene knockdown in either SPTAN1 or SPTBN1, mimicking silencing mutations in cancer tissues, caused cell morphology changes, DNA breaks, and alternations in cytokine profiles via activating cGAS-STING mediated interferon signaling. Xenograft tumor models also indicate accelerated tumor growth in SPTAN1- or SPTBN1-silenced cells, suggesting a more advanced cancer type. Based on immune staining in both human and mouse samples, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration was in tumor lesions with mutations or truncations in SPTAN1\/SPTBN1 genes. In addition, several known substitution mutations were found as potent neo-antigens based on MHC II binding prediction, which could be utilized as targets for immune checkpoint therapy. This study provides a novel insight into how the cytoskeleton can contribute to cancer progression and find out predictive biological indicators with therapeutic values.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytoskeleton,Immunotherapy,Mutations,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Neoadjuvant clinical trials studying the combination of cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in MIBC reported encouraging pathologic complete response rates. However, the molecular mechanisms and cellular programs involved in response and resistance to cisplatin and ICB in MIBC remain incompletely characterized. Our goal is to define cellular transcriptional programs and chromatin accessible regions in cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells associated with response and resistance to neoadjuvant systemic therapy.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-cell Multiome ATAC and Gene expression sequencing (simultaneous identification of gene expression and open chromatin regions within the same cell) of tumors that had a complete response &#8211; &#8220;responders&#8221; &#8211; and tumors that had no response or progressed &#8211; &#8220;non-responders&#8221; &#8211; through neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (n=15). Single cell suspensions were prepared following the 10x Genomics protocol. Cell Ranger ARC was used for sequence alignment, peak calling, and generation of count matrices. Downstream single-cell gene expression analysis was performed with Scanpy and ATAC-seq with Seurat.<br \/>Results: We identified two distinct urothelial cell populations in &#34;responders&#34; vs &#34;non-responders&#34; based on single cell gene expression and genome wide chromatin accessibility regions. Cancer cells in &#8220;non-responders&#8221; preferentially express basal cell gene expression signatures. &#8220;Non-responders&#8221; were significantly enriched in suppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Interestingly, SPP1+ TAMs known to have a pro-tumoral role and promote resistance to ICB were exclusively identified in &#8220;non-responders&#8221;.<br \/>Conclusion: Single cell and genome wide chromatin accessibility regions identify heterogenous urothelial cell populations expressing basal cell markers in tumors resistant to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. &#8220;Non-responders&#8221; are significantly enriched with TAMs implicated in resistance to ICB. Future studies will better define the implications of these findings in cancer therapeutics for patients with MIBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin resistance,Macrophages,Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

Exploring DLL3 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) through liquid biopsy, coupled with comprehensive genomic analysis, presents an invaluable and minimally-invasive avenue for monitoring disease progression. This approach holds the potential to tailor personalized treatment strategies, emphasizing the critical need for in-depth investigations into both DLL3-positive and negative cell genomic compositions.<br \/>METHODS: This study examined blood collected in CellSave preservative tubes from stage I (n=17) and stage IV (n=12) SCLC patients, as well as healthy donors (n=10). The CELLSEARCH&#174; platform was employed to count EpCAM-enriched CTCs and evaluate DLL3 protein expression. Subsequently, individual CTCs were isolated based on the presence and absence of DLL3 expression using the DEPArray&#8482; PLUS. The isolated DLL3-negative and positive CTCs were subjected to low-pass sequencing using the Ampli1&#8482; LowPass Kit to uncover genomic aberrations.<br \/>RESULTS: CTCs were absent in the healthy control group. In stage I patients, CTCs were identified in 5.8% of blood samples, while in stage IV patients, they were present in 50% of samples, with an average CTC count of 148 in stage IV. Among a total of 2074 detected CTCs, 460 were DLL3-positive, accounting for 6-28% of EpCAM-enriched CTCs in individual patients. Analysis of &#62;300 copy number alteration (CNA) profiles of sorted single cells revealed considerable inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity, delineating recurrent clonality and specific genomic alterations in DLL3-negative CTCs. In contrast, DLL3-positive cells showed more stochastic CNA profiles, suggestive of apoptosis-related DNA fragmentation.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Integrating CellSearch, DEPArray, and low-pass sequencing provides a minimally-invasive approach to compare genomic characteristics in DLL3-positive and negative CTCs from SCLC patients. Extension of this approach to a larger patient cohort and employing machine learning algorithms will facilitate identification of patterns within diverse CNA profiles, improving patient stratification and predicting treatment responses for personalized therapeutic strategies in SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Copy number alterations,Lung cancer: small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

We found multiple hallmarks being shifted after the treatment and being different between early and late responders. Also, a change in activity of multiple gene set signatures was detected after the treatment and activity of part of the gene set signatures predicted survival. Deconvolution of cell type composition from RNA-sequencing data revealed changes in immune cell abundances after the treatment. TCR-sequencing revealed changes in composition and diversity of TCR repertoires after the treatment and these differed between early and late responders.

Different organs play various immune function roles, and therefore present varied B and T cell gene expression and immune repertoire profiles. Abnormality of these profiles may reflect immunological disorder, presence of neoplastic tissue, or response to infectious agent. High-throughput sequencing technology has facilitated the understanding of gene expression and related cell functions, but in-depth understanding of B and T cell phenotype and clonotype profiling is an emerging application that has yet to take full advantage of sequencing technology for diagnosis and prognosis of disease.<br \/>Here, we share results of RNA sequencing of immune system tissues; including B cell and T cell specific gene expression and full-length immune repertoire profiling. Total RNA was extracted from various tissue samples including healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, thyroid, thymus and colon, as well as diseased PBMC and colon samples. RNA-seq and Immune-seq libraries were made from these samples and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq2000. Gene expression analysis and immune repertoire profiling from RNA-seq data were performed using edgeR and TRUST4. Immune repertoire sequencing data was processed using pRESTO and IgBlast. We correlated RNA-seq with Immune-seq results for B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor clonotypes. Differential expression and clonotype profiling comparisons were also performed between normal and diseased RNA samples. The effect of reference on immune repertoire detection sensitivity and accuracy was further investigated by comparing IMGT reference and AIRR-C Human IG Reference Sets.<br \/>This study has identified tissue specific B\/T cell phenotype and clonality patterns that relate to tissue functions and disease progression. RNA-seq enables highly multiplex immunophenotyping which is traditionally performed by flow cytometry. RNA-seq can detect high-abundant clones that correlate with Immune-seq, with the latter targeted approach providing more in depth clonality signatures. References comparison results show the importance of continued community effort to develop more representative and accurate immunorepertoire germ line references for clonotype annotation in diverse populations. Integrating both RNA sequencing and immune repertoire sequencing approaches allows accurate phenotype and clonotype determination for immune landscape in various tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Biomarkers,B cells,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, the complex molecular biomarkers and signatures of HNSCC among BAAs and molecular distinction associated with HNSCC disparities are largely unknown. Here we show the results of a multi-omics analysis of 500 patients (48 BAAs and 452 Whites). Comparative analyses between the racial groups were performed at the level of genomics, pathways, molecular subtype, tumor immune infiltration, protein alterations and prognosis. We found that overall survival in BAAs with HPV-unrelated HNSCC is significantly shorter than in White patients. Ancestry-related differential mutation spectrum, DNA methylation, gene and protein expression pattern and immune infiltration landscape were identified. Particularly, FAT1 mutation is significantly associated with its gene expression in BAA HNSCC and poor overall survival in this group. In BAA HNSCC, SALL3 gene expression is positively associated with its gene CNVs, while RTP4 gene expression is inversely correlated with its methylation. High EGFR_pY1068 and RAD50 levels correlate with poor prognosis in BAAs with HNSCC. The immune infiltration enrichment scores of Th17 cells, activated dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in BAA HNSCC were significantly lower than those in White HNSCC. By combining multi-omics analysis and data validation using in-house-made tumor tissue arrays, this study comprehensively elucidates the genetic landscape, immune response, and tumor biology in BAA and White HNSCC patients, providing a molecular basis for future research in identifying appropriate screening modalities and therapeutic interventions leading to improved outcomes in BAAs with HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immune cells,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is the primary treatment. Notably, Black women face the highest mortality-to-incidence ratio across all ethnic groups. This study investigated transcriptomic and immunological differences in tumors from Black compared to NHW women that might explain the poor clinical outcomes observed within this patient cohort. Methods: We collected primary tumor specimens from 36 Black and 31 treatment-na&#239;ve NHW patients. After RNA isolation, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified differentially expressed transcripts and Enrichr performed pathway enrichment studies. To confirm the observed gene expression differences, we employed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC). Additionally, we conducted cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell viability assays to functionally validate potential target genes of interest. Results: Our findings revealed 277 genes with significant differential expression between Black and NHW patients (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60; 0.05). Among these, 103 coding genes were up-regulated, while 81 coding genes were down-regulated in tumors from Black compared to NHW patients. Gene Ontology analyses of these significantly differentially expressed genes highlighted enriched pathways related to DNA damage response, including the insulin receptor (INSR) gene, p53\/apoptosis signaling components such as Forkhead box proteins A1 (FOXA1) and FOXB1, as well as genes involved in the cholesterol\/lipid modulation pathway, including Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD). Notably, silencing INSR and FOXA1 enhanced sensitivity to platinum-based drugs and inhibited cell growth and colony formation. Furthermore, we identified differences in the proportions of key immune cell types between the two patient groups, with tumors from Black patients exhibiting a significantly lower proportion of CD4+ Na&#239;ve T-cells and CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Conclusions: Overall, our study reveals significant differential gene expression patterns between HGSOC tumors from Black and NHW patients, as well as differences in the proportions of immune cell types. These discoveries provide valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the disparities in outcomes observed between black and NHW patients afflicted with HGSOC. It is critical to further investigate how these biological differences affect clinical outcomes and treatment response in Black women.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Transcriptional regulation,Immuno-oncology,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, unlike head and neck angiosarcoma (AS-HN), AS-B disease characteristics in Asia remains unclear. We examined clinical patterns of angiosarcoma patients (n = 176) seen in an Asian tertiary cancer centre from 1999 to 2021, and specifically investigated the molecular and immune features of AS-B in comparison to AS-HN. Data from whole genome sequencing (WGS) (AS-HN, n = 44; breast, n = 7), NanoString PanCancer IO360 gene expression profiling (AS-HN, n = 42; breast, n = 7) and 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics (AS-HN, n = 4; breast, n = 2) were analyzed. Majority of cases were AS-HN (n = 104; 59.1%), while AS-B (n = 16, all females) accounted for 9.1% of the cases. The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range, 26 to 74). Four cases (25%) were related to prior irradiation, while 6 out of 8 cases evaluated were positive for human herpesvirus-7 on immunohistochemistry. Although all cases were non-metastatic at diagnosis and were treated with curative-intent surgery, 6 patients (37.5%) experienced rapid relapse within a median of 7.8 months. Based on WGS, 4 of the 7 AS-B had non-synonymous somatic variants in 48 genes (range, 2 to 28 per case). Among the notable variants found were in kinases (KDR, JAK2, FLT4, ATR, EPHB1 and PRKACA). Other variants were found in cancer-related genes (e.g. ATRX, FOXO1, SMAD3, PTCH1, NOTCH4, HIF1A and SETD1A). These genes were functionally annotated by performing over representation analysis (www.webgestalt.org) on publicly available databases (e.g. Gene Ontology and KEGG). They were enriched in cancer-related pathways such as regulation of cell differentiation, VEGFR and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. By NanoString profiling, compared to AS-HN, AS-B was enriched for angiogenesis, notch signaling and metastasis-associated matrix remodeling pathways. Conversely, AS-B was depleted of lymphoid compartment, immune cell adhesion and migration expression signatures. Based on the gene expression signatures, AS-B was enriched for macrophages, CD8+ T cells and was depleted for T-reg cells. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics showed that compared to AS-HN, tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) in AS-B were enriched for macrophage and T-cells but were depleted for B-cells and NK cells. The location of TILs could provide information on the feasibility of immunotherapy in angiosarcoma. In conclusion, we observed a convergence of both mutational and expression signatures on angiogenesis signaling pathways in our AS-B cases. The spatial transciptomic data revealed that AS-B was enriched for tumor-infiltrating macrophages and T-cells which might have implications on the role of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Whole genome sequencing,Gene expression profiling,Angiogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
