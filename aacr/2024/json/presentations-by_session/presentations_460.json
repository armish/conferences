[{"Abstract":"Introduction: In cancer metastasis in the trunk, the secreted proteins from tumors, such as VEGFs and TNF-&#945;, activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). The activated FAK promotes VE-cadherin phosphorylation and the expression of cell adhesion molecules, and it facilitates the extravasation of cancer cells. In the cerebral blood vessels, the VECs maintain very strong cell adhesion supported by the surrounding pericytes and astrocytes. The strong barrier of cerebral VECs is called the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is regulated differently from trunk VECs. Although the role of FAK in trunk metastasis is shown in many studies, its importance in brain metastasis is not verified. In this study, we focused on the role of the cerebral endothelial FAK and compared the role of FAK in brain metastasis with that in trunk metastasis.<br \/>Methods: We generated tamoxifen-inducible VEC-specific FAK knockout (FAK-cKO) mice (<i>VEcad-Cre<sup>ERT2<\/sup>; Ptk2-flox\/flox<\/i>) and brain metastatic (BrM) cell lines of Ex3LL (murine lung cancer cell line). We intracardially injected BrM cells of Ex3LL into the FAK-cKO mice and analyzed the tumor development using <i>in vivo<\/i> bioluminescence imaging and a CUBIC tissue clearing system. We also analyzed the intracranially injected mice of the parental and BrM cell lines to evaluate the tumor angiogenesis, which is reported to be promoted by the endothelial FAK.<br \/>Results: Although FAK-cKO in VECs has been reported to inhibit lung metastasis, brain metastasis was accelerated in FAK-cKO mice compared with control mice. The number of brain metastatic sites increased in FAK-cKO mice, but there was no difference in the individual tumor size. It suggests that the brain metastasis was promoted by FAK-cKO, but that the proliferation of brain metastasis was not promoted by FAK-cKO. Blood vessel density was decreased with irregular shape in the brain tumors of FAK-cKO mice, suggesting that the angiogenesis was inhibited by FAK-cKO. It indicates that the angiogenic function of endothelial FAK in the brain vasculature was not different from that in the trunk.<br \/>Conclusion: FAK-cKO in VECs exacerbated the brain metastasis of the BrM cells although it has been reported to inhibit the metastasis in the trunk. FAK-cKO in VECs decreased tumor angiogenesis both in the brain and the trunk. It suggests that the regulatory mechanism of cell adhesion and the FAK function in the brain vasculature is partly different from that in the other organs in the body trunk. We need further investigation to elucidate the function of endothelial FAK in brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Blood-brain barrier,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear; while biological sex differences and inherent immune response variability have been assessed in tumor cells, the role of the microenvironment surrounding the tumor, contextually in aging, has been overlooked. We find that skin fibroblasts undergo age-mediated changes in their proliferation, senescence, ROS levels and stress response that vary with sex. We find that aged male fibroblasts selectively drive an invasive and slow-cycling phenotype in melanoma cells in vitro by increasing AXL expression. This is also evident in syngeneic mouse models where metastasis is increased in aged male mice. Mechanistically, intrinsic aging in male fibroblasts coupled with elevated ROS promotes EZH2 decline thereby increasing BMP2 secretion, which in turn drives the slower-cycling, highly invasive, and therapy-resistant melanoma cell phenotype, characteristic of the aged male TME. Inhibition of BMP2 activity blocks the emergence of the invasive phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF\/MEK inhibition. Our data provides an integrated view of how age and sex of the host contributes to melanoma progression and therapy responses. Bridging this knowledge gap will improve patient stratification and assist in tailoring the therapy to the individual.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Sex differences,Aging,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Recent advances in the clinical handling of localized prostate cancers resulted in an almost 100% 10-year survival, but no curative treatment is currently available for metastatic disease. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of progression of primary tumors to metastasis is crucial to develop new therapeutic strategies. While tumorigenesis initiates in prostatic epithelial cells, various cell types, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune and endothelial cells produce extra-cellular matrix and secrete signaling molecules that might contribute to tumor progression. However, the complex communication network driving tumor progression is poorly characterized. As the tumor suppressors <i>PTEN <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>are among the most frequently altered genes in prostate cancer, we generated genetically engineered mice with <i>Pten and Trp53 <\/i>selective inactivation in prostatic epithelial cells at adulthood. Their analysis revealed that they develop precancerous lesions that progress to invasive and metastatic tumors. Spatial transcriptomic and single-cell analyses of <i>Pten-<\/i> and <i>Trp53-<\/i>deficient prostatic tumors identified the presence of a cancer cell population exhibiting cell plasticity driven by Jak\/Stat3 signaling and induced by CAF-produced IL6. In addition, these tumors exhibit a hypoxic core and an immune infiltrate dominated by neutrophils. Inhibition of the hypoxic signaling reduced immune infiltration in primary tumors and their metastatic potential, but did not induce apoptosis of <i>Pten-<\/i> and <i>Trp53-<\/i> deficient epithelial cells, in contrast to those of <i>Pten-<\/i>deficient tumors. These results underline the importance of the tumor genomic background for therapeutic intervention. Taken together, our work highlights the key role of the tumor microenvironment in driving prostate cancer progression and uncovers new vulnerabilities of this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Hypoxia-inducible factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

To develop a more effective therapeutic strategy, it is crucial to understand the underlying pathological mechanism of brain metastasis. Recent clinical data has unveiled a significant association between low body mass index (BMI) and an increased risk of brain metastasis in lung cancer patients, leading to reduced survival rates compared to other primary tumors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this paradoxical relationship, often referred to as the \"obesity paradox,\" in the context of lung cancer mortality presents a complex and intriguing puzzle and warrants in-depth investigation. Here, we examined biological mechanism of how low BMI promotes lung cancer brain metastasis. In this study, we conducted a retrospective pan-analysis of 5,516 patient cohorts with brain metastasis originating from lung, breast, melanoma, and renal cancers with their BMI status. We found that lung cancer patients with low BMI have significantly higher brain metastatic incidence compared to the high BMI patients, in contrast to breast, melanoma, and renal cancers. Furthermore, we found that low BMI plays a pivotal role in mediating neuron activation within the brain and that the secretion of neuronal neuropeptide Y (NPY), a protein involved in appetite and energy homeostasis via GHSR-receptor manner, promotes metabolic switching through NPY\/NPY5R axis in the tumor cells in the brain thereby enabling metastasis. Elevated levels of neuronal NPY in the brains of cancer-free subjects with low BMI suggest its potential utility as a promising prognostic biomarker for identifying the increased risk of metastatic disease in lung cancer patients with low BMI. We also demonstrated that reversing low BMI or blocking the NPY\/Y5R interactions effectively abrogated brain metastasis in our animal model. Our findings suggest a novel pro-metastatic role of low BMI-induced NPY in the progression of brain metastasis. We emphasize the importance of elucidating the clinical implications of this relationship to develop an updated intervention strategy for the clinical care of patients with lung cancer and low BMI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Body mass index,Lung cancer,Brain metastasis,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Nowhere are these mechanisms more important than in osteosarcoma-a pediatric bone tumor where metastases cause nearly all osteosarcoma related deaths and occur almost exclusively in the lung. The purpose of this study was to define the cellular and molecular events that facilitate osteosarcoma lung colonization to devise novel therapeutic strategies that prevent and treat metastasis.<br \/>Experimental Approach: We generated experimental lung metastases using a panel of immunocompetent murine and human xenograft osteosarcoma models. A combination of immunohistochemistry, single cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics were used to define the metastatic niche. Relevant findings were validated in human primary tumor, lung metastasis, and normal lung tissue specimens.<br \/>Results: Disseminated osteosarcoma cells physically associate with alveolar epithelial cells and trigger changes in surrounding epithelial cells that are characteristic of the aberrant, non-resolving wound response seen in non-malignant lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This process drives the accumulation of fibrotic epithelial cells and scar-associated macrophages confined within a dense fibronectin-based matrix. Anti-fibrotic tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat patients with IPF (nintedanib) prevent the observed fibrogenic changes and inhibit metastatic colonization. Epithelial-osteosarcoma paracrine signaling is dominated by an inflammatory cytokine milieu that facilitates this transition towards fibrosis. Blocking one of the dominant paracrine signals with a recombinant IL1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) has similar effects on both fibrosis and metastatic colonization.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that tumor interactions with host stromal cells are critical for metastasis. Metastatic colonization requires transformation of the local lung microenvironment into a fibrotic, non-resolving, cytokine-rich, wound-like state that is both provoked and sustained by tumor-epithelial interactions. These insights have identified several potential therapeutic approaches to prevent metastatic colonization and treat established metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Microenvironment,Osteosarcoma,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We show that chronic stress increased lung metastasis from disseminated cancer cells 2- to 4-fold in mice. Chronic stress significantly altered the lung microenvironment, with fibronectin accumulation, reduced T cell infiltration, and increased neutrophil infiltration. Depleting neutrophils abolished stress-induced metastasis, indicating their critical role. Chronic stress shifted neutrophils&#8217; normal circadian rhythm, and, via glucocorticoid release, caused increased neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Importantly, in mice with neutrophil-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion, chronic stress failed to increase NETs and metastasis. Furthermore, digesting NETs with deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I prevented chronic stress-induced metastasis. Together, our data show that glucocorticoids released during chronic stress cause NET formation and establish a metastasis-promoting microenvironment. Therefore, NETs could be targets for preventing metastatic recurrence in cancer patients, many of whom will experience chronic stress due to their disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),chronic stress,metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.-Y.

Metastatic growth within the bone marrow (BM) is relatively infrequent. Despite its unique immunological characteristics, there is a paucity of research on tumor immune microenvironment in the context of BM metastasis, particularly in patients with solid cancer. This study aims to elucidate the dominant immune cell populations within the BM of patients with solid cancer BM metastasis.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Patients with solid tumors, who underwent BM examinations (aspiration and\/or biopsy) for suspected BM metastasis at our institution between 2016 and 2023 were extracted from the database of pathology. To evaluate BM immune microenvironment in patients with BM metastasis originating from solid tumor, we performed flow cytometry analysis of myeloid and lymphoid subsets using bone marrow aspiration. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were defined as CD33<sup>+<\/sup>CD14<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>-\/low<\/sup>. Additionally, a control group was established, consisting of patients in whom BM metastasis were pathologically ruled out.<br \/>Results: The study involved the BM examinations in 39 patients, 22 of whom were pathologically diagnosed with BM metastasis. No substantial difference in age or gender were observed between patients with or without BM metastasis. However, the incidence of bone metastasis was significantly higher in the BM metastasis group compared to the non-BM metastasis group (90.9 vs. 47.1%, P=0.004). The median duration from the initial diagnosis of metastatic state to the occurrence of BM metastasis was 14.5 days (range 0 - 2194 days) for patients with BM metastasis, whereas it was 170 days (range 0 - 1304 days) for those without BM metastasis. Among the patients who underwent BM examinations, flow cytometry analysis was available in 13 patients with BM metastasis and 11 patients without BM metastasis. Our analysis revealed that a substantial increase in the mean percentage of MDSCs (CD14<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>-\/low<\/sup>) in CD14<sup>+<\/sup> monocytes of BM aspirates from patients with BM metastasis compared to those without (28.06 vs. 8.09%, P=0.0005). Additionally, while not statistically significant, the mean percentage of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the total live cell population appeared to be higher in patients with BM metastasis compared to those without (10.26 vs. 6.67%, P=0.0622). In terms of lymphoid subsets, CD4\/8 ratio was significantly elevated in patients with BM metastasis as opposed to those without BM metastasis (1.57 vs. 0.76%, P=0.0472).<br \/>Conclusion: The tumor immune microenvironment in BM metastasis was skewed toward immunosuppressive state.

The tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) is a key site for the development of anti-tumor immunity that has been reported to be involved in both CD8+ T and NK cells. As a major role of innate immunity, NK cells can produce IFN-&#947;, perforin and granzyme to eliminate tumor cells in the early stages of cancer development. This study aimed to investigate the difference of clinicopathological and immunological profiles in local tissues between CRC patients with enlarged and non-enlarged metastasis-free TDLNs.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The patient cohort was obtained from the NEPDC cohort (No. 2015CB554000). A total of 45 patients with pathologically confirmed stage I-II colorectal cancer were included in this study. Based on the MRI, these patients were divided into enlarged and non-enlarged TDLN groups (lymph nodes &#62;\/= 5mm and lymph nodes &#60; 5mm). We collected the tumor tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue that was 2 cm away from the tumor lesion. The genomic DNA of the tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues was treated with bisulfite and analyzed with the EPIC methylation array. The MeTMEC algorithm based on the methylation profile estimated subsequent cell abundance in these patient tissues.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The study sample was comprised of 22 enlarged TDLN and 23 non-enlarged TDLN patients. There were 4 T1-T2 and 18 T3-T4 patients in the enlarged TDLN group, with 12 T1-T2 and 11 T3-T4 patients in the non-enlarged TDLN group. The proportion of T3-T4 patients in the enlarged TDLN group was higher than that in the non-enlarged TDLN group (p=0.017, Chi-squared test), suggesting an advanced invasion in the local tissue of patients with enlarged TDLN. Then, the abundance of monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, Treg cells, naive T cells, memory T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and B cells in the tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues were inferred with the MeTMEC algorithm by using DNA methylation profile. In the T1-T2 subset, we found that the infiltration of NK cells in the tumor-adjacent normal tissues was significantly more abundant in the enlarged TDLN group compared with the non-enlarged TDLN group (p=0.021, t-test), suggesting an active immune response of NK cells for potential local tumor control. No significant difference in other immune cells was observed between the two groups.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Enlarged TDLN indicates an advanced invasion of tumors in local tissues with an active NK cell-mediated immunity.

Recent studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory and tumor-supportive roles of neurotransmitter-receptor signals in various cancers. Given that various neurotransmitter receptors are expressed in the liver, we aimed to investigate their possible involvement in the metastatic-prone liver microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified <i>ADRB2<\/i>, which encodes &#946;2-adrenergic receptor (&#946;2-AR), as the top-upregulated neurotransmitter receptor gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) and liver metastasis in patients with CRC liver metastasis (CRLM). Co-immunofluorescence (co-IF) staining confirmed the colocalization of &#946;2-AR with myeloid cell marker CD11b instead of T cell marker CD3 and NK cell marker CD56 in patients with CRLM. Consistently, we observed the upregulation of CD11b\/&#946;2-AR double-positive cells in the liver tissues from mice bearing CRC or CRLM compared to na&#239;ve mice through co-IF staining. High-dimensional flow cytometry analysis further revealed that &#946;2-AR was mainly expressed in macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Treatment of CRC-tumor bearing mice with pan &#946;-AR inhibitor propranolol and &#946;2-AR specific inhibitor showed a potential to reduce liver metastatic incidence without suppressing primary CRC. Mechanistically, &#946;2-AR activation may upregulate the expression of <i>S100a8\/9<\/i> to enhance the immunosuppressive activity of macrophages and MDSCs, thereby promoting CRC liver metastasis.

However, the pathological mechanism by which smoking promotes brain metastasis through modulating brain microenvironment is yet poorly understood. We previously showed that the incidence of brain metastasis is associated with nicotine intake. Nicotine enhanced polarization of M2 pro-tumor microglia, which promoted brain metastasis. In addition to the immune surveillance role, microglial cells also control neuronal synapse formation. Microglial cells promote neuron synapse formation in the developing brain, whereas microglia depletion suppresses synapse density. Furthermore, microglia-secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to promote synaptic formation by targeting synapse-related genes of the DKK-Wnt family. Neurons are one of the most abundant cell types in the brain, and they are highly specialized for cell-to-cell signal activation. However, little is known about the roles of neurons in brain metastasis of lung cancer. We hypothesize that nicotine stimulates microglia to secrete exosomal miR-32-3p, which promotes brain metastasis by augmenting GABAergic synaptic formation and hence releasing GABA that serves as a metabolic substrate to fuel tumor cell growth. We also hypothesize that inhibiting the GABA transporter of tumor cells suppresses brain metastasis by blocking the GABA shunt. We found that lung cancer patients with a smoking history had significantly higher synaptic formation and the expression of GABA transporter in brain metastasis. To investigate the effect of smoking and nicotine intake on brain metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>, mice were intracardially transplanted with lung cancer brain metastasis cells (H2030BrM and PC9BrM) followed by administration of nicotine or cigarette smoke exposure in a smoking chamber. We found that smoking and nicotine increased M2 microglia polarization, synaptic formation, and the expression of GABA in mouse brain metastasis. Furthermore, nicotine increased the secretion of miR-32-3p from nicotine-pretreated microglia, which promoted GABA release from GABAergic neurons<i>.<\/i> Treating H2030BrM and PC9BrM cells with conditioned medium (CM) obtained from neurons exposed to CM derived from nicotine-treated microglia exosomes resulted in increased tumor growth through the activation of the GABA shunt pathway. Blocking GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) by CRISPR\/Cas9 or a small molecule of GAT1 inhibitor suppressed the GABAergic neuron-induced tumor progression. Our results indicate that nicotine-activated microglia enhanced GABA release from neurons followed by the promotion of GABA shunt in tumor cells and that a GAT inhibitor serves as a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of lung cancer patients with brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Brain metastasis,Microenvironment,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

Brain metastasis (BM) is a common occurrence in LC, constituting nearly 50% of all BM cases with the brain emerging as the preferred site for LC metastasis. Unfortunately, current LCBM treatment options yield limited success, as reflected in the median survival of BM patients at 7.8 months. Consequently, there is an imperative need for novel and more efficacious therapeutic approaches targeting LCBM. Evidence suggests that brain microenvironment cells, particularly microglia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play a pivotal role in facilitating the colonization and growth of LCBM. Previous investigations from our lab have identified the involvement of the P-selectin\/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (SELP\/PSGL-1) axis in microglia\/TAMs immunophenotypes, promoting pro-tumorigenic activity. This led us to explore the role of the SELP\/PSGL-1 axis in the interactions between LCBM cells and the brain microenvironment<sup>1<\/sup>. Thus, we conducted Immunostaining on human tissue samples, revealing increased expression of SELP, PSGL-1, PD-1, PD-L1, IBA-1, and CD68 in LCBM tissues. Simultaneously, we employed advanced 3D models to investigate the intricate interactions between cancer cells and microglia\/TAMs. Actively inhibiting the SELP\/PSGL-1 axis with pharmacological agents led to a significant decrease in migration and invasion when LC cells were co-cultured with microglia and TAMs. Moreover, SELP inhibition prompted a shift in microglia\/TAMs state towards an M1-like phenotype, enhancing the ability of CD4\/CD8 cells to target cancer cells in our unique 3D LCBM models. This effect was further enhanced when co-treated with a PD-1 inhibitor, demonstrating a potential synergistic impact in targeting both pathways for therapeutic intervention. Our results suggest that combining SELP inhibition with other immunomodulators, including a small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor developed in our lab<sup>2<\/sup>, could synergistically enhance both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Taken together, this study may enhance our understanding of LCBM immunogenicity and contribute to the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches that can improve patient outcomes.1.Yeini, E.<i>, et al.<\/i> P-selectin axis plays a key role in microglia immunophenotype and glioblastoma progression. <i>Nat Commun<\/i> 12, 1912 (2021). 2.

This suggests that CAFs produce soluble factors that increase the tumor-initiating ability of CSCs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was highly upregulated in the conditioned medium of CAFs co-cultured with BCCs. Tumor-initiating ability was increased in the presence of G-CSF. Furthermore, G-CSF neutralizing antibody treatment suppressed tumorigenesis and bone metastasis in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model.

To successfully metastasize, the tumor cell will be required to make numerous adjustments and survive a series of stages involving intravasation, circulation in the blood or lymph system, extravasation, and growth at distant organs, and overcome the challenges of immunosurveillance. The tumor microenvironment is the ecosystem that surrounds and feeds the tumor. The molecular mechanism by which the metastatic tumors survive and escape from immune attack in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. To study the molecular mechanism of interaction between metastatic tumors and the immune system in metastasis, we established immune-resistant metastatic models. We identified that PAEP, a progestogen-associated endometrial protein, is significantly upregulated in immune-resistant metastatic tumors compared with non-immune-resistant tumors. PAEP is a glycoprotein that inhibits cell immune function and plays an essential role in the pregnancy process. To examine the function of PAEP in tumor metastasis, we first introduced PAEP into non-immune resistant and poorly metastatic melanoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells. We found that overexpression of PAEP significantly promotes tumor metastatic potential of both melanoma and RMS cells in immunocompetent mice. Interestingly, there was no difference in metastasis between the control and overexpression groups in immunodeficient mice. These data suggest that PAEP may mediate tumor metastasis relating to host immunity. To further confirm the function of PAEP in tumor metastasis, we use CRISPR\/Cas9 technology to knockout endogenous PAEP and will test the metastatic potential in different hosts. We will also investigate the molecular mechanisms using RNA sequencing and Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) to analyze the metastatic samples. Our study will uncover a new mechanism for how tumors survive in the microenvironment and identify a novel target for the treatment of metastatic diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Metastatic potential,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The balance between host immune regulation and tumor immune evasion ultimately permits or prevents cancer progression. Lymphocytic infiltration in colorectal cancer can predict long-term clinical outcomes. However, these lymphocytes' origin, subtype and function have yet to be adequately explored. We investigated the association between the development of metastasis and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells expressing the integrin protein CD103, a marker of tissue-resident memory T cells.<br \/>Methods: In this retrospective, case-control matched study, we conducted multiplex immunofluorescence staining of tumor samples from 124 patients with colorectal cancer. Tissue microarrays containing representative cores of the central tumor, invasive margin, and adjacent normal tissue were immunostained for CD3, CD8, CD103, pSMAD3, and cytokeratin, using tyramide signal amplification. Cells were quantified using StrataQuest digital image analysis software, with intratumoral and stromal regions analyzed separately. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance with subsequent Dunn&#8217;s test for pair-wise comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni method of multiple-comparison correction.<br \/>Results: Central tumor and invasive margin CD3<sup>+<\/sup> densities were associated with synchronous metastasis. Compared to non-metastatic patients, those who went on to develop metachronous metastasis (n=42) had a low proportion of intra-epithelial CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> T cells at the central tumor (non-metastatic: 32.8%, IQR 15.0-42.7%; metachronous metastasis: 12.9%, IQR 2.08-28.4%; P = 0.013). Similarly, patients with metachronous metastasis had a low proportion of stromal CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> T cells at the invasive margin (non-metastatic: 3.51%, IQR 1.83-6.55%; metachronous metastasis: 1.75%, IQR 0.62-3.72%; P = 0.019). On multivariate Cox regression of histological features, amongst patients with metastasis, significant overall survival prognostic markers<br \/>included a low proportional CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration (HR 2.41, 95%CI 1.16-5.01, P = 0.019), mucinous features (HR 4.28, 95%CI 1.98-9.24, P &#60; 0.001), and the presence of perineural invasion (HR 2.75, 95%CI 1.28-5.89, P &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes may protect from the development of colorectal metastasis. Proportional CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD103<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration is a promising prognostic marker in colorectal adenocarcinoma for the development of metachronous metastasis, and, amongst patients with metastasis, it is a prognostic marker of overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Colorectal cancer,Metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the first organs to receive lymphatic drainage via afferent lymphatic channels leading directly from the primary melanoma. In patients with nodal metastasis, it has been shown that the SLN has a profoundly immunotolerant microenvironment. We sought to determine whether lymphatic fluid signals, including PAF, may be involved in modulating the SLN immune microenvironment to favor melanoma metastasis.<br \/>Hypothesis: Upregulation of PAF can bind to its receptor on monocytes and activate downstream immunosuppressive chemokines, resulting in an immunosuppressed environment in SLNs that permits nodal metastasis and melanoma progression.<br \/>Methods: Lymphatic fluids, plasma samples, and SLN samples were collected from patients undergoing surgical excision of melanoma with SLN biopsy under an IRB-approved protocol. Metabolic analyses were performed on lymphatic fluids from high- versus low-risk patients by two-dimensional liquid chromatography system coupled with mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS). Single cell sequencing was done on single cell suspensions from SLN samples. Protein array was used to compare the cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma samples from high- versus low-risk melanoma patients. We compared two groups: low-risk (no SLN metastasis) and high-risk (with SLN metastasis).<br \/>Results: Lymphatic fluid PAF levels were 3-fold greater in high-risk melanoma patients compared with low-risk patients (<i>p<\/i>=0.0039). Macrophages were identified as the cell type with greatest PTAFR (platelet-activating factor receptor) expression by single cell sequencing. CCL17 levels in plasma samples from high-risk patients were significantly lower than in low-risk patients (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). These results suggest that increased PAF in lymphatic fluid may bind to PTAFR in SLN macrophages, inhibit chemokines (such as CCL17), and result in an immunosuppressive SLN environment to favor nodal metastasis and melanoma progression.<br \/>Conclusion: Lymphatic fluid PAF signaling may contribute to an immunotolerant microenvironment in the SLN that allows nodal metastasis and melanoma progression through downregulation of CCL17. Further studies will investigate whether this pathway can be exploited to therapeutic advantage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Metastasis,Lymph nodes,Chemokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone malignancy that commonly metastasizes to the lungs, resulting in significant patient mortality. During metastasis, disseminated cancer cells are exposed to microenvironment-derived growth factors that result in signaling pathway activation. Two such pathways are MAPK\/ERK and PI3K\/AKT, which regulate complex transcriptional programs underlying cell proliferation and survival decisions. In this study, we utilized precision cut lung slices (PCLS) obtained from mice with established osteosarcoma metastases to ex vivo model associations between the spatiotemporal distributions of growth factors in the lung, osteosarcoma signaling dynamics, and intratumoral gene expression heterogeneity, with single cell precision. To accomplish this, we engineered osteosarcoma cells that co-expressed genetically-encoded ERK and AKT sensors, engrafted them into PCLS tissues, then recorded sensor dynamics via live-cell microscopy. These tissues were subsequently fixed and immuno-stained for measurement of growth factor expression in resident lung cells and spatial correlation with observed tumor cell ERK-AKT signaling dynamics. Using this approach, we found that growth factor expression was diffusely increased within areas bordering osteosarcoma metastases. FGF2 and IGF1, which we have previously demonstrated to potently induce ERK signaling in osteosarcoma cells, were both significantly upregulated in these regions. However, despite relatively uniform overexpression of growth factors adjacent to tumors, individual osteosarcoma cells displayed stochastics patterns of ERK and AKT signaling, and downstream gene targets. These findings revealed that upregulation of lung growth factors, and the inherent systems-level properties of osteosarcoma signaling networks, can converge to promote intratumoral signaling and gene expression heterogeneity. Together, our results, using a novel PCLS and live-cell biosensor imaging approach, provide new insight into how spatial and temporal changes in microenvironmental signaling composition are integrated by metastatic osteosarcoma cells to promote heterogeneity.<sub><\/sub>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signaling pathways,,Osteosarcoma,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

After immunohistochemical staining and whole slide scanning densities of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells and CD20+ B cells were quantified in NM, pCRC and LM using QuPath software. In pCRC and LM cell densities were measured in tumor center (TC), inner margin (IM), outer margin (OM) and peritumor (PT) region. IM and OM were defined as 500 &#181;m on each side of the invasive tumor border.<br \/>Results: For all examined cells in both groups we found smaller densities in TC of pCRC and LM compared to NM (Table). In pCRC of synchronous group compared to LM densities of all cells were smaller in IM and OM and densities of CD3+ and CD8+ cells were smaller in PT region. In pCRC of metachronous group compared to LM densities of all cells were greater in TC, densities of CD3+ were smaller in OM and PT region, whereas densities of CD20+ cells were smaller only in OM. Compared to metachronous group patients with synchronous metastases had smaller densities of CD3+ T cells in IM and CD8+ T cells in TC and IM of pCRC.<br \/>Conclusion: Development of pCRC is accompanied by decreased densities of T and B cells in TC compared to NM, which further decrease in metachronous LM. Lower densities of T and B cells in IM and OM and T cells in PT region of pCRC compared to LM is a hallmark of synchronous group. TC of pCRC harbors larger numbers of T and B cells compared to LM in metachronous group. Low numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in IM and CD8+ T cells in TC of primary CRC may contribute to development of synchronous metastases.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

While a diverse array of primary tumors may result in LM, recent work from our laboratory (Chi Y et al 2020 Science) demonstrates a conserved transcriptional signature, independent of primary tumor, suggesting that tumor-microenvironmental interactions play a dominant role in this pathology. We have proteomically interrogated CSF collected from breast (n = 45), lung (n = 30), and melanoma (n = 27) patients with and without LM. We detect robust expression of inflammatory cytokines in all LM+ samples, 15 of these cytokines including IL8, IL6, and CXCL1 are conserved across tumor types in the presence of LM. Because cancer cells in the CSF do not express mRNA associated with these cytokines, we hypothesized that these inflammatory cytokines may originate from the microenvironment. Within the leptomeninges, LM cells adhere to and interact with the innermost layer of the meninges, the pia mater, which contains fibroblast-like cells. Co-culture of cancer cells with pial cells induced changes in the pial cell transcriptome and secretome, leading to increased IL8, IL6, and CXCL1 production. This communication between cancer cells and pial cells is preserved in the absence of direct cell-cell contact. These pial cells support cancer cell growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, as measured by co-implantation experiments. In addition, bulk RNA sequencing of mouse pial cells shows an inflammatory signature upregulated in the presence of LM. Taken together, these observations support a cancer-associated-fibroblast like role for pial cells in the setting of LM. Our work extends the CAF phenotype beyond classical fibroblasts to include pial cells, suggesting novel therapeutic opportunities within CNS malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Metastasis,Cytokines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, the earliest steps of lethal metastasis in patients are incompletely understood. Therefore, in this study we searched for the earliest detectable disseminated cancer cells (DCC) in sentinel lymph node biopsies of 492 stage I-III melanoma patients. We used micromanipulator-assisted isolation and single-cell transcriptome analysis of these extremely rare DCC and identified melanoma -associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) expressing melanoma cells as strong candidates for metastasis founder cells in lymph nodes. Based on a median follow-up time of 6 years, their detection was the strongest predictor of systemic metastasis and death upon multivariable analysis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that melanoma DCC were exposed to CD8 T cell attack during the transition from single cells to metastasis-initiating clusters, activated the extracellular vesicular exosomal pathway, and expressed the immunomodulatory proteins CD155 and CD276, but rarely PD-L1. CD155- and CD276-positive extracellular vesicles from patient-derived DCC models showed an immunosuppressive activity on CD8 T cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that either direct targeting of metastasis-founder cell with MCSP or their immune escape mechanisms may be key to curing early-stage melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Disseminated tumor cells,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

According to TCGA databank CSF2 expression upregulated in human HPV+ (Human Papilloma Virus) Head and Neck Small Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) compared to normal tissue. The mechanism of CSF2 in tumor progression and chemo resistance has not been well studied. Previously, our lab generated a murine model of HPV+ HNSCC that is partially responsive to cisplatin and radiation (like human disease). The role of our study is to evaluate the importance of Csf2 with cisplatin treatment (CT) in HPV + HNSCC in the murine model. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology we knocked out the expression of the Csf2 ligand in our parental mEERL (murine E6 E7 Ras Luciferase) tumor cell line and implanted both the parental mEERL tumor and the Csf2 KO mEERL tumor in the oral cavity of C57BL6\/J mice. When tumors reached a palpable size, we administered Cisplatin (20mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, 3 doses total). We observed slow tumor growth in absence of Csf2 without treatment. On the other hand, we observed tumor regression in both tumor models with cisplatin treatment. Post treatment, mice with Csf2 KO tumors had a significantly prolonged rate of survival. To evaluate the role of Csf2 in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME), we collected the tumors 96 hours post CT and characterized the TME using multicolored flow cytometry. The results showed that post treatment mice with Csf2 KO tumors increased the number of the Natural Killer cell population and a surge of M-MDSC (Ly6Chi) population. The synergistic effect of knocking out Csf2 and cisplatin treatment in our tumor model appears to be driven by chemokine and cytokine changes in the TME. Simultaneously, we observed significantly lower levels of lung metastasis in Csf2 KO tumor bearing mice compared to those with parental mEERL tumors. Whereas we have seen increased metastasis in ipsilateral lymph node of Csf2 KO mice. This metastasis data mimics human disease where many patients have regional lymph node involvement, but few develop distant metastasis. These results indicate that GM-CSF (CSF2) in the TME could be an excellent target that would cause less metastasis and improved overall survival. Further investigations are needed to understand the underlying mechanism of immune response in the absence of CSF2 in the TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GM-CSF,Tumor microenvironment,Cisplatin,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

The advent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has provided a unique opportunity to study matched, pre- and post- treatment sample pairs, but these samples are often obtained from different metastatic sites. Innate differences in the immune profiles across metastatic sites could therefore be a confounding factor when attempting to determine treatment-related effects. Furthermore, immune contexture can also vary by region within the TME, so results could vary depending on the regions of interest (ROIs) selected for analysis.<br \/>Methods: 36 matched, advanced primary ovarian cancer samples were obtained pre- and post- treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy aimed at reducing tumor burden. The first biopsy was taken at the time of initial diagnosis, whereas the second biopsy was collected after 3-4 rounds of carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy. Each slide was processed using a 26-plex multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) assay, which interrogates immune cell densities and functional states for a broad range of immune cell populations, including CD8+ T cells, Tregs, TH1s, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), granulocytes, macrophages, and monocytes. Tumor and stroma ROIs were selected by a board-certified pathologist using H&#38;E slides immediately adjacent to the mIHC samples, and cell densities were calculated separately for each of the two tissue compartments.<br \/>Results: When comparing pre-treatment samples from the omentum (n = 8) with post-treatment samples from the omentum (n = 14), all of the statistically significant changes were found within the tumor compartment, with higher densities in the post-treatment samples for CD8+ T cells (p = 0.009), Tregs (p = 0.012), DCs (p = 0.04), and monocytes (p = 0.027). In contrast, when comparing post-treatment samples from the omentum (n = 14) and the ovary (n = 14), all of the significant differences were found within the stroma compartment, with higher densities in the omentum for CD8+ T cells (p = 0.002), Tregs (p = 0.043), TH1s (p = 0.003), and macrophages (p = 0.048).<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the site of metastasis can be a significant confounding factor when making statistical comparisons between variables such as timepoint and that differences in immune cell density before and after treatment may be more apparent in the tumor, while differences between tissue types may be more apparent in the stroma. Further research into the immune profiles of different metastatic sites is warranted, but our findings demonstrate the importance of considering both tissue type and ROI selection strategy when designing a study with the intent to detect differences between longitudinal patient samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunohistochemistry,Ovarian cancer,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

However, 15-year survival rates for early-stage breast cancer remain in the range of 70-77%. Mounting evidence showed an increased risk of disease progression and mortality among early-stage breast cancer patients whose surgery was delayed over 60 days after the diagnostic biopsy. Yet, the mechanism(s) underlying the rapidly increased mortality due to delay of surgery after diagnosis remains unknown.<br \/>Our cohort analyses of early-stage breast cancer patients reveal the emergence of a significantly rising mortality risk when the biopsy-to-surgery interval was extended beyond 53 days. Additionally, histology of post-biopsy tumors shows prolonged retention of a metastasis-permissive wound stroma dominated by M2-like macrophages capable of promoting cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis by secretion of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&#946;1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We show that needle biopsy promotes systemic dissemination of cancer cells through a mechanism of sustained activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)\/prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2<\/sub>) cascade, which favors M2-polarization and its associated pro-metastatic changes, but are abrogated by oral treatment with COX-2 inhibitors in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) syngeneic mouse tumor models.<br \/>Therefore, we conclude that needle biopsy of ER+ breast cancer provokes progressive pro-metastatic changes, which may explain the mortality risk posed by surgery delay after diagnosis. Also, our data may provide a rationale for a pharmacologic strategy to inhibit the COX-2\/PGE<sub>2<\/sub> cascade in cases when delay of surgery is unavoidable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biopsies,Prostaglandin E2,Macrophages,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

TNBC cells commonly overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which when bound by microenvironmental growth factors, results in the activation of downstream effector kinases ERK-AKT and initiates transcriptional programs that control cell fate. Tumor cells, however, simultaneously receive many growth factor inputs from their respective microenvironments, many of which stimulate RTKs other than EGFR, that converge at ERK and AKT resulting in different transcriptional and cell fate outputs. This raises questions as to how tumor cells perceive, decode, and respond to a complex set of microenvironmental signals and what the relevance of this process may be for disease pathogenesis and treatment. To this end, our study aimed to determine how disseminated breast cancer cells perceive and respond to a complex growth factor milieu upon seeding and engraftment in the lung. Using live-cell microscopy techniques and TNBC cells carrying biosensors for ERK and Akt signaling pathways, we monitored the dynamic signaling behaviors of single tumor cells, in real-time, as they adapted to the environment in living human lung tissue. Strikingly, we found that individual disseminated tumor cells are <i>less<\/i> responsive to growth factors once seeded in the lung, as compared to outside this tissue, despite the presence of RTK stimulating ligands. We showed that partial activation of EGFR is necessary for complete activation of ERK signaling by other growth factor-RTK pairs, and expression of downstream ERK target genes, whereas AKT signaling was unaffected. Using quantitative modeling and experimentation, we showed that reshaping of ERK signaling response dynamics occurred via dysregulation of negative regulators that are dominantly controlled by EGFR signaling. Together, these results provide novel insight into how tumor cells perceive and respond to complex microenvironmental signals, which has important implications for drug targeting strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Signaling pathways,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Tumors promote expansion and recruitment of immune suppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contributing to tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor T cells. Our prior work suggested a critical role of p38 MAPK in tumor-induced expansion and mobilization of myeloid cell populations thereby facilitating metastasis. The current study examined the role of p38 MAPK in tumor-induced changes in immune landscape and explored the mechanisms by which p38 mediates tumor-immune interactions. First, the contribution of T cells to anti-metastatic activity of p38 inhibitor (p38i) was addressed by depletion of CD8 T cells. Depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells negated the effects of p38i on tumor growth and metastasis in the syngeneic 4T1 model. Next, we examined whether p38i exhibits a direct effect on T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> or <i>in vivo<\/i>. The <i>in vitro<\/i> assays showed that p38 blockade increased levels of CD44<sup>+ <\/sup>CD62L<sup>+ <\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells indicating enhancement of T cell differentiation. To determine the effects of p38 blockade on the immune landscape <i>in vivo<\/i>, single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry studies were performed in the 4T1 model with p38i or p38-deficient cells in which p38&#945;\/Mapk14 was inactivated by CRISPR\/Cas9 (p38KO). The scRNA-seq data showed that p38 blockade increased the expression of T cell differentiation markers in the TME. Furthermore, p38 blockade significant decreased IL-6 signaling in myeloid cells, an important mediator of MDSC function. Assessment of myeloid cell populations showed a decreased expression of the immune suppressive signature. This observation was further validated in MDSCs isolated from the spleens of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice treated with p38i and in p38KO cohorts. Our prior work showed that p38i does not affect the generation of MDSCs <i>in vitro<\/i>. Therefore, we examined whether blockade of p38 affects the chemotactic capacity of conditioned media from MBC cells using mouse monocytes. The chemotaxis assays showed that p38i and p38KO largely reduced the ability of conditioned media to stimulate transwell migration of mouse monocytes. Notably, p38i and p38KO largely reduced expression of chemotactic cytokines in MBC cell models. Furthermore, p38i and p38KO reduced production and chemotactic ability of exosomes isolated from tumor cells. Together, these observations suggest that tumor p38 MAPK signaling promotes immune-suppressive TME and metastasis by facilitating expansion and mobilization of myeloid cell populations through the mechanisms involving production of exosomes and pro-myeloid chemokines\/cytokines. This work highlights that p38 blockade can be utilized in combination with immune therapy or chemotherapy to enhance clinical benefits of immune therapy and reduce promyeloid effects of chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p38 MAP kinases,Immunosuppression,Tumor microenvironment,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Despite its importance in metastasis and residual disease, few studies have been able to successfully model melanoma dormancy. We have previously shown that while tumors grow more slowly in aged mouse skin, they form more lung metastases in aged mice compared to young mice. We queried whether the lung microenvironment undergoes age-related changes that establish a permissive niche for metastatic outgrowth. We identified that Wnt5A and AXL are not only required for efficient dissemination away from the primary tumor but also activate dormancy of melanoma cells within the lung. The young lung microenvironment maintains melanoma cells in a dormant state; however, age-associated reprograming of lung fibroblasts increases secretion of the soluble Wnt antagonist sFRP1, which inhibits both Wnt5A and AXL to enable reactivation from dormancy and the formation of larger metastatic colonies in the aged lung. We found that downregulation of AXL in melanoma cells leads to an increase in the related TAM family receptor MERTK, which promotes a proliferative melanoma phenotype and enables reactivation from dormancy. We have now found that both the aged-pre and post metastatic niche regulate immune cells in the lung to create a permissive niche for reactivation of metastatic melanoma. NK cells are significantly decreased in the healthy lungs of aged mice, are significantly less active, and have increased exhaustion markers. NK cell infiltration remains low in early and late-stage metastasis in aged mice. Depletion of NK cells in young mice is sufficient to induce reactivation from dormancy. Further, MERTK induced reactivation of melanoma cells results in paracrine secretion of its own ligand PROS1 to facilitate a growth permissive lung microenvironment. Melanoma-secreted PROS1 increases infiltration of PMN-MDSCs and decreases macrophage infiltration to maintain an immunosuppressive lung niche for efficient outgrowth. Selective inhibition of PMN-MDSCs using a TRIAL-R2 agonistic antibody significantly decreases metastatic outgrowth and promotes smaller, non-proliferative dormant colonies. Our findings indicate a significant role that aging plays in altering NK-cell infiltration and function to create a growth permissive pre-metastatic niche and how reactivation from dormancy can further contribute to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment for efficient outgrowth via PROS1 induced infiltration of PMN-MDSCs. Importantly, the clear differences found in our young and aged mouse modelling systems for outgrowth in metastatic tissues necessitates the need for age-appropriate pre-clinical modelling for better patient and disease representation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Dormancy,Aging,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"P.

Human PCA primarily yields osteoblastic bone lesions, linked to bone pain and an adverse prognosis. In this study, we explored the activation of HIF-1&#945; in myeloid phagocytic cells by apoptotic cancer cells in the context of bone metastatic PCA. Our previous findings demonstrated HIF-1&#945; stabilization in bone macrophages engulfing apoptotic PCA cells in vitro. This study extends our understanding to an in vivo setting using mouse prostate cancer cells designed to express inducible caspase 9, triggering apoptosis (and subsequent efferocytosis) when exposed to the dimerizer molecule AP20187 (AP). Our assessment of PCA tumor growth in bone utilized a syngeneic mouse model, introducing a loss-of-function Hif1a mutation into myeloid lineage cells using LysM-Cre mice crossed with Hif1a-floxed mice (Hif1a<sup>mut<\/sup> (LysM-Cre<sup>+\/-<\/sup> Hif1a<sup>flox<\/sup>)), compared with the LysM-Cre<sup>-\/-<\/sup> Hif1a<sup>flox<\/sup> (WT). In the first model, cancer cells were inoculated into the tibiae of these mice and apoptosis was induced with AP on days 3 and 5 post-inoculation (AP model). Results were compared to a model where apoptosis was not induced after inoculation (No-AP). In the AP model, fractional bone volume (BV\/TV) in the medullae was significantly higher in tumor-inoculated tibiae than in non-inoculated (No-tumor) contralateral bone, highlighting the predominance of osteoblastic lesions. Conversely, in the No-AP model, increased BV\/TV significance was achieved in WT mice (tumor vs. No-tumor), but not in mutant mice. Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) was increased in both models in the presence of tumor, regardless of the Hif1a phenotype. Importantly, significant differences in BV\/TV and Tb.Th between WT and Hif1a<sup>mut<\/sup> tumor tibiae were exclusively noted in the context of induced apoptosis. Histological differences between tumors in the AP model were observed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, which revealed a reduced fractional F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup> area in Hif1a<sup>mut<\/sup> vs. WT tumors, with no differences in TRAP<sup>+<\/sup> (osteoclasts) lining bone surfaces. RNAseq analysis of HIF1a<sup>mut<\/sup> vs. WT macrophages efferocytosing apoptotic cancer cells showed downregulated processes related to vasculature development and blood vessel morphogenesis (p&#60; 10<sup>-5<\/sup>). In correlation, IF analysis with endomucin (EMCN) demonstrated a reduction in stained area (EMCN<sup>+<\/sup>) relative to tumor area in Hif1a<sup>mut<\/sup> tibiae vs. WT, suggesting a role of efferocytosis-induced HIF-1&#945; in tumor vascularization. This study unveils intricacies of metastatic tumor growth in bone and proposes a connection between efferocytosis-induced HIF-1&#945; in myeloid phagocytic cells and the promotion of tumor vascularization, alongside the enhancement of osteoblastic bone remodeling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Apoptosis,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms that govern this phenomenon could open the door to novel therapies, potentially reducing mortality rates. To address this, we developed a novel protocol to induce cellular dormancy in PCa cell lines (RM1, 22Rv1, LAPC4) <i>in vitro<\/i>. We noted that dormant cells exhibited distinctive clustering and could be reactivated when exposed to serum even after 21 days of stasis. The dormancy program was validated by multiple assays including cell cycle analysis, membrane dye retention, and Edu<sup>+<\/sup> incorporation. RNASeq analysis showed significant transcriptional changes during dormancy induction, with 8 genes commonly upregulated across multiple human and mouse PCa cell lines, of which the transcription factor, PRDM16. We focused on PRDM16 since, 1) it is a known regulator of hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, 2) our emerging data points to bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), a well-known exogenous mediator of dormancy as an inducer of PRDM16 expression and 3) clinically, PRDM16 is suppressed in primary PCa and active metastases. First, we validated the upregulation of PRDM16 during dormancy <i>in vitro<\/i>. Silencing PRDM16 led to impaired dormancy phenotype and cell death, while its overexpression significantly mitigated proliferation rates and promoted survival. <i>In vivo, <\/i>we employed an intra-iliac immunocompetent model (RM1 &#38; C57BL6J) and demonstrated that overexpressing PRDM16 in active RM1 cells resulted in significant reduction of metastasis formation and Ki67 expression concurrent with extended survival when injected <i>in vivo<\/i> compared to control cells. Prostate cancer cells with PRDM16 over-expression were detected in bone sections as solitary or small clusters (&#60;20 cells) demonstrating an inverse relationship between PRDM16 expression and metastatic outbreak. In defining the targets via which PRDM16 controls dormancy entry, we focused on RAR related orphan receptor C (RORC) based on bioinformatic analysis and publicly available PRDM16 ChIP-Seq. Our data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of RORC using GSK805 promoted the apoptosis of dormant PCa cells specifically when compared to their actively growing counterparts. In conclusion, our studies have revealed the critical role of PRDM16 in promoting PCa cell dormancy, in part via upregulating RORC. Translationally, clinically approved RORC inhibitors for non-cancerous conditions (psoriasis) have been developed. We expect, based on our results, that these inhibitors could be repurposed for the eradication of dormant PCa cells in patients with advanced disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Prostate cancer,Dormancy,Bone metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Leveraging single-cell multi-omics sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility landscapes of tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment in human brain metastases that originated from across a spectrum of primary cancers. Our investigations have identified distinct, yet uniformly present, tumor cell subpopulations, each defined by unique gene expression patterns, chromatin accessibility, and the interactions between tumor and stromal cells. Notably, one such subpopulation exhibits a dormancy signature, characterized by enhanced interferon response, oxidative phosphorylation, and upregulated HLA class molecules, alongside alterations in circadian rhythms. Our trajectory analysis charts a course from these dormant cells to rapidly proliferating ones, with notable shifts in circadian rhythm genes, underscoring their potential role in brain metastasis. This aligns with recent findings that disruptions in circadian rhythms can modify stem cell characteristics in glioblastomas. This insight led us to focus on a specific circadian rhythm gene, highly active in the dormant cells and located on the HER2 amplicon&#8212;an area linked to high brain metastasis relapse rates in patients. We've developed inducible models for both overexpression and knockdown to scrutinize this gene's impact in her2 positive breast cancer cell lines, examining gene expression and proliferation in vitro. Complementing this, we are conducting spatial transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the microenvironmental regulation of tumor dormancy in human brain metastases. This multi-omics approach reveals a nuanced regulatory landscape of brain metastasis, highlighting a novel and often overlooked factor in metastasis progression and brain tumor relapse: the interplay between circadian rhythms and tumor dormancy. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of brain metastases but also opens potential new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Dormancy,Circadian genes,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

Recent studies have drawn attention to the importance of metabolism in the survival and colonization of cancer cells. In melanoma, there have been studies focusing on the invasive capabilities of cells; however, not much is known regarding metabolic plasticity in melanoma migratory, invasive and ultimately metastatic capabilities.We have previously shown changes in the lipid landscape of the aged microenvironment promotes melanoma resistance to targeted therapy. Here, we find a distinct metabolite landscape in the aged microenvironment elevates melanoma metastatic capacity. We utilized a panel of well characterized melanoma models and tested their invasiveness and motility under different metabolite levels modeled after the aged microenvironment. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis identifies distinct signatures that explain the migratory and invasive differences in cells cultured in varying metabolic environments. We hypothesize that different nutrient availabilities melanoma cells are exposed to during the metastatic phase affect the migratory and invasive capacity of the cell. We tested this by performing 3D migration assays, organoids and transwell assays of cells grown in media with varying nutrient levels. Further analysis is currently underway to better understand the mechanisms in which these metabolic differences facilitate cell migration, invasion and eventually colonization. This work has important implications for our understanding of the metabolic determinants of melanoma migration and metastatic colonization, and we hypothesize restraining tumor metabolic plasticity is vital to prevent and treat metastases in melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metabolism,Invasion,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.
