In addition to these gene-by-environment interactions, gene-by-gene epistatic interactions also shape the adaptive landscape, influencing the evolutionary trajectories of cancer. Understanding the influence of tobacco smoke on the epistatic trajectories of lung cancer progression would help guide the development of targeted therapies that are more effective for smoker or never-smoker populations. To address this need, we constructed a continuous-time Markov chain model for the evolutionary trajectories of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common subtype of lung cancer and the most frequent subtype among never-smokers. Using thousands of tumor sample sequences aggregated across studies, we profiled the trajectories of LUAD in smokers and never-smokers and estimated the rates at which mutations are gained from each possible set of pre-existing mutations, or genetic states. We then accounted for differences in baseline mutation rates to quantify the selective benefit of mutations. We find that epistasis is prevalent in LUAD, with several strong synergistic interactions&#8212;such as between RB1 and EGFR mutations- and antagonistic interactions-such as between EGFR and KEAP1 or KRAS mutations. Additionally, we identify non-additive epistatic effects: STK11 mutations are synergistic with KEAP1 and KRAS mutations but do not experience additional selection when both are mutated. In contrast, GNAS mutations are not synergistic with KEAP1 or RBM10 mutations alone but are synergistic with their co-mutation. Smoking has a large influence on the adaptive landscape, with several common mutations being preferentially selected in never-smoker cancers, including EGFR, SMAD4, GNAS, and PIK3CA mutations. KEAP1, STK11, and KRAS mutations are preferentially selected in smoker cancers. Smoking&#8217;s physiological influence also affects the strength of certain epistatic interactions, such as between STK11 and KEAP1 mutations. \u0009Overall, we find that smoking not only increases the mutation rate of lung cells but also substantially alters the adaptive landscape of lung adenocarcinoma, leading to clinically relevant differences in selection on mutations between smoker and never-smoker cancers. We additionally detect frequent pairwise and higher-order epistatic effects in LUAD that may inform the personalized application of targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Tobacco smoke,Genomics,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Krishna Dasari<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jorge Alfaro-Murillo<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Townsend<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biostatistics, Yale University, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2f7d82ae-75e6-48b4-a17d-b557d2ad0801","ControlNumber":"6868","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

However, the utility of these methods for identifying pathogenic mutations in cancer remains unknown.<br \/>We sought to quantify the prevalence of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) across the pan-cancer, multi-institution AACR GENIE cohort (N=160,965 samples) and test the utility of VEPs (SIFT, PolyPhen, MutationAssessor, REVEL, CADD, and AlphaMissense), using publicly available mutation annotations from each method, for 1) Annotating known pathogenic somatic cancer variants across the GENIE cohort, using known benign single nucleotide polymorphisms as negative controls 2) Identifying VUSs associated with overall survival (OS) in two cohorts of patients with non-small cell cancer (NSCLC), the MSK-IMPACT NCSLC (N=8,690) and non-MSK AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative NSCLC (N=977) cohorts, and 3) Identifying VUSs associated with known genomic patterns of mutual exclusivity in the MSK-IMPACT NSCLC cohort.<br \/>In the GENIE cohort, 79% of mutations identified were VUSs according to an FDA-recognized molecular knowledge database, with a wide range of VUS frequencies across genes. Among VEPs trained without prior human-annotated knowledge, CADD and AlphaMissense had the highest AUROCs (0.940, 95%CI 0.937-0.943 and 0.917, 95%CI 0.913-0.922 respectively) for predicting known cancer drivers, demonstrating the power of protein structure modeling or functional genomic data for enhancing cancer drivers prediction. All VEPs identified known driver mutations in tumor suppressor genes more accurately than oncogenes, highlighting the challenge in identifying gain-of-function mutations.<br \/>We tested whether VUSs reclassified as pathogenic by VEPs are associated with prognosis using inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox&#8217;s propensity hazard models controlling for tumor mutational burden, treatment history, and other factors. VUSs reclassified as pathogenic by AlphaMissense and other VEPs in KEAP1 and SMARCA4 correlated with worse OS, comparable to that of known oncogenic mutations in those genes. Patients with tumors containing VUSs annotated as benign had similar OS to patients without analogous driver mutations. Finally, VUSs reclassified as oncogenic by AlphaMissense in genes within the RTK\/RAS and NRF2 pathways followed expected patterns of mutual exclusivity, further suggesting biological validity.<br \/>Despite not being trained to predict somatic effects in cancer, AI-derived mutation annotations can broaden the subset of annotated pathogenic variants in cancer and contribute to a more complete understanding of cancer genetics.

However, these projects mainly consisted of White patients, with a limited focus on Asian populations. In addition, while pairwise relationships between driver alterations can provide valuable functional insights, the majority of these analyses are limited to those using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.<br \/>Here we present a pan-cancer landscape of driver alterations in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors using targeted sequencing data of 48,627 samples from the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) in Japan. This data set had a greater number of samples from Asian-prevalent cancer types, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma, compared to the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) cohort. In the C-CAT cohort, the most frequently mutated gene was <i>TP53<\/i> (56%), followed by <i>KRAS<\/i> (25%), <i>APC<\/i> (17%), and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (12%). Gene fusions were detected in 1,166 samples (2%), including <i>ERG<\/i> fusions in prostate adenocarcinoma (<i>n <\/i>= 129), and <i>RET<\/i> and <i>ALK<\/i> fusions in lung adenocarcinoma (<i>n<\/i> = 30 and 32). At least one clinically actionable genetic lesion was found in 16% of patients, with well-differentiated thyroid cancer having the highest proportion.<br \/>A comparative analysis of somatic mutation frequencies was conducted between the C-CAT cohort and the White population in the GENIE cohort. Among 352 driver gene-cancer type combinations, 14 and 4 were significantly higher and lower in the C-CAT cohort (&#62; 10% difference with <i>q<\/i>-value &#60; 0.01). Notably, <i>TP53<\/i> mutation frequencies were elevated in the C-CAT cohort across 10 cancer types, suggesting racial differences in <i>TP53<\/i> mutation frequencies.<br \/>We then integrated C-CAT, GENIE, and TCGA data consisting of more than 150,000 patients to conduct a meta-analysis of co-occurring and mutually exclusive relationships between 1,790 cancer-driver combinations. This analysis not only validated 215 previously reported relationships but identified 484 novel ones. Interestingly, we found significantly co-occurring mutations within the epigenetic pathway, with 13 epigenetic regulators co-occurring in ten cancer types. Gene set enrichment analysis using RNA-sequencing data in TCGA revealed that accumulation of mutations in epigenetic regulators causes increased proliferation-related transcriptomic signatures. In addition, loss-of-function mutations in epigenetic drivers suppresses proliferation in wild-type cell lines, but this effect is reduced in cells with mutations in both the same and other epigenetic drivers.<br \/>Our multi-cohort analyses uncover differences in the driver landscape between Asian and White populations, provides valuable resources for precision cancer medicine, and offers insights into epigenetic regulator-associated oncogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Precision medicine,Genomics,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Horie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki Saito<sup>2<\/sup>, Yasunori Kogure<sup>2<\/sup>, Kota Mizuno<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuta Ito<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariko Tabata<sup>4<\/sup>, Koichi Murakami<sup>3<\/sup>, Junji Koya<sup>2<\/sup>, Keisuke Kataoka<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"830852e0-cc47-4d3d-92c2-75cf18aab165","ControlNumber":"3287","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Previous study has shown that homologous recombination genes, <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC patients possess the potential to be in refractory condition, and their primary response to chemotherapy was heterogenous; thus, there can be subtype-specific determinant factors hatching refractoriness in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC patients. To explore the determinant factors, we performed gene set variation analysis and comprehensive log-rank tests on TCGA advanced serous ovarian cancer datasets. As a result, regulation of small GTPase signaling prominently correlated with poor prognosis uniquely in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC patients (p-value &#60; 0.001), and eventually, pathway clustering analysis by variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model discovered aberrant RAS\/PI3K crosstalk as peculiar poor prognostic signature of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC patients. To elucidate the mechanism of poor progression triggered by RAS\/PI3K, we utilized our syngeneic HGSC organoid models newly established from murine fallopian tube epithelium by making<i> Myc<\/i> overexpressing, and knocking out <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Rb1<\/i>; as a supplement, the propriety of these genetic alterations to develop HGSC models was backed up by genetic profiles of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients in AACR Project GENIE. After that, we knocked out <i>Nf1<\/i> and <i>Pten<\/i> whose deletions were detected relatively with high frequency in HGSC to induce aberrant RAS\/PI3K crosstalk in the primitive HGSC model. <i>In-vivo<\/i> evaluation and growth comparison indicated that aberrant RAS\/PI3K crosstalk transformed <i>Brca1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC modeling cells into aggressive phenotypes such as poor survival (p-value &#60; 0.01) and high growth rate (p-value &#60; 0.001). Chemo-sensitivity assay also showed that the genetic manipulation made <i>Brca1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC modeling cells more tolerant to anti-tumor agents like carboplatin (p-value &#60; 0.001), paclitaxel (p-value &#60; 0.01), and olaparib (p-value &#60; 0.01). To investigate biological processes that induce the aggressive and chemo-resistant phenotype, we performed gene set enrichment analysis among our HGSC models. The result showed that aberrant RAS\/PI3K crosstalk induces cell cycle acceleration and downregulation of apoptosis in the HGSC cells, which backed up aggressive phenotype and chemo-resistance in our HGSC models. In conclusion, aberrant RAS\/PI3K crosstalk transforms <i>Brca1\/2<\/i>-unmutated HGSC modeling cells more aggressive and chemo-resistant, which was well recapitulated by our HGSC modeling organoids. The integration of our computational approach and experimental models will lead us to detect peculiar therapeutic targets against refractory HGSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Organoids,Machine learning,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
