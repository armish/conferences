We performed CRISPR\/Cas9 screening in 13 OS cell lines as part of the Dependency Map project. Mining this data to identify genes whose knockout (KO) leads to selective anti-viability in OS, we observed the helicase<i> SMARCAL1 <\/i>as a selective dependency in OS (p&#60;0.0001; effect size = -0.275). Given the genomic instability of OS and SMARCAL1&#8217;s related, established role in replication stress, we first validated our screens by CRISPR KO in OS lines in vitro. This demonstrated selective antiviability of <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> KO in dependent OS lines. To orthogonally validate <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> dependency, we deployed a dTAG system, utilizing a hetero-bifunctional small molecule targeting the tagged protein for degradation by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We observed antiviability of dependent lines after SMARCAL1 degradation. In parallel, in order to ascertain importance of this gene in vivo, we performed a barcoded CRISPR pooled screen against pre-selected OS dependencies in an OS cell line xenograft in NSG mice. After sequencing of tumor gDNA, we identified <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> as a top hit, suggesting relevance <i>in vivo<\/i>.We next investigated biomarkers of <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> dependency. A role for SMARCAL1 has been described in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). We asked whether ALT+ OS cell lines are enriched for <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> dependency. We found a correlation between ALT+ OS and <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> dependence in our CRISPR screens. We then asked if this extends to other ALT+ tumors. Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor, is enriched for ALT. When we looked specifically at NB models, we observed that <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> was the most enriched dependency in ALT+ NB compared with other NB lines (p&#60;0.0001; effect size = -0.785). We then performed <i>SMARCAL1 <\/i>KO in 2 ALT+ ATRX-altered NB lines and one ALT+ ATRX-WT NB line. We found that <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> KO led to antiviability in the ATRX-altered ALT+ cell lines, while the ALT+ ATRX-WT cell line was unaffected. This suggests that dependency on <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> is specific to ATRX alteration, rather than ALT alone.In order to confirm synthetic lethality between ATRX and SMARCAL1, we next utilized a human OS line not included in the DepMap screen, which has biallelic inactivation of <i>SMARCAL1<\/i>. We infected this line with our SMARCAL1 dTAG, leading to constitutive overexpression of SMARCAL1, and then performed ATRX KO. We observed that SMARCAL1 overexpression rescued the antiviability effect of ATRX KO. This could be reversed by degradation of exogenous SMARCAL1, suggesting that ATRX and SMARCAL1 can compensate for one another. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that <i>SMARCAL1<\/i> is a selective dependency engendered by the loss of WT ATRX in OS and NB and that SMARCAL1 is playing a critical role in mediating ALT. Studies are ongoing to determine the mechanism of SMARCAL1&#8217;s activity and potential for targeting this enzyme for therapeutic benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Neuroblastoma,Synthetic lethality,Alternative lengthening of telomeres,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Although the etiology of ES remains controversial, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are considered to be the likely cell of origin. This is not only due to their ability to tolerate ectopic EWS::FLI1 expression, but also because the transcriptome of EWS::FLI1 expressing hMSCs is highly similar to that of primary Ewing tumors. However, to date a cellular differentiation-based model of ES does not exist. With the intent to understand ES histogenesis, this study aims to establish the first comprehensive single-cell differentiation atlas (both transcriptome and epigenome) of juvenile bone marrow-derived hMSCs with and without EWS::FLI1 expression. We sought to study the consequences of inducing the EWS::FLI1 oncogene expression at various time points of hMSC differentiation into adipo-, chondro-, osteo- and neuro-genic lineages. Our workflow utilizes physiology-mimicking conditions including serum-free differentiation, hypoxia, and growth\/differentiation as spheroids. We pooled bone marrow-derived hMSCs isolated from eleven healthy juvenile donors, engineered them to conditionally express EWS::FLI1, and carried out multi-lineage differentiation for 10 days where EWS::FLI1 was induced daily for 24h or 72h. This temporally resolved atlas of 105 samples representing normal and perturbed differentiation allowed us to map ES patient tumor data to multiple lineages and time-points across stages of lineage commitment. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of ~271,000 transcriptomes revealed an apparent and dynamic dedifferentiation in the presence of EWS::FLI1 across all four lineages. Preliminary analysis of genes detected in the EWS::FLI1 high cluster uncovers a specific lineage preference and time window that shares the transcriptomic signature with tumor cells, indicating the potential cell\/stage of tumor-origin. Our results provide new insight into the enigmatic cell of origin of Ewing sarcoma, laying the foundation for the development of much-needed pre-clinical models for tailoring therapies.

Pre-existing genetic variation within primary tumors may offer certain cell populations an evolutionary advantage, increasing the likelihood that some will be resistant to treatment. But the inherent complexity of the tumor means finding these markers of resistance has yet to be fully explored across childhood cancer. To address this, we developed a pipeline that combines clonal evolution reconstruction with mutational signature extraction at the subclonal level to elucidate changes in mutational processes. Using this pipeline to analyze 1,743 pediatric tumor genomes we found a common pattern of parallel evolution in most pediatric cancers, irrespective of their tissue of origin. Further, we detected therapy-associated mutational signatures linked to specific treatments such as temozolomide, platinum, fluorouracil, and thiopurine in post-treatment tumor subpopulations. Of 235 samples with known treatment exposure, 37.9% displayed one or more treatment-associated signatures. In the context of the phylogenetic tree, we identified specific subpopulations with therapy signatures. In multi-sample cases, resistant subpopulations had ancestors present in primary tumors at the time of diagnosis, suggesting certain subpopulations possessed the ability to withstand chemotherapy-induced pressures from an early stage and then expanded following treatment. Finally, we observed differences in the timing of mutational signatures between antimetabolite and alkylating agent treatments, reflecting the mechanisms of these drugs. Antimetabolite agents showed subclonal mutational signatures occurring in later branches, likely due to dependence on cell cycling. In contrast, alkylating agents displayed signatures in both early and late subpopulations, as they are unaffected by cell cycle state. Thus, investigating mutational signatures at the subclonal level unveils new insights into the clonal dynamics of pediatric cancers and the development of chemoresistance. This research offers valuable insights for identifying pediatric cancer patients at greater risk of recurrence, enabling the development of more effective treatment plans to enhance their quality of life and overall survival rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Therapy resistance,Tumor evolution,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Previous studies have explored clonal genetic and gene expression changes between initial diagnosis and relapse. However, studying tumor cells present at MRD is challenging due to their low abundance. Examining the genomic profiles of leukemia cells that resist induction chemotherapy and understanding their evolutionary relationship to cells present at diagnosis may lead to a better understanding of the cells that eventually seed relapse. We analyzed somatic point mutations, indels, and copy number variants from 41 pediatric B-ALL patients with high-risk B-ALL. We specifically focused on patients from the following four common high-risk subtypes: KMT2A-rearranged, Ph+, Ph-like, and iAMP21, who had detectable disease at the end of induction. Leukemic burden at end-induction (day 29) ranged from 0.03% to 66.00%. Data were generated in partnership with the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Human Tumor Atlas Network and the Children&#8217;s Oncology Group.<br \/>Our data set of 41 patients includes 39 with paired initial diagnostic and end-induction samples that we used to create tumor evolution models based on single cells across disease stages. We produced single-cell multiome gene expression (scRNA) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC) profiles (10x Genomics) with a median of 7428 leukemic blast cells at IDX (range: 2490-14219) and 1907 at MRD (range: 240-10167) after filtering. We called somatic mutations from scRNA and scATAC using SComatic and Monopogen, and we detected copy number changes using Numbat and EpiAneufinder. We also designed a targeted DNA sequencing panel including 335 variants based on B-ALL literature and database searches to produce scDNA (Mission Bio) for 24 patients (16 IDX-MRD pairs) with a median of 2346 cells profiled at IDX (range: 340-8849) and 1828 at MRD (range: 596-5133). We built tumor phylogenies based on somatic SNVs and CNVs with COMPASS. Using multiple tools and complementary single-cell omics data types to detect somatic changes improved our confidence in the events used for tumor evolution tree construction.<br \/>Our approach allowed us to define recurrent genomic events and patterns across pediatric B-ALL subtypes and to describe the clonal evolution of cells measured at initial diagnostic and end-induction disease stages. We were also able to link cell-specific mutation events to their transcriptional and epigenomic signatures, including mapping mutation events along the B-cell development trajectory and within differentially expressed gene pathways. Some cases showed dramatic shifts in subclonal structure between IDX and MRD that may be related to therapy-induced clonal selection, such as a loss of <i>NRAS<\/i> hotspot mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Pediatric cancers,Tumor evolution,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Survival rate for metastatic and relapsed OS patients remains dismal at &#60;30%. Additionally, no effective standardized salvage therapy currently exists for these patients, in part, due to genomic complexities arising from moderate levels of replication stress (RS). Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitors (BETi) are an underexplored option to target RS for BETi creates an imbalance between transcription-replication kinetics resulting exacerbation of oncogenic RS and cell death. BET proteins are epigenetic readers that play a role in regulating gene expression networks as well as DNA replication and repair. We tested the hypothesis that BET inhibition leads to decreased OS cell growth and potentiates the efficacy of salvage therapy via gene dysregulation and increased DNA damage and RS. Combination index and Bliss independence analyses of bivalent BET inhibitor (BETi) AZD5153 or PROTAC ARV825 in combination with salvage agents demonstrated additive-to-synergistic cell growth inhibition in OS lines. Increased apoptotic-mediated cell death was observed following AZD5153+topotecan. In addition, &#947;-H2AX levels and comet assays demonstrated that BETi+topotecan induces its effect, in part through increased RS <i>in-vitro<\/i>. AZD5153 monotherapy significantly suppressed OS tumor growth in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) derived from both na&#239;ve (PDX96) and metastatic (TT2) OS compared to vehicle (p&#60;0.05). Moreover, AZD5153 reduced lung metastatic lesions and increased survival in the 143B OS lung colonization model. <i>In-vivo<\/i> mechanisms of drug-induced tumor response were evaluated. Anti-tumor effect correlated with increased &#947;-H2AX following AZD5153 exposure in PDX96, indicative of increased RS. RNA-seq analysis and protein validation from vehicle versus BETi-treated PDX96 highlighted dysregulation of several key genes involved in DNA damage response including elevated TXNIP, a tumor suppressor which can induce DNA damage and apoptosis. Downregulation of TCF7, a downstream effector of the Wnt pathway, was also observed following BETi. Global kinome profiling and validation experiments revealed increased activity and expression of EphA2 and EphA4 receptors both implicated in development of drug resistance. Furthermore, in BETi-treated PDX96 tumors, Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway activation emerged as tumors rebounded once BETi treatment was stopped. TT2 PDX was resistant to commonly used salvage agents ifosfamide and irinotecan; however, combination BETi+ topotecan increased the probability of survival compared to each agent alone (p&#60;0.05) and was well tolerated. These data collectively suggest that BET inhibition alone or in combination with low-dose salvage therapy holds promise as novel treatment strategies in aggressive OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,DNA damage response,BET inhibitor,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

However, mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), another form of CH with megabase-scale structural alterations (copy gain, copy loss and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity), have not been examined.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Detection of mCAs was performed on whole-genome sequencing (WGS, 30X) data from 5-year CCS with the Mosaic Chromosomal Alterations (MoChA) caller which utilizes phased genotypes, coverage, and B allele frequency (BAF) at heterozygous sites (HETS). We implemented the pipeline established by the TOPMed consortium to detect low mutant cell fractions (CF &#8805;1%). Variant filtration criteria: minor allele frequency &#60;1%, the read depth of either allele &#60;5, and only one variant retained in each 1Kb window. Called mCA filtration criteria: &#60;100 HETS; lod score &#60;5; relative coverage &#62;2.9 or BAF deviation &#62;0.16 and relative coverage &#62;2.5. Autosomal mCAs (CF &#8805;1%, HETS &#62;100 and length &#62;1Mb) retained. Multivariable Cox models evaluated the association between mCAs and specific late-effects including all-cause mortality, obesity, myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiomyopathy (CMP); multivariable logistic models evaluated the association between mCAs and childhood cancer diagnoses. All models were adjusted for age, sex and therapeutic exposures.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In our evaluation of<b> <\/b>4,330 CCS (median age at blood draw: 26.8 years) and 433 controls (33.6 years) with WGS data from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort, the prevalence of mCAs was slightly higher among CCS than community controls (4.83% vs. 4.16%). Among CCS, mCAs were associated with therapeutic exposures (alkylating agents: odds ratio [OR]=1.48, 95% CI=1.09-2.00; antimetabolites: 1.53, 1.02-2.31; corticosteroids: 0.60, 0.40-0.91). In contrast to recent mCA studies in the general population, we observed no co-occurrence with CH point mutations, and no associations with late-effects including all-cause mortality, obesity, MI or CMP. Interestingly, mCAs were significantly associated with the primary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, OR=2.86, 95% CI=1.63-5.01). Furthermore, this finding was replicated in 2898 5-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (OR=3.77, 95% CI=1.94-7.33).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>mCAs were not associated with age-related morbidities and mortality among CCS. However, we identified a striking association between mCAs and previous diagnoses of AML independent of treatment exposures. If validated among AML patients at the time of diagnosis, mCAs, which reflect the underlying genome instability, may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Pediatric cancers,Copy number alterations,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Our approach involved whole genome sequencing, methylation profiling, RNA sequencing, and a suite of mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments, including global proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and glycoproteomic profiling. The proteomics study successfully identified and quantified approximately 11,000 proteins, 33,000 phosphosites, and 3000 glycopeptides with a 50% missing filtering threshold. To identify the unique characteristics of AYA HGG in contrast to both pediatric and adult HGG, we further integrated a proteogenomic dataset of 99 adult GBM tumors previously published by CPTAC and collaborators (PMID: 33577785).<br \/>Our study unveiled a collection of mutations, copy number variations, epigenetic modifications and gene fusions that exhibited different frequencies across tumors from pediatric, AYA, and adult patients. Moreover, the influence of these genetic variations on RNA\/protein activities also varied across different age groups. Clustering analysis using age-dependent molecular profiles revealed striking differences in RNA\/protein\/phosphosite activities between patients aged 15-26 and 26-40. Additionally, significantly better overall survival (OS) was observed in the 26-40 age group compared to all other age groups, highlighting distinct biological characteristics within the AYA category that differentiate adolescents from young adults.By leveraging proteogenomic datasets from normal brain tissues (PMID: 30518843), we identified genes, proteins, and pathways with differential age-dependent molecular profiles between tumor and normal brain tissues. Notably, this analysis highlighted significant alterations in proteins from the oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and myelin sheath pathways in tumors compared to normal tissues, some of which were found to be sex-specific.To search for prognostic markers, we introduced a novel approach called Trans-Population Survival Analysis through Interpolation of Age-Dependent Tumor Molecular Profiles. Applying this method on the kinase activity scores derived from the phosphoproteomic data, we identified 150 kinases whose activities were significantly associated with OS among AYA patients. Additionally, employing a causal network analysis tool, we pinpointed six kinases causally linked to OS, suggesting their potential as treatment targets. This study not only characterizes the molecular landscape of AYA HGG but also explores the disease trajectory across the lifespan. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay of various factors influencing glioma etiology and patient outcomes, paving the way for a deeper understanding of HGG in the AYA population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,High-grade glioma,Prognostic markers,Adolescent and Young Adult,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.
