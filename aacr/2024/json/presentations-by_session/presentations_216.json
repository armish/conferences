[{"Abstract":"Cancer heterogeneity arises from cellular features, suggesting that distinct molecular drivers may be latent within cancers diagnosed at different clinicopathological stages. We thoroughly assessed phenotypic traits and molecular alterations linked to chemoresistance and constructed chemoresistant bladder cancer cell lines representing the stepwise transformation. Model cell lines (5637GRCs, gemcitabine-resistant cells) with stepwise gemcitabine resistance representing early, intermediate, and late resistance phases were developed from non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) cells. Notably, an increase in cell motility was observed at a relatively early phase. The results from the time-course analysis of molecular evolution showed changes in focal adhesion kinase signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and TGF-&#946; signaling pathways during the phase of increasing cell motility. As chemoresistance increased, the levels of genes related to differentiation and MAPK signaling gradually increased. A 63-gene chemoresistance-motility (CrM) signature was constructed and weighted according to cell motility, and a strong correlation was observed between cancer metastasis and drug resistance; the signature also showed prognostic relevance in patients with NMIBC. This study affords a significant understanding of the molecular evolution of chemoresistance acquisition and enables prediction of cancer progression during chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, it provides insights into the progression of cells through all chemoresistance stages from NMIBC to MIBC. Therefore, this study proposes the feasibility of utilizing biomarkers correlated with cancer motility to predict cancer progression in the early phase of chemotherapeutic intervention in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Diagnostic marker,Cancer diagnostics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.-E.

Approximately 80% of BC patients are diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with a high five-year survival rate, while the remaining 20% are diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Although the surgical operation has been utilized to BC, patients with NMIBC frequently experience disease recurrence, of which about 20% progress to MIBC. However, the response rate of MIBC patients to gemcitabine treatment has been shown to be limited to less than 40% efficacy, and only a small number of patients have potential benefits.Chemotherapy resistance is an obstacle to cancer therapy and is considered a major cause of recurrence. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance is critical to improving the prognosis of patients. Here, we have established a stepwise gemcitabine-resistant T24 bladder cancer cell line to understand the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance within cancer cells. The characteristics of the stepwise chemoresistance cell line were divided into 4 phases (parental, early, intermediate, and late phases). These four phase cells showed increasingly aggressive phenotypes in vitro and in vivo experiments with increasing phases<br \/>and revealed the molecular properties of the biological process from parent cells to phased gemcitabine-resistant cell line (GRC). Taken together, through the analysis of gene expression profile data, we have characterized gene set of each phase indicating the response to anticancer drug treatment. Specifically, we identified a multigene signature (23-genes including GATA3, APOBEC3G, NT5E, MYC, STC1, FOXD1, SMAD9) and developed a chemoresistance score consisting of that could predict eventual responsiveness to gemcitabine treatment. We suggest that our findings improve prognosis by predicting to acquiring of chemotherapy resistance in bladder cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-J.

CDCP1 has been associated with tumor progression, metastasis, drug resistance and poor prognosis in prostate cancer, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. It has been shown to be overexpressed in a subset of castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) and cooperate with the loss of tumor suppressor PTEN to promote metastatic dissemination. Extracellular serine proteases activate CDCP1 by cleaving it into an N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. Proteolytic cleavage has been associated with the tumor-promoting functions of CDCP1. We studied the expression of full-length and cleaved form of CDCP1 in grade group 2-4 primary prostate cancer tissues and CRPCs using immunohistochemistry. Total CDCP1 staining was observed in 60% of primary prostate cancer samples, while the staining of cleaved CDCP1 was somewhat less frequently observed (45%). The results will be further analyzed regarding the PTEN status and for association with survival of the patients. In conclusion, so far, our results have indicated that cleaved CDCP1, which likely represents activated CDCP1, is detectable in GG 2-4 prostate cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metastasis,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.-M.

Through an unsupervised analysis of treatment-na&#239;ve imaging, we were able to identify 3 distinct imaging clusters that were associated with different molecular pathways according to transcriptomic pathway analysis. Using xCell enrichment scores as input for clustering, we discovered three distinct immunological groups based on immune cell infiltration. The results suggested the presence of an &#8216;immune-hot&#8221; cluster within the tumors with a poorer prognosis, which may potentially benefit from emerging immunotherapies. We subsequently generated a radiomic signature that was able to predict immunological profiles. We also developed a clinicoradiomic predictive model that can assess patients&#8217; risk of progression and predict treatment response. Finally, we evaluated the transcriptomic pathways that were most predictive of clinicoradiomic risk scores and identified the biological pathways most predictive of risk of progression in PLGG, when adjusting for molecular subtype, race, reported gender, age at diagnosis, and the anatomic location of the tumor. This is the first large-scale radiogenomic analysis in PLGG that can aid in prognostication, assessing patients&#8217; risk of progression, predicting treatment response in conventional therapies, and early stratification of patients to identify potential candidates for targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Magnetic resonance imaging,Bioinformatics,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Mouse model<i> <\/i>studies have demonstrated that downregulation of <i>PDLIM2<\/i> leads to PD-1 immune blockade and chemotherapy resistance. We present a large clinical and molecular characterization of <i>PDLIM2<\/i> expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: NextGen sequencing of DNA (whole exome)\/RNA (whole transcriptome) was performed for NSCLC (Total N = 29126; Adenocarcinoma [-A, N = 15765], Squamous [-S, N = 6416]) patient tumors submitted to Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Mutations were defined as pathogenic SNVs\/indels. Samples were stratified by PDLIM2 expression quartiles (in transcripts per million [TPM]) for all NSCLC tumors (Q4: H, Q1: L). PD-L1 expression [22C3; Positive (+): tumor proportion score (TPS) &#8805;1%]was assessed by IHC. High tumor mutational burden (TMB-high) set as &#8805;10 mutations per Mb. Cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment was estimated by QuantiSEQ. Gene expression profiles were analyzed for transcriptional signatures predictive of response to immunotherapy (T cell-inflamed). Real-world overall survival was assessed from insurance claims data and Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for molecularly defined subpopulations. Mann-Whitney U and X<sup>2<\/sup>\/Fisher-Exact tests were applied where appropriate, with P-values adjusted for multiple comparisons (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Results: Median <i>PDLIM2<\/i> expression was higher in NSCLC-A compared to NSCLC-S (15.3 vs 13.6 TPM, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). <i>PDLIM2<\/i>-A<sup>L<\/sup> had a lower prevalence of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations than <i>PDLIM2<\/i>-A<sup>H<\/sup> (15.5% vs 19.4%, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.01), but the opposite pattern was observed for <i>STK11 <\/i>(21.5% vs 11.2%), <i>RB1 <\/i>(7.5% vs 3.8%), <i>TP53 <\/i>(62.9% vs 52.8%), <i>KEAP1 <\/i>(18.4% vs 10.9%), and <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>(9.15 vs 4.5%) alterations (all <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001). <i>PDLIM2<\/i>-A<sup>L <\/sup>tumors had decreased PD-L1+ (L: 52.4% vs H: 58.4% <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001) but increased TMB-High status (L: 40.9% vs H: 28.5%, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). PD-L1+ and TMB-H frequency did not vary with <i>PDLIM2<\/i> expression in NSCLC-S.

The FUTURE trial (UMIN000029294) demonstrated that adding palbociclib after acquiring fulvestrant resistance is potentially safe and effective. To further identify biomarkers for patient selection, this preplanned translational sub-study aims to use cancer panel sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to discover prognostic and predictive biomarkers for additional palbociclib treatment after acquiring fulvestrant resistance in patents with HR-positive\/HER2-negative ABC\/MBC.<br \/>Methods: Herein, we utilized 149 cfDNA samples from 61 patients with disease progression after fulvestrant monotherapy and who subsequently received fulvestrant and palbociclib. Circulating cfDNA was analyzed at the time of palbociclib addition after fulvestrant resistance, on day 15 of cycle one (D15), and at the end of treatment (EOT) using the ThruPLEX ctDNA Assay, which can identify single or multi nucleotide variants, DNA insertions, and deletions in up to 34 cancer-associated genes.<br \/>Results: The genetic landscape of patients with BC undergoing palbociclib treatment was dynamic and changed over the course of treatment. Regarding progression-free survival, alterations in <i>NRAS <\/i>(Hazard Ratio (HR): 11.97, P &#60; 0.005)), <i>MAP3K1 <\/i>(HR: 6.86, P &#60; 0.005), and <i>TP53<\/i> (HR: 3.6, P = 0.02) were identified in cfDNA on D15 and were linked to poor prognoses. Alterations in <i>CBFB<\/i> at baseline (HR: 5.15, P = 0.01), in <i>BRCA2<\/i> (HR: 7.17, P &#60; 0.005) and <i>NRAS<\/i> (HR: 5.32, P &#60; 0.005) at D15, and <i>ESR1<\/i> (HR: 4.37, P = 0.01) at EOT were also linked to poor prognosis, whereas alterations in <i>WEE1<\/i> (HR: -5.84, P = 0.02) at EOT were associated with a favorable prognosis. Alterations in <i>ESR1<\/i>, <i>WEE1, CBFB<\/i>, and <i>BRCA2<\/i> were prognostic factors at peak frequencies during treatment. Moreover, our research uncovered a novel observation that as treatment progressed, the relationship between prognostic factors focused on alterations in <i>ESR1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> tended to weaken.<br \/>Conclusion: Cancer panel testing for cfDNA identified prognostic and predictive biomarkers for palbociclib add-on therapy after acquiring fulvestrant resistance in patients with HR-positive\/HER2-negative ABC\/MBC.

However, some patients who did not develop T790M mutation are converted to T790M positive through EGFR TKI retreatment. We conducted a Phase II prospective study analyzing T790m (+) conversion and prognosis in patients who were not induced T790M mutation at 2<sup>nd<\/sup> biopsy and were re-treated with first-generation EGFR-TKI as the third-line or later therapy.<br \/>Methods: We re-administered first-generation EGFR-TKI to 63 patients (gefitinib n=34 or erlotinib n=29) who had previously been treated with first- or second- generation EGFR TKIs and cytotoxic chemotherapy because they were T790M-negative at the 2nd biopsy. Results: Among the 63 patients, a new T790m (+) mutation was identified in 20 patients (32%) with EGFR TKI retreatment. The first EGFR TKI treatment period and EGFR TKI retreatment period were significantly longer in the T790m (+) group than in the T790m (-) group (P-value=0.026, P-value=0.029, respectively). The best response to retreatment was also favorable in the T790m (+) group (P-value=0.038). The median overall survival (OS) in the T790m (+) group was 29.3 months, which was significantly better than the 6.0 months observed in the T790m (-) group (P-value&#60;0.001). In an additional NGS analysis conducted on stored plasma samples from the 24 patients who were negative for T790M in the tumor tissue before retreatment, T790M was detected in five patients. These patients, who were subsequently treated with a third EGFR TKI, demonstrated very favorable overall survival (OS).<br \/>Conclusions: EGFR retreatment could induce T790m (+) conversion in approximately one-third of cases, and these patients exhibited favorable prognosis. Through NGS analysis using plasma samples, approximately 20% cases of T790m mutation, which were not detected through routine PCR tests at the tumor tissue, could be identified. Retreatment-EGFR TKI and NGS analysis through blood samples could improve patient prognosis through the additional discovery of T790m (+) mutation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR,Targeted therapy,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Joong Jin Ahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae Cheol Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Chang Min Choi<sup>3<\/sup>, In Ae Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Kye Young Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Jeong Eun Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Seung Hoon Jang<sup>6<\/sup>, Seong Hoon Yoon<sup>7<\/sup>, In Jae Oh<sup>8<\/sup>, Sang Hoon Lee<sup>9<\/sup>, Eun Young Kim<sup>9<\/sup>, Juwhan Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sung Yong Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Ulsan University Asan Medical center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Ulsan University Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Hallym University Medical Center, Anyang, Korea, Republic of,<sup>7<\/sup>Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan, Korea, Republic of,<sup>8<\/sup>Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeonnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>9<\/sup>Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6114dbd1-28e7-405d-8bd9-3af5b07630ad","ControlNumber":"4530","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

This malignancy is characterized by a remarkably early onset, with only 10% of cases occurring beyond 5 years of age. According to the INRG classification, ~50% of patients are classified as low risk (L1\/L2). Despite advances in treatment, around 20% of these experienced a relapse within 5 years with a mere 10% survival rate.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We investigated the role of the adrenoceptor beta-3 (ADRB3) as a prognostic factor for NB. The samples provided by IRCCS Meyer Children&#8217;s Hospital allowed us to measure cytofluorimetric level expression of ADRB3 in tissue biopsies from 43 NBs, in the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and in the bone marrow cells (BMCs) at onset and at the end of treatment. Further, to study the role of ADRB3 in NB, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock down ADRB3 expression in mice model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Results indicate that ADRB3 levels in biopsy at the onset are significantly higher (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.026) in patients with negative outcome than those who achieved complete remission. The R package survival was used to perform Survival curve analysis to further assess the impact of ADRB3 at the onset in biopsy tissues. Results confirmed a significant separation (p = 0.031) between survival curves of patients with high levels and those with low levels, reinforcing its importance as a prognostic factor. Moreover, the same results were found in survival curves (p = 0.038) in low-risk patients, corroborating the importance of ADRB3 levels to discriminate between unfavorable or favorable prognosis. Moreover, post-chemotherapeutic treatment analysis, in both residual CTCs and BMCs, indicated statistically differences in ADRB3 levels between fully recovered patients and deceased. Survival curves, stratified by ADRB3 levels in CTCs post-chemotherapy, a favorable prognosis for patients with low levels (p = 0.0001). Finally, the expression analysis showed that ADRB3 levels in NB cells led to increment of processes associated with the cellular migration and metastasization and in metabolism.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our findings suggest that ADRB3 is a significant prognostic factor for NB. Patients with high ADRB3 expression in biopsy at the onset and after the treatment have a higher risk of unfavorable outcome, even for low-risk patients. In conclusion, our results challenge current classification and prognostic paradigms, highlighting ADRB3's crucial role in NB, contributing to refine risk stratification and unveil a new potential target for liquid biopsy of detecting, analyzing and monitoring CTCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,beta3-adrenoceptors ,prognostic biomarkers,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

STING expression has been described at variable levels in various tumor types where it might enhance anti-tumoral effects of the immune system and impact tumor angiogenesis. STING activating targeted therapies are currently evaluated in preclinical studies. However, the clinical significance of STING expression in tumor cells as compared to tumor-associated inflammatory cells is not fully resolved.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate the potential clinical significance of STING expression in different cell types of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells), more than 1,900 patients were analyzed by multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (CKpan, STING, CD45, CD68 and CD31) in a tissue microarray format (TMA) in combination with a deep-learning based algorithm for automated cell detection.<br \/>Results: STING expression on colorectal cancer cells varied markedly. Of 1,905 evaluable cancers, 601 (31.5%) showed a strong expression in virtually all tumor cells and 428 (22.5%) lacked STING staining while 478 (25.1%) showed a weak, and 398 (20.9%) a moderate staining. High STING expression on tumor cells was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI, p&#60;0.0001), low tumor stage (p=0.0013), absence of nodal metastasis (pN0, p=0.0003) and tumor localization in the right colon (p&#60;0.0001). A multivariate analysis revealed that these associations were solely driven by the tight relationship between STING expression in tumor cells and MSI. Accordingly, subgroups of tumors with and without MSI lacked significant associations between STING expression on tumor cells and pT or pN categories. While the total number of lymphocytes and macrophages were related to MSI, low pT, and pN0, there were significant associations between a high percentage of STING positive macrophages and lymphocytes to low pT stage (p&#60;0.0001 each) and absence of nodal metastases for high percentage of STING positive macrophages (p=0.0033). STING was regularly expressed on endothelial cells of small vessels. Although the intensity appeared to be variable, there was no link to tumor phenotype.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, the significant link between high STING expression on tumor cells, lymphocytes and macrophages with a favorable tumor phenotype supports the concept of STING representing an enhancer of anti-tumoral effects of the immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Colorectal cancer,Microsatellite instability,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

Limited studies have researched disease characteristics in this population, which can benefit from the identification of molecular markers that can provide an insight into who is at greater risk of mortality. Epigenetic biomarkers represent the combined effect of environmental and genetic factors. Particularly DNA methylation biomarkers can be valuable as biomarkers of breast cancer risk and prognosis. While studies in other populations have identified DNA methylation biomarkers associated with breast cancer and its clinicopathological outcomes, research on Brazilian cohorts has been limited in scope and focused on women of European descent. The goal of this work was to determine the epigenetic makeup of breast cancer in Brazilian women of African descent. To identify epigenetic biomarkers in Brazilian women who self-identified as Black or Brown, we conducted a case-series analysis investigating DNA methylation patterns in tumor (T) and adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissue. For this, we used the Illumina EPIC (850k) arrays to carry out DNA methylation profiling in 48 frozen tissue paired T and NT samples of breast cancer patients treated at the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We identified a total of 7,749 probes with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value &#60; 0.0001 and differences between T and NT tissue above |0.3|. Of these, 5,976 or 77.12% had lower DNA methylation in T when compared to NT tissue; while 1,773 (22.88%) had higher DNA methylation. These were used to identify 21 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that contained a minimum of seven cg sites, a mean difference larger than |0.2| and a maximum difference above |0.4|. DMRs were mostly (12) hypermethylated in T, and included PCDHGA, NKAPL, ZKSCAN4, SPAG6, CA3, DPP6, RGS22, NXPH1, ANK3, OTX2, SOX17, and CDO1. We used pyrosequencing to validate the levels of SOX17 in eighty-eight tumor and non-adjacent tumor tissue DNAs. We found SOX17 to be hypermethylated in T (44.5&#177;19.1% vs 10.2&#177;10.6, p&#60;0.0001). Differences in DNA methylation in T and NT tissue we still observed by race\/ethnicity categories, 43.9&#177;18.6% vs 11.0.&#177;13.2% (p&#60;0.0001) for Brown, and 45.1&#177;20.7% vs 8.8&#177;3.0% for Black women (p&#60;0.0001), respectively. Similarly to previously reported, SOX17 hypermethylation was found to be associated with Luminal A and B molecular subtypes (p&#60;0.0001). To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a discovery approach to identify epigenetic biomarkers in Black and Brown Brazilian women. Our findings confirming previously reported data on SOX17 hypermethylation in breast cancer are encouraging. We expect to validate other epigenetic markers unique to this population that can ultimately aid in the molecular characterization of Brazilian breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,DNA methylation,Hispanic,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Post-treatment ctDNA positivity were associated with worse local recurrence-free survival (P=0.001) and progression-free survival (P=0.001), but not overall survival. Moreover, TCR clonality was significantly increased after treatment, including CDR3 diversity (P=0.003), TCR clonotype (P=0.004), and VJ pairs (P=0.010), indicating an increased T cell expansion and complexity. Specifically, we identified two increased and four reduced VJ rearrangements after treatment, and the four reduced VJ rearrangements (V&#946;12-2J&#946;2-4, V&#946;6-9J&#946;1-5, V&#946;6-7J&#946;1-5, and V&#946;6-9J&#946;1-1) were significantly associated with worse progression-free survival.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest the prognostic implication of plasma ctDNA and TCR profiles in patients with unresectable ESCC receiving definitive therapy, supporting the future development of non-invasive monitoring of disease progression in these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Esophageal cancer,Targeted sequencing,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Baidong Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Zhan<sup>2<\/sup>, Qiang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenxuan Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jiaohui Pang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yaru Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Song Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Qiuxiang Ou<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Haimeng Tang<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Alei Feng<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhe Yang<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tumor Research and Therapy Center, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Tumor Research and Therapy Center, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc, Nanjing, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Tumor Research and Therapy Center, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"465efd56-7dc3-4363-b5e0-662ea04fa0cf","ControlNumber":"2119","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Earlier studies demonstrated the prognostic value of serum thymidine kinase 1 (STK1) activity determinations in different hematological malignancies. To date, the prognostic value of STK1 protein concentration in patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP has not been investigated. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the value of high TK levels on Overall survival among DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP as first-line treatment.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The study included 146 patients diagnosed with DLBCL between 2010 and 2016 from the Uppsala-Umea&#778; Comprehensive Cancer Consortium (U-CAN). All patients included were treated using the standard chemotherapy regimen R-CHOP. Serum samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, during the treatment, 1 year after treatment, and after relapse. Non-infected and apparently healthy persons, matched to the DLBCL patients (57 males and 88 females), served as controls. The TK1 protein levels in all serum samples were determined by using AroCell TK 210 ELISA (AroCell AB, Sweden). The TK1 protein concentration was expressed as &#956;g\/L.<br \/>Results: The TK1 concentrations in sera from DLBCL patients before treatment were significantly higher compared to the concentrations in healthy individuals, median 0.44 &#956;g\/L (IQ range 0.22 to 1.06 &#956;g\/L) vs. median 0.22 &#956;g\/L (IQ range 0.18 to 0.29 &#956;g\/L, P&#60;0.00001). Serum TK1 was also significantly higher in patients with more advanced stages (P&#60;0.00001), higher IPI (P&#60;0.00001), and in patients with B-symptoms (P&#60;0.0001). Patients with STK1 protein levels below the cut-off value (0.45 &#956;g\/L) had significantly better OS and DFS (P=0.04 and P=0.0006, respectively) compared to patients with STK1 concentration above the cut-off. In multivariate analyses, dichotomized S-TK1 measurements before treatment were found to be significant for the risk of relapse in combination with either aaIPI or IPI (p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: These results confirmed that STK1 concentration correlates with risk factors such as tumor burden, Ann Arbor stage, and IPI. In conclusion, patients with high TK1 concentrations at the time of diagnosis have short overall survival and STK1 concentrations are apparently a prognostic indicator for survival in patients treated with modern chemo-immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thymidine kinase,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,R-CHOP,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

CNVs have shown to be associated with poor outcome in advanced stage disease. However, the relationship between CNV and clinicopathologic features on prognosis in early-stage lung cancer is undefined. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the impact of CNV on recurrence in never-smokers who underwent curative resection for pathological stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma using an integrated genomic and clinicopathological analysis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed a cohort of 210 never-smokers with stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma treated from 2014 to 2022 who met the inclusion criteria (no neoadjuvant therapy, pathological stage I-II, complete resection, next-generation sequencing available). The patient cohort was stratified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of arm-level CNVs. We assessed cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) between CNV groups using competing risk regression analysis, adjusting for SUVmax, pathologic stage, lymphovascular invasion, IASLC grade, and tumor mutation burden.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 210 patients, 159 patients were female (76%), and patients were primarily from Caucasian (n=140, 67%) or Asian decent (n=50, 24%). Based on arm-level CNV clustering, the cohort was stratified into three groups: CNV low (n=86, 41%), CNV moderate (n=75, 36%) and CNV high (n=49, 23%). The CNV low tumors were characterized by a low CNV burden. Conversely, the CNV moderate tumors primarily exhibited gains in chromosomes 1q, 5p and 7p, along with loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 9p, 9q and 13. CNV high tumors were characterized by whole-genome doubling. Whole-genome doubling was significantly more common in CNV high tumors (n=33, 66%) compared to CNV low (n=2, 2.3%) and CNV moderate tumors (n=2, 2.7%) (<i>p&#60;.001<\/i>). <i>EGFR<\/i> (n=145, 69%) and <i>TP53<\/i> (n=61, 29%) were the most frequently altered genes, with <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations being significantly more prevalent in CNV high tumors (n=41, 84%) compared to CNV low tumors (n=46, 53%) (<i>p&#60;.001<\/i>). In total, 42 patients (20%) developed recurrences. The CIR was lower in the CNV low group (5y-CIR, 14%, 95%CI: 6.5%-25%) compared to the CNV moderate (5y-CIR, 31%, 95%CI: 18%-44%) and CNV high group (5y-CIR, 48%, 95%CI: 27%-66%) (<i>p=.004<\/i>), with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.3 (95%CI: 0.93-5.71; <i>p=0.074<\/i>) and 2.65 (95%CI: 1.07-6.60; <i>p=.037)<\/i>, respectively. The CIR for locoregional (n=11, 5%) and distant recurrence (n=31, 15%) remained lower in the CNV low group compared to the combined CNV moderate &#38; high groups (Gray test <i>p=.020<\/i> and <i>p=.049<\/i>, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In never-smokers who underwent curative treatment of pathological stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma, copy number status seems a predictor of recurrence, with CNV low tumors associated with the best prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Recurrence,Copy number variation,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Following normalization to osmolality, log transformation, and imputation of missing values, we used Welch&#8217;s two-sample t-test to identify biochemicals that differed significantly by progression status. We measured pre- and post-RT plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression or last follow-up. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed the associations between hsCRP and PFS.<br \/>Results: In 120 breast cancer patients, carbohydrate metabolism, branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, phosphatidylcholine metabolism, arginine metabolism, oxidative stress-related metabolites, androgenic steroids, and nucleotide metabolism had the most notable differences in patients with progression versus progression-free cases. In 488 breast cancer patients, RT significantly increased plasma hsCRP levels, and post-RT hsCRP levels were significantly higher in deceased vs. alive patients (p=0.031). In multivariable models, hsCRP had a prognostic value for all-stage and stage 0-II patients.<br \/>Conclusions: In our study of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant RT, multiple metabolite biomarkers and post-RT plasma CRP levels were associated with a worse prognosis.

RD after neoadjuvant anti-HER2-based therapy is associated with worse outcomes. Whether HER2DX risk-score analyzed in RD provides additional prognostic information is unknown.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>:<br \/>This retrospective analysis included 14 pts from group B of the PHERGain trial (NCT03161353): 6 who developed distant recurrences and 8 matched controls with HER2DX high-risk score at BL who did not. Group B pts had centrally confirmed, stage I-IIIA, HER2+ EBC and were treated with HP (&#177; endocrine therapy), with chemotherapy added for pts without PET response after 2 treatment cycles or pathological complete response (Perez-Garcia et al, Lancet Oncol 2021).HER2DX was evaluated on tumor samples collected at BL and surgery. The primary objective was to determine the association of HER2DX risk-score in RD with the development of distant recurrences. Secondary objectives were to assess gene expression and the HER2DX signatures in BL vs RD and their association with distant recurrences. Cox regression models evaluated the association of variables with distant recurrence. Paired SAM with a false discovery rate &#60;5% identified differences in gene expression between BL and RD samples.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>:<br \/>Median follow-up was 4.04 years. Five (83.3%) of 6 pts with distant recurrences had HER2DX high-risk scores at BL. The 8 control pts had HER2DX high-risk scores at BL but no relapse. In RD, all 6 pts (100%) who relapsed had a HER2DX high-risk score, while 4 (50%) of 8 pts without distant recurrence presented a HER2DX downstaging. Pts with HER2DX low-risk in RD had better 3-year distant disease-free survival than high-risk pts (100% vs 50%; hazard ratio = 4.34 [1.03-18.23], p=0.045). In RD, high expression of the proliferation signature and 15 genes, including proliferation genes, and low expression of 38 genes, including immune and luminal-related genes, were associated with poor prognosis. In paired analyses of BL and RD samples, 118 genes (63.8%) were differentially expressed in pts that did not relapse, while only 3 genes (1.6%) were differentially expressed in pts that relapsed.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>:<br \/>These data suggest that HER2DX risk-score in RD provides additional information on the likelihood of developing distant recurrences. In RD, high expression of immune and luminal genes was associated with a reduced risk, while high expression of proliferation genes was associated with a higher risk. Molecular changes after anti-HER2 therapy were mainly observed in RD of pts that did not relapse. Prognostic impact of HER2DX downstaging merits further evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,ErbB2,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We recently discovered a first-in-class human Chondroitinase (Chase) that degrades chondroitin sulfate. This Chase is a splice variant of HYAL4 (V1) and promotes a malignant phenotype and chemoresistance in BC cells. We evaluated V1\/Chase expression and functions in BC and inhibitors to overcome V1\/Chase-mediated Gemcitabine (Gem) resistance.<br \/>Methods: Cohort 1: 653 voided urine specimens (BC, 160; non-BC, 493); cohort 2: 40 cystectomy specimens from MIBC patients who received adjuvant Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (G+C) treatment. Gene expression was measured by q-PCR and urine was assayed by the Chase test. V1 was expressed in BC cell lines or silenced and the transfectants were analyzed for sensitivity to Gem and Cisplatin. The mechanism of Gem resistance was evaluated in preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Results: In cohort 1, Chase levels were 7-10-fold elevated in patients with BC compared to patients with benign genitourinary conditions, history of BC, or other cancers. Chase test detected BC with 94.4% and 87.4% specificity. Chase test had 84% accuracy in correctly diagnosing the cases with atypical cytology inference. Stem cell marker CD44 was the major substrate of Chase in BC cells. V1&#8217;s Chase activity induced CD44 cleavage and shedding. Intracellularly, CD44 cleavage induced JAK2\/Stat3 pathway and subsequently upregulation of cytidine deaminase. CDA induces Gem metabolism and efflux of dFdU, an inactive Gem metabolite. HPLC analysis showed, V1 transfectants have increased levels of dFdU and higher efflux. STAT3 and CDA inhibitors synergistically re-sensitized V1-expressing cells to Gem. In cohort 2, V1, p-JAK2 and CDA expression predicted failure to G+C treatment (P&#60;0.0001). JAK2, STAT3 and CDA inhibitors synergistically re-sensitized V1-expressing cells to Gem. V1-induced muscle invasive tumors that were metastatic. While V1-expressing tumors were resistant, combination of Gem with a CDA or JAK-2 inhibitor abrogated V1 tumor growth with minimal toxicity.<br \/>Conclusion: V1\/Chase is a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer and drives muscle-invasion, metastasis, and Gem resistance in BC. Inhibitors of the Chase signaling pathway overcome V1-induced Gem resistance, suggesting a precision-based treatment approach to improve treatment response.<br \/>Support: 1R01CA227277-05A1; 1R01CA283699-01","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic markers,HYAL4,Invasiveness,Bladder Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

This study investigated impact of an oncRNA recurrence risk model on outcomes in TNBC patients with RD.<br \/>Methods: Study population included stage I-III TNBC patients with RD and available end-of-treatment (EOT) serum samples who were enrolled in a multisite prospective cohort study. EOT samples were collected after completion of all curative treatment (local\/systemic). Small RNAs were isolated from EOT serum, sequenced at average depth of 76.5 &#177; 12.5 million 50bp single end reads, and annotated using a bespoke bioinformatics pipeline to identify oncRNAs. Cancer risk scores were generated using an oncRNA based tumor detection artificial intelligence model trained on 451 treatment naive breast cancer samples and 470 samples from individuals without known cancer diagnosis. Score cutpoint for high vs low recurrence risk was determined through ROC analysis. Impact of EOT oncRNA risk category on event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan Meier method and compared by log rank test followed by Cox regression. Residual cancer burden (RCB) was determined according to classification by Symmans et al.<br \/>Results: oncRNA isolation\/score generation was successful for 79 out of 80 TNBC patients with RD and available EOT serum sample. Median age was 48 years and 39% had node positive disease. RCB class distribution was as follows: RCB I=27%, RCB II=49%, RCB III=18%. Training set (n=39) was used to define oncRNA risk score cutpoint. In the testing set (n=40), 38% were classified as oncRNA high-risk and 62% as oncRNA low-risk. oncRNA risk category was not associated with baseline T stage, nodal status, or RCB class. oncRNA high-risk status was associated with lower EFS and OS; 3y EFS was 47% and 73% (HR 2.76, 95% CI 0.92-9.24, p=0.058) and OS 53% and 76% (HR 3.78, 95% CI 1.19-12.00, p=0.016) in high and low risk groups, respectively. In multivariable analysis including oncRNA risk status, T stage, nodal status, and RCB class, oncRNA high risk status retained significant association with lower EFS (HR 7.70, 95% CI 1.33-44.64, p=0.023) and OS (HR 7.99, 95% CI 1.36-47.00, p=0.022).<br \/>Conclusion: EOT oncRNA liquid biopsy assay was independently prognostic for outcomes in TNBC patients with RD. More than half of patients in the oncRNA high-risk group suffered an EFS event by 3 years. oncRNA risk score has potential to provide prognostic utility complementary to clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with TNBC. These findings should be confirmed in other TNBC studies and may provide insights for patient stratification\/selection in RD adjuvant therapy intensification trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Liquid biopsies,Recurrence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Within this cancer type, an easily applicable prognostic biomarker may have clinical utility, potentially stratifying patients into bladder-sparing treatments. Expansion of T cell populations targeting cancer-specific neoantigens is an early response to malignancy. To investigate if the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire could serve as a biomarker for cancer progression, we analyzed the TCR landscape in a cohort of 119 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before undergoing radical cystectomy.<br \/>Peripheral and tumor TCR repertoires were produced using amplicon-based sequencing of the TCR beta chain. Additionally, T cell fraction was determined from whole exome sequencing data using TcellExTRECT, and latent viral DNA was investigated in plasma whole genome sequencing data using Kraken2. Antigen targets were estimated using GLIPH2. To explore the T cell repertoire subtypes, single-cell sequencing was performed on four fresh blood samples.<br \/>In pre-treatment peripheral blood, low-diversity TCR repertoires were associated with worse survival (HR=2.3, p=0.024). Particularly poor outcome was observed in a subset of patients with both low TCR diversity and low fraction of circulating T cells (HR=4.7, p=5e-4). Low-diversity repertoires were dominated by expanded T cell clones. TCR target annotation revealed that expanded T cell clones disproportionately targeted latent viral infections (p=2e-13), and cytomegalovirus DNA detection was strongly associated with decreased TCR diversity (p=5e-5). Additionally, tumor TCR sequencing revealed that expanded clones were rarely found in the tumor. Single-cell sequencing of peripheral blood found that most expanded clones consisted of cytotoxic T cells, while non-expanded clones mostly consisted of naive T cells. This indicates that low TCR diversity may represent a contraction of the naive T cell compartment, resulting in reduced immune competence. Finally, analysis of patient-matched longitudinal samples revealed that chemotherapy and cystectomy reduced TCR diversity in patients with high pre-treatment diversity (p=0.001), indicating that treatment negatively affected the immune system in the most immune-competent patients.<br \/>Our results suggest that both low TCR diversity and low T cell fraction represent decreased immune competency. This could be associated with an elevated risk of progression due to a reduced ability to control cancer growth and limit systemic cancer cell dissemination. These findings underline that immune health is an important factor during malignant disease, even when patients are not treated with immunotherapies. Therefore, improving immune health could be a potential future goal for cancer treatment and prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Liquid biopsies,Metastatic potential,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

GI and intratumor mutational heterogeneity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) were associated with poor prognosis in a large multi-site sequencing study. As 10-15% of renal tumors exhibit copy number burden associated GI, the development of proteogenomic biomarkers to identify this subset of tumors will be of high clinical value. In our in-depth analysis of CPTAC renal cancer cohorts namely, ccRCC discovery and rare RCC, we first estimated absolute copy number using CNVEX TPO analysis pipeline. Copy number burden-based genome instability was estimated by calculating whole genome instability index (wGII) from DNA sequencing data, in addition to the estimation of genome ploidy and purity of the tumors. Genome instability was associated with survival outcomes in both ccRCC and rare RCC (Ref. 1 and 2). Differential proteogenomic analysis identified IGF2BP3, IGF2BP1, PYCR1 RNA and protein, to be upregulated among high wGII tumors. High wGII tumors showed upregulation of cell proliferation and other cell cycle\/proliferation concepts in gene set enrichment analysis. Interestingly, transcriptional module analysis revealed transcription factors and target genes specifically upregulated in GI cases and this pattern showed certain degree of overlap to 9p loss ccRCC tumors (another molecular ccRCC subset that is also associated with poor prognosis). Differential expression analysis also identified, kinases, phosphosites and co-regulated kinase-substrates that are dysregulated in genome instable renal tumors. IGF2BP3 immunohistochemistry staining showed specific overexpression in high wGII tumors and the high positivity was observed exclusivity in the tumor cells. Prognostic biomarkers IGF2BP3, IGF2BP1, PYCR1, and UCHL1 show great promise to be developed as clinical prognostic assays and warrants additional characterization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Renal cell carcinoma,Prognostic markers,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

It was recently proposed to be associated with cancer aggressiveness and altered T-cell function in bladder cancer and it was found to be linked to poor prognosis in a TCGA bladder cancer patient cohort of 300 patients based on a combined analysis of RNAs from Y-chromosome genes. In this study, we aimed to clarify the clinical relevance of LOY in a large cohort of urothelial bladder cancer patients by using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH).<br \/>Design: X and Y chromosomes were analyzed by FISH on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 1,819 urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder from male patients including 487 patients who had undergone cystectomy for muscle-invasive disease and for which follow-up data were available. Data of tumor microenvironment parameters were obtained in a previous study.<br \/>Results: LOY was found in 26.0% of 1,479 analyzable cancers. In the subset of non-invasive cancers, the frequency of LOY increased from pTaG2 (14.5%) to pTG3 (28.6%) but these differences were not significant (p=0.1015). In muscle-invasive cancers, the frequency of LOY increased slightly from pT2 (25.4%) to pT4 cancers (32.8%) but this association was again not significant (p=0.1868). Within pT2-4 cancers, LOY was associated with venous invasion (p=0.0010) but unrelated to pT, pN, and L-status, as well as to overall, recurrence-free, and cancer-specific survival. Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas with and without LOY did not show significant differences in the number of CD8 positive lymphocytes, the fraction of CD8 positive intraepithelial lymphocytes, the number of macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as the fraction of t helper and t regulatory cells.<br \/>Conclusion: FISH is the gold standard for determining LOY. That LOY was neither associated with histopathological parameters of cancer aggressiveness and patient prognosis nor with any parameters describing the tumor microenvironment strongly argues against a driving role of LOY for bladder cancer progression and cancer associated immune reaction. The slight increase of LOY from pTaG2 to pT4 cancers is consistent with a continuous (but clinically irrelevant) loss of the dispensable Y chromosomes during tumor evolution over time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Prognostic markers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

While GPX2 staining was always strong in normal urothelium, it decreased markedly during grade and stage progression. Within pTa tumors, GPX2 positivity continuously decreased from pTaG2 low grade (99.4% positive) to pTa G2 high grade (97.2% positive) and to pTa G3 (90.5%; p=0.0013) while there was a marked further drop of GPX2 positivity from pTaG3 to muscle-invasive cancers (56.6%; p&#60;0.0001 for pT2-4 vs. pTa G3). Within pT2-4 carcinomas, low or absent GPX2 staining was significantly linked to poor overall survival (p=0.0140), V1 (p&#60;0.0001), L1 (p=0.0014), and high grade (p=0.0091), but statistically unrelated to pT and pN. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic impact of reduced GPX2 expression (p=0.0081) was independent of pT (p&#60;0.0001) and pN (p&#60;0.0001) in pT2-4 tumors.

Several papers revealed that TTF-1 expression is associated with better patient outcomes independent of the tumor stage. However, it is unknown whether the prognostic impact of TTF-1 only results from a different growth pattern (tumor grading) or is independently associated with a biologically more aggressive phenotype. Thus, we analyzed a large bi-centric cohort of LUAD to assume the true prognostic value of TTF-1 in relation to the tumor grade.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We collected a large, real-life cohort of 447 patients with completely resected LUAD from two large-volume German lung cancer centers. TTF-1 status, evaluated by IHC, and tumor grading were correlated with clinical, pathologic, and molecular data, as well as patient outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for comparison of TTF-1 status and different tumor grades in terms of the DFS. The impact of TTF-1 was measured by univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Finally, a causal graph analysis was performed to identify and account for potential confounders to improve the statistical estimation of the predictive power of TTF-1 expression for DFS in comparison to the tumor grade.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that TTF-1 positivity is associated with longer DFS independent of tumor grade, whereas a strong association of DFS with the tumor grade is observed only in TTF-1-positive patients. In univariate analysis, TTF-1 positivity was associated with significantly longer DFS (median log HR -0.83 [-1.43; -0.20]; p=0.018), whereas higher tumor grade showed a non-significant association with shorter DFS (median log HR 0.30 [-0.58; 1.60]; p=0,62 for G1 to G2 and 0.68 [-0.24; 1.89]; p=0,34 for G2 to G3). In multivariate analysis, TTF-1 positivity resulted in a significantly longer DFS (median log HR -0.65 [-1.13; -0.09]; p=0.05) independent of all other parameters, including tumor grade. Applying the adjustment sets suggested by the causal graph analysis, the superiority of TTF-1 (median log HR -0.86 [-1.25; -0.41]) over tumor grade (median log HR 0.31 [-0.32; 1.30]\/ 0.61[-0.07; 1.65]) in terms of prognostic power was confirmed.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study draws three important conclusions: Firstly, it indicates that the prognostic power of tumor grade is limited to TTF-1-positive patients. Secondly, it underlines the independent prognostic value of TTF-1 expression for DFS regardless of tumor grade. Finally, our analyses reveal that the effect size of TTF-1 surpasses that of tumor grade. To transfer the results directly into the clinical area, we recommend distinguishing between TTF-1-positive and TTF-1-negative LUADs in the pathological report. Tumor grading should only be applied to TTF-1-positive LUADs (TTF-1+ \/ G1-3).

A novel approach is to gain a holistic understanding of the cellular composition and formation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, we developed a miF-based, AI-driven approach for spatially resolved TME characterization at the cellular level and used this to successfully predict clinical outcome.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We assembled a large bicentric real-world sample group of 1168 patients with resected NSCLC from the Charite and the University Hospital Cologne. For tissue microarray construction, four 1.5 mm tissue cores were punched from each formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor block. Sections were stained with a 12-plex IF panel followed by H&#38;E staining. All stains were scanned and co-registered with single cell accuracy. Next, we trained a H&#38;E-based tissue segmentation model to detect the different tumor regions: carcinoma, stroma, and necrosis. In addition, we developed a nucleus-based cell detection model, and 12 cell classification models to categorize each detected cell by single-miF channels. Different cell phenotypes were derived from the marker-specific cell classifications. Finally, we trained a model on the Charit&#233; cohort using the spatially resolved cell readouts, spot-wise phenotype log-density, co-clustering of marker expression, and frequency of co-occurrence of marker expression through Delaunay triangulation, to predict patient survival on the Cologne cohort.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The tissue segmentation model achieved a macro averaged F1 score of 92%. The cell detection model identified a total of 53 million cells that were classified marker-wise with an F1 score of at least 95% on hold-out data. Our final prediction model identified a stable spatially resolved cell signature, consisting of 10 different characteristic cell neighborhood niches, which could be used to predict overall patient survival. The model trained on the Charite cohort was validated with the Cologne cohort and achieved a high performance (C-score of 71). In comparison, the UICC8 stage and the immunoscore (CD20<sup>+<\/sup>CD3<sup>+<\/sup>\/carcinoma cell ratio), which were used as a baseline, achieved C-scores of 63 and 54, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The combination of our large real-world clinical cohort, multiplex panel, and automated AI approach enabled a broad spatially resolved exploration of the TME in NSCLC at single cell resolution.
