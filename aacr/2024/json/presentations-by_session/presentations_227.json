[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer has become the most common malignant tumor globally. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become an important treatment option for locally advanced breast cancer, capable of eliminating circulating tumor cells (micrometastases) and achieving downstaging objectives. However, even after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or receiving local treatment, some patients may still have residual lesions, which are a key factor in distant recurrence and metastasis. The existing clinical biomarker tests such as CEA, CA-153, and imaging methods are unable to accurately assess the condition early on. Although tissue pathology biopsy of tumor specimens is the gold standard for clinical pathological diagnosis, it also has certain limitations. Traditional high-throughput sequencing technology for breast cancer primarily identifies \"driver genes\" associated with the occurrence and development of breast cancer. However, it has limitations in identifying genomic structural changes and subclones of breast cancer, and it overlooks the heterogeneity among tumor cells. The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can detect these heterogeneous individuals, decode the heterogeneity of breast cancer cells, refine molecular subtypes, and open up new pathways to overcome drug resistance. We collected samples from 6 patients with locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (ER-, PR-, HER2-negative, defined as HER2 immunohistochemistry 0, 1+ or 2+ but FISH-negative). We compared the cell subgroups and their gene expression in biopsy specimens before neoadjuvant chemotherapy with those in post-treatment specimens obtained during surgery, analyzing changes in cell composition in the tumor microenvironment before and after immunotherapy to identify specific cell types potentially contributing to the outcome of immunotherapy, particularly cell subtypes associated with T-cell clonal proliferation. We found that in the group with good neoadjuvant treatment response (Miller-Payne grade 4-5), B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Tregs cells were all significantly downregulated, while endothelial cells and aSMA-positive fibroblast cells were significantly upregulated. By comparing changes in the immune microenvironment between patients with and without T-cell clonal proliferation before and after treatment, we revealed the differentiation patterns of various immune cells in immunotherapy and potential mechanisms of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Single cell,Immune cells,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Additionally, a combination therapy involving the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab, plus bevacizumab (AtezoBev) has emerged as a standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). Given that more than half of treated patients do not respond effectively, identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical efficacy has become an urgent matter. However, the investigation into the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been lagging in aHCC compared to other malignancies due to the difficulty in obtaining tumor samples just before the commencement of systemic therapy.<br \/>Methods: We have established a scheme to analyze the TME by obtaining tumor samples immediately before AtezoBev administration, and explored the relevance to its efficacy, focusing on the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within those samples. Tumor samples from 94 aHCC patients were collected before AtezoBev administration. TME was assessed in 54 patients via flow cytometry and in 72 patients through RNA sequencing, with certain samples undergoing both analyses.<br \/>Results: Predominant etiologies in 94 patients were HCV (n=22, 23%), followed by HBV (n=17, 18%), and alcohol abuse (n=16, 17%). The objective response (OR) and disease control rates were 17% and 81%, respectively, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.6 months. Groups exhibiting high PD-1 positivity of CD8+ T cells (median values as cutoffs) demonstrated superior AtezoBev treatment effects (PFS: 13.1 vs. 4.4 months, p=0.001). In contrast, PD-1 positivity of effector Treg (eTreg) cells in TILs, which reportedly can be one of resistant mechanisms to PD-1 blockade therapy (Togashi Y, et al. Nat Immunol 2020), was not correlated with efficacy. Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted the importance of antigen presentation for OR in groups exhibiting high PD-1 positivity of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, HLA class I expression was elevated in patients achieving an OR. Although previous studies suggest that immunotherapy efficacy could be reduced in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related HCC compared with viral-related HCC, no clear association was found between PD-1 positivity of CD8+ T cells or eTreg cells in TILs and etiology. Among the 94 patients, samples from 11 were analyzable at the point of AtezoBev refractoriness, revealing a trend toward reduction in PD-1 positivity of eTreg cells in TILs.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest a correlation between the efficacy of AtezoBev for aHCC and the presence of PD-1+CD8+ T cells within the tumor. In contrast, PD-1+ eTreg cells did not induce resistance along with a trend toward reduction after the treatment possibly due to combination with bevacizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

This study aims to identify gene expression patterns and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics associated with resistance to NAC, which could significantly impact tumor progression and treatment outcomes. The study encompassed differential gene expression comparing non-responders and responders, enrichment analysis, tumor microenvironment estimation, and cytokines identification from a female patient's cohort with distinct molecular subtypes and candidates to NAC at the Colombian National Cancer Institute. Candidate differentially expressed genes validated with RT-PCR in a larger validation cohort and corroborated in several publicly available databases, including associated treatment drugs. Distinct gene expression profiles were observed between responders and non-responders, emphasizing immune system-related pathways such as IL-17 signaling, B cell receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and NF-kB signaling. Immune-related genes (AGTR1, APOD, CCL19, CGA, ECEL1, NPY1R, NTNG1, PCSK1, PFDN2, S100B, TPRG1, WDR5B, ZNF385B) were identified as biomarkers correlated with non-response and worse prognosis. Responders showed increased B cell populations, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T-cells in lymphoid groups, while non-responders displayed elevated levels of CD8+ naive T-cells. Additionally, responders revealed upregulated myeloid cell populations like macrophages and dendritic cells. Several cytokines like IL1B, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-21, IL-22, IL-36, and TWEAK showed elevated expression in non-responders. Dexamethasone, Vinblastine, and Streptozocin were candidate drugs that interacted with AGTR1, CGA, and S100B, respectively and are associated with progression and metastasis. Logistic regression revealed that overexpression of CGA showed a higher probability (OR:1.83, p=0.03) while ECEL1 had a lower probability (OR=0.44, p=0.04) in non-responders compared to responders who lacked expression of these genes. Immune-related genes and various subtypes of immune cells within the TME exhibit correlations with response to NAC, and several cell fractions significantly changed before and after NAC. These results suggest meta-signatures that warrant further evaluation as concordance assessment between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling, in addition to an extensive validation to triage patients before NAC and target personalized interventions. Detection and evaluation of TME components are essential to predict NAC efficacy and avoid disease relapse. Finally, these findings emphasize the importance of assessing admixed populations to facilitate novel findings and alleviate disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Chemotherapy response,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Lack of specific symptoms in early-stages frequently leads to late-stage diagnosis, reducing therapeutic options. Surgical resection remains the only curative option for early-stage disease; instead, patients with advanced disease usually receive chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine) in combination with durvalumab as first-line treatment and mFOLFOX-6 as second-line, but effects are limited and only a small proportion of patients respond to treatment. Recent advances in molecular characterization of BTCs allowed the identification of several alterations (e.g. IDH1\/2 mutations, FGFR2 rearrangement) for which targeted agents are now available in second line setting but only for a small subset of patients. However, prognosis for patients with advanced stage disease remains poor. Treatment failure depends on several factors such as intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and the complex immunological landscape. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers able to individuate patients that will benefit from immuno-chemotherapy will be crucial.<br \/>Methods: BTC patients at any stage were enrolled in two arms: A) BTCs undergoing surgery; B) advanced\/relapsed BTCs. For this study, patients belonging to arm B were selected, in particular those who received first-line immuno-chemotherapy. Blood samples were collected before and after three months of therapy. Ascites samples were collected for patients with advanced disease who underwent paracentesis during therapy. DEPArray NxT (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) was used for phenotypic analysis and single ascites-derived cell isolation. The Ampli1 Lowpass kit was used for copy number aberration (CNA) profiling. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from plasma at baseline and after three months of immuno-chemotherapy by size-exclusion chromatography and analyzed for size distribution and concentration using Nanosight NS300. Surface EV markers were analyzed by flow cytometry using the MACSPlex Exosome Kit human (MiltenyiBiotec).<br \/>Results: We enrolled 43 patients starting from August 2022: 14 in arm A and 29 in B. 23 patients from arm B received immuno-chemotherapy and 3 underwent paracentesis during therapy. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were successfully established from tumor cells recovered from ascites of these patients. Epithelial cells recovered from ascites displayed aberrant CNA profiles with gains in chromosomes 1q, 8q, 10, 12p, 20, and losses in 1q, 3q, 4, 8q, 9 and X. EV size distribution and concentration were similar before and after treatment as well as surface markers exposure. Further analyses in correlation with clinical features of patients will be performed.<br \/>Conclusions: Our approach will contribute to identify potential predictive factors associated with response\/resistance to immuno-chemotherapy in BTCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Extracellular vesicles,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Nevertheless, currently approved biomarkers (PD-L1, MSI, TMB) have suboptimal positive\/negative predictive values for tumor responses and survival.<br \/>Aims &#38; Methods: We sought to assess the value of gene expression on circulating blood to predict responses to immunotherapy. We performed total paired-end RNAseq at 20-million reads and analyzed differential gene expressions according to cancer outcomes on baseline frozen whole blood from a cohort of 186 patients prospectively enrolled in the IOPREDI study, a French ancillary cohort of the international multi-center STRONG Phase III trial testing the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab in advanced bladder cancers (NCT03084471).<br \/>Results: One hundred and sixty four out of the 186 baseline samples generated valuable blood transcriptome data. Thanks to mathematical corrections, all samples were normalized, and the analysis was possible without introducing any bias despite the sample origin from 16 enrolling sites. We first observed that patients with a complete or partial response or a stable disease overexpressed 19 genes, 5 of which are markers of immune cell activation: <i>CXCL8<\/i>, <i>EOMES<\/i>, <i>GBP5<\/i>, <i>GZMA<\/i>, <i>and GZMH<\/i>. Conversely, patients with a progressive disease overexpressed 11 genes including <i>CD177<\/i>, a marker of neutrophil cells, recently associated to immunotherapy resistance. Next, patients with a PFS &#62; 3 months showed an overexpression of 25 genes associated with immune cells activation such as <i>CD8A<\/i>, <i>CXCL8<\/i>, <i>EOMES<\/i>, <i>FASLG<\/i>, <i>GZM<\/i> genes, whereas patients with a shorter PFS highly expressed genes of immune cell inhibition: <i>CD177<\/i>, <i>CD300LG<\/i>, <i>CD99<\/i>, and <i>CST7<\/i>. Finally, patients with an OS &#62; 7 months had also a higher expression of the same previous genes completed with 6 other genes, still indicators of immunity activation (<i>CD3D<\/i>, <i>CD3E<\/i>, <i>CD3G<\/i>, <i>GZMM<\/i>, <i>IL2RB<\/i>, <i>and PTGDS<\/i>).<br \/>Conclusion: Total RNAseq from RNA directly extracted from whole blood can detect baseline activation of T-cells in patients who will subsequently benefit from anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. This work shows that RNAseq can detect an immune activation state in circulating blood without specific cell selection.

RNA sequencing has identified a BMS 4-gene inflammatory signature that could more accurately forecast clinical outcomes. However, genomic alterations and tumor mutational burden (TMB) haven't consistently predicted anti-PD(L)-1 therapy response in HCC. Therefore, the aim of this research is to identify potential genetic alternation that could serve as predictive marker for anti-PD(L)-1 therapy responses in advanced HCC.<br \/>Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from 38 HCC patients were analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing with the ACTOnco<sup>TM<\/sup> panel before anti-PD(L)-1 therapy. This analysis identified somatic variants across 440 genes and calculated TMB. In silico tools like NetMHC and IEDB predicted neo-peptide-HLA class I binding affinity. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells provided germline data for paired TMB calculations, with tumor responses assessed by RECIST criteria.<br \/>Results: Within a cohort of 167 patients with HCC undergoing ICI therapy, 35 (20.9%) responded to treatment, while 132 (79.1%) did not. Available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from this population included those from 14 responders and 30 non-responders. After conducting quality control measures, which assessed tumor purity, DNA quantity and integrity, as well as sequencing quality, 13 samples from responders and 25 from non-responders qualified for further analysis. Gene alteration analysis identified mutations in TP53 (47%), MUC16 (34%), CTNNB1 (32%), USH2A (16%), ARID1A (13%), NOTCH3 (13%), and ADAMTS16 (11%) of the cases. A TP53 mutation was linked to poor overall survival, whereas mutations in CTNNB1 and the RTK\/RAS\/RAF pathway did not correlate with clinical outcomes.<br \/>The median TMB, predicted at 3.2 &#177; 4.3 mutations per megabase (muts\/Mb), was nominally higher in patients who achieved disease control compared to non-responders (4.6 vs. 3.7 muts\/Mb, p=0.53). Utilizing paired TMB analysis, those with disease control exhibited a higher TMB trend than non-responders (6.0 vs. 2.2 muts\/Mb, p=0.06). Notably, the 13 cases with MUC16 mutations were associated with a significantly higher predicted TMB (10.0 vs. 3.3 muts\/Mb, p=0.0015).<br \/>Conclusions: This study suggests that certain genetic alterations, especially TP53 mutations, may have predictive value for the response to anti-PD(L)-1 therapy in HCC. Moreover, an elevated TMB, particularly when associated with MUC16 mutations, seems to be correlated with improved disease control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Anti-PD-1,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-C.

It is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers and may positively regulate ER expression. Gene expression analysis in tumor samples from the PALOMA-3 study was conducted to explore potential associations of KAT6A and related biomarkers with enhanced benefit from the addition of palbociclib (PAL) to fulvestrant (FUL) in HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. <b>Methods:<\/b> The PALOMA-3 trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer, including those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, to receive PAL+FUL or placebo (PBO) +FUL. Exploratory analysis was conducted on tumor gene expression levels of KAT6A and KAT6B to evaluate their association with the effect of PAL+FUL vs PBO+FUL on progression-free survival (PFS) using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median. Treatment by biomarker interaction effect was also tested. <b>Results:<\/b> In the PALOMA-3 trial, the analyses were conducted in 214 patients (PAL+FUL, 137 patients; PBO+FUL, 77 patients) with baseline tissue profiled, which included 165 patients with prior chemotherapy (PAL+FUL, 101 patients; PBO+FUL, 64 patients). In patients with KAT6A data, a trend of better treatment effect (interaction p = 0.54) was observed in those with low KAT6A mRNA expression (median PFS on PAL+FUL was 11.04 months (m) and PBO+FUL was 3.65 m, HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.85, log rank p = 0.008) versus high KAT6A expression (median PFS on PAL+FUL was 13.90 m and PBO+FUL was 11.20 m, HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.39-1.13, p = 0.126). A treatment effect was observed in patients with prior exposure to chemotherapy who had low KAT6A expression (median PFS on PAL+FUL was 9.53 m and PBO+FUL was 3.66 m, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.94, p = 0.027), while this was not observed in those with high KAT6A expression (median PFS on PAL+FUL was 11.43 m and PBO+FUL was 11.33 m, HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.61-2.09, p = 0.71), with the interaction p value of 0.12. No treatment difference was detected between treatment arms and expression levels of KAT6B (interaction p values of 0.48 and 0.36 in all patients and in those with prior chemo respectively). Potential interaction of KAT6A with other genes including ESR1 will be discussed. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> Low tumor KAT6A mRNA expression identified patients with relatively greater benefit from addition of PAL to FUL especially in those with prior exposure to both chemo- and endocrine therapies. The data support further investigation of KAT6A and its related biomarkers and their association with CDK4\/6 inhibitors and\/or endocrine therapy in HR+\/HER2-breast cancer patients and to test if a KAT6 inhibitor can enhance CDK4\/6 inhibitor and\/or endocrine therapy efficacy in tumors with high KAT6A expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, it remains unknown why some patients (pts) respond more favorably than others. Pre-clinical data suggests that mutations in the <i>MEN1<\/i>, <i>DAXX<\/i>, and\/or <i>ATRX<\/i> genes influence DNA repair capabilities and increase radiation effect in cancer cells. We therefore thought to evaluate the association between response to PRRT and the presence of <i>MEN1<\/i>, <i>DAXX<\/i>, and\/or <i>ATRX<\/i> mutations in patients with GEP-NETs.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively analyzed CLIA certified tissue-based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay results and clinicopathological data from 28 pts with GEP-NETs treated with PRRT at our center from 2017 to 2023. Genetic findings were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Objective response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by investigator review.<br \/>Results: Pts with mutations in <i>MEN1<\/i>, <i>DAXX<\/i>, or <i>ATRX<\/i> (n = 13, 46.42%) had a longer PFS [mPFS, 26.47 months (95% CI, 17.97 - NA) vs. 12.13 months (95% CI, 9.17 - NA); HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06 - 0.68; p = 0.01] than wildtype (n = 15, 53.58%) pts, when adjusted for surgery prior to PRRT and tumor grade.

Among evaluable pts, objective response rate was higher in pts with a mt in <i>MEN1<\/i>, <i>DAXX<\/i>, or <i>ATRX<\/i> compared to wild-type pts (41.67% vs. 15.38%; p = 0.09). In the pancreatic NET (PNET) subset, mutations in either <i>MEN1<\/i>, <i>DAXX<\/i>, or <i>ATRX<\/i> were found in 11\/16 pts (68.75%) and were also associated with a better PFS compared to wild type patients [mPFS, 28.43 months (95% CI, 11.50 - NA) vs. 9.83 months (95% CI, 7.83 - NA); HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 - 0.95; p = 0.04).<br \/>Conclusions: Mutations in <i>MEN1<\/i>\/<i>DAXX<\/i>\/<i>ATRX<\/i> correlate with improved PFS in patients with GEP-NETs receiving PRRT.

However, their significance in tumor biology and oncological outcome is unclear. PDAC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy with intraoperative bile fungal culture were identified (N=40) in a prospective single-institution cohort. Tumor regression scores (TRS) were abstracted from pathology reports and correlated with bile fungal cultures. Bulk tumor RNASeq data were obtained from the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). Tumor microbiome data of non-metastatic PDAC patients with upfront surgery were extracted using the {exotic} tool (Hoyd et al. <i>Cancer Res. Commun.<\/i>, 2023). Gene expression profiles were compared between <i>Candida<\/i>+ and <i>Candida<\/i>- tumors, defined by a cutoff microbial count of 0. Overall survival (OS) of resected PDAC patients with <i>Candida<\/i>+ and <i>Candida<\/i>- tumors was compared using Kaplan Meier survival analysis. From the single-institution PDAC cohort, <i>Candida<\/i>+ bile was associated with poor pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy (Table 1). Using the ORIEN cohort, <i>Candida<\/i> were detected in 67% (106\/158) of the PDAC tumors. Patients with <i>Candida<\/i>+ tumors had worse OS (median 28 vs. 56 months, Log-Rank p&#60;0.008). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Hallmark gene sets showed an enrichment of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) gene set and a reduction of metabolic and DNA repair gene sets in <i>Candida<\/i>+ tumors. GSEA for Immune signature and Tumor Immune Microenvironment Deconvolution (TIMEx) cell types showed an enrichment of Stromal-Fibroblast and EMT signature in <i>Candida<\/i>+ tumors.

PD-L1 expression is typically assessed by pathologist scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue using the tumor cell (TC) score. In this work, we present PD-L1 Quantitative Continuous Scoring (PD-L1 QCS) to digitally assess PD-L1 expression (Ventana SP263 assay), and analyze its utility for identification of patient subgroups with higher likelihood of treatment response.<br \/>Method: 368 digitized whole slide images (WSI) of fresh biopsy and archival samples were obtained from the PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461), including 126 patients who received placebo and 242 patients who received Durvalumab post-cCRT [1]. WSI analysis included two deep learning models for epithelial TC segmentation followed by optical density (OD) quantification of membrane expression [2]. Initially, PD-L1 QCS was calibrated to compute the TC score at 1% cutoff by determining an optimal OD cell positivity threshold. Next, other scoring approaches were investigated, which included various OD thresholds and biomarker cutoffs.<br \/>Results: PD-L1 QCS-based TC scoring was able to maintain median overall survival (mOS) of 57.4 months in the biomarker positive (BM+) ICI cohort, while increasing prevalence to 191 out of 242 patients (78.9%) compared to 177 (73.1%) with manual TC score at 1% cutoff. Extending the scoring paradigm to the PD-L1+ TC density &#62;= 542.5 cells\/mm&#178; lead to a more pronounced increase of prevalence to 200 patients (82.6%) in the ICI population, while mOS was not reached and additionally showed comparable hazard ratios (HR) when evaluating against the BM+ placebo cohort (HR=0.54 [0.39, 0.76] resp. HR=0.52 [0.37, 0.74]). Results further demonstrated that PD-L1 QCS density scoring of the ICI treated population allowed for a clearer separation of patients with less treatment benefit (34.2m mOS, N=42, log rank p=0.0067) compared to manual scoring (47.4m mOS, N=65, log rank p=0.2).<br \/>Conclusion: We investigated a computational pathology approach for selecting patients for treatment with the PACIFIC regimen and compared it against established manual pathology scoring. Results indicate that PD-L1 QCS TC proportion scoring can increase prevalence, while PD-L1 QCS TC density scoring has the potential to identify an even larger patient subgroup with increased survival benefit.<br \/>References: 1.

By identifying and quantifying specific extracellular matrix fragments with neo-epitopes that are generated by proteases specific for T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, respectively, it is possible to develop peripheral biomarkers that reflect the activity of these immune cells. Such biomarkers have previously shown associations with outcome of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here we investigated the distribution of 3 such biomarkers in different cancer indications. Moreover, these data were compared to data from melanoma patients showing associations with response to cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: Tissue-derived biomarkers related to activity of T-cells (C4G: Collagen-4 degraded by Granzyme B), Neutrophils (CPA9-HNE: Calprotectin degraded by neutrophil elastase), Macrophages (VICM: citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin) were measured by validated ELISA\/ECLIA in serum from patients with various solid tumor types (bladder-, breast- colorectal-, head and neck-, kidney-, lung-, ovarian-, pancreatic, stomach-, prostate- cancer, and melanoma, n=220) and compared to age-matched healthy controls (n=33) by ANOVA. The biomarker levels were compared to historical data.<br \/>Results: Median biomarker levels of CPA9HNE (neutrophil activity\/NETosis) and VICM (macrophage activity) were significantly increased in all solid tumor types (p&#60;0.001), respectively and with a ~5-fold inter-patient variation as well. Median C4G levels was only slightly elevated in a few indications (p&#60;0.05) and with a 5-10-fold inter-patient variation across tumor types. All biomarker levels were independent of disease stage. Similar biomarkers levels were seen to those found to be associated with objective response rate and overall survival of melanoma patients treated with cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Tissue-derived peripheral biomarkers that reflect the activity of T-cells (C4G), macrophages (VICM) and neutrophils (CPA9HNE) has biomarker potential in solid tumors and may serve as prognostic, predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in clinical trials investigating cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Serum,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Despite the broader usage of immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis, the response rate and survival of patients remain low for this disease. Redirecting swiftly these patients toward alternative therapeutic strategies upon immunotherapy failure should be a priority. So far, no marker allows to precisely determine early outcome to the treatment.Blood-based biomarkers represent ideal candidates for the development of non-invasive immuno-oncology-based assays. However, to date, no blood biomarker has been validated to predict clinical response to immunotherapy. In this study, we used next generation sequencing (RNAseq) on bulk RNA extracted from whole blood and tumor samples in a pre-clinical MIBC mouse model. We aimed at identifying biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response and to assess the potential application of simple non-invasive blood biomarkers as therapeutic decision-making assay compared to tissue-based biomarkers. We established that circulating immune cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) display highly organ-specific transcriptional responses to ICI. Interestingly, a common lymphocytic activation signature can be identified in both compartments associated with the efficient response to immunotherapy, including a blood specific CD8+ T cell activation\/proliferation signature which predicts immunotherapy response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,Bladder cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

We utilized both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression to evaluate whether various patient clinical factors and serum biomarkers, could serve as predictors of patient response to treatment and overall survival (OS) during ICI therapy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Logistic regression showed that patients with a history of surgery (p=0.003, OR 9.06, 95% CI: (2.17, 37.9)) and no metastasis (p=0.008, OR 7.82, 95% CI: (1.73, 35.4)) exhibited a higher odds of response to ICI treatment. Cox regression analyses demonstrated that pretreatment blood albumin (p=0.003, HR 1.72, 95% CI: (1.21, 2.45)) and derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) (p=0.003, HR 1.71, 95% CI: (1.20-2.44)) were independent predictors for OS in SCLC patients. By establishing a pre-treatment prognostic scoring system based on baseline albumin and dNLR, we found that patients with high albumin and low dNLR exhibited a significantly better prognosis than those with low albumin and high dNLR in both the full (P&#60;.0001, HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20-0.55) and the metastatic cohort (P&#60;.0001, HR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.15-0.51). The better prognostic group also had younger age, higher BMI and lower systemic inflammatory biomarker values than the unfavorable group (P&#60;.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our data reveals the significant role of metastasis status and treatment history in predicting the initial response of SCLC patients to ICI treatment. However, baseline serum albumin and dNLR provide a more precise prognostic prediction for patient OS. The scoring system based on albumin and dNLR enhances the ability to stratify patient prognosis and holds the potential to guide clinical decision-making for SCLC patients undergoing ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Predictive biomarkers,Efficacy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

Current methods such as NGS are costly and challenging to interpret, while PCR assays are limited in the number of variants they can cover.&nbsp; We developed ASPYRE&#174; (Allele-Specific PYrophosphorolysis REaction) technology to address the urgent need for rapid, accessible and affordable diagnostics informing actionable genomic target variants of a given cancer.&nbsp; The targeted ASPYRE-Lung&#174; panel for NSCLC covers 114 variants in 11 genes (<i>ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, RET, ROS1, MET &#38; NTRK1\/2\/3<\/i>) to robustly inform clinical management, based on practice guidelines. The assay detects single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and gene fusions from tissue-derived DNA and RNA simultaneously. We tested the limit of detection, specificity, analytical accuracy and analytical precision of ASPYRE-Lung using FFPE lung tissue samples from patients with NSCLC, variant-negative FFPE tissue from tonsil tissue, and FFPE-based contrived samples with controllable variant allele fractions. The sensitivity of ASPYRE-Lung was determined to be &#8804; 3% variant allele fraction for single nucleotide variants and insertions or deletions, &#8804; 100 copies for fusions, and &#8804; 200 copies for MET exon 14 skipping. The specificity was 100% with no false positive results. The analytical accuracy test yielded no discordant variants between ASPYRE-Lung and orthogonal testing (targeted enrichment NGS) or contrived samples, and results were replicable across operators, reagent lots, runs, and real-time PCR instruments with a high degree of precision. The technology is simple and fast, requiring only four reagent transfer steps using standard laboratory equipment (PCR and qPCR instruments) with analysis via a cloud-based analysis algorithm. ASPYRE-Lung has the potential to be transformative in facilitating access to rapid, actionable molecular profiling of tissue for patients with NSCLC.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Biomarkers,FFPE,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

The G1 and S phase checkpoint allows for repair of damaged DNA, preventing damaged DNA from being copied. The G2 and M phase checkpoint prevents transmission of mutated DNA to the next generation. This pathway, along with mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and base excision repair (BER), is being actively researched to assess its role in cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: Sixty-two patients participated in this study. These patients were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced biliary tract cancers (BTCs) from Mar. 2020 to Aug. 2022 at Samsung Medical Center. DNACHK mutations were defined as genomic alterations such as SNVs, MNVs, and short insertion and deletions in seven genes These genes include checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), BRCA1, DNA repair associated (BRCA1), the serine\/threonine kinase ATM, the serine\/threonine kinase ATR, and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1). We analyzed the effect of DNACHK mutations on the efficacy of ICIs in advanced BTCs.<br \/>Results: Patient median age at diagnosis was 68.0 years. Ten patients (16.1%) had gall bladder (GB) cancer; the remaining patients (n = 52, 83.9%) were diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Among the 62 patients with advanced BTCs treated with ICIs, 37 (59.7%) were categorized into the DNACHK wild-type (WT) group and 25 (40.3%) into the DNACHK mutated (MT) group. The most observed DNA checkpoint mutations were ATM mutations (n=14). MDC1 mutations were found in seven patients, ATR mutations in three, BRCA1 mutations in four, and CHEK2 mutations in three. Patients in the DNACHK MT group had better disease control rates than patients in the DNACHK WT group (60.0% vs. 48.6%, p=0.53). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.1, 22.8) in the MT group and 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.1, 11.0) in the WT group (p=0.33).<br \/>Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the DNACHK pathway may be a valuable source of biomarkers for ICI and worthy of further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,DNA double-strand break repair genes,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The enzyme is highly cell cycle dependent and correlates with cell growth state. Numerous studies have consistently shown elevated TK activity (TKa) in the blood of patients with solid tumors and active disease. DiviTum&#174; TKa, a clinically and analytically validated FDA cleared assay, measures and quantifies TKa in serum or plasma in humans and animals. TKa as a biomarker offers valuable information at all stages of drug development, from drug efficacy and dose response studies in cell culture and xenograft models, to patient selection and treatment monitoring in clinical trials. The launch of FDA Project Optimus highlights the need for new biomarkers to assist in drug development to identify optimal dose. Using TKa to measure the impact on cell proliferation as a drug evaluation endpoint can confirm mechanism of action efficacy and a minimally effective dose of a new compound rather than a maximally tolerated dose. TKa can be used as a pharmacodynamic tool to improve study endpoints. TKa data in cultured cells and mouse xenografts demonstrates that a complete shutdown of tumor cell proliferation can be observed well before and at much lower drug-doses than when cell death or toxicity is used as the dose determination endpoint. Increased dosing of CDK4\/6 inhibitors demonstrates immediate impact on TKa levels in cell lines and provides signals of drug effect at doses where cell viability is unaffected. After initiation of samuraciclib treatment, a CDK7 inhibitor, a significant reduction in TKa levels in blood from metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients was observed, indicating inhibition of cell cycle progression. For patients on samuraciclib therapy and with stable disease before progression, TKa levels were significantly lower than pre-treatment (p=0.0038). Post-progression TKa levels increased to significantly higher levels than during therapy including the last sample measured before progression (p=0.014). Baseline blood TKa levels are predictive for progression free survival (PFS) allowing for the early stratification of patients with long vs short PFS. In patients with MBC, TKa levels during the first treatment cycle are strongly predictive for PFS. Suppressed TKa levels after 2 and 4 weeks of CDK4\/6 inhibitor therapy predict longer PFS than high TKa levels at the same time points (HR 5.65; p&#60; 0.0001). MBC patients monitored &#62;3 months and showing low TKa levels have very low likelihood of progression within 30- to 60 days, &#60;2% and &#60;6%, respectively. TKa is a translational liquid biomarker that bridges results between preclinical and clinical studies, providing fundamental information for drug development decision making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,CDK inhibitor,Thymidine kinase,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

These scans are highly effective for the staging of the disease but in terms of follow-up, there are several limitations including the inability to detect minimal residual disease (MRD). Circulating biomarkers are a viable solution to overcome these limitations, and this study sought to investigate a panel of melanoma-specific microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers in stage IV patients undergoing therapy. This panel had previously been assessed in treatment na&#239;ve stage IV patients, with members of the MELmiR-7 panel able to detect an increase in tumor burden in 100% of cases, as well as the ability to define overall survival (OS) superior to serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and S100B levels (delta log-likelihood = 11, p&#60; 0.001). In this multi-center longitudinal study, bloods were drawn from study participants from 2013-2015, with clinical follow-up until October 2018. The expression levels of the MELmiR-7 panel were assessed in serially collected serum (&#8805;3 timepoints; &#8805;2-month intervals) collected from a total of 23 melanoma patients, treated with BRAF\/MEK inhibitors and\/or anti-CTLA4 and\/or anti-PD-1. The goal was to determine if the panel could predict treatment success\/failure, as well as patient OS, if treated with the same therapy. All miRNA panel members were measured using a sensitive real-time PCR assay at each time point, but only miR-4731 gave stable expression over the course of the therapy, with other panel members fluctuating post treatment. The stability of miR-4731 expression over time indicated that this marker was not affected by treatment type, rather changes in its expression were reflective of disease progression\/regression (as determined by radiological images), thus making it an ideal biomarker. Importantly, across the cohort of 23 patients, miR-4731 expression had the ability to predict treatment outcome (Complete Response\/Stable Disease (n=12) vs Melanoma Death (n=11)) for patients at &#8805;2 months post therapy vs baseline, with a high degree of precision (Mann Whitney, 2-tailed; p=0.0004). Area under the curve analysis also found miR-4731 expression to be highly sensitive and specific (AUC=0.91; p=0.0009) at predicting overall survival (OS). Furthermore, in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, participants with high serum expression (&#8805;2 months post therapy vs baseline) of miR-4731, had poor OS (p=0.0045; 14-month median survival) as compared with low serum miRNA expression which was predictive of a positive prognosis. In sum, assessment of this miRNA marker during therapy would permit early on-treatment prediction of patient outcomes, independent of imaging, to either continue to treat with current regimen, or to switch treatment modalities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"T.

Since targeted therapeutic options are limited, we developed small molecule compounds to block activation (GTP loading) of the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Rac and Cdc42 are ideal molecular targets due to their regulation of cell migration, proliferation, invasion, and signaling in cancer and immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our lead compound MBQ-167 is a dual Rac and Cdc42 inhibitor with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~100 nM for inhibition of Rac\/Cdc42 activation and the phosphorylation of their common downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK). MBQ-167 is highly effective in mouse models of breast cancer metastasis and is currently undergoing a Phase I clinical trial in advanced breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate potential target molecules that can be used as biomarkers predictive of Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor efficacy. We recently published that in addition to inhibiting the growth and migration of breast and pancreatic cancer cells, MBQ-167 inhibits macrophage cell migration, immunosuppressive myeloid cell activation and release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with cancer. Transcriptomic data of tumors from mice treated with vehicle or MBQ-167 identified a number of immunomodulatory pathways downregulated by MBQ-167, including IL-6 and S100A family signaling, and Chitinase 3-like (CHI3L1\/CHI4L1) genes coding for the human YKL-40 protein. We tested for the activation status of PAK (phospho (p)-PAK) as a diagnostic marker for Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor efficacy using breast cancer patient tissue in <i>ex vivo<\/i> culture treated with vehicle or MBQ-167 and found decreased p-PAK staining following immunohistochemistry of MBQ-167-treated tissue. From flow cytometry, using Alexa-488-tagged anti p-PAK antibody, we found that p-PAK was reduced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following MBQ-167. ELISA assays for YKL-40\/CHI3L1 proteins after treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines and macrophage-like cells with Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitors show that MBQ-167 and the derivative MBQ-168 reduced CHI3L1 levels from conditioned media. These results demonstrate the potential of p-PAK and YKL-40\/CHI3L1 from blood as biomarkers for Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor efficacy. This study impacts pharmacodynamic biomarker design for the planned Phase 2 clinical trials for MBQ-167 in breast and pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Rac,Cdc42,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

There has been no obvious biomarker that contributes to the selection of a therapeutic agent among new-generation androgen receptor-axis targeted (ARAT) therapy, such as abiraterone (ABI) or enzalutamide (ENZ). We aimed to assess the possibility of using COMT expression as a biomarker for PCa progression and the criteria for selecting ABI or ENZ.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 60 patients with PCa treated with ABI or ENZ via needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy. Immunostaining of COMT was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks obtained from the initial prostate biopsy for diagnosis or prostatectomy. Immunostaining evaluations were scored by immunostaining intensity (0-3) and staining area (0-3), and the total score &#8805;4 was defined as \"high expression\" and the total score &#60;4 was defined as \"low expression.&#8221; The associations between COMT expression levels and clinical outcomes, including the duration of ENZ or ABI response, were also assessed.<br \/>Results: Of the 60 cases, nine (15%) showed low expression of COMT. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with lower COMT expression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.83, P= 0.024). When ENZ was administered as the first ARAT, progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different between patients with COMT expression scores &#60;4 and &#8805;4 (median 5.9 and 23.3 months, respectively). However, when ABI was administered as the first ARAT, there was no significant difference in the PFS of ARAT between COMT expression scores &#60;4 and &#8805;4.<br \/>Conclusion: Patients with lower COMT expression have a significantly poorer prognosis for PCa. In addition, PFS after ENZ administration, as the first ARAT, correlated with COMT expression levels. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between COMT expression and the duration of ARAT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Enzalutamide,Overall survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Especially abemaciclib has been implicated in multiple mechanisms of action including cell cycle arrest, senescence. In addition, immunomodulatory effects have been suggested but are not yet clear. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical relevance of abemaciclib to systemic immune status by examining the status of peripheral immune cells in patients with MBC who received abemaciclib plus ET.<br \/>Methods: Patients with MBC who were treated with abemaciclib plus ET in our hospital were included in this study. Response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1. Peripheral blood at the initiation of abemaciclib treatment, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24weeks after abemaciclib treatment initiation were analyzed using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Changes of cellular densities of each immune cell and survival by immune cell density were analyzed without calculating p values because of small sample number.<br \/>Results: Twenty patients were enrolled, among whom 14 and 6 received an aromatase inhibitor and fulvestrant, respectively, as concomitant ET. 7 premenopausal patients received an LH-RH analogue.<br \/>The analysis of serial blood collection showed an increase in CD8-positive T cell density by 12.5% and conversely a decrease in monocyte density by 52.3% at 4 weeks after treatment initiation. In responders (N = 10), an increase of the ratio between CD8-positive T cell density and Treg density (CD8\/Treg) at 4 weeks after the treatment initiation were observed (65.2%), while not in non-responders (7.3%).<br \/>In the analysis of the blood samples at the treatment initiation, lower Treg density and lower NK density at treatment initiation indicated longer PFS than the counterparts (median PFS for Treg: low, not reached; high, 8.8 months; for NK: low, not reached; high, 8.8 months).<br \/>Conclusion: An increase of CD8\/Treg at 4 weeks after the treatment initiation was associated with a good response in patients with HR-positive HER2-negative MBC treated with abemaciclib plus ET. Our results suggest an association between systemic immune status and clinical outcome in MBC patients who received abemaciclib plus ET treatment.

During blood collection and sample storage, <i>ex vivo<\/i> platelet activation, hemolysis, and blood cell degradation can occur, which causes the release of blood cell-secreted proteins into the plasma. The contamination of these proteins may confound true <i>in vivo <\/i>levels of plasma proteins of interest, resulting in inaccurate or inconsistent assay results. Protein Plus BCT is a new blood collection tube that maintains accurate plasma protein levels during ambient whole blood storage.<br \/>Methods: Blood samples from self-proclaimed healthy donors were drawn into Protein Plus BCT, EDTA, and ACD-A tubes. All the samples were stored at ambient temperature for up to 5 days. Plasma was isolated using a general double-spin protocol and frozen at -80 &#176;C until use. Plasma levels of protein biomarkers were measured by Ella Simple Plex Assays (Bio-Techne) and Luminex xMAP&#174; Technology Assays (Bio-Techne, samples tested by LuminexPLORE Lab) following manufacturers&#8217; dilution and processing recommendations.<br \/>Results: Over 50 key plasma proteins like cytokines, cancer, and immuno-oncology checkpoint markers in samples collected into Protein Plus BCT were analyzed by immunoassays and compared side-by-side to those collected in EDTA and ACD-A tubes. EDTA and ACD-A samples exhibited a substantial elevation in the plasma concentration of many, such as IL-8, IL-1&#946;, HGF, VEGF, MMP-9, CCL5\/RANTES and TGF-&#946;1 post draw, indicating platelet activation and blood cell degradation during ambient temperature storage. Samples collected into Protein Plus BCT displayed limited <i>ex vivo<\/i> platelet activation and minimal contamination by blood cell-secreted proteins, maintaining the draw-time plasma levels of proteins of interest for up to 5 days in whole blood at ambient temperature.<br \/>Conclusions: The novel Protein Plus BCT maintains draw-time plasma protein levels during extended whole blood storage at room temperature by limiting <i>ex vivo<\/i> platelet activation, hemolysis, and blood cell degradation. Protein Plus BCT ensures sample integrity and minimizes preanalytical variables, providing cancer researchers and clinical assay developers greater flexibility in sample handling and improved confidence in downstream plasma protein analysis.

Over-expression of HSP90 client proteins has been implicated in paclitaxel resistance, therefore, it was hypothesized that the potent HSP90 inhibitor onalespib could improve paclitaxel efficacy. As TNBCs are a heterogenous population of tumors, it is important to establish biomarkers of response to this treatment combination.<br \/>Methods: Patients with TNBC were treated with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel and IV onalespib at doses ranging from 120 mg\/m2 to 260 mg\/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle utilizing a standard 3+3 design. The primary objectives were to determine dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary objectives included determination of overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Retrospectively, archival tumor tissue was obtained from study patients and processed for RNA expression analysis by NanoString nCounter platform with the Breast Cancer 360 panel. Post-hoc gene expression analysis was performed through Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Linear models were employed to detect differential expression between conditions while considering cartridge effect.<br \/>Results: 31 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 90% received prior taxane therapy. The established recommended phase II dose was 260 mg\/m2 onalespib when given with 80 mg\/m2 paclitaxel. ORR was 20%, median DOR was 5.6 months. Three patients achieved complete responses (CR), all of whom had received prior taxane therapy. Nanostring profiling analysis revealed that patients who had a CR to treatment expressed higher levels of several breast cancer-associated genes also known to be dependent upon HSP90 activity compared to patients with progressive disease (PD) as their best treatment response. These genes include FGFR4, JAK2, PIK3R1, TGFB3, and TGFBR2 (all p&#60;0.05). Tumor genes overexpressed in patients with PD versus CR included IRF6, MMP7, and KRT17 (all p&#60;0.01). Additionally, IPA showed patients with CR to have substantial upregulation of PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, p53, HER2, and cyclin\/cell cycle regulatory signaling pathways compared to patients with PD (all p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Combination treatment with onalespib and paclitaxel had an acceptable toxicity profile and showed anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced TNBC. Gene expression analysis of patient tumor samples suggest that TNBCs with greater activation of immune checkpoint pathways and those with proteins dependent on HSP90 activity, including p53 and HER2, may be more susceptible to HSP90 inhibition.<br \/>ClinicalTrials.gov study identification: NCT02474173","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Therapeutics,Heat shock proteins,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression plays a key role in the prognosis of HER2+ breast cancer (BC). While HER2 is well-established as a cell surface marker, its soluble extracellular domain (ECD) in serum has gained attention as a potential prognostic biomarker. Elevated levels of HER2 ECD (&#62;15ng\/ml) have been associated with a poor outcome. However only a small percentage of primary BC patients have levels of HER2 ECD &#62;15ng\/ml. Research has suggested that HER2 targeted therapies can influence the rate of HER2 ECD shedding. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between circulating HER2 ECD levels with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic HER2+ BC.<br \/>Methods: Matched Pre and post treatment serum samples (n=25) from BC patients enrolled in TH V THL (ICORG (CTRIAL-IE) 11-10\/NCT01526369) clinical trial were assessed. Human ErbB2 (HER2) ELISA Kit (Invitrogen) was used to detect levels of soluble HER2 ECD in the serum. Serum levels were stratified as Low (&#60;300pg\/ml n=5), Intermediate (300-700pg\/ml n=10) or High (&#62;700pg\/ml n=10). Patient data correlation was used to assess PFS and OS, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed based on the serum levels of HER2 ECD. Significance p values were determined using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.<br \/>Results: Levels of HER2 ECD detected (94-1730pg\/ml) did not exceed 15ng\/ml for any sample. There was no significant difference in HER2 ECD levels between treatment arms (TH vs. THL) for PFS (p=0.4685) or OS (p=0.1376). There was no change between the pre and post treatment HER2 ECD serum levels in the samples tested (p=0.344). However, when pre-treatment samples were stratified based on Low, Intermediate or High HER2 ECD levels, there was a significant increase in PFS for patients in the High cohort. Median PFS increased from 8.31 months in the Low cohort to 13.57 months in the Intermediate cohort. The median PFS increased further to 22.24 months in the High cohort (Log rank p=0.0197). The same parameters were applied for the analysis of OS, which also improved as the level of HER2 ECD increased. Median OS increased from 35.19 months (Low) to 68.7 months (Intermediate), with a Median OS not reached for the High cohort (Log rank p=0.077).<br \/>Conclusions: Patients with HER2 ECD levels above 700pg\/ml display a survival advantage in this limited study. Further validation and prospective studies are warranted to fully establish the clinical utility of HER2 ECD as a biomarker in metastatic HER2+ BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HER2\/neu,Serum,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Whole slides were stained with the 14-plex antibody panel, coverslip mounted with ArgoFluor&#8482; Mounting Medium and cured overnight. Whole slides were imaged at 20X using the Orion&#8482; spatial biology platform.

Data revealed a distinction between hepatocytes highlighted in the autofluorescence channel, sinusoids filled with proliferating progenitor cell and macrophages, and epithelial cells lining the border of the fetal liver forming the ductal plate surrounding the portal vein. Whereas in HCC, imaging revealed autofluorescent hepatocytes obliterating the sinusoids with some hepatocytes dividing, an extensive capillary network, and red bloods cells also highlighted in the auto fluorescent channel. T cells and macrophages showed clustering within the capillary networks and as expected, hepatocytes expressed high levels of Albumin. In the CRC liver metastasis sample, hepatocytes were shown to be surrounded by T cells, neoplastic glands (PanCK), and CD163<sup>+<\/sup>FOLR2<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages. Furthermore, the majority of the metastatic epithelial cancer cells were observed to be proliferating.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> We were able to observe precise differences in the tissue architecture of liver samples from three divergent sources. Specifically, the ability to identify distinct cell subtypes and their spatial co-localization may provide mechanistic insights into the spatial immune landscape and its role in disease progression and treatment outcome.

Here we investigate a sample of invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma using whole slide, single-step high-plex staining and imaging at single-cell resolution followed by quantitative analysis.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b> <\/b>The slide was stained in one round with a 17-plex immune-oncology panel then imaged in one round with the Orion<sup>&#8482;<\/sup> spatial biology platform. Quantitative analysis was performed on the resulting TIFF file using the following pipeline:- Manually annotate regions of interest (ROI) on the tissue- Segment whole slide images into cells with UnMICST and S3segmenter - Import mask and clean data in QuPath - Generate primary feature data table with QuPath - Classify cells into populations in QuPath - Generate spatial biomarkers - Compare cell populations and their spatial interactions in the different ROIs.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Data revealed a distinction between normal colonic epithelium, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with immune cell collection, and an infiltrating border of the carcinoma. Differences in immune cell content and spatial organization were measured, and the infiltrating border found to contrast with other tumor regions by showing a lower proliferative fraction (Ki-67, nuclear) and differences in E-cadherin and cytokeratin expression patterns.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>These data highlight the importance of sufficient plex, resolution and whole slide context to derive reliable spatial biomarkers of potential prognostic value. Further, hours vs. days speed for whole-section multiplexed biomarker quantitation, along with same-section conventional chromogenic analysis, makes this approach suited to multi-patient clinical studies.<br \/><sup>1<\/sup> JR Lin et al., High-plex immunofluorescence imaging and traditional histology of the same tissue section for discovering image-based biomarkers, Nat Cancer, 4, 1036-1052 (2023).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.
