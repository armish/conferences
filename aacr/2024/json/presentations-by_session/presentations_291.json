[{"Abstract":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will claim the lives of ~60,000 female patients in the US in 2023. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a subtype of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that comprises ~30% of NSCLC and is characterized by high metabolic activity. Specifically, LUSC typically exhibits elevated rates of both glucose and glutamine metabolism driven by the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and KEAP1\/NRF2 pathways. Further, a paucity of identifiable genetic drivers in LUSC has resulted in a lack of effective targeted therapies for patients with this devastating disease. Despite recent advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced NSCLC is 6%, underscoring the need for better treatment options. Importantly, no significant sex bias is seen in the newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer (~50%M\/~50%F) (American Cancer Society, 2023), yet there are no sex-specific therapeutic approaches in clinical use. We demonstrated that the catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitor TAK228 can be utilized to effectively treat LUSC tumors via inhibition of glycolysis, an approach that is currently being evaluated on two phase I\/II clinical trials (NCT02417701, NCT04250545), launched as a direct result of our pre-clinical work. However, our pre-clinical data suggests that despite the potential benefit of TAK228 inhibition in LUSC, a subset of tumors are resistant to TAK228 despite on-target activity of mTOR inhibitor, leading to the rationale of the current hypothesis, namely the possibility that sex-specific differential effects of TAK228 may exist. To evaluate this hypothesis, we have generated preliminary data demonstrating that sex is a determinant of TAK228 response in LUSCs, whereby male mice are significantly more sensitive to mTOR inhibition than females. Follow-on experiments have demonstrated that the anti-estrogen therapy (Letrozole) sensitized previously resistant female mice bearing LUSCs to TAK228, suggesting an estrogen-related link to TAK228 resistance in females. Additionally, RNASeq and biochemical analyses identified pathways that are upregulated in TAK228 resistant female mice with LUSC tumors. These results suggest that the estrogen may play a key role in the observed pattern of female resistance to mTOR inhibition. As such, the goal of the current proposal is to evaluate the catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitor TAK228, in combination with anti-estrogen therapy as a therapeutic strategy to treat LUSC in females. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,mTOR,Estrogen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Despite the efficacious breakthrough and improved patient outcomes, disease progresses once more due to the seemingly inevitable development of drug resistance in tumor cells. This poses a considerable predicament in the clinical management of oncogene-mutated NSCLC and signifies the importance of elucidating the mechanism of resistance in tumor cells that harbor these genomic alterations which give rise to oncogenic drivers. Recent evidence suggests that drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, which are tolerant to initial exposure to TKIs give rise to acquired drug-resistant cells. Currently, the mechanism by which tumor cells undergo a drug-tolerant state is not well understood in NSCLCs driven by <i>ALK<\/i> or <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion. Previously, we identified <i>CD74<\/i> as a gene that may play a role in a drug-tolerant state in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutated lung cancer via single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Here, we sought to determine whether the CD74 signaling also leads to resistance to TKIs in NSCLCs with <i>ALK<\/i> or <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion. We showed that CD74 expression increased at both the mRNA and protein levels after treatment with respective TKIs in <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion cells lines. Notably, the <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion cell lines also exhibited an increase in mRNA expression levels of upstream and downstream genes of CD74. Additionally, we generated CD74 knock-out and overexpression models in two cells lines, HCC78 (<i>SLC34A2-ROS1<\/i> fusion) and H2228 (<i>EML4&#8211;ALK<\/i> fusion), to further examine the role of CD74 expression in DTP cells. We demonstrated that resistance to TKIs were dependent on CD74 expression. Furthermore, it was determined that anti-CD74 antibody-drug conjugates, in combination with TKIs, synergistically induced apoptosis in these cell lines. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD74 can be a therapeutic target in NSCLC with <i>ALK<\/i> or <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ROS1,ALK,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

In our previous studies, we found that antiangiogenetic therapy had certain advantages for patients with Ex20ins in the real-world practice. Previous research showed the tumor microenvironment has been associated with resistance to targeted therapy in sensitive mutations. However, the mechanism of resistance of EGFR-TKIs and the advantage of antiangiogenetic therapy in patients with EGFR Ex20ins were still unclear.<br \/>Methods: In this study, patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del), exon 21 p.L858R (21L858R), and Ex20ins were collected to identify the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. Stable cell lines expressing were established and used to compare signaling pathway activation. Matrigel angiogenesis assay was conducted in different cell lines. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of various treatments combined with antiangiogenetic agents or not in mouse models.<br \/>Results: We collected 23 patients with EGFR sensitive mutations and Ex20ins, respectively, and found Ex20ins presented primary resistance to TKIs and poor survival outcomes. Based on the RNA sequence of stable cell lines, it was found that Ex20ins had a higher level of VEGFA expression and enriched in MAPK pathway compared to EGFR 19del and 21L858R. Immunohistochemical studies also revealed that a higher level of VEGFA expression was observed in a cohort of NSCLC patients with Ex20ins mutation compared with 19del or L858R. Matrigel angiogenesis assay has shown consistent result that Ex20ins promoted angiogenesis <i>in vivo.<\/i> Further experiments in mouse models identified that in the group of Osimertinib, mobocertinib alone, chemotherapy alone, mobocertinib or chemotherapy combination with bevacizumab, Osimertinib achieved the worst efficacy and additional utility of antiangiogenetic agents had a more favorable efficacy.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of VEGFA as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and induces immunosuppression microenvironment in NSCLC with Ex20ins.

Individuals with surgically unresectable stage four CRC have a five-year overall survival rate of 13%. Targeting of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), EGF receptor (EGFR) with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab) is approved for use in wild-type (WT) KRAS\/NRAS\/BRAF (RAS\/RAF) advanced CRC. However, these antibodies as a single agent have response rates of 12-17% and expected progression-free survivals of only 3-4 months. Accordingly, resistance may be present at the outset (de novo resistance) or develop during treatment (acquired resistance). Here, we report the identification of an EGFR ectodomain missense mutation acquired <i>in vitro<\/i> in response to treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab. Using 2D and 3D drug sensitivity assays, our results demonstrate that this EGFR ectodomain mutation in addition to being resistant to cetuximab and panitumumab, also could not be targeted by the oligoclonal antibody cocktail MM-151. To determine whether this EGFR ectodomain mutation is necessary and sufficient to impart cetuximab resistance, we engineered CRC lines to inducibly overexpress mutant EGFR and showed that this was sufficient to induce cetuximab resistance. Further structural, and functional characterization is underway for this ectodomain mutation that confers resistance to cetuximab and will be shared during the meeting. These findings necessitate the need for additional treatment strategies for a subset of subjects with mCRC who do not respond to treatment with cetuximab\/panitumumab and MM-151.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cetuximab,EGFR,Cancer,Colorectal,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

How therapies alter this post- translational cancer hallmark and the consequences thereof remain elusive. Here, we show that an elevated secretome fucosylation is a pan-cancer signature of both response and resistance to multiple targeted therapies. Large-scale pharmacogenomics revealed that fucosylation genes display widespread association with resistance to these therapies. In cancer cell cultures, xenograft mouse models, and patients, targeted kinase inhibitors distinctively induced core fucosylation of secreted proteins less than 60 kDa. Label-free proteomics of N-glycoproteomes identified fucosylation of the antioxidant PON1 as a critical component of the therapy-induced secretome (TIS). N-glycosylation of TIS and target core fucosylation of PON1 are mediated by the fucose salvage-FUT8-SLC35C1 axis with PON3 directly modulating GDP-Fuc transfer on PON1 scaffolds. Core fucosylation in the Golgi impacts PON1 stability and folding prior to secretion, promoting a more degradation-resistant PON1. Global secretome and PON1-specific de-N-glycosylation both limited the expansion of resistant clones in a tumor regression model. We defined the resistance-associated transcription factors (TFs) and genes modulated by the N-glycosylated TIS via a focused and transcriptome-wide analyses. In a spontaneous lung metastasis mouse model, global secretome and PON1-specific core fucosylation functionally drive hypoxia and hypoxic selection of drug-resistant clones. Our findings demonstrate that core fucosylation is a common modification indirectly induced by targeted therapies that paradoxically promotes resistance and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Targeted therapy,Hypoxia,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

As a result, androgen signaling inhibitors (ASIs) like abiraterone and enzalutamide (ENZ) have emerged as the first-line treatment for CRPC. Nevertheless, the limited success of ASIs underscores the urgency of developing new approaches for managing CRPC patients who have become unresponsive to ASIs. Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a tumor suppressor, which is frequently down-regulated during PCa progression. It has been shown that reduced Pdcd4 expression promotes both AR-dependent and AR-independent growth in PCa. In this study, we found that down-regulation of Pdcd4 led to acquisition of ENZ resistance in PCa. We also observed that down-regulation of Pdcd4 resulted in activation of mTORC2 activity. Additionally, knockdown of Rictor, a component of mTORC2 complex, enhanced sensitivity to ENZ treatment in PCa. These findings suggested that activation of mTORC2 due to Pdcd4 loss contributes to ASI resistance in PCa. To understand how Pdcd4 is down-regulated in the PCa, we identified that polo-like kinase (Plk1) phosphorylated Pdcd4 at Ser239. Phosphorylation of Pdcd4 by Plk1 led to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Pdcd4. Over-expression of the phosphomimic Pdcd4(S239D) in 22Rv1 cells promoted tumor cell growth in cultured cells and mice. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting Plk1\/Pdcd4\/mTORC2 signaling axis holds promise as a strategy to overcome ENZ resistance in PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,mTORC2,Pdcd4,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

After surgical resection of GBM, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) are used as treatment modalities to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most cytotoxic and lethal form of DNA damage. However, an inadequate oxygen supply and the high metabolic demand in rapidly growing solid tumors like GBM result in severe hypoxic regions, contributing to altered cellular metabolism and resistance to these cancer therapies. These subpopulations of resistant and refractory hypoxic cancer cells are clinically significant as they lead to poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes in patients. Ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutics such as temozolomide induce DNA damage, such as base deletions, single-strand breaks (SSBs), and DSBs. Rapidly replicating cells are more sensitive to these therapeutic agents partly due to replication-induced conversion of SSB and other manageable damages to highly lethal DSB. A balanced deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is crucial for DNA replication, repair, and maintenance of genomic stability. Cellular dNTP is mainly regulated by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and the SAM- and HD-domain-containing protein (SAMHD1). RNR boosts the cellular dNTP pool through the <i>de novo<\/i> synthesis, while SAMHD1 depletes the pool by hydrolyzing dNTPs. Also, previous studies have shown that hypoxic cancer cells have low dNTP levels due to oxygen dependency of its rate-limiting RNR enzyme, which could result in reduced DNA replication and cell cycle arrest. Here, we show the direct relationships between dNTP levels, DNA replication, and DSB induction in hypoxic GBM cancer cells, which is currently unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, we exposed GBM cells to severe hypoxia and utilized cellular dNTP analysis to demonstrate that their dNTP pool can be elevated. Our results show that elevating the cellular dNTP pool relieved hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest as determined by flow cytometry and increased their DNA replication.

Furthermore, we detected an increased efficacy of DSB-inducing agents in hypoxic GBM, as demonstrated by apoptosis pathway activation.

EAC, known for its aggressive nature and limited response to therapy, exhibits a disheartening 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Overcoming drug resistance remains a pressing challenge in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes for EAC patients. Previous studies from our team have unveiled that exposure to ABS leads to the overexpression of Apurinic\/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1), which orchestrates various oncogenic pathways in EAC cells. In this study, we delve into the influence of ABS in driving APE1-redox-mediated activation of the SOX9 pathway, thus contributing to the chemoresistance observed in EAC. To identify the enrichment of the SOX9 pathway and the heightened downstream target genes in EAC, we analyzed RNA sequencing data and public databases. Cell models, patient tissue arrays, pL2-IL1&#946; transgenic mice, and de-identified xenografts derived from EAC patients (PDXs) were employed to investigate the signaling axis of APE1-redox-SOX9 in oxaliplatin resistance of EAC. Our analysis of public databases unveiled a significant enrichment of the SOX9 pathway in EAC patients. RNA sequencing data from EAC cells exposed to ABS, with or without APE1-knockdown, suggested APE1's involvement in the GERD-activated SOX9 signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry staining of human patient tissue arrays, along with immunofluorescent staining of L2-IL1&#223; transgenic mice, confirmed the co-overexpression of APE1, SOX9, and ALDH1A1 in EAC. Furthermore, APE1 silencing led to the downregulation of SOX9 and exhibited synergistic effects with oxaliplatin in chemo-resistant EAC cells. Mechanistically, we uncovered that APE1's redox function is crucial for AKT-GSK3&#223;-mediated SOX9 stability. Treatment with the APE1-redox-specific inhibitor, APX2009, sensitized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors to oxaliplatin by repressing SOX9-regulated chemoresistance genes. This study sheds light on a novel signaling axis involving APE1-redox-AKT-GSK3&#223;-SOX9 in Barrett&#8217;s carcinogenesis. The pharmacological inhibition of APE1-redox function presents itself as a promising therapeutic approach to target the previously intractable SOX9 signals, potentially overcoming chemoresistance in EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,APE1,SOX9,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

CK2 phosphorylates the tumor suppressor IKZF1 (IKAROS) resulting in a loss-of DNA-binding activity. Loss of IKZF1 function is associated with poor prognosis in high-risk B-ALL. As such, inhibition of CK2 using silmitasertib (CX-4945), to restore IKZF1 function, is being therapeutically investigated in high-risk B-ALL. CK2 also phosphorylates\/activates the mammalian ceramide synthases to increase production of the pro-apoptotic sphingolipid, ceramide (Cer). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of CK2 with CX-4945 would exert both pro-death (restoration of IKAROS function) and pro-survival (decreased Cer production) effects on B-ALL cells. Moreover, this suggests that targeting the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in tandem with CX-4945 could be a novel strategy for treatment of high-risk B-ALL. To this end, we examined the effects of CX-4945 on sphingolipid levels and the enzymes of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Unexpectedly, we determined that CX-4945 dose-dependently increased expression of ceramide synthase 1 (CERS1) and acid ceramidase (AC) proteins, in an IKZF1 dependent manner. Increased CERS1 expression\/production of C18:0 Cer has been linked to enhanced mitophagy (i.e., lysosomal clearance of damaged mitochondria) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Induction of mitophagy by CX-4945 was confirmed by western blot analysis of mitofusin-1 and Drp-1 levels. Up-regulation of AC, a lysosomal protein, metabolizes C18:0 Cer to sphingosine for recycling and prevents Cer-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Thus, induction of mitophagy and metabolic breakdown of Cer could potentially reduce the apoptotic efficacy of CX-4945 in B-ALL cell lines. We, therefore, tested whether inhibition of AC would synergize with CX-4945 to enhance B-ALL cell death. Indeed, synergy was observed with the AC inhibitor, SACLAC, in multiple cell lines. Consistent with the observation of synergy between CX-4945 and SACLAC, the combination also enhanced cleavage of PARP indicating an enhancement of cell death. We are currently testing the efficacy of a combination of CX-4945 and AC inhibitors in cell-line derived xenograft models of human B-ALL. Together, these findings indicate that simultaneous targeting of CK2 and AC represents a rationally selected combinatorial therapeutic strategy that overcomes the ability of cancer cells to adapt to single agent targeted therapies by altering pro- and\/or anti-apoptotic pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-04 Regulation of gene expression in drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ceramide,CK2,IKAROS,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

More than 70% of patients are diagnosed with locoregionally advanced NPC (LA-NPC) at initial presentation, and the addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended for these patients. However, chemoresistance is a main reason for treatment failure in NPC patients, and the exact regulatory mechanism underlying chemoresistance in NPC remains to be elucidated.<br \/>Methods: A gene expression dataset and STRING database were used to identify core module and gene that are related to the efficacy of docetaxel-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TPF) IC in NPC patients. <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> functional experiments were used to test the effects of PJA1 on docetaxel chemoresistance of NPC cells. The flow cytometric analysis, western blot, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays were performed to determine the effects of PJA1 on GSDME-mediated cell pyroptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence staining, and ubiquitination assays were performed to explore the regulatory manners between PJA1 and PGAM5-DRP1 axis. Finally, multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate the clinical significance of PJA1 -PGAM5-DRP1 axis in patients with NPC.<br \/>Results: PJA1 was identified as a key E3 ligase of the top-ranked module ubiquitin-proteasome system dysregulation that involved in NPC chemoresistance, which was highly expressed in NPC patients with nonresponse to the TPF IC. PJA1 facilitated the docetaxel resistance of NPC cells through inhibiting the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Mechanistically, PJA1 promoted the degradation of the mitochondrial protein PGAM5 by increasing its K48-linked ubiquitination at K88, further increasing the phosphorylation of DRP1 at S637 and reducing the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in turn resulting in a suppressive of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. PGAM5 knockdown fully restored the docetaxel sensitization effect of PJA1 knockdown. Moreover, RTA402, a pharmacological inhibitor of PJA1, enhanced the docetaxel sensitivity of NPC cells. Clinically, high PJA1 expression indicated resistance to TPF IC an inferior survival in NPC patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study emphasizes the essential role of E3 ligase PJA1 in regulating chemoresistance in NPC and provides new therapeutic strategies for NPC patients based on targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Chemoresistance,pyroptosis,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Since the majority of cancers are HR-proficient, there is a need for developing strategies to extend the use of PARPis to HR-proficient cancers. We investigated whether the hypoxic cytotoxin, tirapazamine (TPZ) sensitizes HR-proficient cancer cells to PARPis under normoxia and hypoxia (2% O<sub>2<\/sub>), and found that TPZ enhanced PARPi cell killing to a greater extent under hypoxia compared to normoxia. Mechanistically, this enhanced killing was due to the induction of DNA double-strand breaks and free radicals that lead to ferroptotic cell death. To determine the role of hypoxia in the anti-tumor effect of the combination treatment, we examined the efficacy of TPZ and PARPi treatment in hypoxic spheroids and subcutaneous xenograft models derived from a panel of HR-proficient human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We found that PARPis combined with TPZ significantly inhibited the growth of the hypoxic NSCLC spheroids. In addition, the combination treatment significantly inhibited the growth of A549 and CORL105 xenografts that possess significant hypoxic fractions, but did not significantly inhibit the growth of well-oxygenated Calu3 and H3122 xenografts. Taken together, this study demonstrates that TPZ can sensitize HR-proficient tumor cells to PARPi through the introduction of DNA strand breaks and free radicals, suggesting that TPZ treatment can broaden the usage of PARPi to HR-proficient cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Hypoxia,PARP inhibitors,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The chemoresistance of malignant tumors is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the stemness of cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the availability and functional mechanisms of trefoil factor family 1 (TFF1), a tumor-suppressive protein in pancreatic carcinogenesis, to treat pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: To investigate the role of endogenous TFF1 in human and mice, specimens of human pancreatic cancer and genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer (KPC\/TFF1KO; Pdx1-Cre\/ LSL-KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/ LSL-p53<sup>R172H<\/sup>\/ TFF1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To explore the efficacy of extracellular administration of TFF1, recombinant and chemically synthesized TFF1 were administered to pancreatic cancer cell lines, a xenograft mouse model and a transgenic mouse model.<br \/>Results: The deficiency of TFF1 was associated with increased EMT markers of cancer cells (Snail and Zeb1) in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, KPC. Analysis of the survival of patients who underwent chemotherapy for recurrent pancreatic cancer revealed that the expression of TFF1 in cancer cells was associated with better survival. Also, in the mouse model of pancreatic cancer, KPC mice showed improved survival when treated with gemcitabine, the KPC\/TFF1KO mice did not. Pancreatic cancer cell lines were administered with gemcitabine and\/or chemically synthesized TFF1, revealing that addition of TFF1 downregulated gemcitabine-induced EMT markers (Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and &#945;SMA), Wnt pathway activation (&#946;-catenin, TCF7, and EPHB3). In addition, TFF1 inhibited the expression of cancer stemness markers (CD133 and NANOG3) and the ability to form tumor sphere. Importantly, TFF1 accelerated the apoptosis of cancer cells induced by gemcitabine <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, combined treatment of gemcitabine and subcutaneous administration of TFF1 arrested tumor growth in xenograft mouse model. Also, KPC mice with combined treatment showed the better survival rather than gemcitabine-alone treatment, with lower expression of CD133, high expression of ZEB1, and lower nuclear translocation of &#946;-catenin.<br \/>Conclusion: These results indicate that TFF1 can contribute to establishing a novel strategy to treat pancreatic cancer patients by enhancing chemosensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Chemoresistance,Cancer stem cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The application of ferroptosis-inducers has been limited to preclinical studies due to toxic side effects and drug-resistance. Our study aims to explore the metabolic mechanism in regulating ferroptosis-resistance, thereby identifying combinational therapeutic target for ferroptosis-inducers.<br \/>Methods: The ferroptosis-resistant CRC cell lines were induced by chronic exposure to ferroptosis inducer Erastin and verified by cell viability assay. Metabolomics and transcriptomics were performed to identify the metabolic characteristics in ferroptosis-resistant CRC cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot was applied to confirm the differentially expressed serine-glycine-one-carbon metabolism (SGOC) enzymes. The MTT cell viability assay, colony formation assay, 3D spheroid formation assay and cell derived xenograft (CDX) model were carried out to investigate the therapeutic effect of targeting SGOC key enzyme-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) in combination of ferroptosis inducers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify molecular mechanism for the upregulation of SGOC enzymes based on RNA-seq data from TCGA-COAD cohort.<br \/>Results: Metabolomic and transcriptomic data revealed that SGOC metabolism was significantly increased in ferroptosis-resistant CRC cells. Moreover, the mRNA and protein level of SGOC key enzyme-PHGDH were remarkably upregulated in ferroptosis-resistant CRC cells. PHGDH inhibitor NCT-503 or knockdown of PHGDH exhibited a great synergistic effect with ferroptosis inducers for CRC cells in vitro or in vivo. Additionally, targeting PHGDH could dramatically restore the sensitivity of ferroptosis-inducers in ferroptosis-resistant cells. The RNA methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) was identified as the upstream regulator responsible for the upregulation of PHGDH in an m<sup>6<\/sup>A-dependent manner. The ferroptosis stress induced deacetylation of METTL3, thereby promoting its nuclear translocation and enzyme activity.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, we have uncovered that CRC cells resisted ferroptosis inducers via METTL3-PHGDH axis. Targeting PHGDH combined with ferroptosis inducers exhibited with synergistic effect for CRC in vitro and in vivo. Our findings identified the metabolic vulnerability in ferroptosis-resistant CRC cells, which could serve as a novel therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,PHGDH,Serine-glycine-one-carbon metabolism,Ferroptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a markedly worse outcome in comparison to patients diagnosed with hormone-dependent and human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive breast cancers due to the aggressive and rapidly progressive nature of the disease and the deficit in specifically targeted therapies available. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. Extracellular ATP has been shown to cause cell death in an autocrine and paracrine manner and is also a known danger signal that causes immune activation. Our published data reveals that at high micromolar concentrations extracellular ATP (eATP) can induce cell death through the eATP-gated ion channels, purinergic P2RX7 and P2RX4 receptors. We also showed that in the context of chemotherapy treatment, eATP modulates TNBC cell death at submicromolar concentrations. A feature of the tumor microenvironment is a pronounced increase in the concentrations of eATP (micromolar) to levels that are closer to the threshold for cytotoxicity than in normal tissues (nanomolar). In addition, we discovered that chemotherapy induces the release of eATP from TNBC cells, further augmenting its concentration. Despite this, eATP is rapidly degraded to adenosine by extracellular ATPases (eATPases). It should be noted that extracellular ATP release and activation of its receptor, P2XR7, are prerequisites for the activation of a complex of proteins known as the NLRP3 inflammasome that is critical for IL-1&#946; and IL-18 secretion and the induction of a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate if augmenting eATP levels using extracellular ATPase inhibitors will increase the efficacy of chemotherapy against THP-1 and differentiated THP-1 cells to undergo an inflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis. We treated THP-1 and differentiated THP-1 cells with increasing concentrations of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel in the presence of eATPase inhibitors POM-1 and PSB 069 with eATP content and cell viability being assessed. Additionally, we examined NLRP3 inflammasome activation by immunoblot analysis. We analyzed the oligomerization of NLRP3 and ASC, the cleavage of caspase 1 and gasdermin and the secretion of IL-1&#946; and IL-18, all components of pyroptosis. These results reveal that eATP modulates the chemotherapeutic response in the monocytic THP-1 and differentiated THP-1 cells, which could be exploited to augment the anticancer effects of macrophages on TNBC cells. These preclinical experiments could be applied to develop effective therapies that increase the depth and length of responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in TNBCs by augmenting pyroptosis of tumor associate macrophages through enhanced eATP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,ATP,Macrophages,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In NSCLC, the activation of MET pathway is thought to occur through diverse mechanisms that influence properties affecting cancer cell survival, growth, and invasiveness. These tumors show oncogene addiction to MET and exhibit remarkable responses to MET-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). However, the long-term effectiveness of MET-TKIs is usually limited due to acquired drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying primary and acquired resistance to MET-TKIs in the management of NSCLC remain unclear.

[Results] Multiple mechanisms underlay acquired resistance to crizotinib in <i>MET<\/i>-amplified lung cancer cell lines.

However, as with previous therapeutic agents for malignant tumors, there have been cases of resistance to these drugs either initially or during treatment, and the mechanisms of drug resistance need to be elucidated. So far, little is known about the mechanisms of resistance to molecularly targeted drugs in thyroid cancer. To overcome resistance to the RET inhibitor, selpercatinib (SEL), and to consider next therapeutic strategies, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to SEL.<br \/>Method: We used papillary carcinoma cell lines TPC-1 and CUTC48, which harbor the <i>RET\/PTC1<\/i> fusion gene. We established an SEL-resistant subline (TPC-1\/SELR) in TPC-1 by long-term exposure to SEL. The growth inhibitory effect of drugs was analyzed using the WST assay. The alteration of intracellular signal transduction was analyzed by western blotting.<br \/>Result: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) for SEL in the parental TPC-1 was 3 nM, while growth inhibition in TPC-1\/SELR did not reach 50% even at more than 100 nM of SEL. On the other hand, growth inhibition by SEL in CUTC48 did not reach 50% even at more than 100 nM of SEL. The sensitivity to SEL in CUTC48 was comparable to that in TPC-1\/SELR, and CUTC48 showed an intrinsic resistance to SEL. TPC-1\/SELR showed increased phosphorylation of EGFR, Erk, Akt, and mTOR compared to TPC-1. In CUTC48, phosphorylation of EGFR and Erk was not increased compared to that of TPC-1, while phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was increased. We investigated the growth inhibitory effect of an mTOR inhibitor everolimus and found that TPC-1 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 1.3 nM), TPC-1\/SELR (5 nM) , and CUTC48 (9.4 nM) were all highly sensitive to everolimus.<br \/>Discussion: Our results showed that Akt and mTOR phosphorylation were elevated in the SEL-resistant TPC-1\/SELR and the SEL-intrinsic resistant CUTC48 in common, suggesting the involvement of activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway in SEL resistance in thyroid cancer. The inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway in parallel with RET may have therapeutic potential to overcome SEL resistance in thyroid cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Molecular targets,Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The oncogenic MUC1-C protein confers pleotropic resistance of cancer cells to diverse cytotoxic and targeted agents by unclear mechanisms. We demonstrate that MUC1-C regulates the interferon (IFN) type I\/II pathways in H1975 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells selected for osimertinib resistance (H1975-OR). Targeting MUC1-C in H1975-OR cells suppressed STAT1 and inflammatory IFN signaling in association with reversing the osimertinib-resistant phenotype. Studies of H1975-OR cells selected for growth in the absence of osimertinib demonstrate that revertant H1975-RT cells retain MUC1-C-dependent memory necessary for recalling osimertinib resistance. Mechanistically, osimertinib treatment of H1975-RT cells activates the <i>MUC1 <\/i>gene at a (i) promoter-like signature (PLS) by MUC1-C and STAT1, and (ii) proximal enhancer-like signature (pELS) by PBAF and JUN\/AP-1. Targeting MUC1-C in osimertinib-treated H1975-RT and MGH170 NSCLC MET-amplified cells isolated from a patient refractory to osimertinib treatment suppressed induction of STAT1 and downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding MX1, OAS1 and ISG15. Targeting MUC1-C, STAT1, PBRM1\/PBAF and JUN\/AP-1 further confirmed their dependencies for reemergence of osimertinib resistance in H1975-RT and MGH170 cells. In support of these results, high MUC1-C protein expression analyzed by IHC is associated with shorter progression free survival for patients treated with osimertinib. These findings and the demonstration that MUC1-C is upregulated in NSCLC cells from patients refractory to osimertinib indicate that MUC1-C drives osimertinib resistance in NSCLC cells by promoting an inflammatory memory response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,MUC1,Osimertinib,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

However, clinical trials repeatedly demonstrate that durability of benefit is short-lived in many patients. While genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance have been described, this explains a small minority of patients and further research is needed to determine the underlying biology limiting MAPKi therapy durability in CRC.<br \/>Potential responsible mechanisms were explored using transcriptomic data from patients treated with MAPKi combination therapy, showing upregulation of stem-related signatures in nonresponders (FDR&#60;0.001), therefore CRC stem markers with the greatest expression increase were identified. The top markers (ASCL2, LGR5, LRIG1) were evaluated using a metacohort of single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data from patients with CRC (n=72), and ASCL2 was selected for further study due to its high marker coexpression and tumor cell specificity (OR=8.27, p&#60;0.0001). Additionally, ASCL2 expression increased in multiple patient-derived organoid and xenograft (PDX) models that were treated with a spectrum of MAPKi therapies (BRAFi, EGFRi, G12Ci, MEKi, SOSi). As such, we postulated that ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells play an important role in the limited response durability of MAPKi therapy in CRC.<br \/>To investigate, ASCL2 reporter models were treated with MAPKi therapy, resulting in the significant enrichment of ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells, independent of driver mutation or treatment regimen used. Using Single Cell BarcodeSeq, by combining molecular barcoded PDXs with single cell transcriptomics, we found that MAPKi therapy engaged intrinsic cellular plasticity resulting in cells transitioning into the ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> phenotype. Additional patient-level data confirmed enrichment of the ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> transcriptomic signature at progression while on MAPKi therapy. Characterization of ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> cells showed higher stem cell frequency (p=9.7x10<sup>-62<\/sup>), clonogenic capacity (p&#60;0.0001), expression of stem-related genes, and retention of phenotypic plasticity, indicating ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells feature stem-like abilities, as previously described, which include therapy resistance. Lastly, depletion of ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells resulted in improved initial response to MAPKi therapy (p&#60;0.0001) and, more importantly, prolonged cell growth inhibition.<br \/>Overall, we observe that MAPKi therapy enriches stemness programs in CRC and demonstrate MAPKi drives cells into a transient ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> stem-like state with limited sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors. Further studies are underway to identify vulnerabilities that will enable targeting of ASCL2<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. Ultimately these findings will help guide future optimization of MAPKi regimens to prolong response durability and improve outcomes for patients with CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Targeted therapy,Tumor biology,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Patients treated with approved treatment strategies may develop resistance to these therapies. Because of this problem in treatment, new treatment regimens need to emerge. Altered reprogramming of metabolism and an intense dependence on glycolysis are hallmarks of cancer, which is necessary to support the high energy demand of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Rapidly dividing cancer cells are known to have increased energy requirements and altered reprogramming of glucose metabolism, leading to an increased reliance on glycolysis. The conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a critical rate-limiting step in the glycolysis pathway, is greatly influenced by an allosteric activator produced by the enzyme PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3), thus making PFKFB3 an important regulator of glycolytic flux. Furthermore, PFKFB3 has been shown to be overexpressed in many human cancers, including breast cancer, and upregulated by estrogen. In our previous studies, we have shown that endocrine-resistant BC cells growth is strongly reduced by PFKFB3 targeting using PFKFB3 inhibitors, glucose uptake is reduced, triggered to necroptosis by RIPK1 and MLKL phosphorylation, and PFKFB3 inhibition reduces tumor size in mouse xenografts. In this study, we showed that silencing of RIPK1 and MLKL, genes involved in necroptosis, by siRNAs followed by inhibition of PFKFB3 by PFK158 did not induce necroptosis in endocrine-resistant BC cells. Furthermore, we further confirmed that phosphorylation of MLKL and RIPK occurs with PFKFB3 inhibition. In summary, this study reveals that necroptosis induced by PFKFB3 inhibition contributes to resistance by arresting necroptosis in endocrine-resistant BC cells after silencing of necroptosis-related genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine resistance,Targeted therapy,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"B.

The study aimed to determine if tamoxifen resistance genes cause cross-resistance to commonly employed metastatic breast cancer (combination) treatments.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: Parental and tamoxifen resistant MCF7A models (BCAR3, BCAR4, EGFR, AKT1 and AKT2) were cultured for 10 days with different concentrations of tamoxifen and fulvestrant (endocrine therapy), ribo-, abema-, and palbociclib (CDK4\/6 inhibitors) and alpelisib (PIK3CA inhibitor). Compounds were tested as mono- and combination therapy in replicate experiments estimating cell growth using the Sulforhodamine B assay and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated by Graphpad PRISM v5 software. Resistance was declared when IC50 was significantly different from parental (p&#60;0.05, Mann-Whitney U test).<br \/>Results: The BCAR3, BCAR4 and EGFR models were not only resistant to tamoxifen but also to fulvestrant monotherapy (see table). In the two AKTs models the initial results could not be reproduced and were excluded from the study. The BCAR4 model was also resistant to all CDK4\/6- and PIK3CA-inhibitors monotherapy. Analysis of the combination regimens demonstrated cross-resistance in the BCAR4 model for all compound combinations tested, in the EGFR model for all combinations except fulvestrant combined with alpelisib, and in the BCAR3 model only for tamoxifen combined with alpelisib.<br \/>Discussion\/Conclusion: Tamoxifen resistance genes BCAR3, BCAR4 and EGFR show various degrees of cross-resistance to other breast cancer treatments. It might be worthwhile to evaluate these genes or their associated biological pathways as predictive biomarkers for cross-resistance in HR+ breast cancer patients treated with the mentioned (combination) therapies.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{D3C16EA7-4EF1-460C-82D7-C033E8BB7335}\"><caption>Summary of median IC50 (IQR) for different conditions<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">parental<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BCAR3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BCAR4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">EGFR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AKT1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AKT2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Monotherapy<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Tamoxifen<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>9.8 (7.0)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>47.3 (121) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>2210 (1280) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>515 (495) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>8.0 (21.3)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3.8 (21.8)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Fulvestrant<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.1 (0.35)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.8 (0.8) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>309 (407) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>11.4 (37.7) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Ribociclib<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>479 (285)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>423 (1102)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3099 (1212)**<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>719 (669)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Abemaciclib<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>94.9 (82.5)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>28.9 (52.6)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>206 (197) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>189 (172)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Palbociclib<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>138 (163)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>91.1 (107)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>608 (347) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>158 (128)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Alpelisib<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>14.1 (676)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>322 (94.0)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1424 (372) **<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>375 (356)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;

Sorafenib (SF), a second-line treatment for mRCC, exhibits modest efficacy, and the underlying molecular basis for its failure is elusive. Hyaluronic acid (HA), implicated in promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and motility through CD44 and RHAMM receptors, represents a potential player in SF resistance. Hymecromone (HC), a non-toxic dietary supplement, is known to inhibit HA synthesis and downregulate CD44 and RHAMM mRNA levels. This study investigates the elusive mechanisms of SF resistance and evaluates the effectiveness of the HC+SF combination as a targeted therapy for advanced RCC, providing insights into a novel and potentially impactful treatment approach.<br \/>Methods: HA levels were measured in normal and tumor kidney specimens using ELISA-like assay and IHC. Similarly, HAS3 and UGT1A9 (A9) levels and SF glucuronidation were measured by qPCR and a glucuronidation assay using tumor microsomes. Response to SF+HC combination was examined in A9 and HAS3 knockdown and overexpression cell lines (transfectants) and primary RCC spheroids by proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and invasion assays. Target analysis was performed by immunoblot. Treatment efficacy was evaluated in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models, with bioluminescence imaging.<br \/>Results: SF failure in mRCC was linked due to its glucuronidation and inactivation by A9. Tumor microsomes from patients who developed mRCC glucuronidated SF 5-fold higher than from non-mRCC patients. A9 levels were elevated (8-10 folds) in mRCC patients&#8217; tumor along with HA and HAS3 (5-10 folds) as compared to non-mRCC patients and normal kidney tissues. HC treatment downregulated A9 promoter activity and inhibited SF-glucuronidation in RCC cells. SF (5uM) and HC (20, 40ug\/ml) combination inhibited RCC cell and primary tumor spheroid proliferation (&#62;90%), motility\/invasion (&#62;80%), and induced apoptosis (5-fold) and downregulated HAS3 expression (&#62;80%), and HA synthesis in RCC cells. While A9 and HAS3 transfectants both were resistant to SF+HC treatment, A9 and HAS3 - KO transfectants were sensitive to SF. Endothelial cells co-cultured with either A9 or HAS3 transfectants were resistant to SF+HC treatment. SF+HC upregulated apoptosis effectors, but downregulated CD44, RHAMM, and phospho-Met levels in EV but not in A9 or HAS3 transfectants. HC (100 or 200mg\/kg) and SF (30mg\/kg) oral combination abrogated Caki-1 tumor growth (&#62;80%), without serum\/tissue toxicity. HC+SF treatment decreased A9, HA and HAS3 levels, Ki67 index and microvessel density. Both A9 and HAS3 overexpressing tumors were resistant to treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrates the mechanism of SF failure in mRCC and proposes a safe, oral adjunct combination for effective treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hyaluronan,metastatic RCC,sorafenib resistance,Hymecromone,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Surgical therapies such as liver transplantation and hepatectomy may help cure hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in its early stages. Advanced stages of the disease have a poor prognosis and a high refractoriness because of drug resistance. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for the systemic treatment of patients with advanced HCC. However, the efficacy of this medication has shown a limited prolongation of the overall survival in patients with advanced HCC. The mechanism of resistance to sorafenib in advanced HCC is poorly understood. The TCGA analysis of the HCC patient cohort shows an elevated expression of YBX1 in tumors as compared to normal. The expression is also correlated with progression, metastasis, and poor survival of HCC patients. Transcription factor YBX1 is involved in the regulation of drug resistance in different cancers, especially breast and colorectal cancers. Our lab is interested in understanding if YBX1 is involved in sorafenib resistance in HCC. Different HCC cell lines procured from ATCC SK-Hep1, Huh-7luc, and C3A, were analyzed for their IC50 values for sorafenib using MTT assays, at different time points. SK-Hep1 showed 8.780&#181;M and 8.174&#181;M, HepG2luc 4.659&#181;M and 3.596&#181;M at 48 and 72 hrs respectively. Overexpression of YBX1 in the SK-Hep1 cell line increased the cell survival and IC50 value of sorafenib at 48 and 72 hrs at 13.19&#181;M and 10.64&#181;M respectively. This supports the hypothesis which demonstrates the role of YBX1 in mediating resistance to sorafenib in advanced HCC. YBX1 could be a major therapeutic target and by inhibiting its action could improve the sensitivity of advanced HCC to sorafenib. We have developed YBX1 overexpressing and knockdown (GFP expressing) cell lines, FACS sorted and Puromycin selected for further mechanistic studies. We are also further developing the sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines to understand the mechanism underlying sorafenib resistance in HCC. Protein and RNA analyses revealed a relative increase in YBX1 overexpression in sorafenib-resistant cell lines as compared to its parental cell lines. Understanding the mechanism of YBX1-induced drug resistance to sorafenib and its associated signaling pathways could help improve the sensitivity of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma to treatment by sorafenib and thus improve the livelihood of its patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Drug resistance,Liver cancer,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, up to 40% of these patients will experience relapse due to endocrine therapy resistance even when these agents are used in combination with cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. A small population of cells within tumors known as breast cancer stem cells are generally resistant to endocrine therapy and are believed to promote patient relapse. We previously found that breast cancer stem cell marker &#945;6-integrin is expressed at elevated levels in cells that are resistant to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. We thus hypothesized that elevated levels of &#945;6-integrin confer resistance to anti-estrogens. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that tamoxifen-resistant and fulvestrant-resistant mammospheres (breast cancer spheroids) exhibit increased &#945;6-integrin expression as compared to antiestrogen-sensitive mammospheres. Cells with enforced &#945;6-integrin expression were less responsive to tamoxifen and fulvestrant than control cells. Further, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of &#945;6-integrin enhanced anti-estrogen efficacy. Our data suggest that targeting &#945;6-integrin represents a viable strategy to overcome endocrine therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Endocrine resistance,Integrins,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Standard therapy involves temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, an alkylating agent. However, most cases develop resistance to TMZ, necessitating the development of new treatment options to overcome TMZ-resistant GBM. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a class of RNA molecules that, despite not encoding proteins, play pivotal roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Overexpression of specific lncRNAs in cancer is linked to crucial aspects of cancer progression, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) is a highly expressed lncRNA in GBM, playing a crucial role in preventing excessive DNA replication stress and associated DNA damage (Nat Commun 2023).This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of TUG1 depletion and TMZ in TMZ-resistant GBM. First, we established a TMZ-resistant U251MG cell line, U251MG-R, characterized by a low DNA methylation level of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. We observed that TMZ increased DNA replication stress in the U251MG-R. Depleting TUG1 by using antisense oligonucleotide (TUG1-ASO) sensitized U251MG-R cells to TMZ. Treatment with TMZ or TUG1-ASO alone inhibited cell proliferation, with the most significant inhibition observed when both were combined. Next, we employed a xenograft mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous TUG1-ASO treatment coupled with a tumor-specific drug delivery system (antiTUG1-DDS). The combination of antiTUG1-DDS with TMZ displayed the most effective suppression of tumor growth compared to either TMZ or antiTUG1-DDS alone. Targeted therapy aimed at TUG1 may be a promising approach for overcoming TMZ resistance in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Temozolomide,Glioblastoma,Antisense oligonucleotides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hidekazu Kito<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yuji Kibe<sup><\/sup>, Miho Suzuki<sup><\/sup>, Keiko Shinjo<sup><\/sup>, Yutaka Kondo<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6414cc80-c947-4736-80df-bb24e8a58db6","ControlNumber":"4303","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

We developed an integrated computational-experimental platform to mitigate treatment resistance by identifying therapeutics that selectively target clinical resistance mechanisms. The key innovation is the computational framework that comprehensively maps tumor-specific mechanisms of response and resistance to a treatment based on clinicogenomic and\/or preclinical pharmacogenomic data. It then screens for drugs or targets that are synthetically lethal with these resistance mechanisms. Here we present the identification of therapeutic options that mitigate resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors as a case study. Leveraging a breast cancer-specific atlas of cellular architecture, our framework learned genetic mechanisms of CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance from a high-throughput phenotypic screen of ~700 cell lines treated with the clinical CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib. The learned mechanisms formed a parsimonious set of hierarchically linked protein complexes that coordinate G1-to-S transition (P=5.6&#215;10<sup>-12<\/sup>). The mechanisms unified distinct resistant populations such as samples resistant due to CDK4\/6-Rb checkpoint bypass and those resistant due to growth factor receptor activation. Applied to 70 ER+ metastatic breast cancer patients in a real-world dataset, the learned resistance mechanisms accurately predicted patient response to palbociclib (P=3&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>, log-rank test). Computationally screening 20K clinical-grade small molecules and gene targets for therapeutic options synthetically lethal with the learned resistance mechanisms identified the known CDK4\/6 resistance targets CDK2, CCNE1, and E2F. It also identified a target that, to our knowledge, has not previously been rigorously evaluated for its potential to mitigate CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance. In-vitro, monotherapy inhibition of the target by siRNA selectively decreased growth of breast cancer cell lines resistant to CDK4\/6 inhibitors by 52% compared to CDK4\/6i sensitive cell lines (P=0.023, Mann-Whitney U-test). As a combination therapy, inhibition of the target by siRNA selectively increased the sensitivity to palbociclib by nearly an order of magnitude in an otherwise resistant breast cancer cell line (expected vs observed IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 9.7 uM vs. 1.3 uM) while not having a substantial effect in a palbociclib-sensitive cell line (expected vs observed IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.57 uM vs. 0.56 uM). Finally, while monotherapy inhibition of the target and CDK4\/6 induced cell cycle arrest, the combination strongly induced apoptosis in cell lines resistant to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. These results highlight how computational deconvolution of tumor resistance mechanisms enable algorithmic identification of therapeutic options to target treatment-resistant cell populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Machine learning,Cell cycle inhibitors,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Lenvatinib has recently been approved by the FDA for front-line treatment of HCC patients at advanced stages. However, the survival benefit of lenvatinib is modest due to the development of acquired drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying lenvatinib resistance in HCC and to identify potential therapeutic targets to combat lenvatinib resistance. For this purpose, we established a lenvatinib-resistant (LenR) HCC patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) by administering four rounds of lenvatinib treatment, and their genetic profiles were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Based on single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) analysis, Annexin A1 (ANXA1), the top gene that was enriched in the HCC cell-like cluster of LenR tumors, was identified and was consistently observed in LenR HCC cell lines and LenR tumors derived from <i>Tp53<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup>\/<i>C-Myc<\/i><sup>OE<\/sup> and RIL175 HCC mouse models. Using an <i>in vitro<\/i> differentiation model, limiting dilution assay, apoptosis assay and correlation analysis, we demonstrated the role of ANXA1 in the regulation of cancer stemness-driven lenvatinib resistance. Mechanistically, ANXA1 regulates cancer stemness and drug resistance by driving the STAT3\/S100A6 signaling cascade, and ANXA1 expression is regulated by SOX2 via promoter activation, as demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Using the same set of scRNA-seq data, we showed that LenR HCC tumors reshaped the tumor microenvironment (TME) by inducing M2 macrophage polarization, as evidenced by a higher M2\/M1 ratio of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in LenR HCC tumors than in their mock counterparts. Based on this observation, we further demonstrated the <i>in vitro<\/i> role of secretory ANXA1 in LenR HCC cells in inducing macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype. In conclusion, ANXA1 may regulate lenvatinib resistance intrinsically via the promotion of cancer stemness and extrinsically via the induction of an immunosuppressive TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Lenvatinib,Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Although many drivers of acquired drug resistance have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping tumor evolution during treatment are incompletely understood. We recently demonstrated that lung cancer targeted therapies commonly used in the clinic induce the expression of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A (A3A), leading to sustained mutagenesis in drug-tolerant cancer cells persisting during therapy. Preventing therapy-induced A3A mutagenesis by gene deletion decreased the chromosomal aberration events and delayed the emergence of drug resistance. Thus, inhibition of A3A may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired resistance. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of A3A may provide alternative approaches to inhibit A3A mutagenesis. Using a panel drug screen, we found that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor remarkably induces A3A in non-small cell lung cancer cells. RNA-seq profiling revealed that targeted therapy as well as DNMT inhibitor treatment activate expression of distinct classes non-coding repetitive RNA elements, including endogenous retrovirus (ERVs), in drug-tolerant persister cells. Activation of intracellular viral sensing pathways by introduction of exogenous nucleic acids mimicking viral elements induced A3A expression. While the transcription factor NFkB was acutely activated by targeted therapy, TBK1-IRF3 signaling was activated at later time points. These findings suggest that reactivation of ERVs may underlie A3A mutagenic activity and tumor evolution during targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug resistance,APOBEC,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Nearly 85% of the lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an established marker for NSCLC, is frequently overexpressed on the cell surface. Amplifying mutations often render these receptors activated in a ligand independent manner, therefore, therapies such as erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), target these activating mutations and inhibit tumor growth. Nevertheless, patients acquire resistance to EGFR TKI within 9-14 months of treatment. Recent studies show that fat mass and obesity- associated (FTO) gene, initially identified to increase the body mass index, plays a major role in cancer development and acquired therapy resistance in several cancer types. FTO demethylates m6A mRNA and modulates tumorigenesis, and drug resistance. In this study, we explored the functions of FTO in EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC. To study the expression of FTO in erlotinib resistant cells, we used wildtype-EGFR NSCLC cell lines (H2170, H358) and mutant EGFR NSCLC cell lines (H1975, PC9) that were rendered resistant to erlotinib. Our RT-qPCR results demonstrated that FTO was upregulated by 1.7-3.0 fold in erlotinib resistant H2170, H358, PC9 and H1975 cells. FTO protein was upregulated by 1.3-1.6 fold as seen by western blotting, and by 1.7 to 2.6 fold in the nucleus of erlotinib resistant H1975, H2170 and PC9 cell lines by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we investigated FTO inhibition with Dac51 (FTOi) on cell viability and cell migration properties. MTT cell viability assay showed a 9-17% decrease in cell viability when treated with a combination of Dac51 and erlotinib compared to Dac51 alone in erlotinib resistant H2170 and PC9 cells, respectively. The combinatory treatment showed an additive effect compared to the Dac51 and erlotinib treatments alone. Wound healing assay revealed an 18% open wound area after 48-hour treatment with both Dac51 and erlotinib compared to 0.1% after treatment with erlotinib alone in erlotinib resistant H2170 cells. To evaluate the effect of siRNA mediated FTO (siFTO) knockdown on cell viability and energy metabolism, MTT and luciferase assays were performed. MTT assay showed a 21-28% decrease in viability in erlotinib resistant H1975, H2170, PC9 cells, demonstrating increase in the erlotinib efficacy, as compared to the mock siRNA treatment. Luciferase assay showed an inverse relationship between the FTO and ATP, where the latter was upregulated by 1.3 to 3.4 folds in erlotinib resistant H1975, H2170 and PC9 cells, when treated with siFTO, suggesting its involvement in the energy requirements of the NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our study suggests FTO was upregulated in erlotinib resistant NSCLC cells on both the gene and protein levels. FTO could mediate resistance to EGFR TKI possibly through cell proliferation and migration and help with prognosis of NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.
