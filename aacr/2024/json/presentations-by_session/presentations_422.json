[{"Abstract":"Background: Perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs), notable representatives of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), are synthetic persistent chemicals widely accumulated and detected in humans. Short-chain PFASs [PFCAs with carbon number &#60;8 and PFSAs &#60;6, e.g. perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA)] are considered less bioaccumulative and increasingly used in commercial products, yet their health impacts are rarely investigated. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been categorized as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B) and a potential mammary toxicant. However, few population studies explored the prospective associations of PFOA and other common PFASs with breast cancer risk nor the underlying mechanisms.<br \/>Methods: Hence, we conducted a case-cohort study within the DongFeng-Tongji Cohort, compromising 226 incident breast cancer cases and a random sub-cohort of 990 individuals. Plasma concentrations of four PFCAs [PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and PFHpA] and two PFSAs [perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)], as well as peripheral blood mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) levels, were measured at baseline.<br \/>Results: Using Barlow-weighted Cox regression, we found 35% and 20% increased incident risk of breast cancer for each 1-unit ln-transformed increase in PFOA and PFHpA, respectively [HR (95% CI) = 1.35 (1.03, 1.78) and 1.20 (1.02, 1.40)]. Quantile g-computation analysis revealed a 19% increased incident risk of breast cancer along with each simultaneous quartile increase in all ln-transformed PFCA concentrations [HR (95% CI) = 1.19 (1.01, 1.41)], driven mainly by contributions from PFOA (56%), PFNA (24%), and PFHpA (20%). Besides, mtDNAcn was positively associated with PFHpA levels [&#946; (95% CI) =0.027 (0.005, 0.048)], but not with PFOA or PFNA (P&#62;0.05). We also found significantly higher breast cancer risk in participants with the highest mtDNAcn (Q4, &#8805;1.52) than those with the lowest (Q1, &#60;0.87) [HR (95% CI) =2.92 (1.69, 5.04)], and that mtDNAcn mediated 12.77% of PFHpA-breast cancer association [Indirect effect, HR (95% CI) =1.02 (1.00, 1.04)]. No significant mediation effect of mtDNAcn was observed in associations of PFOA and PFNA with breast cancer (P&#62;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Our work unveiled the relationship of short-chain PFHpA with increased incident risk of breast cancer for the first time and highlighted the intermediate role of mtDNAcn in this association, providing a research clue for exploring the potential mechanisms of PFAS-induced breast cancer. Moreover, co-exposure to PFASs was observed as a risk factor for breast cancer, shedding light on breast cancer prevention by regulating PFASs as a chemical class.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Perfluoroalkyl substance,Mitochondrial DNA copy number,Case-cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

These persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been identified for their impact on the circadian rhythms of the brain and vascular system. Several studies indicate that phthalates can elevate neuroinflammation and reduce levels of the junctional protein ZO-1 in the hypothalamus, home to the master circadian clock known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN regulates cellular and tissue circadian rhythms, including tight junction proteins essential for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) main barrier function. Interestingly, experimental studies reveal that prolonged chronic circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) in mice leads to increased breast cancer metastasis. However, the effects of phthalates on CRD concerning brain cancer and metastasis remain poorly understood. Given their significant prevalence and biological impact, we hypothesize that phthalate exposure induces CRD through hypothalamic dysregulation, resulting in BBB dysfunction and an elevated risk of brain metastasis.<br \/>Results. We developed an in vitro BBB model using endothelial cells and exposed them to an environmentally relevant mixture of five phthalates simulating chronic low-grade exposure. Analysis showed dysregulation of critical clock genes (Bmal1 and Clock), along with a substantial decrease in BBB tight junction proteins (claudin-5 and occludin) at the protein and mRNA levels. The tumor trans-endothelial migration assay using breast adenocarcinoma cells along with endothelial cells demonstrated an increased metastatic potential following phthalate exposure.<br \/>Conclusion. These findings offer crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying phthalate exposure, suggesting potential targets for future brain metastasis treatments. Additionally, they hold implications for the future regulation and management of phthalate usage and policy.

Michigan is also home to a diverse population of Latinx, Black, White, and Middle Eastern\/North African (MENA) Americans. Because minority populations are underrepresented in environment and cancer research despite being at greater risk of being exposed to environmental hazards and having worse cancer outcomes, Michigan is uniquely positioned for studying the associations between environmental exposures and cancer risk. In June 2022, the Michigan Cancer and Research on the Environment Study (MI-CARES) began recruitment with a goal of establishing a cohort of over 100,000 Michiganders to examine these associations. Any Michigander aged 18-49 is eligible to enroll in MI-CARES. By focusing on this age range, we will capture exposures during important windows of susceptibility prior to the onset of most cancers.While recruitment is open to all state-wide, efforts are focused on six environmental injustice hotspots, identified using the MiEJScreen tool, a relative summary score capturing pollution burden and population vulnerability: the metro areas of Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Flint, Lansing, Detroit, and Bay City-Saginaw.MI-CARES will enroll equal numbers of Black, Latinx, MENA, and White participants. To support participation in diverse communities, study materials are available in Arabic, English, and Spanish. MI-CARES has employed a multifaceted community engagement strategy and is recruiting from these communities directly and with the help of community partners. An incentive of $10 is also provided to participants who successfully complete the questionnaire.To democratize participation, MI-CARES enrollment can be completely remote, but in-person and paper-based enrollment is available. Enrollment includes a baseline questionnaire, consent for data linkage, and annual follow-up surveys. Participants are also asked to provide saliva and blood spot samples via a mailed at-home biospecimen collection kit. Biospecimens will be analyzed for environmental exposures like heavy metals and for intermediate cancer markers including inflammation, cellular aging, immune function, and altered metabolism. Participant data will be linked to neighborhood-level exposure databases, administrative databases like cancer registries and death indices, and to the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. More than 4,000 Michiganders have enrolled in MI-CARES. Data on initial cohort members including environmental exposure history and demographic characteristics will be presented. MI-CARES is part of the Cohorts for Environmental Exposures and Cancer Risk (CEECR) consortium, which is funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Environmental exposure,Cancer markers,Environmental pollution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Our previous study of long-term exposure to particulate matter air pollution and lung cancer incidence in a South Korean cohort showed no association with hazard ratios greater than one. This inconsistent finding with those from previous cohort studies could be due to limited exposure assessment relying on district averages and a relatively small sample size of 80 thousand people. The present study aimed to overcome the two major limitations and re-analyzed the association for long-term exposure to particulate matter &#8804; 10 &#181;m and 2.5 &#181;m in diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone. Specifically, we improved our exposure assessment for individual exposure using 100-meter grid addresses, and increased the population size to 2 million people based on the National Health Insurance Database (NHID) composed of the entire South Korean population.<br \/>Methods: Our study population included 1,976,265 people who aged 30 years or older, had no history of cancer for 2002-2006, underwent health screening for 2005-2007, and resided in the Seoul Metropolitan Area. We defined lung cancer incidence as the first diagnosis based on the International Classification of Diseases 10<sup>th<\/sup> revision code and identified the incidence for 10 years of follow-up from 2007 through 2016. We estimated individual long-term exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and ozone as five-year average concentrations on each year at 100-meter grid addresses of participants&#8217; homes by using previously-validated exposure prediction models. Finally, we applied time-varying Cox proportional hazard model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 10 &#181;g\/m3 or 10 ppb increase of each of the four pollutants after adjusting for individual- and area-level characteristics.<br \/>Results: Out of 1,976,265 people, 15,707 people (0.79%) developed new cases of lung cancer for 10 years of follow-up. In all analyses for long-term exposure to four pollutants and lung cancer incidence, we did not find an association (PM10: HR= 0.999 [95% CI=0.956 - 1.044]; PM2.5: 0.890 [0.787 - 1.006]; NO2: 1.002 [0.967 - 1.037]; ozone: 1.027 [0.978 - 1.077]). Our stratified analyses by individual and area-level characteristics as well as 79 districts showed that the null findings in the total population were not derived by specific subpopulations.<br \/>Conclusion: Despites the considerable improvement in exposure assessment and population size, our findings are contradictory to previous evidence. In addition to the possibility of no association, our null findings could be due to a relatively short period of exposure, the lack of histological information, and exposure measurement error resulting from indoor-outdoor difference and time activity. Future studies should overcome these limitations and re-examine the association.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Environmental pollution,Lung cancer,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

Exposure to farm animals has also been associated with some cancers including lower risk of lung cancer and elevated risks of certain hematologic malignancies, with heterogeneity by animal species. Increasing epidemiologic evidence suggests that changes in the oral microbiome contribute to cancer development. Few human studies have investigated the potential influence of farm animal exposures on the oral microbiome. We investigated associations between farm animal exposures and the oral microbiome in 1245 Iowa and North Carolina farmers and spouses from the Agricultural Health Study. Participants provided information on types and numbers of farm animals raised in telephone interviews close to the time of oral wash sample collection. DNA was extracted from oral wash specimens and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing. We evaluated associations between farm animal exposures and alpha diversity metrics [e.g., observed amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)] using linear regression and assessed differences in beta diversity metrics (e.g., weighted Unifrac) using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. In addition, we evaluated associations with the presence and relative abundance of specific genera using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. All analyses adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., sex, age, state of residence, smoking). Overall, 63% of participants reported raising any animals, most commonly cattle (46%) and hogs (20%). Raising sheep\/goats was associated with lower alpha diversity [e.g., 18 (95% confidence interval: 3-33) fewer observed ASVs compared to not raising sheep\/goats], with an exposure-response trend for increasing number of sheep\/goats (13 and 24 fewer observed ASVs for 1-29 and &#8805;30 sheep\/goats vs. none, respectively; <i>P<\/i><sub>trend<\/sub> = 0.048). Increasing numbers of hogs and poultry were associated with higher and lower alpha diversity, respectively. Associations were similar after mutual adjustment for other farm animal types. Based on beta diversity analyses, we did not observe statistically significant differences in microbial compositions between participants with and without farm animals. After adjusting for multiple testing, having any farm animal was associated with an increased relative abundance of <i>Porphyromonas<\/i>, and several genera were more likely to be absent with specific animal exposures (e.g., <i>Capnocytophaga <\/i>for cattle and sheep\/goats; <i>Corynebacterium <\/i>and<i> Abiotrophia <\/i>for sheep\/goats)<i>.<\/i> To our knowledge, this was the largest investigation of farm animal exposures and the human microbiome to date. Our preliminary findings suggest that animal farming may alter the oral microbiome and provide new insights into the potential role of animal exposures in cancer etiology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Oral microbiome,Epidemiology,Environmental exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Previous epidemiologic investigations, including in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), have suggested potential associations between carbaryl use and cancer risk. In this analysis, we updated a previous AHS evaluation of carbaryl and cancer risk by incorporating additional exposure information and follow-up time.<br \/>Methods: The AHS is a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in North Carolina (NC) and Iowa (IA). Information on lifetime pesticide use, including carbaryl, was reported on questionnaires at enrollment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1999-2005). We evaluated cancer risks associated with ever-use and intensity-weighted lifetime days (IWLD) of carbaryl use, comparing those who reported use to those who did not. For IWLD, carbaryl exposure was categorized (quartiles, tertiles, or the median) among users, depending on the number of cases. Among 52,625 applicators, 8,713 incident cancers were identified from linkages with state cancer registries through 2014 (NC) or 2017 (IA). We used Poisson regression to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), controlling for confounders, and evaluated lagged exposures.<br \/>Results: Approximately 50% of applicators reported use of carbaryl. Among cancer cases, 53% reported carbaryl use. Increasing IWLD of carbaryl use was associated with stomach cancer (RR<sub>T3<\/sub>=2.15, 95% CI: 1.11-4.15, <i>p-<\/i>trend=0.02), which persisted across lags up to 15 years. Carbaryl users in the highest quartile of IWLD had an increased risk of leukemia (RR<sub>Q4<\/sub>=2.12, 95% CI: 1.05-4.29, <i>p-<\/i>trend<i>=<\/i>0.08); this risk remained elevated, though attenuated, when exposure was lagged by 5-years (RR<sub>Q4<\/sub>=1.86, 95% CI: 0.91-3.81, <i>p<\/i>-trend=0.14). Ever-use of carbaryl was also suggestively associated with both esophageal (RR=1.45, 95% CI: 0.98-2.14) and tongue (RR=1.87, 95% CI: 0.93-3.74) cancers.<br \/>Conclusion: This study provides novel evidence of associations between carbaryl use, leukemia, and stomach cancer, as well as suggestive evidence of elevated risks of esophageal and tongue cancers. With more than 7,000 added cancer cases and up to 14 additional years of follow-up time as compared to a previous analysis in the AHS, we were able evaluate cancer sites not previously examined, making this the largest prospective study of carbaryl and cancer risk to date.

The Korean CARcinogen Exposure (K-CAREX) developed in 2021 is utilized to estimate the population at risk in industrial work environments in Korea (Koh et al., 2021). Our goal is to estimate preventable cancer incidence attributable to occupational carcinogens in Korea, utilizing the K-CAREX program and employing appropriate methodology. Among the exposures classified as Group 1 factors by IARC, considering the possibility of occupational exposure. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were computed using Levin's Formula (1953), considering a latency period of 15 years between exposure and cancer in our assessment. The prevalence of exposure was calculated using K-CAREX program and census data. The relative risk (RR) for incidence was derived from a meta-analysis of literature. It was possible to calculate PAFs for 11 occupational factors linked with 8 cancer types. This estimation was chosen based on a combination of exposure and sufficient evidence of human carcinogenicity. As a result, Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for cancer incidence associated with occupational carcinogens was estimated at 1% in 2020. Lung cancer (approximately 90%) was found to be the most prevalent type of cancer attributable to occupational factors, as widely acknowledged. The prevalence of exposure to occupational carcinogens was 22%, with Diesel engine exhaust being the most significant source for both genders. Since the early 2000s, the exposure levels of asbestos, subject to usage prohibition and restriction measures, were estimated to be at a lower level compared to other countries. It is evident that these estimates reflect the characteristics of the Korean industry.

The metabolism of solvents is known to be influenced by genetic susceptibility. Here, we evaluated the association between BTX and bladder cancer, stratified by genotype in known bladder cancer susceptibility loci and in variants shown to impact the metabolism of solvents.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) modified the association between BTX exposure and bladder cancer risk in 1182 cases and 1408 controls from a population-based case-control study in New England. Ever and cumulative lifetime exposure to BTX was assessed using occupational histories obtained by personal interviews and exposure-oriented modules in conjunction with a job-exposure matrix. Genotyping was conducted using Illumina arrays and <i>GSTM1 <\/i>and <i>GSTT1 <\/i>deletion were determined using melt curve\/copy number assays. We used multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between BTX exposure and bladder cancer, stratified by genotype and to calculate p-values for multiplicative interaction.<br \/>Results: Ever exposure to BTX was more strongly associated with bladder cancer risk among individuals with the <i>GSTT1 <\/i>null (deletion) genotype (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.26-9.89), while exposed individuals with the <i>GSTT1 <\/i>active genotype had a diminished risk (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.93-2.10, P-interaction = 0.06). The association between benzene exposure and bladder cancer was similarly modified by <i>GSTT1 <\/i>genotype (carriers of the deletion: OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.91, 14.13; carriers of one or two copies: OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79, 1.89, p-interaction=0.008).<br \/>Conclusion: <i>GSTT1 <\/i>genotype has been shown to impair the metabolism of solvents, particularly for benzene<b>. <\/b>Here we show that bladder cancer risk is higher among those exposed to solvents who also harbor a common deletion in <i>GSTT1,<\/i> adding to the evidence of a plausible link between BTX exposures and bladder cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Some studies of highly-exposed individuals have suggested positive associations between PFAS and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); however, it is unknown whether associations exist at lower exposure levels that are more common in the general population. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a nested case-control study investigating serum PFAS concentrations and NHL within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We measured pre-diagnostic serum concentrations (collected between 1993-2001) of five PFAS among 706 cases and 706 controls individually matched on the basis of age at baseline, sex, self-reported race and ethnicity, study center, calendar year of blood collection, and number of prior serum thaws. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PFAS concentrations in relation to NHL, both overall and for selected histologic subtypes [diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)] using conditional logistic regression. We found no evidence of a positive association with NHL for any of the five PFAS in analyses adjusting for all measured PFAS. In analyses of histologic subtypes, we observed a positive association between perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and DLBCL (OR per doubling in concentration=1.27, 95% CI=1.07, 1.50) which remained for cases diagnosed &#8805;10 years after blood collection (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.09, 1.64). We also observed inverse associations with PFNA for all subtypes (DLBCL, OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.72, 0.98; FL, OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.69, 1.08; LPL\/MZL, OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.66, 1.12), although these associations were null among participants with blood drawn prior to 1997 (DLBCL: OR<sub>&#60;1997<\/sub>=0.95, OR<sub>&#8805;1997<\/sub>=0.67, P<sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.001; FL: OR<sub>&#60;1997<\/sub>=1.01, OR<sub>&#8805;1997<\/sub>=0.77, P<sub>interaction<\/sub> =0.08; LPL\/MZL: OR<sub>&#60;1997<\/sub>=1.26, OR<sub>&#8805;1997<\/sub>=0.88, P<sub>interaction<\/sub> =0.03). In conclusion, our findings from a cohort study with PFAS serum concentrations comparable to that of the general population do not support an association with increased risk of NHL overall. The suggestive evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and DLBCL warrants further investigation. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-07 Environmental and occupational risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Per- and polyfluorinated substances ,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

No published study has estimated the contribution of the major potentially modifiable risk factors, such as immunosuppression, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and infection with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), to the burden of MCC in the US. We estimated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for MCC associated with immunosuppression (HIV and organ transplantation), MCPyV, and UVR in the US during 2001-2020.<br \/>Methods:<b>&nbsp;<\/b>We calculated PAFs for immunosuppression and UVR using the formula: prevalence in cases (Pc)*[(Relative risk, RR-1)\/RR]. The proportion of MCC cases among organ recipients and people with HIV (Pc) were derived from US cancer registries in the HIV\/AIDS Cancer Match Study, Transplant Cancer Match Study, and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program data. To approximate the RRs, we calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) comparing MCC incidence in people with HIV and organ recipients to the general population. We merged SEER data on MCC cases by county with data on ambient UVR levels in order to create population quintiles of UVR exposure. Since only non-Hispanic White individuals showed elevated IRRs for increased ambient UVR exposure, we estimated the PAF of UVR by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRR &#8776; RR) comparing MCC incidence in non-Hispanic White individuals to all other races\/ethnicities (at any UVR level) as the reference; here, Pc was the proportion of non-Hispanic White patients in each quintile. To estimate the PAF of MCPyV, we meta-analyzed US studies reporting on MCPyV prevalence in MCC tissues (here PAF &#8776; Pc).&nbsp;<br \/>Results:<b>&nbsp;<\/b>Over the study period (2001-2020), 40,571 MCCs were diagnosed in the US.<b>&nbsp;<\/b>Compared to the general population, organ recipients had 13 times higher (SIR=12.7, CI: 11.3-14.2) and people with HIV had three times higher (SIR=2.78, CI: 2.01-3.75) risk of MCC. Due to the rarity of these exposures (HIV Pc = 0.4%; Transplant Pc = 1.9%), only 0.2% of MCC cases were attributable to HIV and 1.7% were attributable to organ transplantation. Compared with people in other racial\/ethnic groups, the IRRs of non-Hispanic White individuals at the various levels of ambient UVR for MCC arising on the head and neck ranged from 4.24 to 5.03 and for other primary sites ranged from 2.81 to 3.36. After combining the PAFs for these sites, the overall PAF for UVR was 65.8%. Meta-analyzing 20 studies with 984 MCC cases combined, we found that 66.1% (CI: 58.0-72.2%) of MCCs were attributable to MCPyV.<br \/>Conclusions:<b>&nbsp;<\/b>While a small proportion of MCCs were due to immunosuppression from HIV infection and organ transplantation, UVR and MCPyV played a major role in MCC burden.

This limitation can obscure vital insights into how cancer risks vary across races, ethnicities, or exposures. This study was designed with the purpose of examining associations between pre-diagnostic immune cell profiles and cancer risk in Black participants.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In this study, DNA methylation was measured in blood samples collected between 1993 and 1995 from a subset of 2,467 Black participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) prospective cohort study. Immune cell subtype proportions were estimated using deconvolution based on leukocyte DNA methylation markers. The analysis included 668 incident cancers ascertained between time of blood draw and 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the association between immune cell subtype proportions and cancer incidence (all cancers; lung, breast, and prostate cancers). Models controlled for age, sex, BMI, self-reported smoking status, self-reported and methylation-derived smoking pack-years, postmenopausal hormone use, and batch effect, along with other cancer-specific factors.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Increased T regulatory cell (Treg) proportions were associated with significantly higher risk of lung cancer (HR: 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.41 per percent increase; n = 84 cases) and suggestively higher risk of all cancers. Increased B memory cell proportions were associated with significantly higher risk of prostate cancer (HR: 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.33; n = 173 cases), all cancers (HR: 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.22), and suggestively higher risk of lung cancer. Increased CD8+ na&#239;ve cell proportions were associated with suggestively lower risk of lung cancer and all cancers, and significantly lower risk of all cancers in participants over the median age of 55 years (HR: 0.91, 95% CI = 0.83, 0.98). Cancer risks for other immune cell subtypes were null.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These results in Black participants align closely with prior findings in largely White populations. Deconvolution allowed for the extension of work on cancer immunity (which has largely focused on major immune cell types) to immune cell subtypes like B memory cells and CD8+ na&#239;ve cells. The results are consistent with Tregs initiating and accelerating cancer development by impeding the usual protective immune response. A large reservoir of CD8+ na&#239;ve cells may allow for a more targeted and efficient elimination of malignant clones. Further studies should assess these relationships in other cancer types and better elucidate the interplay of B cells in theorized mechanistic processes.

This study aimed to investigate the proportion of cancer incidence attributable to infectious agents in the Korean population as of 2020.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>We organized the Consensus Committee to establish strategy and methodology of PAF estimation. Based on the consensus, infectious agents and cancer sites for PAF estimation were selected according to the IARC List of classification with sufficient evidence in human. As a result, infectious agents included hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV), <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> (<i>H. pylori<\/i>), human papilloma virus (HPV), <i>Clonorchis sinensis<\/i> (<i>C.sinensis<\/i>), Epstein Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and cancer sites included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The PAF was calculated by using Levin&#8217;s formula including exposure prevalence and relative risks (RRs). Exposure prevalence data were collected from literature review of studies in Korean population in 2005 or earlier, assuming at least 15 years of latent period from risk exposure to cancer development. We performed systematic review for cohort studies and case-control studies which investigated RRs or ORs of cancer due to infectious agents in Korean population. Pooled RRs were estimated by meta-analysis of RRs or ORs by using random-effects model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The fractions of all cancer incidence attributable to infectious agents were estimated to be 13.5% and 7.1% in men and women, respectively. The reduction in PAFs of cancer incidence due to infection in 2020 compared to 2009 is considered due to decrease in exposure prevalence. The major findings regarding infectious agents with large PAFs are as the following. We found that the fractions of HCC cases attributable to HBV infection were 47.7% and 38.4% for cancer incidence in men and women, respectively. The estimated PAFs of gastric cancer due to <i>H. pylori<\/i> were 40.4% in men and 38.2% in women. <i>C. sinensis<\/i> was related to 9.8% of CCC cases in men and 5.2% in women. A total of 77.7% of cervical cancer incidence was attributed to HPV infection.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Although<b> <\/b>the total PAF due to infection has decreased over the last decade, infection still contributes a substantial fraction to cancer incidence in Korea.

On an ecological level, Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) demonstrated that lifetime risk of solid tumor cancer types were strongly correlated with total number of stem cell divisions estimated from tissue-specific cell lines. Recently, several mitotic clocks (MC) have been developed to estimate stem cell division rates (SCDR) based on whole-genome methylation arrays. Here, we compare estimated SCDR for several tissue types with tissue-specific cancer incidence and lifetime risk estimates. Furthermore, we assess the link between SCDR with cancer progression and survival.<br \/>Array-based methylation data derived from normal adjacent tissue in TCGA was used to estimate SCDR for 15 cancer types. A Pearson correlation test was performed to assess the association between SCDR and cancer-specific incidence and lifetime risk for each cancer type overall and stratified by self-reported race (<i>e.g.<\/i> White and Black). SCDR was estimated in tumors from TCGA for 4 common cancers and subtypes: breast (BRCA), prostate (PRAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). A Spearman correlation test was used to identify potential trends between SCDR and pathological stage. Cox proportional hazard (PH) models adjusted for age at diagnosis and treatment status (<i>e.g.<\/i> surgery, radiation, <i>etc.<\/i>) were used to evaluate the association of time to death with SCDR terciles across different cancer stages.<br \/>We observed a similar trend between SCDR and overall incidence (cor=0.61, p=0.01), aligning with earlier findings. Stratified-specific trends between cancer incidence and SCDR was consistent for both Black and White populations (cor=0.62 vs 0.66). Tumor analysis revealed a significant correlation between SCDR and pathological stage (<i>e.g. <\/i>stage 1, 2, and 3\/4) for BRCA (p&#60;0.001) and pathological stage (<i>e.g.<\/i> stage 2, 3 and 4) for PRAD (p&#60;0.001), suggesting its potential as a marker of cancer progression. However, the correlation between LUAD, LUSC and pathological stage was insignificant. Based on Cox PH model, within stage III BRCA, SCDR significantly contributed to explaining variability in survival (p=0.04), emphasizing its potential prognostic value beyond cancer stage.<br \/>Our study supports earlier findings applying methylation based SCDR estimates and shows that this association is consistent across racial groups. This implies that SCDR may act as a biological marker of a combination of various genetic and environmental risk factors underlying disease etiology. Further analyses will be extended to all cancers in TCGA. Lastly, we demonstrate that MC-based SCDR estimation has the potential to serve as a clinical tool to identify individuals at elevated risk of cancer initiation, track progression, and complement cancer stage for predicting survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-01 Aging as a risk factor,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cancer risk,Cancer progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

We evaluated the influence of age on the clinical presentation and outcomes among newly diagnosed patients with MM to optimize risk stratification.<br \/>Methods:<i> <\/i>In 850 patients with first primary confirmed MM prospectively enrolled in the Integrative Molecular And Genetic Epidemiology (IMAGE) study (2009-2020), we evaluated the presence of diagnostic myeloma-defining events (MDE), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by young age at diagnosis (&#8804;50 years). We evaluated the association of young age with the prevalence of diagnostic MDE, clinical features and chromosomal abnormalities using the prevalence odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated from multivariable logistic regression. Median PFS and OS were graphically examined using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests used to compare survival by diagnostic age group. Risks of disease progression and all-cause mortality were estimated using hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CI calculated from multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.<br \/>Results.: Of the 850 patients, 15.4% were diagnosed at &#8804;50 years of age, 54% were male and 40% self-identified as Black. Compared to patients diagnosed with MM over the age of 50, young patients were more likely to self-identify as Black (59.5% vs 40.5%; P&#60;0.0001) and to report a negative smoking history (66.2% v 56.4%; P=0.01), and less likely to present with age-dependent comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus type II (P&#8804;0.0001). In multivariable analyses, young patients, compared to older patients, were more likely to present at diagnosis with higher median percent bone marrow plasma cells (70% v 55%; P=0.02) and to undergo autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as part of their first-line treatment (82.0% v 67.6%; P=0.01) after controlling for sex, race, body mass index, smoking status and comorbidities. We did not observe significant associations of young age with the prevalence of any other MDE, clinical feature or chromosomal abnormality evaluated. The median OS was 106.9 months (range, 0.23-356.1). OS was significantly longer in young patients with MM compared to patients aged greater than 50 years (159 v 99 months, respectively; P&#60;0.001) leading to a suggestive 1.5-fold decreased risk of mortality among younger newly diagnosed patients (HR=0.67, 95% CI 0.39-1.14; P=0.14) after adjusting for sex, International Staging System-stage, adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, and ASCT.

Delayed or incomplete ARLI is linked with increased postmenopausal breast cancer susceptibility.This study focuses on unraveling the molecular mechanisms of ARLI, drawing parallels with the well-characterized postpartum involution (PPI). Our aim was to discover biomarkers differentiating women who progressed through ARLI from those with stagnant ARLI.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We utilized the Mayo Clinic Benign Breast Disease (BBD) cohort, analyzing 108 perimenopausal women aged 45-55 who had a subsequent benign biopsy between 2-15 years later. We assessed Lobular Involution (Ll) status by comparing the number and size of lobules in initial and subsequent biopsies. RNA profiling of initial biopsies was performed using NanoString 10360 and BC360, identifying differentially expressed genes between ARLI progression and stagnation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) mapped the expression of these biomarkers in epithelial lobules.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified 37 genes with significant differential expression, highlighting Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR) as upregulated in ARLI stagnant samples. LIFR, part of the IL-6 cytokine signaling pathway, is known for its role in the induction of apoptosis during PPI via pSTAT3 activation. Our IHC analyses of initial biopsies of women who differentially progress through ARLI confirmed differential expression of LIFR that is coordinately regulated with pSTAT3.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings reveal significant parallels between ARLI and PPI. Future research will assess how LIFR\/pSTAT3 signaling is linked to induction of apoptotic markers in perimenopausal women and will investigate how anomalies in the LIFR\/pSTAT3 pathway might contribute to heightened breast cancer risk in women with delayed or incomplete ARLI. This study not only sheds light on the complex biological processes of aging in breast tissue but also opens new avenues for breast cancer risk assessment and prevention strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-01 Aging as a risk factor,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immune cells,Aging,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

MPB has similar risk factors with prostate cancer (PrCa) including advancing age, family history, and sex hormones. Several studies have examined the associations between MPB and PrCa but the evidence remains unclear. We carried out a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies that examined the relationship between patterns of baldness: frontal, vertex, or both and PrCa risk.<br \/>Methods: A literature search was performed in October 2022 using PubMed and Web of Science databases for epidemiological studies published between 1\/1\/2000 and 10\/31\/2022, which examined the above hypothesis. From each eligible study, relevant data were extracted on study design, population, sample size, prevalence of MPB at various ages, and corresponding associations with risks of total and aggressive PrCa. Pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by I<sup>2<\/sup> statistic.<br \/>Results: A total of 14 studies: 14,573 cases and 132,434 controls\/non-cases were included. The prevalence of MPB increased from 5% to 70% with aging and varied across studies. Vertex MPB at ages 40 years or older was associated with a pooled RR of 1.08 (95%CI 1.00-1.17) of total PrCa, but there was no association with frontal MPB. The onset of MBP at younger ages was also associated with RR=1.10 (95% CI 0.93 - 1.29) of PrCa, although results were not statistically significant. Results were similar when data were stratified by clinical features of PrCa, although there was large heterogeneity in the definition of aggressive PrCa across studies.<br \/>Conclusions: Men with vertex MPB may have modest increased risk of PrCa. However, the majority of studies were conducted in Caucasian men and they did not evaluate effect modifications by genetic variations in androgen metabolism pathway genes or changes in serum levels of androgens. Further, large well-designed prospective cohort studies are needed to better understand the complex relationship between genetic susceptibility, endogenous hormones, MBP and risk of PrCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-01 Aging as a risk factor,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen,Epidemiology,Hormone-related cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Reduced naive T cell generation and a rise in immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells are hallmarks of aging, which are strongly correlated with advanced cancer stage. Aging also alters host and cellular metabolism, which can influence Treg number and function. Although metabolic alterations are known to impact ant-tumor immune response, the relationship between age-related metabolic dysfunction and immune cells is not fully understood. We utilized young (2 months) and old (18 months) female C57\/B6 mice, and were injected intraperitoneally with 5x10<sup>6<\/sup> mouse epithelial ovarian cancer ID8<sup>p53-\/-<\/sup> cells. Old mice with EOC showed decreased survival compared to young mice (median survival 49 vs 65 days). Old mice with EOC presented with decreased CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, but a significant increase in CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD25+FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> Treg cells in tumor micro environment (TME) and in blood. The Tregs from old mice displayed enhanced expression of IL10 and TGF&#946;, which corelated with their increased suppression of CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to Tregs isolated from young EOC mice. The CD4+ and CD8+ T cells also displayed decreased effector makers including CD4+IFN&#947;, CD8+IFN&#947; and CD8+ Granzyme B, compared to young EOC mice in TME and in blood. The tumor promoting role of Treg was validated by depleting Tregs using anti-CD25 antibody which resulted in decreased tumor burden and improved overall survival, of both young and old mice, more significantly in old EOC mice. Tregs from old mice with EOC displayed enhanced metabolic activity, reflected in increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared to young EOC mice. Further, on inhibition of OXPHOS, the Tregs from old mice showed decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers Foxp3 and IL10. Targeted metabolomics of TCA cycle in the Tregs, revealed a 5-fold increase in succinate levels in old EOC Tregs compared to young. Succinate treatment enhanced the immunosuppressive Treg function along with an increase in levels of IL10 and TGF&#946;, while inhibition of succinate synthesis reversed the increase in FOXP3, IL10 and TGF&#946;. We identified fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a hormone essential for T cell development, to be significantly decreased in ascites and plasma, of old mice. Supplementing FGF21 decreased Treg survival, number, and suppressive ability, resulting in increased CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells in aged EOC mice. FGF21 treatment decreased OXPHOS and succinate levels in aged Tregs. Overall, our observations indicate Tregs to be vital in driving aggressive EOC in old mice. The hyper-suppressive Tregs in old mice reprogram succinate metabolism to drive their suppressive ability which may be negatively regulated by FGF21. Thus, Treg-succinate-FGF21 may be a potential actionable pathway in precision targeting of EOC in the older population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-01 Aging as a risk factor,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Ovarian cancer,Tregulatory cells,Succinate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

These sites have previously been associated with adverse health outcomes, including an increased incidence of cancer. Historically, communities with racial and ethnic minorities and people of low socioeconomic status have served as prime locations for these sites, as these communities have lacked the ability to advocate against this land use. Here, we ask whether racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these sites or other regions of hazardous waste in our catchment area at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and in the state of Ohio. Further, we are examining whether areas of high exposure are associated with adverse health outcomes including higher cancer incidence and mortality. We utilized the Environmental Justice Index (EJI) database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess, on a census tract level, the percent of racial and ethnic minorities in a region, defined as all persons except white, non-Hispanic individuals. We also queried hazardous and toxic waste sites including regions with a national priority list site, a toxic release inventory site, treatment, storage, and disposal sites, risk management plan sites, coal mines, and lead mines. We intersected these data and found that census tracts with a higher percentage of minority persons were more likely to be exposed to hazardous and toxic sites. Our current studies are assessing whether this high environmental burden is contributing to disproportionately worse cancer burden for these individuals. We will test this by comparing EJI data with data from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System database to assess cancer incidence and mortality in Ohio. This will also provide an avenue for identifying specific exposures that may contribute to different cancer types. Further, we plan to assess if persons with low socioeconomic status or those living with disabilities are disproportionately affected by environmental burden. Overall, understanding environmental burden and health outcomes will facilitate the prioritization of communities at greatest need, contributing to greater health equity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
