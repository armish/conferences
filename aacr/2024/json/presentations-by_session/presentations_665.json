SKB264 (MK-2870) is a TROP2 ADC developed with a novel linker to conjugate the payload, a belotecan-derivative topoisomerase I inhibitor. The linker is affected by both extracellular pH-sensitive cleavage and intracellular enzymatic cleavage within tumor cells, which leads to efficiently release payload inside tumor cells as well as within tumor microenvironment to exert its anti-tumor effects. Here, we report the preliminary results from a Phase 2 expansion cohort in pts with advanced G\/GEJ cancer.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Pts with previously treated inoperable advanced G\/GEJ adenocarcinoma were enrolled to receive SKB264 monotherapy at 5 mg\/kg Q2W until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in Phase 2 expansion cohort of KL264-01 study (NCT04152499). Pts with heavily pre-treated G\/GEJ cancer were enrolled first, and then the cohort was amended to enroll pts with only one prior therapy of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1\/L1 therapy. Tumor assessment was performed every 8 weeks per RECIST v1.1 assessed by investigator.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At data cutoff date (Nov 22, 2023), a total of 48 pts were enrolled and followed up for at least 9 weeks. 24 pts (50.0%) had received one prior line of therapy (2L), while 24 pts (50.0%) had received &#8805; 2 prior lines of therapy (3L+). 40 pts (83.3%) had received prior anti-PD-1\/L1 inhibitors. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of &#8805; Grade 3 were reported in 52.1% of pts. The most common &#8805; Grade 3 TRAEs (occurred in &#8805;5% of pts) were anemia (20.8%), neutrophil count decreased (18.8%), WBC decreased (12.5%) and neutropenia (6.3%). TRAEs leading to dose reduction and dose delay occurred in 18.8% and 33.3% of pts, respectively. No TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation or deaths occurred. No neuropathy or drug-related ILD\/pneumonitis was reported. Of 41 response-evaluable pts (defined as &#8805; 1 on-study scans), the ORR was 22.0% (9 PRs, 2 pending confirmation) and disease control rate (DCR) was 80.5%. The ORRs in the 2L and 3L+ setting were 27.3% (including 2 pending confirmation) and 15.8%, respectively. Median duration of response (DoR) was 7.5 months (mos). In the subset of 3L+ pts (n=24 including 54.2% of pts with &#8805; 4 prior lines of therapy) with more mature follow-up (median follow up of 14.6 mos), median progression free survival (mPFS) was 3.7 mos (95% Cl: 2.6, 5.4); median overall survival (mOS) was 7.6 mos (95% Cl: 5.3, 15.5) with 12-mo OS rate of 32.6%.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The preliminary data suggests that pts with heavily pre-treated advanced G\/GEJ cancer could achieve durable response and potentially prolonged OS from SKB264 monotherapy, with a manageable safety profile. A Phase 3 global study of SKB264 monotherapy vs SOC in 3L+ G\/GEJ adenocarcinoma is being planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),GC,SKB264,Trop-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We have recently demonstrated that pro-tumoral SIRP&#945;+ macrophages may mediate resistance to lenalidomide and rituximab (R<sup>2<\/sup>) in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (RR) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Evorpacept (ALX148) is a novel high-affinity CD47 blocker that abrogates the &#8216;do-not-eat-me signal&#8217; provided to SIRP&#945;+ macrophages. In a phase I trial including 33 pts with RR B-NHL it was well tolerated in combination with rituximab. We hypothesized that evorpacept and R<sup>2<\/sup> will be synergistic, and the combination will be safe and effective for the treatment of pts with RR B-NHL.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. This single arm phase I study (NCT05025800) was conducted between 11\/2021 and 9\/2023 (data cut-off 12\/2023). Adult pts with RR B-NHL who had received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (1 in case of indolent B-NHL [iNHL]) were included. Evorpacept was administered intravenously (IV), in a 28-day cycle, for 12 cycles, at two dose levels (DL): 30 mg\/Kg on day (D) 1 and D15 (DL1), or 60 mg\/Kg on day 1 (DL2); rituximab IV was given weekly during cycle 1, and on D1 during cycles 2-6; lenalidomide was given orally on D1-21 during cycles 1-6. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated according to CTCAE v5 during cycle 1 and a Bayesian Optimal Interval design was used, with a target DLT rate of 0.3. Response was assessed according to Lugano 2014 criteria.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. Twenty pts were included in the study. Median age was 61 (27-85), 10 (50%) were male, and 7 (35%) were non-white; 15 (75%) had follicular lymphoma, 3 (15%) marginal zone lymphoma, 1 (5%) mantle cell lymphoma, and 1 (5%) Richter Syndrome; 20 (100%) had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, 13 (72%) chemoimmunotherapy, and 15\/18 (83%) iNHL pts had intermediate-high FLIPI. Three pts were treated at DL1, 17 at DL2, and no DLT was observed. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included: neutropenia (55%), infections (30%), ALT increase (15%), AST increase (10%), skin rash (10%), and anemia (10%). Eight (40%) pts experienced a cycle delay, mainly due to grade (G) 1 AST\/ALT elevation; 6 (30%) required a dose reduction for lenalidomide, none for evorpacept; 1 pt discontinued treatment after 1 cycle due to G3 lenalidomide-associated myocarditis. Sixteen (80%) pts achieved CR and best overall response rate was 90%. After a median follow-up of 16 months (95% CI, 12-20 months), 1-year PFS rate was 70% and 1-year OS rate was 90%.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. The combination of evorpacept and R<sup>2<\/sup> is well tolerated in pts with RR B-NHL, with similar toxicity and promising anti-tumoral activity as compared to historical CR rates with R<sup>2<\/sup> alone (34%). Bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence are being performed on tissue biopsies collected before and during treatment, to characterize its effects on the tumor immune microenvironment. A phase 2 study investigating its efficacy in pts with previously untreated iNHL is now enrolling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Lenalidomide,CD47,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Additionally, GSTP has a chaperone function which regulates key oncogenic pathways such as the KRAS and JNK. Since redundant pathways could compensate for the inhibition of a single kinase, targeting multiple pathways may lead to more effective therapy. NBF-006 is a novel drug product comprised of GSTP siRNA encapsulated within a proprietary lipid nanoparticle. It is designed to deliver siRNA to localized and metastatic lung tumors. As GSTP downregulation leads to inhibition of KRAS signaling through modulation of both MAPK and PI3K pathways, NBF-006 is being developed to treat KRAS mutant tumors. <b> <\/b> NBF-006-001 is a first-in-human dose escalation and expansion study evaluating safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of NBF-006 administered intravenously. The dose escalation phase enrolled 21 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic, or colorectal cancer. No DLTs or treatment-related SAEs were observed. NSCLC disease control rate of 55% (6\/11) was observed in heavily pre-treated patient population, warranting further investigations. Final results from the dose escalation and expansion of NBF-006-001 are reported here. <b>Results<br \/><\/b>Thirty-eight NSCLC patients, with or without KRAS mutation, received treatment at 0.3 mg\/kg [n=1], 0.6 mg\/kg [n=12], 1.2 mg\/kg [n=14], or 1.6 mg\/kg [n=11]. NBF-006 was well tolerated with no treatment-related grade 4-5 AEs, SAEs, or DLTs. Two grade 3 events were assessed as possibly related to study treatment, anemia and bilateral pleural effusions (both at 0.6 mg\/kg). The most common NBF-006-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions (IRRs) (18 %) and nausea (11 %). IRRs (n=8 in seven patients), occurred in the first cycle and were well-managed. One patient discontinued due to recurring IRR. Cytokine elevation was only noted in this patient. No clinically meaningful complement activation nor ADA response has been observed. Linear PK (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> ~41 hrs) was observed with dose proportional increases up to 1.6 mg\/kg without exposure accumulation or reduction after repeat doses. GSTP mRNA knock-down in PBMCs was statistically significant at 1.2 and 1.6 mg\/kg dose levels. Patients had received 1-7 prior lines of therapy (1 line [n=10], 2 lines [n=10], and &#8805; 3 lines [n=16] respectively). Two patients (1.2 and 1.6 mg\/kg) experienced a durable PR, 17 patients experienced SD. The disease control rate is 19\/38 (59%). Patient enrichment strategies were evaluated with interesting trends observed.<br \/><b>Conclusion<br \/><\/b>NBF-006 is well tolerated up to 1.6 mg\/kg dose level for over a year with early signs of efficacy in heavily pre-treated pan-KRAS mutant NSCLC patients. The results suggest that further clinical development of NBF-006, alone or in combination with standard therapy, is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,KRAS,GSTP1,siRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

To test this hypothesis, this Phase 0\/1b study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD1390, a first-in-class ATM inhibitor, in combination with radiation in newly-diagnosed GBM patients (NCT05182905).<br \/>Methods: Presumed newly-diagnosed GBM patients received 3 days of AZD1390 prior to planned resection at 4-6 or 23-25 hours following the final dose. Tumor tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma were collected. Total and unbound drug concentrations were measured using validated LC-MS\/MS methods. A PK &#8216;trigger&#8217; determined eligibility for the therapeutic expansion phase. ATM inhibition was assessed via <i>ex vivo <\/i>tissue radiation, quantifying pRAD50 levels compared to non-radiated control. Patients exceeding the PK threshold (2 nM unbound drug levels in Gd-non-enhancing tumor region) with unmethylated MGMT promoter were eligible for the expansion phase of study drug, combining AZD1390 with 6 weeks of radiotherapy.<br \/>Results: Seventeen patients were enrolled into the study. All tested patients (n=14) exceeded the PK threshold and qualified for the expansion phase. Three patients were excluded from the PK analysis due to dosing deviation (n=1) and non-GBM diagnosis (n=2). The mean unbound concentration of AZD1390 in Gd-nonenhancing tumor was 12.4 and 4.4 pmol\/g, respectively, for the 4-6 and 23-25-hours cohort. Following 5Gy <i>ex vivo<\/i> radiation of surgical specimen, pRAD50 expression was significantly suppressed in AZD1390 treated patients compared to untreated controls (median 0.2% for 4-6-hours cohorts and 1.9% for 23-25-hours cohort vs 32.3% for control cohort, average 99% and 95% reduction, respectively, p&#60;0.01 for both cohorts vs control). As of 11\/30\/2023, 3 patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter are undergoing therapeutic dosing of AZD1390 plus radiotherapy, with median clinical follow-up of 2.3 months.<br \/>Conclusion: AZD1390 is well-tolerated in newly-diagnosed GBM patients, achieving pharmacologically relevant concentrations in Gd-nonenhancing tumor tissue, and substantially suppressing radiation-induced increases in pRAD50 levels. These data are the first in GBM patients demonstrating AZD1390-mediated pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase 0 clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,ATM inhibitor \/ ATM Kinase,Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.
