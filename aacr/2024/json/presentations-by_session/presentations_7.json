Deep learning can extract subtle visual features from complex image data. A particularly suitable application of deep learning is in the analysis of cancer histopathology slides. Tissue slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin are ubiquitously available for any patient with a solid tumor, and deep learning can extract quantitative information from digitized tissue slides. While classical digital pathology approaches are concerned with the quantification of cells and segmentation of tissues, contemporaneous 'end-to-end' deep learning approaches can directly predict biologically and clinically relevant properties of tumors.<br \/>This presentation will demonstrate how deep learning can be used to derive prognostic and predictive biomarkers from routine pathology slides. A particular focus will be placed on deep learning models that can directly influence clinical decision-making in precision oncology, for example by predicting the response to cancer immunotherapy. Also, the presentation will explore how deep learning models can enhance our understanding of cancer biology and thus directly contribute to scientific discovery.<br \/>Finally, the talk will cover recent technical advancements such as foundation models, multimodal models, and large language models. These developments enable us to tackle biomarker prediction challenges that were previously difficult to solve.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Biomarkers,Histopathology,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jakob Nikolas Kather<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, many cancer-relevant genes encode proteins that remain poorly characterized and lack selective small-molecule probes, with some even being considered classically undruggable. To address these problems, we have introduced activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), a chemical proteomic technology that globally profiles the functional state and small molecule interactions of proteins in native biological systems. In this lecture, I will describe the application of ABPP to generate covalent small molecule interaction (or ligandability) maps of cancer proteomes and how this information can guide the discovery of first-in-class chemical probes and drug candidates for cancer-relevant proteins. Key themes will include: 1) the importance of assaying cancer proteins in endogenous environments to realize their full small molecule interaction potential; 2) the capacity of covalent chemistry coupled with ABPP to extend the druggability of the proteome to reach historically challenging target families like adaptor\/scaffolding proteins and transcription factors; and 3) the remarkably diverse ways that allosteric small molecules can regulate protein function in cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Target identification, small molecule probes, and libraries,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Drug discovery,Proteomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin F.
