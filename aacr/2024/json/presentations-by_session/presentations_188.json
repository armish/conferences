In sporadic cancers this is due to the requirement for longitudinal sampling to study this occult process, which occurs over years to decades. Individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) possess a germline APC mutation, leading to hundreds of colonic polyps in adolescence and a 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer. Resected colons from FAP patients contain normal mucosa, benign and dysplastic polyps that embed the natural history of colorectal tumorigenesis at different points of malignant progression. Through genome sequencing of 127 independent polyps or mucosa samples from six FAP patients, we characterized the genomic landscape, relative timing of somatic alterations, and clonal dynamics in normal, dysplastic, and invasive colon tissue. Comparison with multi-region sequencing data from FAP patients and sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas indicates similar molecular profiles, with canonical cancer driver genes present across benign and dysplastic premalignant lesions and shared mutational orders. Pairwise sample comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions revealed extensive heterogeneity and subclonal sharing within a patient&#8217;s benign and dysplastic lesions, irrespective of location in the colon. These data imply that polyps were initiated from multiple cells from distinct lineages whose most recent common ancestor arose during development. We corroborate these findings using a mechanistic mathematical model, which infers polyclonality in 100% of benign and 83% of dysplastic samples. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual model of the multi-ancestral origin of intestinal malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Clonal evolution,Cancer initiating cells,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

A key player in this process is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), known for its role in enhancing cancer cell adaptability, resistance to treatment, and metastasis. Our study focuses on EMT within PDAC, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics to explore how the tumor microenvironment influences changes in cellular states. We introduce a novel method involving Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to categorize EMT stages in single-cell data and utilize deep learning for label transfer of these tumor cell states, including intermediate cell states, onto spatial transcriptomic data with limited gene panels and sparse count profiles. We find strong spatial autocorrelation of classical cells and a dispersion of basal cells alongside other cells at intermediate stages of the EMT spectrum. By leveraging the spatial proximity of clonally related cells, we confirm that cells transition along the EMT spectrum in a gradient and infer transition rates. We next leverage density gradients of tumor cells in different states to identify distinct neighborhoods with varying EMT subtype composition. We observe significant variations in cell density among different EMT states. A focus on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages reveals differences in these cells across density contours. We also examine differential ligand-receptor interactions across cell state gradients to better understand the cellular interactions that drive EMT transitions and alter the tumor environment. By leveraging spatial transcriptomics, this research aims to provide new biological insights into PDAC intratumoral heterogeneity, potentially leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to disrupt treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

RMC-7977 is a potent inhibitor of GTP-bound RAS proteins (RAS(ON)), including both wild type and mutant variants of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS. The related investigational agent, RMC-6236, is a first-in-class, potent, orally bioavailable, RAS<sup>MULTI<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor currently in Phase 1\/1b clinical trials (NCT05379985). We performed preclinical studies in a range of models of PDAC, including the highly chemoresistant K-ras<sup>LSL.G12D\/+<\/sup>, p53<sup>LSL.R172H\/+<\/sup>, Pdx1Cre<sup>tg\/+<\/sup> (KPC) genetically engineered mouse. RMC-7977 exhibited broad anti-tumor activity at tolerable doses, provoking radiographic responses in KPC pancreatic tumors and extending overall survival by 3-fold, the largest response observed yet in this model. RMC-7977 dosing produced a metronomic effect on RAS signaling in tumor and normal tissues, with full pathway inhibition at 4 hours post treatment that was restored by 24 hours. This pattern yielded tumor-selective effects on apoptosis and proliferation, consistent with RAS oncogene addition in PDAC. To understand the dynamic response of malignant cells following RAS-GTP inhibition, we did single cell RNA sequencing on KPC pancreatic tumors treated with RMC-7977 or vehicle at multiple timepoints. Using the ARACNe and VIPER algorithms [Maroling., et al. 2006; Alvarez., et al. 2016], we performed regulatory network analysis on the expression profiles of &#62;210,000 cells to calculate the activities of &#62;5000 transcriptional regulatory proteins per cell. Additionally, we assessed the impact of treatment on malignant cell subtypes as previously identified by our team based on their sets of hyperactivated developmental transcription factors [Laise., et al. 2022].<br \/>As expected, RAS pathway transcription factors, such as FOS and JUN, were repressed relative to controls in malignant cells by 4 hours after treatment with RMC-7977. However, at 24 hours, responses varied by cellular subtype: well-differentiated Gastrointestinal Lineage State (GLS) cells had restored MAPK activity, while poorly differentiated Morphogenic State (MOS) cells were still inactivated. Strikingly, we found that after one week of treatment (in actively regressing tumors, representing a state of residual disease), nearly all malignant cells had assumed the GLS state. Acquisition of resistance after weeks or months of treatment was associated with a restored diversity of malignant cell states, suggesting that the GLS state serves as a regulatory &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; in which residual malignant cells can undergo evolution and adaptation. Mechanistically, we found that RAS pathway signaling directly activates transcriptional regulators that drive the MOS state, elucidating an early adaptive response to RAS-GTP inhibition that enables residual cells to survive treatment prior to development of acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Inhibitors,KRAS,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Characterization of GBM through gene expression profiling and DNA sequencing has identified disease subgroups and commonly altered genes and pathways, including alterations in the genes encoding neurofibromin-1 (<i>NF1<\/i>) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR<\/i>). <i>NF1<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> are involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), RAS\/MEK\/ERK, and PI3K signaling, and together, are genetically altered in over 60% of adult GBMs. Interestingly, <i>NF1<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations in GBM are almost always mutually exclusive. Here, we designed a multimodal approach integrating spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics to measure cell composition, immune cell function, cancer cell signaling, cellular spatial organization, gene expression, transcriptional subtypes, and genome alterations in 80 <i>NF1<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> altered human GBMs with extensively curated treatment and survival data. We quantified the spatial expression of 42 proteins in over 31 million single cells measuring RTK\/RAS\/PI3K and Rb signaling and features of the TME, including 23 cell types covering tumor cells, immune cells, and brain resident cells. In addition to tumor genotype labels, we classified each GBM tumor by its transcriptional subtype (i.e., mesenchymal, classical, or proneural). We identified genotype-phenotype associations in GBM including hyperactive RAS signaling cellular niches, a macrophage-rich TME, and an epithelial-mesenchymal signature in <i>NF1<\/i> altered tumors and hyperactive RTK signaling and an immune desert TME in <i>EGFR<\/i> amplified tumors. Furthermore, we observed spatial heterogeneity in cancer cell signaling patterns suggestive of the presence of different tumor cell clones within different regions of each GBM tumor. Together, we identify several genotype-associated features of GBMs, reinforcing the value of integrating spatial multi-omic data for generation of genotype-driven therapeutic hypotheses, with implications for GBM genotype-based therapeutic stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Tumor microenvironment,Signaling pathways,Spatial biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

To understand chemoresistance, it has been proposed that the spatial interactions between cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) could offer insights into the differential response to therapy and metastatic potential. Thus, this study utilizes spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) to profile the spatial interactions in TNBC TME. With the goal of understanding chemoresistance and providing a proof-of-concept for new technology, we launched a longitudinal SRT study of a TNBC PDX of residual disease before, during, and after adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) treatment (Tx). SRT by 10X Visium was performed on Veh, AC-residual tumor (21 d post-Tx), and AC-regrown tumor (50 d post-Tx when tumors regrew). This study is divided into two parts. 1. Due to the lack of specialized tools for processing xenograft reads from SRT, we developed the Xenomake pipeline, which combines xenograft sorting and spatial barcode demultiplexing to assign reads into the host and graft organisms per spatial spot. It permits clustering the spots into stroma-rich (mouse), and epithelial-rich (human) regions. We show that it can find differential cytokines in the stroma (S) and epithelium (E), and finding SS, EE, and SE interactions. 2. Although using PDX necessitates immune-compromised mice, several types of stromal populations are present and analyzable. Thus, using Xenomake, we inferred the localization of stromal cell types in Visium spots including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF), macrophages (MP), endothelial (ENDO), monocytes, and perivascular cells. We compared the spatial localization profiles (SLP) of stromal cell types across samples. With human reads, we computed the spatial pathway activity map (SPAM) for HALLMARK pathways. We correlated SPAM with stroma cell type SLP to survey stroma-epithelial interactions. Stroma cells are distributed in the tumor periphery in vehicle and AC50, while in AC21 there is a notable increase in stroma abundance and stroma infiltration within tumor mass. SLP of MP (Cd68+ and Csf1r+) is correlated with ENDO (Pecam1+), and CAF (Acta2+ and Pdgfrb+). Additionally, all 3 cell types are correlated with Vim and Cd44 expression. Although all samples show enrichment of MP, ENDO, and CAF, they interact differently with pathway activities of adjacent epithelial cells. In vehicle and AC50, the 3 cell types are colocalized with OXPHOS, MYC targets, E2F pathway, while in AC21, a switch to colocalization with EMT is observed. Further, hypoxia response and glycolysis display anti-correlation with stroma cell types, meaning that these pathway activities are further away from stroma and occupy distinct territories.

Recent single-cell genomics studies have identified the G3\/4 MB cell of origin and point to disrupted stem-cell differentiation as a key factor in MB pathogenesis. However, surprisingly little is known about the contribution of tumor-supportive paracrine signaling to the ontogeny of this disease. The spatial organization of MB cellular hierarchies is not completely understood. We profiled N=24 G3\/4 MBs from UCSF patients via single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Of these cases, N=10 were profiled via single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (scATAC-seq). To capture the spatial context, we profiled an additional 20 samples via spatial transcriptomics using the Visium and Xenium platforms. We found that the standard Xenium brain capture set was inadequate, and we developed a highly specific capture set for G3\/4 MBs. In particular, our panel resolves cell-type differences in the stage of MB lineage commitment, from rhombic-lip progenitors to more differentiated unipolar brush-like cells. Altogether, over 110,000 nuclear-sequencing libraries and over 1,898,000 spatially-resolved single-cell libraries were generated. We inferred cell-cell communication signals from our snRNA-seq data by identifying co-expressed receptors and their cognate ligands. We then performed an integrated analysis of our snRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to infer the cis-regulatory enhancers of those signaling genes, as well as the transcription factors that bind them. We employed our spatial transcriptomics data to confirm paracrine signaling networks inferred from nuclear-sequencing data. We found that distinct MB cell types corresponding to different stages of differentiation occupied specific spatial domains. The results of our ongoing analysis of this spatially-resolved single-cell atlas will be presented. This study paves the way for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting paracrine signaling in G3\/4 MB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Multiomics,Paracrine,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

These features are able to drive emergent properties such as chemoresistance through diverse and not yet fully elucidated mechanisms. Through single-nucleus RNA-seq and whole-transcriptome digital spatial profiling of PDAC patient tumors, we previously reported marked heterogeneity in the malignant cells and CAF composition of PDAC. In this project, we performed high-plex single-cell spatial molecular imaging (990-plex SMI, Nanostring) to dissect the therapy-remodeled multicellular neighborhoods and malignant-stroma cell interactions in primary resected human pancreatic cancer with (n = 6) or without (n = 7) neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. SMI of the PDAC samples yielded ~753,000 high-confidence single cells and captured the heterogeneity of malignant cells and CAFs. We identified three malignant subtypes: classical (CLS), basal-like (BSL), and the recently characterized neural-like progenitor (NRP) malignant subtype that exhibits stem-like and neurodevelopmental features. To leverage the single-cell spatial resolution of SMI to further dissect treatment-associated changes in cell-cell interactions, we developed Spatially Constrained Optimal Transport Interaction Analysis (SCOTIA), an optimal transport model with a cost function that includes both spatial distance and ligand-receptor gene expression. Our results uncovered a marked enrichment in ligand-receptor interactions between CAFs and malignant cells in response to treatment. In combination with several complementary methods, including examination of downstream target gene expression and <i>ex vivo<\/i> 3D co-culture of CAF and PDAC cells, we found that IL-6 family signaling was the most consistently enriched interaction between CAFs and malignant cells after treatment. This led us to hypothesize that IL-6 signaling between CAFs and malignant cells may induce chemoresistance in cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated three human cancer cell lines (AsPC1, Panc1, Panc0203) with 5FU with or without IL-6 and discovered that IL-6 induced chemoresistance for two of the lines (Panc1, Panc0203). Taken together, we have integrated novel experimental and computational approaches to enable high-resolution, spatially-guided discovery of treatment-associated remodeling in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment. Further studies will be conducted to dissect additional mechanisms by which candidate cell-cell interactions promote disease progression and\/or resistance to cytotoxic therapy, with the ultimate goal of guiding novel therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Pancreatic cancer,Chemoresistance,Single-cell Spatial Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
