Nearly half of TNBC patients treated with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) have excellent responses. However, those patients with significant residual cancer burden (RCB) after NACT are at high risk of recurrence or metastatic relapse within two years. Due to the challenges posed by the inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of TNBC, it is critical to develop appropriate models for predicting and overcoming therapy resistance. We established a collection of 92 orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC from 84 patients before, during, and after NACT while they were enrolled in the ARTEMIS trial (NCT02276443) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Serial biopsies were obtained from patients prior to treatment (pre-NACT), from poorly responsive disease after four cycles of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC, mid-NACT), after a 3-month course of additional chemotherapy and\/or different experimental therapies in cases of AC resistance (post-NACT), and from the metastatic lesions of two patients. The collection includes 12 longitudinal sets. Models were established from chemo-sensitive and -resistant tumors, but engraftment success was higher from those cancers that proved to be treatment resistant (RCB II\/III). The PDX collection includes models encompassing a broad heterogeneity of chemotherapy responses, histologic features, and molecular TNBC subtypes. In addition, the majority of models develop spontaneous lung metastases. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated conservation of mutations between patient tumors and corresponding PDX models, with <i>TP53 <\/i>being the most commonly mutated gene. A similar comparison of patient and PDX transcriptomes revealed conservation of signaling pathway signatures, with those related to immune and stromal interactions being the most variable, as anticipated when adapting human tumors to growth in mice. The subclonal architecture of the tumors exhibited little overall change throughout NACT, suggesting that selection for resistant subclones is not likely to be a significant contributor to resistance. Tumor cells from the longitudinal PDX collections were subjected to high throughput drug susceptibility profiling to identify targetable vulnerabilities associated with resistance to NACT. We found that post-NACT tumors exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drugs targeting protein homeostasis pathways. Preclinical studies with pevonedistat validated the neddylation pathway as an effective target in chemoresistant TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-09 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemoresistance,Neddylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

While CRISPR-Cas9 technology has significantly advanced our understanding of gene functions in zebrafish, two challenges remain: 1) how do we knock out embryonic lethal genes in adult melanocytes? and 2) how do we knock out tumor promoting genes (rather than tumor suppressors)? To address this, we have developed a new transgenic line in which Cas9 is knocked into the melanocyte-specific endogenous <i>mitfa <\/i>locus. To test this system in normal melanocytes, Tg(mitfa:Cas9) embryos were injected with a plasmid containing albino sgRNA. Cells with integration of this plasmid exhibited almost complete loss of pigmentation, demonstrating the high efficiency of our approach. This system can now be rapidly used to knock out embryonic essential genes specifically in melanocytes and evaluate the phenotype of adult fish. In melanoma, the commonly available zebrafish lines overexpress the oncogene BRAFV600E in melanocytes with germline knockout of tp53. This is not comparable to the situation in humans, where global p53 loss is rare. By utilizing our mitfa:Cas9 system, we have generated tumors with melanoma-specific loss of tp53 or ptena\/b, thereby eliminating non-specific tumors that originate from knockout of tumor suppressors in other cell types. Using this system, we are now testing whether knockout of tumor promoting genes delays melanoma onset and progression, something that has previously been difficult to efficiently achieve in zebrafish. In addition to specificity, an additional advantage of our system is that we can create nearly complete knockout of genes in the melanocytes by the F1, rather than the F2 generation. This saves several months of time and reduces the number of uninformative animals without the relevant genotype. Collectively, our system provides a highly efficient mechanism to study essential genes in melanocytes and melanoma in the zebrafish system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-10 Zebrafish models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,CRISPR\/Cas9,In vivo,Skin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

To address this, we are investigating the paradigm of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) that is driven by the biallelic loss of the von Hippel Lindau (<i>VHL<\/i>) tumor suppressor gene. Though VHL loss is required, additional mutations have been found in the evolution of the cancer, most commonly in Polybromo-1 (<i>PBRM1)<\/i>, a subunit of the PBAF SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Concomitant <i>Vhl <\/i>and <i>Pbrm1<\/i> deletion, but not <i>Vhl<\/i> deletion alone, in the renal tubular epithelium (RTE) has been reported to be sufficient to drive the formation of renal tumors in mice. However, the early <i>in vivo<\/i> consequences of <i>Vhl <\/i>loss, and the exact requirement for <i>Pbrm1 <\/i>loss<i> <\/i>to tumorigenesis remain poorly studied. We have previously reported the development of a novel lineage-tracing model of <i>Vhl <\/i>deletion that directly couples loss of a conditional <i>Vhl<\/i> allele to the expression of a tdTomato reporter and allows accurate identification and retrieval of marked <i>Vhl<\/i>-null cells. In the work reported here, we have combined this system with conditional <i>Pbrm1 <\/i>deletion using an RTE-restricted <i>Pax8-CreERT2 <\/i>to precisely identify and assay <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1<\/i>-null cells. We describe the histological abnormalities specifically comprising <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1<\/i>-null cells observed at early (1-3 weeks), intermediate (10 months), and late (17 months) intervals post recombination. We found that <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1-<\/i>null cells formed extensive &#8216;tumorlets&#8217;, disorganized, multilayered tubules, and cystic dilated tubules specifically in the renal cortex at 17 months post recombination. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that all epithelial cells in the lesions were <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1<\/i> null and expressed HIF1 and HIF2. These lesions contained cycling cells as identified by dual tdTomato\/Ki67 staining, foci of immune cells and were strikingly surrounded by cells expressing high levels of p-ERK. We then traced these lesions to earlier timepoints, and observed <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1<\/i>-null lesions resembling &#8216;tumorlet&#8217; precursors and disorganized tubules at 10 months post recombination specifically in the renal cortex. Interestingly, these precursors were encompassed by macrophages and could be discerned <i>in situ <\/i>by a ring of p-ERK-expressing cells surrounding these lesions. No similar lesions were detected at 3 weeks after recombination. Interestingly, the presence of cortical lesions was associated with a region-specific expansion of the total <i>Vhl<\/i>\/<i>Pbrm1<\/i>-null population over time. Our data suggest that morphological abnormalities arise after a general proliferation of <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1<\/i>-null cells in the renal cortex and from a subset of cells expressing specific markers. We are now comparing the differential gene expression patterns of <i>Vhl<\/i>-null cells and <i>Vhl\/Pbrm1-<\/i>null normal and transformed cells at single cell resolution to expand on these observations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Vhl,ccRCC,Pbrm1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The Kirsten rat sarcoma (<i>KRAS<\/i>) gene is the most frequently mutated oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC) and patients with CRC tumors positive for KRAS mutations have poorer outcomes and limited treatment options. Extensive work over the past four decades has shown that common oncogenic alleles of <i>KRAS<\/i> are associated with hyperactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway (i.e. RAF\/MEK\/ERK), and it is for this reason that patients with KRAS mutant tumors are excluded from targeted therapies against EGFR. Recently, we characterized two alleles of KRAS, KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup>, that paradoxically promote KRAS activation but are impaired in their ability to promote BRAF dimerization (<i>Johnson et al. Mol Cell. 2022. PMID: 35202574<\/i>). Consistent with these biochemical functions, KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> are enriched in CRC tumors that already have genetic alterations in genes that regulate MAPK signaling (e.g. EGFR, BRAF, NRAS, NF1). Further, unlike other described oncogenic alleles of KRAS, clinical data suggest that these KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> may not confer intrinsic resistance to anti-EGFR therapies at all. While KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> may not promote BRAF dimers, here we show that KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> does promote dimerization between ARAF and CRAF, and using an unpublished conditional mouse mode of K-Ras (i.e. LSL-K-Ras<sup>A59E<\/sup>) we tested (1) whether Ala59 alleles are oncogenic or (2) require cooperation with additional MAPK pathway activating mutations, and (3) whether Ala59 alleles can promote intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibition. Here, we show that endogenous K-Ras<sup>A59E<\/sup> can disturb colon homeostasis and decrease mouse survival in an autochthonous colon tumor model, demonstrating that A59E alone is an oncogenic allele of KRAS in the colon. Breeding of LSL-K-Ras<sup>A59E<\/sup> mice with mice harboring a conditional knockout of Nf1 (i.e. Nf1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>), a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that promotes activation of wildtype RAS, show that combined expression of K-Ras<sup>A59E<\/sup> and wildtype RAS activation cooperatively perturb colon homeostasis and decrease mouse survival. Thus, while KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> may not require a second genetic alteration to activate the MAPK signaling pathway, it can cooperate with these alterations to increase the severity of disease. Finally, using mouse colon derived organoids, we show that endogenous K-Ras<sup>A59E<\/sup> neither promotes EGF independence of organoid growth nor confers on these organoids a resistance to EGFR inhibition. Thus, our data support a unique role for RAF dimer function in in KRAS mutant tumors of the colon in both development and sensitivity to drugs, as well as argue for the inclusion of KRAS<sup>A59T<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>A59E<\/sup> bearing CRC tumors in anti-EGFR therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Mouse models,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The worse overall outcome for male patients compared to females, however, underscores inadequate disease management and a sex-based divergence in disease biology. To gain more insight into male breast biology and pathology, we used mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer and 3D whole-mount confocal imaging techniques to evaluate both <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>ex vivo<\/i> mammary gland development, tumor formation, and hormone signaling dependence. Our results show that <i>Myc<\/i> overexpression in collaboration with <i>Trp53<\/i> deficiency drives mammary tumorigenesis in male mice. We show that MYC overexpression promotes estrogen-independent formation of lobuloalveolar structures, which progress into tumors with a similar histology and immune landscape as female mammary tumors but with significantly more genomic instability. In female mice, MYC overexpression bypasses the dependency on paracrine estrogen signaling in mammary tumorigenesis. These data provide robust evidence that MYC overrides mammary tumor estrogen dependence and abolishes the tumor-preventive effect of a low-estrogen environment. Supporting this notion, <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments in human female breast cancer cell lines indicate that MYC overexpression may functionally contribute to endocrine therapy resistance and therefore could possibly serve as a prognostic biomarker or clinically targetable pathway for treating both male and female breast cancers. Collectively, this preclinical work presents new insights into male mammary gland biology and mechanisms of cancer progression that might translate to a broader range of breast cancers in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Male breast cancer,Myc,Endocrine resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Yet, preclinical drug screening is usually performed in cell lines or patient cells, one at a time, without consideration of cancer heterogeneity. Consequentially, positive outcomes obtained in the preclinical stage do not translate well into subsequent clinical successes. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a highly lethal form of prostate cancer (PC) exhibiting a high degree of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity with very few therapeutic options. Therefore, we created mixed-cell models depicting heterogeneity in various clinical contexts, where multiple PC cell lines representative of distinct CRPC tumor variants were labeled and combined in co-cultures to mimic the complex molecular landscape of CRPC patient cohorts. Specifically, transcriptomic profiles of PC cell lines were clustered with patient tumor specimens to identify cell lines that are genetically similar to distinct patient clusters representing CRPC tumor subtypes. Since heterogeneity has been linked to the clinical efficacy of combinatorial therapies, we applied these models to evaluate drug combinations. A combination of docetaxel and dasatinib that was previously assessed in a PC trial, was tested in the mixed-cell model and experimental findings concurred with the published clinical results, demonstrating the utility and accuracy of the model. Additionally, a computational model, IDACombo, was employed to nominate novel potentially efficacious drug combinations using monotherapy response data of cancer cell lines, a number of which were successfully validated in the mixed-cell model. More importantly, we demonstrated that while individual cell line screens may result in erroneous conclusions, combination efficacy can be accurately measured in a heterogeneous cell pool emulating a diverse patient cohort. We further explored phenotypic heterogeneity in advanced disease states, by mixing parent and standard-of-care (SOC)-resistant CRPC clonal variants. Drugs with selective potency in the resistant (vs. the parent) clone were computational prioritized and when combined with the SOC and tested in the mixed-cell models, outperformed either monotherapy. Additionally, we investigated the effects of altering the relative proportion of the constituent clones to mimic different stages of acquired therapy resistance. Furthermore, we generated mixed-cell xenograft models by subcutaneously injecting the labeled cell-line mixtures in mice and characterized the harvested tumors to detect and quantify the individual subpopulations. Development of these preclinical models holds enormous promise not only for advancing novel therapeutic strategies for cancer, but also for providing insights into the mechanisms of resistance and recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Combination therapy,Prostate cancer,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Thus, a need exists for novel therapeutic concepts to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient survival. Cancer cell plasticity, the capacity for cancer cells to differentiate and adapt to cell-extrinsic pressures, drives LUAD progression and enables treatment resistance. We discovered a molecularly distinct \"high-plasticity cell state\" (HPCS), which emerges during the initial stages of tumor development and is maintained in established tumors, comprising 10-15% of the cancer cell pool. We hypothesized that the HPCS is critical for tumor progression and drug resistance. To functionally interrogate this cell state, we engineered a novel genetic system that enables both <i>in situ<\/i> ablation (via a suicide gene) and longitudinal lineage tracing (via secreted luciferases) of the HPCS in an autochthonous genetically engineered mouse LUAD model. Lineage-tracing revealed the HPCS harbors high differentiation potential (plasticity) and growth potential <i>in situ.<\/i> Strikingly, ablation of the HPCS led to robust tumor regression and growth suppression. Motivated by these findings, we sought to identify molecular drivers of the HPCS using an <i>in vivo<\/i> multiplexed gene perturbation approach coupled to single-cell RNA sequencing. This effort led to the identification of central transcriptional plasticity drivers. This study motivates the therapeutic targeting of the HPCS in lung cancer and uncovers candidate targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor plasticity,Tumor progression,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
