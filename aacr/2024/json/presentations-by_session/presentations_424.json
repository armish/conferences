For example, <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations are detected in up to 80% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Accumulating evidence suggests that certain missense mutant forms of p53 such as R175 (R172 in mouse), R273 and R282 can acquire neomorphic pro-oncogenic activities that are referred to as gain-of-function (GOF). To elucidate novel mutant p53-dependent mechanisms in promoting metastasis, we conducted RNA-Seq, p53 ChIP-Seq and H3K27ac CUT&#38;RUN-Seq on primary and metastatic tumor cells harvested from our mouse model of ESCC harboring <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/-<\/sup><\/i>, <i>Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and <i>Trp53<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i>. Herein, we have identified p53-R172H gene targets in metastatic ESCC. One of the dominant effectors of p53-R172H-mediated metastasis was Colony stimulating factor-1 (Csf-1) signaling through its cognate receptor (Csf-1r), which we recently published in <u>Cancer Discovery (PMID: 37676642<\/u>). Overall, this study aims to investigate the GOF properties and mediators of mutant p53 in promoting ESCC metastasis.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>RESULTS\/DISCUSSION:<\/b> Using <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures and <i>in vivo<\/i> tail-vein injections, we demonstrated increased colonization and metastatic capabilities of ESCC cells harboring p53-R172H in comparison to the tumor cells with null and wild-type p53. p53-R172H occupies more genes in the metastatic ESCCs than in the primary tumors that is independent of p53 expression levels. We identified 72 unique targets of p53-R172H with altered gene occupancy and expression that occurs during the transition from primary tumor to metastasis. Such targets in metastatic ESCC are exemplified by <i>Csf-1<\/i> and <i>Birc5<\/i> (encoding anti-apoptosis protein Survivin) that are also enriched with H3K27ac in their promoters. They are upregulated during metastasis compared to the primary tumors dependent upon p53 mutation status, which is reinforced by TCGA data and ESCC patient-derived tissue microarrays (TMAs). Interestingly, other frequently detected &#8220;hotspot&#8221; p53 mutations including R282W and R273C, which we introduced into the ESCC cells using base editing promote differential pro-tumorigenic activities. Indeed, the analysis of SCC datasets in TCGA reveals that specific p53 mutations are associated with altered overall survival, as well as differences in the enriched pathways.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> We have demonstrated GOF properties and mediators of p53-R172H in promoting ESCC metastasis that may be applicable to other SCCs. We are further expanding our analyses to additional &#8220;hotspot&#8221; p53 mutations to dissect the mechanisms of distinct p53 mutations in fostering ESCC metastasis, which can open up new avenues for therapeutic applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,p53 target gene,Metastatic tumors,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

One primary mode of metastasis is collective invasion, whereby cohesive groups of cells invade into the adjacent stroma while maintaining cell-cell contacts. Importantly, these cellular packs harbor genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulations that cooperate to drive invasion. To deconstruct how phenotypic cellular heterogeneity facilitates distinct molecular profiles within a single tumor, we established the technique <u>S<\/u>p<u>a<\/u>tiotemporal Cellular and <u>G<\/u>enomic <u>A<\/u>nalysis (SaGA). SaGA is an image-guided approach that optically highlights phenotypically defined cell(s) for live fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analysis. To elucidate the transcriptional heterogeneity across invasive packs within a 3D physiologically-relevant microenvironment, we combined SaGA with single cell RNA sequencing for isolation and analysis of actively invading cells. This novel single cell transcriptomics approach reveals that - during cellular invasion into the microenvironment - the follower subpopulation supplies TGF&#946; to heterogeneously stimulate both autocrine canonical and paracrine noncanonical signaling pathways. This cooperative exchange facilitates a symbiotic relationship between tumor subpopulations in non-small cell lung carcinoma both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i>, we determine that PMEPA1 protein levels mitigate TGF&#946; downstream effector signaling within heterogeneous tumor cells to modulate JAG1 expression and activity. <i>In vivo<\/i>, we show that a reduction in JAG1 levels decreases primary tumor cell invasion and progression. We mechanistically define a TGF&#946;-PMEPA1-JAG1 signaling axis across leader and follower subpopulations critical for tumor cell invasion and cancer progression. Together, these data highlight the importance of cellular heterogeneity and subpopulation communication required for tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Metastasis,NSCLC,Cooperation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Our study, the largest spatial analysis reported to date, aimed to uncover unique cellular and genomic features facilitating metastatic lesion development. Employing spatial transcriptomics on 60 patients' surgical resections, we validated our findings with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and <i>ex vivo<\/i> functional studies in tumor slice cultures. We obtained spatially distinct gene expression profiles of metastatic tumor cells, tumor microenvironment (TME) and brain parenchymal lineages. Our analysis identified spatially heterogenous upregulation of PI3K, MAPK, EGFR, p53, and TGF&#946; signaling in metastatic tumor cells. Tumor cells had high levels of chromosomal instability (CIN) marked by recurrent amplifications in chromosomes 6, 7, 17, and 20. WGS from three independent cohorts revealed significantly higher CIN in mCRC brain compared to primary CRC or mCRC from other organs. Spatial neighborhood analysis identified an immune desert phenotype with lack of proximity between lymphocytes and metastatic tumor cells. However, mCRC brain contained abundant plasma cells identifying a unique TME niche feature. Significant proximity between tumor cells and endothelial cells underscored their potential role in tumor seeding and growth. Spatially aware differential expression analysis demonstrated adaptive responses in the brain parenchyma. This included increased Golgi-ER processing and Rho GTPase signaling in neurons and astrocytes adjacent to metastatic tumor cells, respectively. Macrophages were characterized by high expression of pro-fibrogenic genes. Increased <i>SPP1<\/i> ligand expression from these macrophages interacted with corresponding receptors on spatially proximal fibroblasts, identifying a key niche reorganization feature that can promote metastatic lesion growth. To evaluate the translational potential of our findings, we examined the effects of perturbating the metastatic niche using scRNA-seq. We established a tumor slice culture from a mCRC brain surgical resection, which maintained all original cell states. Despite elevated signaling pathway activity, metastatic tumor cells were resistant to regorafenib, a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In contrast, pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory small molecule, successfully reduced extracellular matrix-associated gene expression programs in fibroblasts in the TME. Our analysis identified distinct properties of mCRC brain that can serve as therapeutic targets, including high levels of chromosomal instability, remodeling of brain parenchyma, lymphocyte evasion, plasma cell abundance and macrophage-fibroblast interactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,Heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Little is known about how cancer cells spread into abdominal cavity and what is different from hematogenous metastasis. It is also not well characterized how tumor microenvironment prevent cancer cells from spreading in abdominal cavity. We performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis and special transcriptomic analysis to clarify the progression and environment of the cancer. We collected and processed ascites samples of 20 PDAC samples from 19 patients. Sixteen ascites samples were obtained from abdominal paracentesis and two cases in the postmortem period. For one patient ascites was collected both pre and postmortem. All but one patient received chemotherapy prior to ascites collection. Routine clinical cytology evaluation of ascites samples from 17 patients indicated it was malignant in 11 patients and nonmalignant in six patients. All ascites samples were purified by gradient centrifuge using Ficoll-Paque Plus to remove erythrocytes and necrotic debris. For the platform, we adopted the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression platform for single-cell RNA-seq library preparation. Spatial transcriptomics was performed for eight FFPE samples from the two autopsy patients with paired cancer ascites using 10x Visium. The CytAssist was used to transfer transcripts of pre-sectioned and pre-stained tissues with 11 x 11 mm Visium Capture Area slides. The sample locations were metastatic tumors to bowel wall, rib bone, mesentery, iliac nerve, diaphragm, peritoneum, pelvis, and primary pancreas tumor. A total of 248,263 cells were analyzed in single-cell RNA-seq. Cell population in pancreas cancer ascites consisted of macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, plasma cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mesothelial cells, and cancer cells. Cancer cells were detected in twelve samples whereas no cancer cells were detected in eight samples. Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses showed macrophages in ascites with cancer cells involved neutrophil activation while those in ascites without cancer cells retained antigen presentation capacity and inducing interferon gamma pathway. Mesothelial cells in ascites with cancer cells showed more apoptosis and lymphocyte proliferation while those in ascites without cancers cells triggered fibrosis and mitosis. These data suggest that macrophage and mesothelial cells could be categorized into anti-tumor cells and tumor associated cells. Ongoing investigations are exploring ligand-receptor relationships. We are going to compare the expression profile of tumor cells in ascites fluid and in tissue from various organs by integrating single cell RNA-seq data and special transcriptomics data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Ascites fluid,Peritoneal metastasis,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

For PCa, a common treatment strategy is external beam radiation therapy to the prostate. However, when cancer recurs (radiorecurrent PCa), it often behaves aggressively by invading into surrounding organs or spreading distantly. Radiorecurrent PCa metastasis is therefore a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that must be overcome to improve survival of advanced PCa patients. Proteomic analysis revealed the procollagen enzyme Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 (PLOD2) to be upregulated in our radiorecurrent, and highly aggressive, conventionally fractionated DU145 (DU145-CF) PCa cell line. Given its established function as a mediator of invasion in various other cancers, we sought to characterize the role of PLOD2 in the aggressive phenotype of our radiorecurrent PCa cells. Bioinformatic analysis of clinical data revealed PLOD2 genomic amplification to be significantly associated with biochemical recurrence in PCa patients. Upon further examination in vitro, it was revealed that PLOD2 knockdown significantly reduces matrigel invasion and migration in our radiorecurrent DU145-CF cell line, in addition to numerous other PCa cell lines, including primary cells we derived directly from PCa patients. Using the in vivo chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) model, we confirmed that PLOD2 knockdown significantly reduces the ability of DU145-CF cells to extravasate from the CAM vasculature into the surrounding stroma, a critical step of the metastatic cascade. To explore mechanisms of metastatic cellular reprogramming downstream of PLOD2, RNA sequencing of DU145-CF cells was conducted; a total of 681 genes were discovered to be dysregulated by PLOD2 knockdown, with their functional analysis suggesting changes in cellular metabolism and respiration. Finally, since PLOD2 is known to be regulated by hypoxia-induced protein HIF1&#945;, we explored whether PLOD2 expression could be inhibited by the HIF1&#945; inhibitor, PX-478. Treatment with PX-478 reduced both HIF1&#945; and PLOD2 protein expression, and significantly reduced invasion, migration, and in vivo extravasation in DU145-CF cells, thereby indicating its potential as a pharmacological inhibitor of HIF1&#945;-associated PLOD2 in radiorecurrent PCa. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the role of PLOD2 in radiorecurrent PCa invasiveness, and point towards its potential as a therapeutic target to reduce metastasis and improve survival outcomes in PCa patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,PLOD2,Prostate cancer,Radioresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Gavin Frame<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hon Leong<sup>2<\/sup>, Roni Haas<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiaoyong Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jessica Wright<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul C.

Throughout the metastatic cascade, cancer cells requires substantial metabolic rewiring to adapt the nutrient micro-environmental changes enabling dissemination and seeding in distant organs. Recent insights into importance of the tumor-intrinsic metabolic reprograming has been implicated in immune escape, yet altered immune responses imposed by tumor metabolism during metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we generated genetic perturbations in triple-negative breast cancer cells using metabolism-focused CRISPR knockout library and performed in vivo screens in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. By comparing enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases or primary tumors, we identify loss of one gene related to long chain fatty acid (LCFA) &#946;-oxidation (FAO) potentiates metastatic dissemination in immunocompetent mice but no in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that impaired FAO in tumor cells promotes breast cancer lung metastasis through an lymphocytes-dependent manner. We confirmed individual sgRNAs targeting this FAO gene from the primary screen dramatically accelerate metastasis in different breast cancer orthotopic models. Specifically, we find that low expression of this gene in primary tumors of advanced breast cancer patients with high grade tumors and positive lymph nodes (LN+) is associated with reduced overall survival. In addition, deletion of this gene generates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in the lung metastatic tumors with increased neutrophils, monocytes and decreased TNF&#945;<sup>+<\/sup>-IFN&#947;<sup>+<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Mechanistically, impaired FAO in tumor cells causes mitochondria imbalance under lipid metabolism stress, consequently triggers inflammatory response on establishing a neutrophil-rich metastatic niche via mitochondrial nucleic acid-driven innate immunity. Altogether, our data provides a new insight on how tumor cell lipid metabolism impacting immune interplay during metastatic progression, nominating potential anti-tumor immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Cancer metabolism,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaoyong Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shu-ting Chou<sup><\/sup>, Verra Ngwa<sup><\/sup>, Yoonha Hwang<sup><\/sup>, Breelyn Karno<sup><\/sup>, Deanna Edwards<sup><\/sup>, Jin Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7911a58b-7763-40f6-8191-33869f1c2866","ControlNumber":"6754","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Among several microscopic perspectives to solve these obstacles, much evidence has emerged indicating that mitochondria dynamics are closely associated with tumor metastasis and tumor progression in various types of cancer.<br \/>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin is associated with PINK1-mediated mitophagy, allowing cells to control mitochondria damages and generate the needed energy to survive in harsh physiological conditions.<br \/>Interestingly, we found that Parkin potentially ubiquitinates proteins independently of PINK1-associated mitophagy. By SALIC analysis, we found that K681 and K582 of Kindlin-2 is one of the potential ubiquitination sites by Parkin in prostate cancer cells.<br \/>Kindlin-2 is a cytoskeletal membrane protein and is a component of the focal adhesion complex. Computational modeling suggested that N-terminal region of Kindlin-2 binds to Parkin, with K581 and K582 of Kindlin-2 exposed outside for ubiquitination. Our studies showed that Kindlin-2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by wild-type Parkin but not by the catalytic site, C431S, mutant Parkin. Furthermore, K581A and K582A mutant Kindlin-2 did not exhibit poly-ubiquitination under conditions of Parkin overexpression. Surprisingly, in our immunofluorescence study, Kindlin-2 was recruited to the mitochondria and co-localized with Parkin. From a mitochondrial functional perspective, wild-type Kindlin-2 reduced mitochondria dynamics, whereas mutant Kindlin-2 didn&#8217;t in the presence of Parkin. This suggests that the cytoskeletal protein Kindlin-2 might play a role in mitochondrial dynamics that mediates tumor metastasis.<br \/>Wild-type Kindlin-2 reduced both focal adhesion generation and decay, unlike mutant Kindlin-2 under Parkin-induced condition. Additionally, this pattern was observed in the single cell lamellipodia dynamics through live cell imaging. 2D and 3D cell invasive assays supported the evidence that Parkin decreases tumor metastatic potential by ubiquitinating Kindlin-2 and regulating mitochondria and focal adhesion dynamics.<br \/>Our findings indicate that Parkin reduces tumor metastatic potential by ubiquitinating Kindlin-2 and demonstrate the possibility as a therapeutic agent for advanced and immune suppressive tumors. Furthermore, Parkin could be a promising agent for Parkin suppressed tumor patients in line with personalized cancer therapy development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,Prostate cancer,Ubiquitination,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
