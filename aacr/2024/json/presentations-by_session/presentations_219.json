[{"Abstract":"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) often fails to respond to immune therapies due to various factors, including the role of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) plasticity in conferring broad resistance to diverse therapies. However, the relationship between cancer cell heterogeneity and the tumor immune microenvironment remains unclear. To address this, we utilized single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to uncover the landscape of these cell-cell interactions in human PDAC. Here, we applied to specimens from a clinical trial testing Losartan, an indirect TGF-beta inhibitor with FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and nivolumab (anti-PD1) in a randomized multi-institutional clinical trial for PDAC (NCT03563248).<br \/>Methods: Using the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, we selected multiple regions of interest in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human PDAC specimens. Immunofluorescent antibody-guided isolation of RNA and protein from cancer cells (pan-cytokeratin), cancer-associated fibroblasts (alpha-SMA), and immune cells (CD45) were performed. Utilizing the whole transcriptome assay (WTA; 18,000+ protein-coding genes) and a new IO Proteome Atlas (IPA; 500+ plex proteins), we ventured to understand the relationship between tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment.<br \/>Results: PDAC cells, CAFs, and immune cells were successfully characterized using NanoString GeoMx in clinical trial specimens. Analysis revealed associations between cancer cell plasticity, TGF-beta signaling mesenchymal subtypes in PDAC cells. These TGF-beta enriched mesenchymal PDAC cells were enriched in Arm 1 (FOLFIRINOX) compared to Arm 2 (FOLFIRINOX+losartan). Immune deconvolution analysis identified variations in immune infiltrates, showing an anti-correlation between macrophages and T-cells. The IPA analysis revealed lower MHC I protein levels in short compared to long term survivors in Arm 3.<br \/>Conclusions: Spatial transcriptomics and proteomics reveal insights into the spatial relationship between PDAC tumor cell EMT plasticity, CAFs, and immune infiltrates. This enables the discovery of novel immune response biomarkers and potential therapeutic avenues to target tumor and microenvironment interactions.<br \/>Trial Registration: DF\/HCC protocol 18-179: Losartan and Nivolumab in Combination With FOLFIRINOX and SBRT in Localized Pancreatic Cancer.

In this study, we using spatial genomic expression analysis of MCPN, and focus on the correlations between marker expression patterns in stroma and ductal region. Tissues obtained from surgical samples of a 69-year-old patient with a pancreatic head cystic mass and a history of pancreatitis (staged as T3N1Mx) were embedded in paraffin. These tissues were then sectioned, collected onto subbed slides, and subjected to probe hybridization, ligation, and extraction onto Visum slides following the manufacturer's instructions (10X Genomics). Genomic expression was extracted using established protocols, processed through SpaceRanger, and further visualized in Loupe Browser (10X Genomics). A comparison was conducted between the ductal and stromal regions, both with and without cystic involvement. Our study reveals a significant 5.1 log<sub>2<\/sub> fold increase in MUC5AC expression in the ductal region, regardless of cystic involvement, suggesting implications for apoptosis regression and cadherin-dependent cell adhesion in MCPN progression. Further analysis indicates a significantly higher expression of TMSB4X exclusively in the ductal region, extending into the surrounding stroma, potentially stimulating MCPN progression by fostering pro-inflammatory cytokine environments. The novel marker IGKC, indicating favorable prognosis and PDAC treatment efficacy, shows high expression in the stroma (1.8 log<sub>2<\/sub> fold higher). However, around the duct with cystic involvement, its expression is notably reduced (-1.7 log<sub>2<\/sub> fold lower), suggesting pathways that may contribute to MCPN's progression towards a more invasive PDAC phenotype. Additionally, our study reveals a 1.9 log<sub>2<\/sub> fold elevated expression of FN1, a biomarker associated with poor outcomes in PDAC patients, in the stroma around the cyst, hinting at a possible pathogenic role of FN1 in cell adhesion, migration, and progression of MCPN to PDAC. Co-expression of FN1 with COMP and TIMP3 within MCPN suggests a concerted effort in the microenvironment, influencing tissue development, maintenance, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Co-localization of FN1 with COMP and TIMP3, particularly within degenerating acinar cells, hints at a potential mechanism in the intricate progression of MCPN to PDAC. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular landscape of MCPN, offering potential avenues for targeted interventions to thwart its progression to PDAC, guiding novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for pancreatic neoplasms. Further expression data will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,TIMP,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

One of the most frequently occurring mutations in lung cancer is KRAS mutations. Recent development of chemical inhibitors that specifically target oncogenic variants of Ras, particularly the commonly mutated KRAS-G12D isoform, represents a significant breakthrough in targeted therapeutics. The tissue-level mechanisms underlying the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of KRas-G12D inhibitors are poorly understood. Additionally, the effectiveness of KRas-G12D inhibitors in lung cancer models remains unknown. To address these gaps in knowledge, we analyzed the spatial interactions between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue microenvironment during the process of tumor eradication mediated through KRas-G12D inhibitors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We utilized a genetic mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), driven by the activation of KRas-G12D in combination with the loss of p53. We investigated the immune-mediated tumor recognition following the targeting of KRas-G12D in an immunocompetent setting. Lung samples were collected from control mice and treated. Spatial transcriptomic analysis (CosMx<sup>TM<\/sup> SMI 1,000-plex Mouse Universal Cell Characterization Panel) were employed to obtain a high-plex, single-cell, temporal and spatially resolved molecular atlas of lung tumor regression.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Prior to Kras inhibitor treatment, mice displayed both LuAD and lung adenomas. Lesion size and histological grade progressively decrease during pharmacological treatment with Kras inhibitor. 906 unique genes were detected above background on intact FFPE tissue slides, along with 4 protein markers for optimal single-cell segmentation results. Concordance between CosMx SMI and scRNAseq was assessed and demonstrated high assay sensitivity and specificity of the CosMx assay. LUAD cell subtypes were identified and showed distinct spatial features. Molecular states, and receptor-ligand interactions, within niche-specific signaling networks were investigated to underline molecular mechanism of immune attack and eventual eradication of tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This study provides novel insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of KRas-G12D inhibitor-mediated tumor regression in lung cancer, shedding light on the previously unknown cell-cell interactions occurring during this process. By investigating these spatiotemporal aspects, we aim to enhance our understanding of lung cancer biology and potentially identify new immunotherapeutic biomarkers.

The relative histomorphological categories composition of each spot across the ST slide was computed as percentage of pixels. Spots were defined as tumoral if the percentile of pixels in that spot surpassed the 80<sup>th<\/sup> percentile of all the tumor spots in the cohort.<br \/>Results: Our cohort consisted of 56 HER2-zero (IHC 0), 30 HER2-low (IHC 1+) and 20 HER2-positive (IHC 2+\/FISH positive or IHC 3+) samples. HER2-zero samples contained a significantly higher percentage of acellular stroma spots compared to HER2-low (pvalue=0.04), while no other morphological annotation showed a difference, including tumor spots. Only tumor spots were retained for downstream analysis. A difference in the ERBB2 gene expression was found at the spot level, with a higher expression in HER2-low samples compared to HER2-zero samples (median expression 0.4, 0.7 and 3.1 in HER2-zero, HER2-low and HER2-positive, respectively). Inter-sample heterogeneity was observed, with 27% of the HER2-zero samples having equal or higher mean ERBB2 expression that the mean ERBB2 expression of the HER2-low cohort. Variability within individual samples was observed, revealing two peaks in ERBB2 expression, one characterized by low levels and the other by medium-high levels. This pattern was frequently observed in samples classified as HER2-zero and HER2-low, indicating the existence of tumor spots with diverse ERBB2 expression.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Our results revealed inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of ERBB2 expression in HER2-zero and HER2-low BC. The use of spatial transcriptomics can provide more details of the spatial distribution of ERBB2. Further validation is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,ErbB2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

A risk stratification tool is the Operative Link on GIM (OLGIM), a system that relies on histopathologic annotation of gastric biopsies. Advanced OLGIM (stages III and IV) have the highest risk of progression to GC. Molecular biomarkers for advanced OLGIM are lacking. We explored transcriptomics biomarkers for advanced OLGIM to aid risk assessment efforts among GC precursors.We used clinical and genomic data from four cohorts: 1) GAPS, a cohort of OLGIM-staged patients (N=303); 2) a subset of confirmed intestinal-type GC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, N=198); 3) a compilation of scRNA-seq data (N=40), and 4) a spatial transcriptomics cohort (N=5) with annotated H&#38;E-stained histopathology slides from GC or OLGIM-staged patients.We separated the GAPS bulk RNAseq gene expression dataset into independent discovery (N=88) and validation (N=215) sets. Through a combination of differential expression analysis and co-expression analysis, we identified a discrete set of 100 significantly upregulated genes characterizing advanced OLGIM that were confirmed in the validation set. Importantly, these genes were overexpressed both in the corpus and antrum of the stomach. We leveraged spatial transcriptomics assays to refine this signature to genes overexpressed specifically in GIM foci. We interrogated the TCGA dataset and confirmed these genes to be also expressed in gastric tumors. The final high-risk signature included 26 genes. Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed these genes to be expressed by aberrant intestinal-like lineages. Further, reference-mapping identified cells resembling mature enterocytes and goblet cells that expressed 16 of these genes, whereas 10 genes from the high-risk signature pinpoint immature intestinal stem-like cells at varying stages of differentiation (duodenum stem cells, duodenum differentiating stem cells, and duodenum transit amplifying cells). Finally, we confirmed expression of 12 of these genes by single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (smFISH), that distinguish differentiated from stem-like lineages in metaplasia and are absent in normal gastric glands in intact tissue sections from GC precursors.Our study identified as signature of 26 genes that are: i) characteristically over-expressed in advanced OLGIM stages, ii) localize specifically to metaplasia, iii) are expressed in gastric tumors, and iv) distinguish differentiated from stem-like cells in GIM. These results provide transcriptomics biomarkers that indicate the establishment and expansion of intestinal stem-like cells in advanced OLGIM, with profound translational implications, as these cells may harbor and expand mutations that predispose advanced OLGIM patients to GC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Prevention,Stem cells,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Spatial transcriptomics, which maps gene expression in its spatial tissue context, offers a unique approach over bulk transcriptomics. By incorporating spatial information, the predictive power of the signature can be enhanced. Here, we aim to develop spatially informed gene signatures that could be translated into clinical RNA in situ assays, distinguishing patients unlikely to benefit from immunotherapy and thereby sparing them unnecessary side effects. We utilized the NanoString GeoMX Whole Transcriptome Atlas for spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling of retrospectively collected lung cancer tissue samples from patients treated with immunotherapy in an advanced-stage setting (N=60). By targeting 18,190 genes within distinct areas of interest (AOIs)&#8212;including stromal (macrophages\/CD68+ and leukocytes\/CD45+) and tumor (cytokeratin, CK+) cells&#8212;we developed AOI-specific gene signatures to predict objective responses. These were derived from a robust computational framework employing LASSO logistic regression on a split-sample approach, yielding predictive models for treatment outcome.We achieved high predictive accuracy on the training set, with the area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.86 for all AOI-specific spatial signatures, indicating strong potential for clinical application. Validation against an independent cohort (N=42) corroborated the efficacy of these signatures. Our 6-gene tumor signature was validated with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.89, p = 0.009**), while the CD45 5-gene signature showed an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.53-0.97, p = 0.022*). Our 18-gene CD68 signature trended towards validation but lacked statistical significance. A combined CD68 and CD45 signature predicted outcomes with greater accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62-0.98, p = 0.0088*). Following gene set enrichment analysis on our differentially expressed and signature genes, we identified genes with positive coefficients in both tumor and stroma signatures that were associated with glucocorticoid response and glycolytic processes linked to T-cell homeostasis, while genes with negative coefficients were associated with epithelial cell differentiation and cytokine production. These associations are concordant with the observation that genes with positive coefficients are predictors of treatment response, while those with negative coefficients indicate resistance.Our findings indicate that AOI-specific signatures predict the immunotherapy outcome in lung cancer with high accuracy, suggesting that spatial assessment can provide substantial predictive information. The high performance of these signatures indicates their potential for prospective clinical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The microenvironments of these subtypes, proximal-inflammatory (PI), proximal-proliferative (PP), and terminal respiratory unit (TRU), have been described generally as immune hot, immune moderate and immune cold, respectively, but otherwise have not been analyzed at high resolution. Here, we aimed to characterize and compare tumor microenvironments between LUAD subtypes. Using spatially barcoded arrays and cDNA libraries (10x Genomics), we sequenced the spatial transcriptomes of a 6.5mm<sup>2<\/sup> plane of 14 LUAD tumors from the Applied Proteogenomics and Organizational Learning Outcomes (APOLLO) program. Spatial transcriptomes had a median of 3,560 spots and a median of 4,026 genes detected per spot. First, collapsing the spatial array to a bulk measurement per sample, we applied our published expression subtype predictor classifying 4 PI, 5 PP, and 5 TRU cases. We then decomposed each tumor&#8217;s spatial expression profile by unsupervised clustering, followed by signature scoring and collapsing into tumor, immune, and stroma tumor microenvironment (TME) components. Twelve of the fourteen tumors harbored multiple components while two tumors had one component. The region areas of TME components showed trends among the subtypes, with PI having the greatest immune area and PP having the greatest tumor area. Within each tumor, we calculated differentially-expressed genes between each TME component. Comparing TME genes to the subtype predictor genes, we found significant overlap (chi-square p &#60;&#60; 0.001). This indicates that genes that are variable among bulk tumors also have variability within tumors. We then predicted expression subtype for decomposed compartments. Five tumors had the same expression subtype across their TME components, which we refer to as single subtype tumors. However, six tumors had more than one expression subtype prediction among the tumor&#8217;s TME components, which we call &#8216;multi-subtype tumors&#8217;. Multi-subtype tumors had lower bulk subtype prediction scores than single-subtype tumors (p &#60; 0.01), indicating that the TME diversity among tumors affects the bulk expression subtype. Interestingly, the six multi-subtype tumors were in the PP and PI subtypes, suggesting greater TME component diversity than TRU. Calculating the spatial compactness of the tumors through continuity indices, we found that PI subtype trended with greater intermixing of TME components. In summary, the bulk LUAD expression subtypes capture differences between tumors and within tumors related to the tumor microenvironment.

However, dissociated single cell profiling lacks spatial context. To resolve the organization, cell-cell communication, and granular structures in the TME, new single-cell spatial transcriptomic (ST) characterizations are needed. Here, we dissected the spatial molecular architecture of the melanoma (30 tumors, 30 patients) and transformed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (tCTCL, 12 tumors, 6 patients) TMEs by Multiplexed Error-Robust FISH (305 gene MERFISH), with benchmarking scRNAseq data from matched tissues (6 melanoma scFFPEseq, 6 tCTCL scVDJ\/RNAseq) for cross-platform validation. We profiled 565,122 cells in melanoma and 92584 cells in tCTCL by MERFISH. We interrogated both datasets using a novel computational framework that includes cell typing by Leiden clustering and marker genes, spatial neighborhood and receptor-ligand (R-L) analyses, and spatial\/scRNA imputation via deep learning. In the melanoma dataset, we identified tumor cells, major TME cell types, and rare immune cell types (TCF7+ stem-like T-cells and CD3+TCR&#945;+PAX5+CD79a+ B\/T dual-expressor lymphocytes enriched in tertiary lymphoid structures). All cell types were validated in scFFPEseq. As immune R-L interactions are critical therapeutic targets, we developed a novel computation method to quantify spatial R-L interactions by accounting for cell-cell distance, identifying spatially informed R-L pairs that differ from dissociation-based inferences. CNV inference from melanoma scFFPEseq revealed intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). We therefore adapted the conditional variational autoencoder ENVI to simultaneously incorporate scRNA and MERFISH spatial data into a unified latent embedding. ENVI-ITH successfully learned ITH subgroup information, enabling imputation of phylogenetic lineages on spatial MERFISH. CTCL MERFISH data revealed major TME cell types, yet separation of malignant vs benign T-cells by clustering and marker approaches is hindered by their overlapping gene expression. To overcome this barrier, we deployed ENVI to impute patient-specific malignant and benign TCR clonotypes by training on the matched scVDJ\/RNA data, yielding an ENVI-TCR pipeline that can delineate malignant vs benign T-cells <i>in situ<\/i>. We validated the spatial pattern of malignant T-cells by patient-specific <i>in situ<\/i> TCR probes. In sum, we have interrogated the melanoma and CTCL TME by MERFISH and presented a novel computational framework for robustly co-embedding scRNA data with imaging-based ST to spatially resolve melanoma ITH and malignant\/benign T-cell populations. We believe this approach will be highly impactful for melanoma and CTCL and can be broadly applied to other solid tumors and lymphomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Deep learning,Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

First-line therapy consists of maximal surgical tumor resection, accompanied by concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Malignant cells escape surgical resection by migrating into the brain parenchyma, where they give rise to the recurrent tumor. Based on gene expression, the tumor core can be subtyped into mesenchymal, proneural and classical areas, each being associated with differences in genetic alterations and cellular composition. In contrast, the tumor periphery where migrating tumor cells infiltrate brain parenchyma is less characterized in patients. Using spatial transcriptomics (n = 11), we show that specific malignant states colocalize in tumor core areas with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Malignant cells within proneural or mesenchymal subtyped cores displayed, as expected, many differences in genetic expression, although such differences disappeared in the tumor periphery. Malignant cells residing in the tumor periphery had increased expression of genes related to neurodevelopmental pathways and synaptic connectivity. Our findings show similarities in cellular states across tumor subtypes with implications for post-operative treatment and provide an updated view of the spatial landscape of glioblastomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Previous studies demonstrated that PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden as well as certain neo-antigens were associated with response to pembrolizumab but there were no biomarkers predicting the response of pembrolizumab of TNBC in neoadjuvant setting. Therefore, tumor microenvironment (TME) evaluation would be warranted to understand the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab in TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We employed the Xenium In Situ platform, a cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics tool, capable of mapping hundreds of transcripts within individual cells. Using a 380-plex gene panel, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded TNBC sections treated with weekly paclitaxel with carboplatin followed by doxorubicin with cyclophosphamide (CTx) with\/without pembrolizumab in neoadjuvant setting. We analyzed detailed cellular compositions of tumors, encompassing immune and stromal cells, across over one million cells and we attempted to identify various cell types and states, previously characterized through single-cell RNA sequencing, and assess their spatial heterogeneity within the TME with regard to treatment strategy and the response to treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We collected 19 serial samples from 13 patients including 12 pre-treatment and seven post-treatment samples. Among seven post-treatment samples, one was collected after three weeks of the first treatment and one was after disease relapse. Of 13 patients, seven patients had received pembrolizumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy and four out of seven have achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). In six patients treated with only cytotoxic chemotherapy, only two achieved pCR. Our analysis revealed significant alterations in the spatial organization of cells in both the pembrolizumab with CTx and CTx-only groups. Notably, an increase in CD8 T cells and plasma cells following treatments was pronounced in post-treatment samples from patients in the pembrolizumab with CTx group. We also observed treatment-specific variations in ligand-receptor interactions between immune cells and cancer cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This study provides an in-depth analysis of the TME in TNBCs in response to pembrolizumab with CTx. Utilizing the Xenium In Situ platform, we uncovered significant disparities in the immune cell population according to the application of pembrolizumab. Our findings underscore the complexity of TME responses and highlight the potential of spatial transcriptomics in informing tailored treatment strategies for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.-E.

However, current understanding of cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity remains limited, especially in the spatial context. Previous studies underscored that cancer cell states are not strictly governed by genetics, but rather display a remarkable degree of plasticity. Recent pan-cancer single-cell studies have unveiled dozens of recurrent cancer cell states. Nevertheless, the relationship between these cancer cell states and tumor microenvironment (TME) remains poorly understood, especially when considering the diversity across different tumor types. Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have paved the way for a novel approach to spatially profile cell location, organization, and interaction within the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we curated ST data (Visium, 10x Genomics) from public repositories and in-house datasets, encompassing a total of &#62;200 tissue sections across 11 cancer types. By incorporating histological annotations and inferred copy number variations, we systematically investigated the spatial heterogeneity of cancer cell states and inferred clonal architectures of cancer cell-enriched spots. Non-negative matrix factorization was applied to identify highly recurrent cancer states and transcriptional hallmarks associated with intra-tumor heterogeneity. By employing this approach, we uncover a diverse curated gene set of meta-programs. Notably, we observe a high level of reproducibility of these meta-programs when compared to the findings from single-cell level. Furthermore, we observe significant variations of cell states across different cancer types, even among two cancer subtypes within a specific tissue. We noted a unique distribution of 'hypoxia' and 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition' in the basal lineage tumor. Following this, we perform single-cell and ST co-embedding using available tools, including CellTrek and CytoSPACE. We noticed the cell type composition of tumor&#8217;s neighbor spots play a significant role in influencing tumor states, especially for myofibroblastic CAFs and the tumor state in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings contribute valuable insights into the relationship between cancer cell state plasticity and interactions with the TME, offering potential targets for further exploration and therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Spatial transcriptome,Plasticity ,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Our investigation focused on the transition of molecular characteristics from normal to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN, pre-cancer), spanning the spectrum of Gleason Grades 3 to 4 and advancing to metastatic prostate cancer. We identified genes with unique spatial and grade-dependent expression profiles, including MYC, CP, and UHCL1. Evaluating sub-cellular imaging facilitated a comprehensive characterization and quantification of immune and stromal interactions, unveiling distinct spatial niches across transition stages. These findings underscore the nuanced immune interactions within the tumor microenvironment and offer crucial insights into the development of immunotherapeutic approaches tailored to the specific spatial and immune dynamics observed in advanced prostate cancer.

Pathologic tumor response has been utilized in clinical trials as a surrogate of clinical efficacy. Yet, over half of treated patients experience non-response, highlighting the need for novel markers to identify those who are most likely to derive therapeutic benefit.<br \/>To dissect the spatial complexity of the tumor-associated immune landscape following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (CT+ICI), we selected patients (n =3) with a range of residual viable tumor (%RVT) - pathological complete response (pCR; 0% RVT), partial response (20% RVT), and no-response (100% RVT). We performed multimodal spatial transcriptomics (ST) and proteomics (using a 35-plex protein panel) on the same tissue sections using the Visium CytAssist from 10X Genomics. We also examined spatial patterns of 20-plex panel of immune and stromal markers at single-cell resolution in the same samples using the COMET Lunaphore platform. In the pCR patient, we studied two tumor areas to assess the impact of tumor response heterogeneity on the immune landscape.<br \/>Our analysis identified distinct immune profiles across three patients with varying %RVT, reflecting the heterogeneity of the immune response. We found robust gene-protein correlation, such as <i>MS4A1<\/i> gene expression and CD20 protein levels, in our multimodal spatial-omics analysis. Intriguingly, the arrangement of B cells and their interaction with surrounding plasma cells (PCs) varied notably across patients. Unlike in the patients with partial or no response, pronounced tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation and signatures were observed in the pCR patient, with the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis overlapping with the TLS profile, suggesting a functional interplay that may be crucial in mediating response to therapy. Intriguingly, in the pCR patient, PCs uniquely arrayed around dense B cell aggregates, marked by <i>MS4A1<\/i>, <i>CR2<\/i>, <i>FCER1<\/i>, and <i>CXCL13<\/i>. PCs were not only less abundant in non-PCR patients but they also did not array around lymphoid aggregates.<br \/>Our high-resolution and multimodal analysis identified spatially-resolved expression and patterns for B lineage cells that may be associated, and thus, underlie response of resectable NSCLC to neoadjuvant CT+ICI. Ongoing efforts on this expanding cohort will shed further light on transcriptional states and immunogenomic roles of B lineage cells in neoadjuvant CT+ICI-treated NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Multimodal Spatial Transcriptomics,Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Especially, adding pembrolizumab on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increased pathologic complete response (pCR) rate at the time of curative surgery. Previous studies suggested that PD-L1 expression in both tumor and immune cells was associated with the response of pembrolizumab in TNBC, but PD-L1 expression state were not associated with pembrolizumab response in NAC setting. In addition, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab increased event-free survival (DFS) rate after NAC even though they had not achieved pCR. However, there were no biomarker for EFS increasement of using pembrolizumab. We designed prospective translational research for evaluating tumor microenvironment (TME) of residual TNBC which had treated with NAC followed by curative surgery. We collected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) surgical specimens after NAC with or without pembrolizumab. TNBC samples were used for spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis, with H&#38;E staining and inspection by an experienced pathologist. Libraries were prepared using Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit protocol for FFPE (10x Genomics). Sequencing was conducted on the NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina). From February 2023 to October 2023, 23 TNBC specimens from 22 patients were collected. Twenty specimens were breast tissues and three were lymph nodes, 18 TNBCs had been treated with NAC with pembrolizumab and four with only NAC, and five had residual cancer burden(RCB) class I, 11 of RCB class II and one of RCB class III. We collected BC and LN samples from BC with class III. Of 23 samples, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis in 12 samples. In intrinsic subtyping, eight specimens were categorized into normal like, two of basal like and two of luminal A BC subtypes. In TNBC subtyping, mesenchymal stem cell like (MSL) were in six specimens, three of stem cell like (SL), two of luminal androgen receptor (LAR) and one of immunomodulatory (IM). We also performed cell type annotation with unsupervised method and categorized into 11 cell types; three cancer cell types, two macrophages, B and T cells, adipocytes, normal epithelium and perivascular-like and cancer associated fibroblasts. Among these 11 cell types, increasement of immune cells including B cells, T cells and macrophage proportions was associated with pembrolizumab treatment in NAC setting. In our study, we evaluated TME state of TNBC after NAC with or without pembrolizumab. We suggested that MSL or SL TNBC subtypes were associated with residual disease after NAC regardless of pembrolizumab use and pembrolizumab may recruit more immune cells in TME of TNBC. For concreating our suggestion, further analyses would be warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-Y.

In this study, spatial transcriptomics (ST, 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression) was performed on 40 retrospectively collected CRC samples, along with detailed clinicopathological parameters and long-term clinical outcomes, with the goal of unraveling the molecular topography of the tumor and surrounding stromal compartments, and associating their spatial interactions to clinical outcomes. Five primary RNA groups were identified through unsupervised clustering on ST data, correlating with tissue classes detected in H&#38;E-stained images via a pre-trained deep learning model. Markers and pathways specific to these tissues were identified. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration in these regions was deconvoluted using reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Sub-clustering within the tumor groups revealed five major tumor subtypes, each characterized by a distinct set of differentially expressed marker genes. Enrichment analysis across these subtypes highlighted distinct activation and suppression in pathways including KRAS, p53, MAPK, and Integrin. Tumors exhibited intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Location-specific tumor subtypes were observed, with those in right-sided CRC displaying increased immune cell infiltration, linked to enriched pathways such as Type II Interferon Signaling and Cytokine Signaling. Conversely, left-sided CRC subtypes had reduced immune cell presence, and were characterized by enhanced pathways related to vascular development, Hypoxia, and p53 Signaling. Inferred clonal lineages from copy number variation (CNV) using ST suggested a spatially structured phylogenetic organization corresponding to transcriptional clusters. Additionally, the ST data unveiled distinct spatial distribution patterns across various cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotypes, such as matrix, inflammatory, vessel-associated, tumor-promoting, and antigen-presenting CAFs. Transcriptional patterns uncovered through scRNA-seq, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), displayed unique spatial layouts within the tumor microenvironment. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity within CRC patients, revealing distinct tumor, stroma and immune compositions and spatial structures. This spatially detailed map provides novel insights into CRC heterogeneity, critical for advancing personalized treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,Cancer genomics,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Multiple studies have characterized at single cell resolution the GBM as being composed of transcriptional cell states interconnected with components in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Our group proposed and validated the first single cell guided functional classification of GBM in four tumor-intrinsic cell states which informed clinical outcome and delivered therapeutic options. However, single cell technologies are unable to unravel the spatial relationships among the cell states of GBM and between GBM cell states and TME. Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are emerging as powerful tools to reconstruct the spatial architecture of a tissue. We performed spatial transcriptomics of multicellular regions of interest (ROI) in 6 primary IDH wild-type GBM and 2 recurrent GBM with both CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager, which analyzes 1,000 RNA probes and 64 proteins at single cell resolution, and GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler which profiles the whole transcriptome (~18,000 genes) at ROI resolution. The development of computational tools aimed to integrate spatial proximity and CosMx derived single-cell transcriptomics revealed spatial segregation of the tumor cell clones and cellular states and highlighted recurrent patterns of cell states, distinct TME cell types associated with coherent histopathological features across multiple samples. The development of a spatial informed intercellular communication algorithm and the reconstruction of ligand-receptor-target networks will allow the discovery of tumor cell states-TME cross-talks and the biological signaling regulated by these interactions that are driving the heterogeneity of GBM and therefore potentially therapeutically targetable. Analysis of matched regions of interest profiled by GeoMx and spatial proteomics with CosMx further cross-validated the spatial ecosystem of glioblastoma as reconstructed at single-cell resolution. Our studies established a scalable approach to resolve the transcriptional heterogeneity of GBM and reconstruct the architecture of GBM cell states and tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Single cell,Tumor heterogeneity,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

They function as immunological &#8220;hubs&#8221;, driving anti-tumor responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of TLSs is often associated with improved responses to immunotherapy and superior clinical outcomes. Despite these insights, our understanding of their phenotypic diversity, spatial organization, intercellular communication, and interactions with cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment remains incomplete. Existing methods lack the resolution, depth, and scale required for a thorough understanding of these complex structures. We have obtained in-house and public spatial multi-omics data generated on various tissues across 9 different cancer types using the cutting-edge single-cell spatial transcriptomics and high-plex spatial molecular imaging platforms. We have developed innovative computational approaches for the detailed characterization of TLSs at single-cell and subcellular resolution and carried out an extensive analysis of lymphoid aggregates (LAs) and TLSs in tissue sections across these different solid cancer types. We defined the phenotypic state of each individual cell within TLSs including B\/ plasma cells, follicular helper\/regulatory\/stressed\/exhausted T cells, follicular dendritic cells, fibroblasts and high endothelial venules. Then, we performed unbiased phenotyping and classification of TLSs based on their cellular states, compositions and organization patterns across various types of tissues. Additionally, we performed spatial neighborhood analysis, characterized the neighboring cells of each TLS and analyzed their cell-cell communication networks.<b> <\/b>Our approach allowed an unprecedented examination of the spatial phenotypes of TLSs in large, complex tissues at super resolution, in ways that were not previously described.<b> <\/b>We comprehensively characterized TLSs across different solid tumor types. Our analysis revealed a high degree of spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity in LAs and TLSs. We created a comprehensive spatial atlas of LAs and TLSs across solid tumor types, profiled TLSs at various maturation states with distinct cellular composition and organization patterns, and discovered new TLS states. Notably, we observed distinct communication networks associated with TLS phenotypic states.<b> <\/b>Our innovative methods and analytical approaches offer a more comprehensive way to study LAs and TLSs, enhancing detection capabilities and providing deeper insights into their spatial interaction and functional phenotypes.

Unfortunately, efficacious treatments for lung cancer remain suboptimal. Lung cancer is characterized by several distinct subtypes of which lung adenocarcinoma is the most common, comprising about 40% of this malignancy. The hallmark gene mutations of lung adenocarcinoma include <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>RAS, <\/i>and <i>STK11. <\/i>LKB1 is a serine-threonine kinase (coded by the gene <i>STK11<\/i>) that largely functions as a tumor suppressor, and is mutated in 20-30% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The diversity between and within lung cancer subtypes, as well as within a patient (i.e. metastases vs primary tumor), makes treating this cancer very challenging. Lung adenocarcinoma, in particular, has collective invasion packs of cells adjacent to the primary tumor that correlate with metastatic disease in mouse models. We hypothesize that the transcriptomic profile of the collective invasion packs in lung adenocarcinoma patients varies significantly from the adjacent primary tumor and represents a targetable metastatic sub-population. This work will help to identify specific cell signaling pathways that have the translational potential to develop novel therapeutics for metastatic disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes through precision medicine. Utilizing patient lung adenocarcinoma samples with KRAS and KRAS+LKB1 mutations, we identified regions of interest including bulk tumor and surrounding invasion packs. Then, using GeoMx digital spatial profiling technology (by Nanostring) and next-gen sequencing, we generated transcriptomic profiles from bulk tumor and invasion packs. Preliminary results indicate region specific transcriptomic differences, highlighting the heterogeneity of these cell populations. More specifically, collective invasion packs exhibit upregulation of gene networks involving immune cell differentiation, function, oxidative phosphorylation, tumor invasiveness, and mitochondrial structure. To discern the metastatic potential, transcriptomic profiles and biological functions will be compared between invasion packs, tumor bulk vs invasion packs, and finally, inter-patient differences. Successful completion of this project will characterize transcriptomes of metastatic lung cancer and has the potential to ultimately identify biomarkers of aggressive disease. Lastly, this foundational study will pave the way for future studies on the transcriptomic landscape of metastatic pediatric cancers and cancer predisposition syndromes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Metastatic potential,Transcription,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The molecular and cellular characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) may reveal clues as to why some head and neck tumors are responsive or resistant to the therapy.<br \/>Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were collected from 34 patients at two major Queensland Hospitals with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), prior to immunotherapy. To investigate the cellular and molecular characteristics of the HNSCC TME, we used the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) spanning modules in an immune-oncology panel, which included immune cell typing and profiling, cell death, PI3K\/AKT signaling, drug target, immune activation, and pan tumor protein biomarkers. A deeper structural analysis was performed using the Nanostring whole transcriptome atlas (WTA) panel of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and germinal centers (GCs).<br \/>Results: Out of 34 patients, 3 had a complete response (CR), 7 had a partial response (PR), 5 had stable disease (SD), and 19 had progressive disease (PD), based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). When we compared patient responders (patients with CR, PR, and SD) to patient non-responders (patients with PD), we found that the former had a higher infiltration of immune cell type markers representatives of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, into their tumor microenvironment than the latter. Then, to investigate differentially expressed genes between patients with complete response and patients with partial response to immunotherapy, we performed DE analyses and we found that patients with PR had higher Ki-67 expression than those with CR. Spatial transcriptomic mapping of TLS&#8217;s (peripheral, intra-tumoral) and normal germinal centers revealed interferon pathway enrichment in the TLS&#8217;s. In a subset, these appear to be linked with HPV viral infection.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we found that immune cell type infiltration into the tumor microenvironment of head and neck cancers could be predictive of response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, it was revealed that patients with a high expression of Ki-67 might be less likely to respond completely to immunotherapy. Spatially resolved whole transcriptome analysis of HNSCC tissues revealed the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures with a higher enrichment of interferon pathway genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

While previous research has implicated partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT) of tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), specifically myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), in LNM, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the lack of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers related to LNM has impeded the improvement in clinical outcomes for patients with OSCC. Here, we conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis integrating original and publicly available OSCC data of the bulk genome and transcriptome analyses, single-cell transcriptome profiling, and spatial transcriptome analyses. We found that myCAFs were both quantitatively and functionally activated in LNM-positive samples and spatially colocalized with OSCC cells within the invasive tumor front (ITF), providing a niche that may facilitate LNM. We validated spatial colocalization of myCAFs and OSCC cells using 50 additional Immunohistochemistry (IHC) samples. Mechanistically, myCAFs provided increased extracellular matrix (ECM) signals, such as <i>COLLAGEN<\/i>, <i>Fibronectin1(FN1)<\/i>, and <i>LAMININ<\/i> to OSCC cells. Consequently, OSCC cells upregulate ECM receptors such as <i>&#945;&#946; integrins (ITGA-B)<\/i>, <i>syndecans (SDC)<\/i>, and <i>CD44<\/i>, leading to upregulating stemness-related genes in OSCC cells. Further analysis using CRISPRGeneEffect data from DepMap found that <i>ITGB1<\/i>, <i>ITGA3<\/i>, and <i>CD44<\/i> are among the most essential genes for the survival and growth of OSCC cells. By analyzing the spatial transcriptomic data of matched primary tumor sites (HUH001-P1 and HUH001-P2) and metastatic site (HUH001-met) from the same patient, we identified the origins of metastatic cells in the primary tumor site. We further extracted a 23-gene signature from the metastatic origin in ITF, where OSCC and myCAFs colocalize. This spatially-resolved 23-gene signature predicted LNM status and poor overall survival (OS) in clinical OSCC patients. The prognostic significance of the 23-gene signature we extracted from the spatial analysis was also validated in separate clinical cohorts from TCGA study and two other microarray datasets. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular crosstalk between myCAFs and OSCC cells that facilitates LNM and identifies clinically valuable biomarkers for better prognostication in patients with OSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymph node metastasis,Oral cancers,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Many of the currently available mIHC technologies do not offer amplification, resulting in the loss of detection of low expressing cells, while others require deposition and cycling of antibodies, which can lead to epitope masking and degradation, respectively. The SignalStar mIHC assay from Cell Signaling Technology is a novel methodology used to label, amplify and visualize up to 8 targets within the same formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded carcinoma (FFPE) tissue section without the need for fluorophore deposition or antibody cycling.<br \/>In this study, the SignalStar mIHC assay was used to simultaneously label 8 targets including TIM-3, PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, CD3, CD68, CD8 and Pan-Keratin in FFPE carcinoma tissue. A network of complementary, fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotides was used to amplify the signal of the first 4 antibody-oligo conjugates followed by tissue imaging. The fluorescent signal was then removed, and the process repeated.The resulting two 4-plex images were then computationally aligned with QuPath. This methodology was compared to the Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) deposition assay, as well as to indirect and direct immunofluorescent detection with respect to mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) per cell and percent positivity of cells in matched regions of interest in serial sections. All mIHC strategies were in turn compared to the canonical chromogenic IHC assay. Furthermore, the fluorescent signal from the 8-plex SignalStar assay was removed and the same tissue was stained with fluorescent direct conjugates to achieve even higher plex.<br \/>Our data demonstrates that the SignalStar assay detected similar percentages of cells when compared to chromogenic and TSA staining. Alternatively, the SignalStar assay often outperformed indirect and direct immunofluorescent detection. SignalStar was also successfully combined with a panel of direct Alexa Fluor&#174; dye conjugates, showing the complementarity of these assays in such a way that both plex and flexibility can be increased. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SignalStar mIHC is a useful tool in the characterization and analysis of the complex TME. SignalStar mIHC outshines existing technologies as it does not require deposition in order to amplify the signal of multiple colocalizing targets, including low abundance proteins, while also maintaining dynamic range.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Only a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Thus, there is a clinical need to develop predictive biomarkers for ICIs. Deeper insights from the tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to identification of spatial features associated with clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In this study, we investigated functional profiles within cell subtypes as a surrogate for ICI clinical endpoints.<br \/>Methods. We profiled a retrospective cohort of 39 NSCLC tissue cores from 27 patients treated with ICI, using highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) stained by the Phenocycler Fusion platform (Akoya Biosciences) capturing 45 proteins. Utilizing a deep learning based multiplex imaging analysis pipeline, cells were classified to 15 cell types by known marker expression and were further subclassified by unsupervised clustering. Cells were assigned to the tumor area or TME and more than 1000 spatial features were calculated based on cell type, marker positivity, and area assignments, and were compared between responders and non-responders to ICI therapy using Fisher&#8217;s exact and logrank tests.<br \/>Results. Unsupervised cell subtyping of the 15 cell types identified 43 cell subsets, which were mostly segregated by their metabolism and activation status. Interestingly, all lymphocytes showed a similar pattern of clustering resulting in two clusters of metabolically active and inactive cells. The most significantly differentially expressed proteins between these cell types were oxidative phosphorylation proteins such as CS, SDHA and ATPA5, and other metabolic enzymes such as HK1, GLUT1 and LDHA. We found a direct connection between metabolic state, effector functions and tissue localization as the metabolically active lymphocytes exhibited higher levels of PD-1, MHC class I and II and CD44 positivity, and were more abundant within tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). Unsupervised clustering of tumor cells demonstrated segregation to three main metabolic states - OXPHOS+, OXPHOS- and a third cluster (PPP+) which was characterized by upregulation of ASCT2, a glutamine transporter, as well as pNRF2 and G6PD, regulators of the pentose phosphate pathway. These cells also exhibited higher proliferation rate and CD44, a tumor stemness marker, positivity. All tumors with high content of PPP+ tumor cells (&#62;40%) were resistant to PD-1 blockade (0\/8 vs. 10\/18 response rate in other tumors, p=0.009) and showed reduced overall survival (OS) rates (median OS of 27.6 vs 90.3 months, p=0.02).<br \/>Conclusions.

This finding prompted our investigation of clinically viable strategies to induce TLS in patients with immune-excluded tumors. We previously reported the induction of intratumoral TLS following administration of a neoadjuvant GM-CSF-secreting allogeneic vaccine (GVAX) to PDAC patients (NCT00727441). However, no clinical benefit was observed, likely owing to immune tolerance mechanisms governing the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). We previously observed upregulation of both the PD-1 and 4-1BB pathways with GVAX, and thus in a subsequent neoadjuvant trial combined GVAX with PD-1 blockade and 4-1BB agonism (NCT02451982) which was associated with pathologic responses. We hypothesized this combination strategy induced TLS of higher maturity and anti-tumor activity compared to GVAX alone.<br \/>Methods: To explore how this therapeutic strategy affected TLS morphology and intercellular crosstalk, we leveraged the Visium spatial transcriptomics platform and a 35-marker customized TLS panel for imaging mass cytometry. We generated cellular and molecular maps of the TME after neoadjuvant treatment in 26 PDAC patients (GVAX n=19, GVAX+aPD1 n=2, GVAX+aPD1+a41BB n=5). To compare TLS maturation in parallel with secondary lymphoid organ-mediated tumor immunity, we also profiled tumor-adjacent lymph nodes. We applied unsupervised learning with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and trained AI-enabled image classification models to characterize cellular states within tissue structures of interest.<br \/>Results: We identified spatial gene expression NMF patterns in PDAC TLS spanning across distinct morphologies and neoadjuvant treatment arms. Intratumoral TLS after GVAX were found to propagate activated B cells expressing immunoglobulins that infiltrated into malignant cellular niches. TLS NMF patterns were also associated with autoimmune disease signatures, such as diabetes, in a subset of patients. We scored TLS using tumor-draining lymph nodes as a reference and found increased maturation of TLS after PD-1 blockade, while addition of 4-1BB agonism significantly boosted the cytotoxic NK\/T cell compartment compared to GVAX alone.<br \/>Conclusions: We present machine learning approaches for spatial multi-omics analysis to characterize the TLS-enriched TME. We mined genome-wide spatial TLS gene expression patterns elucidating the spatial dynamics of humoral immunity of rare immunotherapy pathologic responders in PDAC. Altogether our findings shed light on the plasticity of TLS in neoadjuvant immunotherapy and suggest future immunotherapy approaches should target both humoral and cytotoxic NK\/T cell compartments to augment responses in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Lymph nodes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Recent genomic analyses have revealed the intertumor heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In CRC with liver metastases, current treatment strategies are mainly based on the parameters of primary tumors, and metastatic heterogeneity is a challenge since molecular heterogeneity contributes to therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, spatial intratumor heterogeneity exists within a single tumor between cancer cells (tumor) and their microenvironment (stroma) in human cancers. However, whether there are distinct spatial gene expression patterns of tumor and stroma between primary lesions and liver metastases remains unclear in CRCs.<br \/>We examined 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples, including primary lesions and matched liver metastases from 12 patients (6 with synchronous and 6 with metachronous metastases) using NanoString GeoMx&#174; DSP. The best regions of interest (ROI) with the invasive front boundary of the tumor were selected by pathologists. The ROI was segmented into PanCK-<br \/>positive (tumor) and PanCK-negative (stroma), followed by a collection of indexed oligonucleotides and sequencing on Illumina instrument. Differential expression and pathways enrichment analyses were performed using R BioConductor package standR, limma, and GSEABase. Statistical significances were based on |Log<sub>2<\/sub> fold change| &#62; 1 and Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.05. Immune cell abundance was estimated using the SpatialDecon package.<br \/>In 12 metastatic patients (mean age, 61 years &#177; 7 [standard deviation]), liver metastatic stroma was associated with 68 upregulated and 93 downregulated genes compared to the primary stroma, with enrichment of 'Immune response' terms in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A higher proportion of CD4 T memory cells and increased expression of cytotoxic genes (<i>IL7R<\/i> [2.02-fold], <i>CD3E<\/i> [1.75-fold], <i>KLRB1 <\/i>[1.68-fold], and<i> GZMK <\/i>[1.54-fold]) were observed in liver stroma compared to primary stroma. Conversely, liver metastatic tumors were associated only with 23 upregulated and 6 downregulated genes compared to primary tumors, with 'humoral response' terms enriched in GSEA. Similar patterns were observed in stratified analyses with synchronous and metachronous metastases, although a more prominent &#8216;immune response&#8217; was observed in synchronous metastatic stroma compared to the primary stroma.<br \/>We revealed that higher immune cell proportion and cytotoxic activity were observed in liver metastatic stroma compared to CRC stroma, providing novel insights into a unique etiology and may yield clinical implications for developing targeted treatment modalities for liver metastatic CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Liver metastasis,Spatial transcriptome,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

The tumor microenvironment is composed of different cell types and is known to support the glioblastoma cells and contribute to poor patient prognosis. Since accumulating studies report discordance between mRNA and protein abundances both on population and single-cell levels, and since proteins are the effector molecules of the cells and the actual target molecules of most drugs, our aim is to dissect the tumor microenvironment by spatial LC-MS based proteomics. Glioblastoma<b> <\/b>formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was sectioned and placed on membrane glass slides suitable for laser capture microdissection (LCM), followed by precise isolation of single cells from the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. We used the Zeiss Palm MicroBeam laser microdissection instrument, combined with an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer running our in-house sensitivity tailored Data Independent Acquisition method (WISH-DIA) to analyze and quantify the proteomes. We obtained up to 3000 proteins out of only 100 cells and were able to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting and analyzing various cell types at the single-cell level. The proteins identified belonged to many different classes\/families of proteins and were able to distinguish the different cell types. In conclusion, this on-going study demonstrates our ability to isolate single cells from the highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma with ultra-high sensitivity, thereby allowing the characterization of the proteome of the glioblastoma microenvironment followed by identification of potential therapeutic and\/or diagnostic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Proteomics,Laser capture microdissection,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Our understanding of the development of IO resistance for ccRCC is very limited. We employed spatial transcriptomics (ST) with single cell resolution on patients with IO na&#239;ve tumors and IO exposed tumors to characterize spatial properties and differences between these two populations. Fourteen matched tumor and adjacent stromal fields of view (FOV) from surgically resected primary kidney specimens were analyzed using CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI). Non-tumor cell phenotyping was performed using the Kidney Cell Atlas. A generalized linear model was developed to identify malignant tumor cells in kidney tissues and validated by a pathologist. Differential cell abundance, clustering, and gene expression for each cell phenotype were compared between the two groups. Spatial gene set enrichment (GSEA) of modified hallmark gene sets were also compared. CD8+ T cells were more abundant in IO exposed vs IO na&#239;ve tumor FOVs. <i>YES1<\/i> expression in the malignant tumor cells was significantly higher in IO exposed samples compared to IO na&#239;ve samples (false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.084). Spatial GSEA showed significant clustering of many gene sets (cells of high enrichment closer together than expected by chance), most notably epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Next, a post-hoc analysis of genes belonging to known ligand-receptor pairs in the EMT pathway was completed using bivariate Moran&#8217;s I to estimate spatial autocorrelation. We found significantly higher spatial autocorrelation of <i>ITGAV<\/i>-<i>COL4A1<\/i> in the stroma of IO exposed FOVs than IO na&#239;ve FOVs (FDR = 0.008). Cell types with the highest expression of <i>ITGAV<\/i> and <i>COL4A1<\/i> were found to be fibroblasts, endothelial, and tumor cells. Protein validation with multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) confirmed cells positively stained for anti-integrin alpha-V were more abundance on stromal FOVs (p &#60; 0.001) in IO exposed samples. Fibroblast (SMA+) cells in stromal FOVs were more likely to be positively stained for anti-integrin alpha-V (p &#60; 0.001) in IO exposed than IO na&#239;ve FOVs. ITGAV protein is involved in migration from primary to metastatic disease in several cancers, and its inhibition increases T cell killing indicating ccRCC endothelial and tumor cells may be using this signaling for immune evasion and disease progression. Further, collagen and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumor growth. To our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage single-cell resolution ST to identify potential ways by which ccRCC tumors become resistant to IO therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Renal cell carcinoma,Single cell,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
