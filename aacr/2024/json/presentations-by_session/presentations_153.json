However, many cancers do not respond to ICB, prompting the search for additional strategies to achieve durable cancer remission. In this regard, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell surface receptors involved in signal transduction and are the target of &#62;30% of all approved drugs. GPCRs are the most pharmacologically favorable targets due to their druggability and direct relevance to many key physiological processes and a myriad of human diseases. However, GPCRs have been largely underexploited in oncology, and specifically understudied in cancer immunotherapy. GPCRs are primarily coupled to 4 distinct families of G proteins &#945; subunit (G&#945;i, G&#945;s, G&#945;q, and G&#945;12), which dictate the signaling events controlled by each GPCR. Recently, we cross-integrated large single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from CD8+ T cells covering 19 distinct cancer types and identified an enrichment of G&#945;s-coupled GPCRs on exhausted CD8+ T cells. These include GPCRs activated by inflammatory mediators, protons, neurotransmitters, and metabolites that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting T cell dysfunction. We also developed transgenic mice expressing a chemogenetic CD8-restricted G&#945;s-GPCR and showed that a G&#945;s-PKA signaling axis promotes CD8+ T cell exhaustion and immunotherapy failure. These studies revealed that tumor cells may avoid immune elimination by stimulating G&#945;s-GPCRs on infiltrating CD8 T cells, thereby exposing novel druggable immune checkpoints that can be exploited therapeutically. We have recently extended these studies and mapped the expression patterns of all human GPCRs in nearly a million-tumor infiltrating immune cells. The emerging tumor-immune GPCR atlas may provide a valuable resource to explore the role of GPCRs in cancer immunology. Ultimately, our study may reveal new and exciting GPCR therapeutic targets to enhance the response to ICB, and help identify potential co-medications that may limit the success of ICB therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Cancer immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Chemokine receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>J.
