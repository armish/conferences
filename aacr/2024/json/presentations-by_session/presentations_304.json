We developed a novel comprehensive <i>in silico <\/i>pipeline for detecting tumor-specific splicing events (neojunctions), and across multiple cancer types, we successfully identified a new class of tumor-wide, public, alternatively spliced neoantigens (ASNs) that elicit CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune responses.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Our pipeline identified recurring public neojunctions expressed in TCGA RNA-seq (positive sample rate (PSR) &#62; 10%) and not in GTEx normal tissue RNA-seq data (PSR &#60; 1%) across ten cancer types. To characterize tumor-wide neojunctions, we utilized available multi-site RNA sequencing across diverse cancer types. With gliomas, our in-house dataset comprised of 56 patients with approximately 10 maximally-distanced intratumoral biopsy sites per patient (<i>n<\/i>=535). Tumor-wide public neojunction expression was subsequently validated in RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) data from patient-derived cell lines (<i>n<\/i>=68) and samples (<i>n<\/i>=447). Two independent algorithms then predicted peptide processing likelihood and HLA-binding affinity of ASN candidates. TCRs identified by <i>in vitro<\/i> sensitization (IVS) of donor-derived CD8+ T-cells followed by 10x VDJ scRNA-seq, were transduced into CD8+ T-cells and co-cultured with tumor cells to evaluate TCR functionality and cytotoxicity.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Pan-cancer analysis identified large subsets of neojunctions that were interpatiently and intratumorally conserved. Our glioma-specific analysis identified 789 public neojunctions, and 8 ASNs were validated in transcriptomic and proteomic glioma data and predicted to be presented by HLA-A*02:01 with high confidence. IVS and subsequent 10x VDJ scRNA-seq on expanded PBMC-derived CD8+ populations cultured against ASN-pulsed dendritic cells identified TCR clonotypes reactive against neojunctions in <i>RPL22<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=7) and <i>GNAS<\/i> (<i>n<\/i>=1), the latter being highly intratumorally-conserved (detected in &#62; 90% of spatially-mapped biopsies in 17\/56 patients (26.78%)). TCR-transduced T-cells demonstrated recognition and immunogenic activation against endogenously processed and presented neoantigens in both pan-cancer cell lines and transfected COS7 cells and cytotoxicity against glioma cell lines. Pan-cancer analysis revealed the detection of both neojunctions in various tumor types beyond gliomas, with the GNAS neojunction notably found tumor-wide in mesothelioma, prostate cancer, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma spatial data.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>Our unique integrative pipeline identified a novel class public tumor-wide splice-derived neoantigen candidates and ASN-specific TCRs, offering a promising off-the-shelf immunotherapy approach for diverse cancer types and tackling the critical challenge of ITH in immunotherapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,RNA,Immunotherapy,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Given the delicate balance of R-loop formation and resolution in maintaining efficient transcription and replication, the ability of DHX9 to unwind R-loops is important in helping to maintain genomic stability. In addition, DHX9 can interact and regulate a large variety of proteins, including key proteins in DNA damage repair pathways such as BRCA1, ATR, Ku86, and WRN. Previously we demonstrated that DHX9 inhibition was efficacious in microsatellite high (MSI-H) CRC xenograft tumor models. Efficacy attributed to DHX9 loss in MSI-H correlates with defective DNA repair pathways such as mismatch repair (MMR). Here we report results of preclinical studies in ovarian and breast cancer models that indicate patients with Loss-of-Function (LOF) mutations in the DNA damage repair genes BRCA1 and\/or BRCA2, may also benefit from DHX9 inhibitor treatment. <b><\/b> DHX9 small molecule inhibitor ATX968 was tested for anti-proliferative activity in a large cell panel of 300 cell lines, and bioinformatic analyses was performed to identify molecular variants that co-associate with sensitivity or resistance cell proliferation outcomes. Notably, selective dependency on DHX9 was observed in both ovarian and breast cancer cell lines that exhibit BRCA LOF, as defined by somatic mutations including single-nucleotide variants and\/or copy number loss in BRCA1 and\/or BRCA2. DHX9 inhibition leads to increased RNA\/DNA secondary structures such as R-loops and G-quadruplexes, resulting in subsequent DNA damage and increased replication stress. Cell lines that exhibit BRCA LOF appear unable to resolve this replication stress and show S-G2 phase cell cycle arrest prior to onset of apoptosis. Furthermore, a potent and selective DHX9 inhibitor tool compound was dosed orally <i>in vivo<\/i> to assess DHX9 dependency within multiple human xenografts representing triple negative breast cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer with BRCA LOF. In all models, the tool DHX9 inhibitor was dosed orally at 100 mg\/kg BID and it was well tolerated for a period of up to 28 days. Robust and significant tumor growth inhibition and regression was observed in multiple BRCA LOF models with minimal tumor growth inhibition observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type xenograft models. These results extend the opportunity for DHX9 inhibition to provide therapeutic benefit for patients with solid tumors beyond what was previously reported for MSI-H CRC. Together, this preclinical data package validates DHX9 as a tractable new target with potential utility as a novel treatment for patients with defective DNA repair, such as MMR and BRCA1 and\/or BRCA2 LOF, across multiple tumor types including colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA,DNA damage response,Small molecule inhibitor,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Loss or inhibition of PARG results in replication stress and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, suggesting it is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Indeed, PARG inhibitors are now undergoing clinical development for patients having tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as ovarian and breast cancer patients with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>-mutation. In this study, we investigated PARG inhibitor (PARGi)-PDD00017273 activity in preclinical models of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary patient-derived organoids. PARGi exhibited sensitivity in a subset of ovarian cancer cell lines that was distinct from PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Initially, we evaluated a PARGi-sensitive cell line, RMUGS. By gradually increasing the concentration of PARGi, we generated drug resistant cells. PARGi treatment resulted in increased S phase specific PAR, DNA-PARylation, DNA damage, and replication stress in the sensitive cells but not in cells with <i>de novo<\/i> or acquired resistance. In the sensitive cells, PARGi exposure also increased accumulation of PAR at the replication fork resulting from unligated Okazaki fragment processing. More importantly, PARGi treatment or PARG loss caused accumulation of single strand DNA (ssDNA) gaps in sensitive cells, as detected by the DNA fiber assays combined with S1 nuclease treatment. Regardless of the <i>BRCA-<\/i>status, the induction of ssDNA gaps in ovarian cancer cells correlated with PARGi sensitivity. Consistent with an increase in ssDNA gaps, PARGi exposure increased p-RPA, a ssDNA surrogate, at the replication fork in sensitive cells. p-RPA sites also colocalized with PAR suggesting that accumulation of PAR occurs at the ssDNA sites, perhaps, leading to the ssDNA gaps. Collectively, these results suggested that toxic accumulation of PAR at the replication fork leads to accumulation of ssDNA gaps due to Okazaki fragment processing defects and ovarian cancer cell killing after PARG inhibition. We further assessed PARG inhibition in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoids (PDXOs) as model systems of ovarian cancer. PARGi exhibited monotherapy activity in specific HR-deficient PDOs and PDXOs with <i>BRCA1 <\/i>or <i>RAD51C<\/i> mutation and in a HR-proficient PDXO model. Importantly, PARGi exposure resulted in accumulation of ssDNA gaps in organoids of ovarian cancer and this phenotype directly correlated with drug sensitivity. PDOs can therefore be a useful model system for testing PARGi sensitivity. The detection of ssDNA gaps in PDOs may provide a functional biomarker to predict the response to PARG inhibitors in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

This process could be accelerated by a comprehensive interrogation of driver variants and gene expression profiles across cancer types. The Atlas of Blood Cancer Genomes (ABCG) project was initiated to elucidate the molecular basis of all leukemias and lymphomas, building on advances in genomic technologies, our capabilities for data analysis, and economies of scale.<br \/>The ABCG project includes collaborators from 25 institutions worldwide who contributed samples from 10,512 patients comprising every type of blood cancer in the World Health Organization classifications. All cases were de-identified and their associated pathology and clinical information entered into a purpose-built web-based system. All cases underwent pathology and clinical data review by experienced hematopathologists and oncologists. Samples were subjected to whole exome DNA and RNA sequencing.<br \/>We examined three classes of therapeutic targets with selected examples of application: 1. Surface markers: Surface markers are targets of many approved and experimental therapies in blood cancers (CAR-T cells, monoclonal and bispecific antibodies). We found that CD22, which has been evaluated as a target in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), is also highly expressed in follicular lymphoma, adult ALL, mantle cell lymphoma, and high-grade B cell lymphoma, all areas of clinical need. We can evaluate the expression of virtually any marker or combination of markers across all blood cancers while noting areas of greatest clinical need within and across diseases, providing the basis to reclassify diseases by therapeutic target. 2. Genetic targets: Our work assesses the entire spectrum of genetic alterations including mutations and fusions. We found targetable alterations including BCR-ABL1 fusions, EZH2 Y641, IDH2 R140Q and BRAF V600E mutations in multiple cancers, albeit at low frequency, pointing to potential new indications for existing drugs in subsets of rare diseases. 3. Complex targets (immune or expression signatures or combinations of gene variants): Past work defined DLBCL immune and other signatures associated with response to avadomide, a novel cereblon inhibitor.

Treatments for high grade (HG) MEC are lacking due to a limited understanding of its diverse histological and clinical features. Consequently, patients with non-resectable HG MEC are often treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and suffer from increased rates of recurrence and metastasis with poor 5-year survival rates (30-50%) as compared to low grade (LG) MEC (76-95%). We previously demonstrated a role for IGF-1 signaling, an important mediator for SG development and branching morphogenesis, in MEC pathogenesis (Musicant et al, 2021). Here, we analyzed transcriptome profiles shared between fetal and adult normal parotid (PAR) tissues with MEC tumors to investigate programs involved in MEC progression. Using this information, we developed the first genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of advanced HG MEC via targeted oncogene expression in SG ductal cells. MEC samples from 21 PAR tumors (8 LG\/13 HG), 8 age-matched normal, and 3 fetal PAR glands aged between 22-24 weeks of gestation (Saitou et al, 2020) were retrospectively collected from UCSF or UNC Surgical Pathology. RNAseq was performed on FFPE samples using Illumina HiSeq. Differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), and alternative splicing analyses were compared between fetal\/normal\/MEC according to tumor grade and CRTC1 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1)\/MAML2 (Mastermind-like 2) (C1\/M2) status. Based on these analyses, we developed a GEMM combining C1\/M2 expression with TP53 loss. GEMM tumors were subjected to RNAseq and reviewed by two independent pathologists for diagnostic confirmation of HG MEC.GSEA revealed significant overlap between MEC tumors and fetal SG for genes governing proliferation and developmental pathways associated with branching morphogenesis. Interestingly, upregulation of the negatively regulated p53 target FOXM1 along with a mutant-p53 gene signature (Troester et al, 2006) revealed that p53 dysregulation in HG tumors phenocopies that seen in fetal SG. Cre-inducible expression of C1\/M2 alone was insufficient to induce MEC-like lesions when targeted to distinct salivary cell types (ductal Krt14-CreER, acinar Mist1-CreER, serous demilune Dcpp1-CreER). However, p53 alteration (Tp53<sup>KO<\/sup>) with ductal C1\/M2 expression drove MEC formation with histological and molecular features of human HG-MEC. Notably, transcriptome profiles implicate an FGFR-p53 developmental signaling axis<b> <\/b>in MEC progression. Our autochthonous GEMM recapitulates advanced HG-MEC <i>in vivo<\/i> providing the field with a powerful platform for identifying pathways for developing targeted therapies. Taken together, the integrated bioinformatics and mouse modeling of this study provide a critical step toward elucidating salivary MEC progression and suggest a role for FGFR targeted therapies in the treatment of non-resectable HG MEC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-05 New nonclinical models for targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumorigenesis,Gene expression analysis,Transgenic mouse models,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Although PARPi have shown limited efficacy as OS monotherapy, rational combination strategies have not yet been explored for this disease. We performed a genome-scale loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 screen in two OS cell lines in the presence and absence of olaparib, a small molecule PARPi. <i>ATM<\/i> knockout (KO) scored highly as a potent synergizer of PARPi across both cell lines. Here we report this screen finding as well as <i>in vitro<\/i> validation of PARPi and ATM inhibition (ATMi) synergy in OS models.<br \/>OS cell lines SAOS2 and CAL72 were infected with the Avana genome-scale lentiviral CRISPR library, targeting 20,000 genes with 4 uniquely barcoded guides (sgRNAs) per gene. After infection and antibiotic selection, cells were grown in an IC<sub>40<\/sub> dose of olaparib or matched control for 18 days. Following DNA sequencing of barcodes and rigorous quality control, sgRNA dropout hits were calculated against the control arm. <i>ATM<\/i> KO sensitizing to PARPi was first validated utilizing a CRISPR-based genetic approach. <i>ATM<\/i> KO in CAL72 and SAOS2 was performed via lentiviral infection. After KO confirmation by western immunoblotting (WB), <i>ATM<\/i> KO and control KO cells were treated with PARPi in a dose range of 19.5 nM-10 &#181;M. ATP-based and Incucyte assays were used to quantify differential cell viability. Secondly, the combination of a small molecule ATMi and a PARPi was studied in a panel of OS cell lines. Synergistic cytotoxicity was quantified using the Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP) model. DNA damage levels after PARPi and ATMi (by chemical inhibition and genetic KO) were assessed by WB for &#947;H<sub>2<\/sub>AX, a marker of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs).<br \/>In our genome-scale CRISPR screens,<b> <\/b>ATM arose as a top druggable hit across both lines. Reassuringly,<i> PARP1<\/i> KO scored as a top resistance mediator to PARPi, confirming biologic relevance of the screen and supporting the known PARP-trapping mechanism of these drugs in OS. At low-throughput, <i>ATM<\/i> KO lines trended toward increased sensitivity to PARPi in short-term viability assays. Combined chemical inhibition yielded highly synergistic ZIP scores across OS cell lines; synergy was achieved with both drugs in the low nanomolar range. &#947;H<sub>2<\/sub>AX levels were substantially increased in the setting of combined PARPi and ATMi (via chemical inhibition or genetic KO) as compared to inactivation of either PARP or ATM alone, indicating increased presence of DNA DSBs.<br \/>In conclusion, these data demonstrate synergy of ATM and PARP inhibition, providing promise for their potential combined use in the treatment of OS. Accumulation of DNA DSBs in response to PARP and ATM inactivation suggests a shared role in DNA damage repair as the molecular basis of synergism. Ongoing studies are investigating anti-tumor potential in <i>in vivo<\/i> OS models and exploring the mechanistic impact of the combination in OS tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,PARP inhibitors,ATM,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, the mechanisms by which GCs kill malignant lymphoma cells still largely remains elusive due to the pleiotropic consequences of GC binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; <i>NR3C1<\/i>), a ligand-induced transcription factor. This prompted us to search for critical direct targets of GC action with the hypothesis that GCs may inhibit key survival pathways in lymphomas. To determine effector genes that increase glucocorticoid toxicity, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in the presence and absence of prednisolone. Screens in cell line models of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) revealed strong synergy between GC treatment and inactivation of genes encoding components of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway (&#8805;2 SD). To identify direct transcriptional GR targets and binding sites genome-wide, we performed the cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&#38;RUN) assay and integrated this dataset with RNA-seq upon GC treatment. The pairwise comparison analysis (p&#60;0.05) for GR-bound genes across BL and DLBCL cell lines revealed a significant enrichment of negative regulators of BCR\/PI3K signaling and BCR-related tumor suppressors (<i>LAPTM5, KLHL14, ARID5B, DDIT4, DAPP1, INPP5D<\/i>, and <i>CSK<\/i>). Interestingly, expression of CSK, an inhibitor of all Src-family kinases (SFKs), was repressed while that of other BCR negative regulators were directly activated by binding of GR. Combinatorial deletion of activated genes counteracted the toxicity of GC up to 83.9%. In contrast, depletion of CSK paradoxically increased the cytotoxic effects of GC in BCR-dependent aggressive lymphoma with decreased proximal BCR signaling. To gain further insights on CSK function in aggressive lymphomas, we performed phospho-proteome and ubiquitinome profiling by treating lymphoma models with a small molecule inhibitor of CSK kinase activity (CSKi). The CSKi treatment initially increased constitutive BCR signaling, as expected, but then triggered exuberant ubiquitination of the LYN, HCK and BLK, leading to their proteasomal degradation. Consequently, the CSKi blocked BCR-dependent NF-&#954;B activation in ABC DLBCL models and BCR-dependent PI3 kinase activation in models of GCB DLBCL and BL. In summary, inhibition of oncogenic BCR signaling is a major mode of action for GCs. Furthermore, small molecule inhibition of CSK kinase activity potentiated the effect of GCs on oncogenic BCR signaling and strongly synergized with GCs in killing ABC and GCB DLBCL models in vitro and preventing the growth of ABC and GCB DLBCL and patient-derived xenografts, warranting the development of clinical-grade CSK inhibitors for the treatment of these aggressive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid,B-cell receptor signaling,Aggressive B-cell lymphomas,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
