[{"Abstract":"Cancer cells frequently exhibit altered lipid metabolism to sustain their rapid growth and proliferation.Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs) are key transcription factors that orchestratelipid biosynthesis and uptake in cells. Dysregulation of SREBPs is a common feature of many cancertypes, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we present acomprehensive exploration of the potential and rationale for targeting lipid metabolism in cancerthrough the use of a small molecule inhibitor that targets activation of SREBP. We illustrate that oursmall molecule inhibitor (SMI) exhibits potent anticancer activity and effectively targets SREBPsignaling in a variety of prostate cancer models as well as in non-prostate cancer models that arelipogenesis driven. Our novel SMI induces apoptosis and reduces PCa cell proliferation, suppressescell invasion and migration. Furthermore, we illustrate that in addition to suppressing the transcriptionfactor activity of SREBPs, these novel SMIs are highly effective in suppressing both the full length andvariant androgen receptor and their signaling in prostate cancer cells. Notably, in cell and organoidmodels, these novel inhibitors exhibit synergistic anticancer activity in combination with the ARsignaling inhibitor, Enzalutamide. The anticancer activity of these inhibitors extend beyond ARdependent prostate cancer and are also effective in organoid models of neuroendocrine PCa, aparticularly drug-resistant and aggressive PC subtype. Lastly, we illustrate excellent pharmacokineticsand potent anti-tumor effects of these novel SREBP activation inhibitors using<i> <\/i><i>in<\/i><i> <\/i><i>vivo<\/i> castration-resistant prostate cancer CDX tumors. Given the urgent need for novel targets in PCa, our first-in-class inhibitor represents a promising therapeutic strategy with the potential to effectively targetdysregulated lipogenesis in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipogenesis,Drug discovery,Epigenetics,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

ONC212 is a second-generation imipridone with antitumor effects in human PDAC cell lines. ONC212 has been shown to bind to mitochondrial protease ClpP, suppress ClpX, and impair oxidative phosphorylation by decreasing ATP production. While ONC212 has been evaluated in immunocompromised mice xenografted with human pancreatic tumors, ONC212 has not been evaluated, either alone or in combination with MEK and\/or immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), in immunocompetent mice bearing notoriously aggressive <i>Kras<sup>LSL.G12D\/+<\/sup>; Tp53<sup>LSL.R172H\/+<\/sup>; Pdx1Cre<sup>tg\/+<\/sup><\/i> (KPC) murine PDAC tumors. We hypothesized that, like human PDAC cells, KPC cells would demonstrate sensitivity to ONC212 both <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i>. Our group has previously shown that ONC212 synergizes with trametinib to induce tumor cell death in human PDAC cells.

Mouse weight and tumor size was measured every four days. Treatment was stopped once tumor volumes reached 3,000 mm<sup>3<\/sup> or if ulceration occurred. Once the ideal dose of ONC212 was determined, a study treating KPC tumor-bearing C57BL\/6 mice with ONC212, trametinib, and ICI (anti-PD-1 mAb) alone and all possible doublet\/triplet combinations was performed using the same methods.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Results: <\/i>We found that the combination of ONC212 and trametinib exhibited synergy in the KPC cell line <i>in vitro.<\/i> Our <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments revealed that ONC212 controlled KPC tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, however, toxicity was also noted at higher, more frequent doses. While both 25 mg\/kg and 50 mg\/kg twice weekly were equally effective, 25 mg\/kg was better tolerated and determined to be the ideal dose. In the combination therapy study, all treatments resulted in tumor reduction, as compared to the vehicle control; however, the triple therapy group had the lowest average tumor size at day twenty. Toxicity was noted in mice receiving at least two treatments, reflected by reduced weights and mobility. Further analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment using multiplex cytokine and immunofluorescence are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imipridone,Pancreatic cancer,Combination therapy,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Over 20% of PDAC patients with advanced-stage and worse prognosis undergo a venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence. Fibrinogen (FG) may contribute to VTE due to its high expression in advanced PDAC tumors. Here, we set to determine the biological roles of tumor-derived FG in PDAC. In addition, our previous study showed that Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) A2 domain can effectively bind to FG and reduce platelet clot formation. Therefore, the functional roles of A2 on FG in PDAC were also studied.<br \/>Methods: The correlation between survival rate and FG expression in PDAC was analyzed using RNAseq profiles of 149 PDAC patient samples from the TCGA database. PDAC subtyping of Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cohort was performed using RNAseq data according to Moffitt&#8217;s criteria. The FG (three chains FGA, FGB, FGG) overexpression (OE) and knock-out (KO) PDAC cell lines were established. The gene expression and biological functions of FG were performed in PDX and cell lines using IHC and immunoblot assays. The FG effect on PDAC progression <i>in vivo<\/i> was studied in mouse models.<br \/>Results: TCGA analysis showed that elevated tumor-derived FG gene expression is significantly correlated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival rates in PDAC patients. PDX lines RNAseq analysis clearly separated BCM PDAC PDXs into two subtypes: basal-like and classical PDACs. Basal-like PDXs showed significantly stronger FG staining than that in classical ones. Compared to the classical subtype, the basal-like subtype showed significantly upregulated genes that are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), IL6\/JAK\/STAT3, and TNF&#945; signaling pathways. Accordingly, basal-like subtype PDAC exposed to IL6 or TNF&#945; significantly increased FG and FG receptor expression with activated STAT3 and AKT pathways and elevated EMT markers, whereas classical subtype cells have minimal changes. In addition, we found that the FG-OE cells exhibit enhanced cell proliferation and migration properties whereas FG-KO cells reduced the effects. Consistent with <i>in vitro<\/i> data, FG-OE PDAC showed significantly higher tumor burdens than that of control PDAC in both orthotopic and subcutaneous PDAC mouse models. Furthermore, A2 protein treatment can effectively block the FG function and dramatically inactivate the FG-induced EMT process and AKT signaling pathway.<br \/>Conclusions: Tumor-derived fibrinogen is upregulated in a basal-like subtype of PDAC cells and may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by activating aberrant signaling pathways and promoting EMT. Our findings imply that elevated fibrinogen in PDAC could contribute to tumor progression and the A2 protein which target to fibrinogen may be a promising therapy for basal-like subtype PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Tumor progression,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Mutations in SOS1 are found in several prominent cancer types, including 2-4% of NSCLC, CRC, and melanoma. The recent development of novel SOS1 inhibitors (SOS1i), including BI-3406, that block interaction between SOS1 and RAS, presents a potential therapy for SOS1-driven cancers. Here we show that the majority of SOS1 mutations observed in patients enhance RAS guanine nucleotide exchange in cells and activate RAS-MAPK signaling. We treated 11 SOS1 mutant cancer cell lines without RAS co-mutation with a SOS1i and found that 10 were sensitive to SOS1 inhibition in 2D and\/or 3D cell culture. In contrast, cell lines with SOS1 and RAS co-mutations were resistant to SOS1 inhibition. In vitro treatment of SOS1 mutant cells with a SHP2 inhibitor, which is presumed to inhibit the activity of both SOS1 and SOS2, revealed a subset of four cell lines that were more sensitive to SHP2 inhibition than SOS1 inhibition. This implied that, in certain contexts, SOS2 can compensate for the loss of SOS1 activity. Accordingly, these cells exhibited a SOS2-dependent rebound in RAS-MAPK signaling after treatment with SOS1i. SOS2 knock-down further sensitized these cells to SOS1 inhibition, resulting in responses equivalent to SHP2 inhibition. Thus, upon SOS1 inhibition relief of ERK1\/2-dependent negative regulation likely contributes to receptor tyrosine kinase-driven SOS2 activation that may mediate SOS1 inhibitor resistance in some contexts. In vivo, SOS1i efficiently inhibited tumor growth in four SOS1-mutant NSCLC, CRC, and AML xenograft models. The tumor-suppressive effects of SOS1i in these models were comparable to or stronger than the effects of SHP2i or MEKi. Thus, our results suggest that SOS1 inhibition could be an effective therapeutic approach in RAS wild-type cancer patients with SOS1 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Signal transduction inhibitors,Targeted therapy,ERK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Splicing is altered in cancer owing to both recurrent mutations and deregulated expression of trans-acting factors that catalyze and regulate splicing. Therefore, splicing can be targeted for the development of new drugs to treat cancers, particularly those with mutations in splicing factors. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), genes that encode splicing factors are among those with the highest mutation rates. These mutations are heterozygous and largely mutually exclusive, suggesting the possibility of synthetic lethality due to multiple splicing factor mutations. Such synthetic lethality can be applied as an innovative strategy to develop drugs for the treatment of MDS and AML. We have reported the development of a CLK kinase inhibitor, CTX-712, and evaluated its anti-leukemic activities both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The mechanism of action of CTX-712 involves the suppression of the phosphorylation of multiple SR proteins, including SRSF2\/3\/4\/6, alteration of nuclear speckle morphology, and switching of binding partners of SRSF2. RNA-seq analysis revealed that CTX-712 induced global alterations in splicing, typically resulting in exon exclusion (exon skipping) of cassette exons. Notably, the anti-leukemic effects of CTX-712 positively correlated with the degree of altered splicing, suggesting that CTX-712 inhibits RNA splicing. [Cancer Res (2022) 82 (12_Supplement): 5494., Blood (2022) 140 (Supplement 1): 489-490]. However, patient stratification markers for CTX-712 based on the above mechanism are still undefined. To identify biomarkers for CTX-712, we performed a comprehensive analysis by integrating both wet and dry DNA\/RNA sequencing on more than 60 <i>ex vivo<\/i> primary samples from MDS\/AML patients and 23 MDS\/AML-derived xenografts (PDX). Unexpectedly, regardless of their splicing factor-mutation status, various types of primary AML cells and PDX models were highly sensitive to CTX-712. Both the primary cells and PDX models showed significant responses to CTX-712 and greater changes in splicing. Additionally, we performed biomarker analysis by comparing gene mutations and RNA splicing patterns between the sensitive and insensitive models and associating them with the anti-tumor effect. We identified several potential biomarkers that can indicate sensitivity to CTX-712. Mechanistic studies that aim to determine why these biomarkers could make cancer more sensitive to splicing perturbation by CTX-712 are ongoing. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a significant effect of CTX-712 on MDS\/AML-derived models regardless of their splicing factor-mutation status. Additionally, we present novel biomarkers that could predict sensitivity to CTX-712.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Spliceosome,Small molecule inhibitor,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD. This screen revealed disruption of kinase SMG1&#8217;s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potent disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from truncating mutations in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable HLA class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule drugs,Nonsense-mediated Decay,High-content screening,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

PARP1 binds to DNA break sites and then catalyzes PARylation, which leads to recruitment of repair factors and initiation of base-excision and single-strand break (SSB) repair. Removal of PAR chains is performed by PARG and is also critical for successful completion of DNA repair. Suppression of PAR chain hydrolysis via PARG depletion or inhibition leads to defective single-strand break repair, reduced kinetics of repair, and hypersensitivity to certain DNA damaging agents.<br \/>Cancer cells demonstrate high levels of replication stress, characterized as the slowing or stalling of replication forks during DNA replication. Replication stress generates DNA SSBs and exposes unligated Okazaki fragments which activate PARP1. PARP1 catalyzed PARylation slows replication fork progression as a protective mechanism, initiates damage repair, and promotes fork reversal. PAR chain removal, via PARG activity, enables completion of damage repair, replication fork restart, and recovery from replication stress. Under conditions of replication stress, PARP inhibition can result in unrestrained fork progression and the occurrence of DNA double strand breaks from fork runoff. In contrast, PARG inhibition causes prolonged slowing or stalling of replication fork progression, which can lead to replication catastrophe and cancer cell death. Because of these opposing roles, PARG inhibitors show distinct pharmacology as compared to PARP inhibitors in certain cancer cells including cancer cells that are <i>BRCA<\/i> wild type, homologous recombination proficient, and PARP inhibitor insensitive or resistant.<br \/>ETX-19477 is a novel inhibitor of PARG that demonstrates low nM, on-target activity in cells as measured by the accumulation of PAR chains. ETX-19477 induces death and\/or inhibits the proliferation of multiple cancer cell types including ER+HER2- breast, serous and mucinous ovarian, lung, and gastric cancers and induces pan-nuclear &#947;H2AX expression, a hallmark of replication catastrophe. Preclinical studies demonstrate that ETX-19477 is orally bioavailable with favorable pharmacokinetics. Oral treatment of mice with ETX-19477 is well tolerated and shows robust dose-dependent in vivo anti-tumor activity in breast and ovarian cell-line derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Efficacy is observed with either once or twice daily dosing and with a discontinuous dosing regimen. In mouse xenograft models, induction of &#947;H2AX expression in tumor tissue correlates with tumor growth inhibition. Preclinical data show ETX-19477 demonstrates potent and specific anti-proliferative effects by exposing underlying existing replication stress vulnerabilities in cancer cells across multiple tumor types. ETX-19477 will be advanced into clinical trials in 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARG,DNA damage response,PARP,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Previous studies in breast cancer showed that 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> (24,25) regulates tumorigenesis via a caveolae membrane-associated signaling pathway involving phospholipase D [PLD] and palmitoylation of an unknown receptor. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of 24,25 in estrogen responsive laryngeal cancer tumorigenesis, investigate the mechanisms involved, and determine the ability of the tumor cells to produce 24,25 locally. Expression of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 was measured in ER&#945;66+ UM-SCC-12 (UM12) and ER&#945;66- UM-SCC-11A (UM11A) laryngeal cancer cells. Cells were treated with 25(OH)D<sub>3<\/sub>, and production of the vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> metabolites 1,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>, 24,25(OH)<sub>2<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub>, and 1,24,25(OH)<sub>3<\/sub>D<sub>3<\/sub> was measured using HPLC. The therapeutic potential of 24,25 was then assessed by treating the cells with 24,25 and measuring proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo, UM12 and UM11A cells were implanted into the cheek of NSG mice; the mice were treated with 24,25, and evaluated for survival and tumor volume. The signaling pathways involving PLD, palmitoylation, and caveolin-1 were investigated as driving mechanisms. CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 were present in ER&#945;66+ UM12 and ER&#945;66- UM11A cells, both of which are responsive to estrogen. When treated with 25(OH)D<sub>3<\/sub>, UM11A cells produced more 24,25 than UM12s, comparable to the physiologically relevant levels in blood. Both cells produced similar levels of 1,25. 24,25 increased proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in ER&#945;66+ UM12 cells in vitro, but had the opposite effect in ER&#945;66- UM11A cells. 24,25 increased PLD activity in UM12 cells but decreased PLD activity in UM11A cells. Inhibition of PLD activity or palmitoylation, as well as silencing expression of caveolin-1, reduced the effects of 24,25 on P53 in both cell types, indicating they played a role. Mice with UM11A tumors given 24,25 exhibited reduced tumor burden and increased survival compared to vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, mice with UM12 tumors given 24,25 had an increased tumor burden and reduced survival compared to controls. The presence of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1, local production of 24,25, and demonstration that laryngeal cancer cells respond to 24,25, indicate that 24,25 acts in an autocrine\/paracrine manner. 24,25 was pro-tumorigenic<sub> <\/sub>in ER&#945;66+ laryngeal cancer cells while having the opposite effect in ER&#945;66- cells, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a dependence on ER&#945;66 expression. 24,25 acts via a mechanism involving PLD, caveolae, and palmitoylation. These data<b> <\/b>show that 24,25 regulates laryngeal cancer tumorigenesis, which is mediated by membrane associated signaling pathways that may depend on ER&#945;66 level, and suggest a major role of 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3<\/sub> in laryngeal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hormone receptors,Vitamin D3,Therapeutic target,Head and neck cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Elevated eIF4F level\/activity has been correlated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. Leveraging our findings with the small molecule SBI-756, which interacts with eIF4G1 and impairs eIF4F complex assembly, we set to map domains that are required for SBI-756 activity. A CRISPR screen using sgRNAs that target different sequences on eIF4G1 led to the identification of the MA3 domain, as a putative binding site for SBI-756. Deletion\/mutation of the eIF4G1 MA3 domain attenuated melanoma cells and spheroids growth. Polysome profiling assays confirmed attenuated translation activity, which resembled those seen with SBI-756. In silico virtual screen identified 64 small molecules (out of &#62;10 million) that interact with the MA3 domain. Of these, we have selected four that effectively attenuated melanoma growth in culture. Analogs developed for these four compounds were more potent in impairing the assembly of the eIF4F complex, inhibition of protein translation and the 2D and 3D growth of melanoma cells. RNA-sequencing analysis highlighted altered expression of genes implicated in apoptosis, UPR, cell cycle, and ROS pathways, leading us to test possible combination with pathways that may complement the above. Among those, autophagy inhibitors synergized with our lead compound, M19-6, resulting in efficient melanoma cell death, using notably lower concentrations of these inhibitors. Our findings identify the eIF4G1 MA3 domain as an important player in eIF4F assembly and a potential target for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translation,eIF4G,MA3 domain,small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Hence, there is a compelling need for innovative chemopreventive treatments aimed at minimizing CRC tumorigenesis. Exportin 1 (XPO1; also referred to as CRM1) plays a pivotal role in transporting proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The overexpression of XPO1 has been identified across several cancers, including CRC. XPO1 interacts with a diverse spectrum of more than 1000 proteins. The overexpression of XPO1 leads to the excessive removal of tumor suppressors from the nucleus, rendering these proteins functionally inert. To counteract the overexpression of XPO1 in tumors, a novel class of drugs known as Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE) has been developed. Among these, Eltanexor (KPT-8602) has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, demonstrating fewer side effects compared to its precursors, and is currently under evaluation in Phase 1\/2 clinical trials. The treatment effects of SINE compounds on CRC remain largely unknown. We have assessed Eltanexor's ability to limit CRC tumorigenesis using a genetic CRC model in <i>Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>mice. Our findings indicate that Eltanexor substantially reduces tumor burden by approximately 3-fold and induces a significant reduction of tumors exceeding 1mm in size. Furthermore, a xenograft experiment using the human CRC cell line, HCT116, reveals nearly a 3-fold reduction in tumor size upon Eltanexor treatment. In both CRC models, Eltanexor exhibits noteworthy tolerability. Additionally, XPO1 protein levels are consistently diminished in both models, aligning with our <i>in vitro<\/i> observations. To further ascertain Eltanexor's specificity for CRC tumors versus normal tissue, we conducted drug sensitivity assays using organoids derived from <i>Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>tumors and wild-type mice small intestine tissue. We found that <i>Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup><\/i> tumoroids have heightened sensitivity to Eltanexor-treatments, when compared to wild-type organoids. In an endeavor to elucidate Eltanexor's potent <i>in vivo<\/i> tumorigenesis inhibitory effects, we conducted multiple assays which revealed a reduction in COX-2 RNA and protein expression levels in Eltanexor-treated cells and reduced COX-2 protein in the tumors of Eltanexor-treated <i>Apc<sup>min\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice. In CRC, COX-2 is implicated in CRC development and is currently the target of multiple CRC chemopreventive agents. Our observations reveal that Eltanexor-treated CRC cells exhibit reduced COX-2 gene expression through both inhibiting COX-2&#8217;s promoter and its mRNA post-transcriptional stability. Collectively, our findings underscore XPO1 as a potent target for inhibiting CRC tumorigenesis. Future studies will aim to further assess how Eltanexor is impacting COX-2&#8217;s promoter, while additionally testing Eltanexor&#8217;s tumorigenesis-inhibiting potential in a colitis-induced CRC mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,XPO1,Prevention,Eltanexor (KPT-8602),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known to upregulate and depend on lysosomal functions such as autophagy to exist in its harsh, nutrient-disrupted microenvironment. Thus, we aimed to establish PIKfyve as a therapeutic target in PDAC. Using a PIKfyve-knockout genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer (KC and KPC), we determined that PIKfyve was necessary for PDAC development. Given these results, we hypothesized that PIKfyve was critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in PDAC and that inhibiting PIKfyve would be an efficacious therapeutic strategy for PDAC.<br \/><b>Methods and results<\/b> We first validated the known role of PIKfyve in regulating autophagy using CRISPRi mediated knockdown, PIKfyve inhibitors Apilimod and ESK981, and a PIKfyve degrader, which all demonstrated that PIKfyve perturbation disrupted autophagic flux and suppressed PDAC cell growth.<i><\/i> Little is known about the metabolic impacts of PIKfyve inhibition in PDAC beyond disruption of autophagy. Thus, we paired RNA-seq and a metabolic CRISPR screen to discover that PIKfyve inhibition obligated PDAC cells to upregulate <i>de novo <\/i>lipid synthesis. Specifically, PDAC cells upregulated fatty acid synthesis genes <i>ACACA<\/i> and <i>FASN<\/i> upon PIKfyve inhibition. Additionally, these genes were synthetically critical in the context of PIKfyve inhibition. We further performed metabolomics and lipidomics which revealed accumulation of sphingolipids upon PIKfyve inhibition. Given this, we concluded that PIKfyve regulates lipid homeostasis in PDAC. To further establish PIKfyve as a target in PDAC, we investigated the role of PIKfyve upon inhibition of KRAS, which drives PDAC through MAPK pathway signaling. First, KRAS\/MAPK inhibition diminished expression of <i>FASN<\/i> and <i>ACACA<\/i>, genes synthetically essential upon PIKfyve inhibition. Additionally, KRAS\/MAPK inhibition upregulated autophagy which was attenuated upon concurrent PIKfyve inhibition. Given this metabolic conflict between KRAS\/MAPK and PIKfyve, we assessed the effects of dual inhibiting KRAS\/MAPK and PIKfyve in a syngeneic orthotopic model. Encouragingly, combination therapy of trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and ESK981 eliminated tumor burden in most of mice, while single treatments only had modest effects. Further, we established a patient-derived xenograft model and showed that while the treatment with individual compounds trametinib, MRTX-1133 (KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitor), and ESK981 all suppressed tumor growth, the combination of ESK981 and trametinib or ESK981 and MRTX-1133 caused substantial tumor regression in nearly all mice. Taken together, targeting lipid metabolism through inhibition of PIKfyve is a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC, particularly in combination with the numerous KRAS\/MAPK inhibitors in clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Autophagy,Cancer metabolism,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The translation of novel therapies has been hampered, and there has been no significant improvement in prognosis for 30 years. Our recent findings demonstrate that IWS1, a transcription elongation and alternative splicing factor, is elevated in dedifferentiated LPS (ddLPS) patient tumor samples and is associated with worse survival and a shorter time to relapse in ddLPS. In this study, we present preliminary results on a novel treatment for advanced ddLPS: an IWS1 inhibitor, serving as a way to discover a spliceosome as a novel therapeutic target.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Methods. <\/b>Utilizing computer-aided, structure-based virtual screening approaches, we identified a class of compounds that exhibited inhibitory potential. A subset of FDA-approved drugs was evaluated by molecular docking calculations, and compounds with the highest calculated theoretical potency were selected for further analysis. To assess the ability of specific compounds to disrupt IWS1\/Spt6 binding, Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments on ddLPS cell line Lipo863 were conducted. Transwell invasion and migration assays were performed to evaluate the effect of the drug candidate on the metastatic potential of cells. Additionally, to evaluate the impact of IWS1 inhibition on spheroid formation, a matrigel extracellular matrix scaffold was employed.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Results. <\/b>Through virtual screening, we identified a class of compounds characterized by a specific chemical pattern featuring a tricyclic fused-ring structure. This class of compounds includes the well-known FDA-approved drug Ketotifen, an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. Co-immunoprecipitation of IWS1\/Spt6 complex after 48-hour treatment with Ketotifen showed a decrease of over 50% of the isolated complex. Migration and invasion of the ddLPS cell line, Lipo863, were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by 18-44% and 17-52%, respectively, when treated with Ketotifen, without affecting cell viability.

However, in this study, we have identified a new, fundamental, pro-oncogenic, non-canonical activity of RAS-GTP that increases the Exportin 1 (XPO1)-dependent export of nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm and is independent of RAF\/MEK and PI3K\/AKT signaling. The nuclear protein export machinery is known to depend on a trimeric protein complex composed of RAN-GTP:XPO1:nuclear protein cargo. Unexpectedly, we have found that RAS-GTP forms a stable complex with RAN GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (RAN-GAP) at the nuclear envelope, which facilitates the release of nuclear protein cargo by increasing the hydrolysis of RAN-GTP to RAN-GDP. We have determined that RAS-GTP and RAN-GAP form this complex in primary human lung tumors, patient derived xenografts, and human lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the RAS-GTP:RAN-GAP<b> <\/b>complex is found at the nuclear envelope and in the cytoplasm, but not at the plasma membrane. The RAS-dependent step mediated by the RAS-GTP:RAN-GAP<b> <\/b>complex acts downstream of XPO1 by increasing RAN-GTP hydrolysis, which promotes protein cargo release. Our fundamental findings have important clinical implications. For example, in human lung cancer models that harbor a KRAS-G12C mutation, the combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K (MEKi + PI3Ki) does not inhibit tumor growth to the same degree as a KRAS-G12C inhibitor. Remarkably, adding an XPO1 inhibitor to MEKi + PI3Ki inhibits tumor growth to the same degree as the KRAS-G12C inhibitor. One critical pro-oncogenic target of the RAS-GTP:RAN-GAP complex is nuclear export of the EZH2 methyltransferase, whose increase in the cytoplasm leads to a direct methylation of the cytoplasmic DLC1 tumor suppressor protein, leading to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of DLC1 protein. Analysis of a KRAS mutant cell line from which the DLC1 gene has been disrupted by CRISPR-Cas9 technology indicates that DLC1 makes an important contribution to the growth inhibition by inhibitors that reduce nuclear protein export. These findings establish nuclear protein export as a critical, pro-oncogenic, non-canonical RAS function that is mediated by the RAS-GTP:RAN-GAP complex and provide a mechanistic explanation for poor clinical responses to combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K, which do not regulate the nuclear protein activity identified in this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Lung cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

We have compared with various BC genomic databases such as TCGA, COSMIC, and MSKCC to identify 29 novel variants in 18 genes that were predicted to have a pathogenic effect. In these pathogenic variants, we found that the GNAQ T96S mutation (threonine 96 to serine alteration of the G&#945;q protein) was presented in 116 out of 615 BC patients (18.9%). To examine the effect of the GNAQ T96S mutation on BC, we transfected the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with the wild-type or the mutant GNAQ T96S expression vector. Transfection with the GNAQ T96S expression vector enhanced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and activation of the MAPK pathways compared to wild-type GNAQ expression MCF-7 cells. We also found that the tumorigenicity, and tumor growth were significantly increased in the GNAQ T96S expressed MCF-7 xenograft model, and exhibited higher rates of lung metastasis in GNAQ T96S expressed MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggest that the GNAQ T96S mutation may play an oncogenic role in BC by potentiating the GNAQ signaling pathway.

While activity of macroautophagy changes in a context-dependent manner in cancers, the upregulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is well-described in all solid tumors studied to date. Upregulated CMA directly contributes to both tumor growth and protection against anti-oncogenic interventions in cancers. Selective degradation of anti-oncogenic and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as mutant p53 and PUMA, misfolded proteins, and glycolytic enzymes by CMA allows for increased survival, reduced cell death, increased stress resistance, and enhancement of the Warburg effect in cancer cells, respectively. As such, inhibition of CMA is an attractive target for anti-cancer therapeutics, but the field currently lacks protein targets specific to CMA and selective CMA inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated the regulatory effect of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#945;) and its coregulator, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1), on CMA through transcriptional upregulation of the CMA effector proteins (Bourdenx et al. Cell 2021, Gomez-Sintes et al, Nat. Commun. 2022). Here, we identified a high NCoR1\/RAR&#945; expression ratio in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors compared to healthy lung tissue. We further illustrated a dependency on NCoR1 expression and its interaction with RAR&#945; to maintain high CMA activity in NSCLC cell lines. Provided the reliance on NCoR1 repression of RAR&#945; for high CMA activity in NSCLC, we hypothesized that small molecule targeting of the druggable NCoR1\/RAR&#945; interaction to disrupt the interaction may result in suppression of CMA effector proteins and CMA inhibition. Through a series of in-silico screens for predicted NCoR1\/RAR&#945; targeting, and functional screens for CMA inhibition, we identified CIM7, a first-in-class potent and selective CMA inhibitor. We validated CIM7 function through binding to RAR&#945; and subsequent disruption of NCoR1 binding, resulting in alterations to CMA-related gene expression. CIM7 inhibits CMA <i>in vivo<\/i> with no observed toxicity in normal tissues. We additionally demonstrated the therapeutic potential of CIM7 through its ability to reduce tumor growth <i>in vivo <\/i>in<i> <\/i>mouse NSCLC xenografts. Our findings support the NCoR1\/RAR&#945; interaction as a major regulator of CMA in NSCLC and demonstrate the potential of pharmacologic CMA inhibition as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Small molecule inhibitor,Therapeutics,Retinoic acid receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are an innovative treatment that has been shown to improve patients' life expectancy in the last two decades. TTFields therapy has an antitumoral effect that involves different mechanisms and is an optional add-on to standard maintenance temozolomide. Although TTFields therapy initially slows tumor progression, it does not prevent tumor relapse in most patients. In the present investigation, we run a genomic and proteomic analysis of surgical material from 10 patients treated with TTFields. GB tissues were obtained from the primary tumor mass and from a second surgery after tumor relapse. All the patients, in addition to brain tumor standard therapies, were treated with TTFields for eighteen hours a day, the time span of treatment application was dependent on GB recurrence. Control samples were obtained from primary and secondary surgeries of 5 patients treated with standard therapy alone. The GB tissue extracts were analyzed with an RNAseq routine, and the results from the secondary surgery were compared with the data obtained from tumor specimens of the primary surgery. A common feature of transcripts among all the patients was the alterations of several pathways promoting the increase of intracellular oxidation and cell cycle regulation. In parallel with the analysis of patient specimens, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> GB cell relapse model. This was instrumental in investigating the beneficial contribution of TTFields action during tumor relapse, but also in uncovering the limitation of this therapeutic procedure. GB primary cultures obtained from patients' surgery were exposed for up to 12 days with 200 kHz TTFields stimulation using the inovitro&#8482; system. After 12 days of continuous TTFields application, GB cells showed an average depolarization of the resting membrane potential, increasing oxidation, and acidification of the cytoplasm. Genomic analysis of treated cells compared with wild-type primary culture, denoted an increase of tumor stem cell markers, activation of several metabolic pathways, and upregulation of different ion channel protein transcripts. Our final goal is to identify specific molecular features enhanced by TTFields treatment to be used as a parallel therapy to fight GB recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Recurrence,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

The most commonly mutated oncogenic alteration in human cancers is KRAS, which is prevalent in pancreatic malignancies. The KRAS G12D mutation subtype is present in more than 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To this date there is no available targeted therapy options for patients with KRAS subtype mutations. MRTX1133 has been identified as a non-covalent, potent, and selective inhibitor of KRASG12D. This small molecule inhibitor has been shown to suppress KRASG12D signaling in cells and in vivo. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is a novel approach to treating cancer, the electric fields alter the behavior of cancer cells and prevent them from growing and dividing. We hypothesize that the co-application of MRTX1133 with TTFields will enhance the effects of MRTX1133 in PDAC and colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/>Martials and Methods: PDAC cell line CFPAC1 with KRAS G12 V mutation and LS513 CRC cell line with KRAS G12D Mutation were treated with same dose of MRTX1133 (500 nM) and were co-treated with 150kHz TTFields. After 48 hours western blot was used to probe for cleaved PARP, cleaved C3, phosphor-ERK and DUSP6.<br \/>Results: In both KRAS G12D &#38; KRAS G12V cell lines, synergistic upregulation of cPARP was observed following 48-hour co-treatment. Synergistic inhibition of pERK happened in KRAS G12D cell line but no change in pERK level following TTFields or MRTX1133 treatment was seen. Upregulation of cC3 in KRAS G12D happened in only co-treatment conditions. DUSP6 levels increased following MRTX1133 treatment in KRAS G12V cell line.<br \/>Conclusions: The surprising synergistic upregulation of cPARP in both KRAS G12V and G12D cells following co-treatment of KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 and TTFields can bring hope for other KRAS mutation subtypes as well as G12D. the increase in cPARP in KRAS G12V with no effect on pERK is particularly interesting and demonstrates the need of more studies to investigate the mechanisms of this synergy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Pancreatic cancer,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

At least in part, this is due to the lack of optimal targeted therapies and treatment resistance to the remaining standard of care consisting of chemo-\/radio- therapy. Here, we show that cancer cells that are irreparably damaged can withstand cell death through a process we define as &#8220;scarring&#8221;. In scarred cells, p53 is phosphorylated at Ser46 and Ser392 and localizes into progressive multifocal leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. We have identified scarring in over a quarter of metastatic breast, colon, stomach and ovarian cancer. Thus, pivoting scarred p53 towards cell death in scarred cancer could establish a novel broad-range therapeutic opportunity against metastatic cancer. Targeting p53 with small molecules has proven challenging. We developed cell-penetrating peptides that selectively bind scarred p53. One of our lead compounds, CL04177 dissociates p53 from its PML scaffold leading to its a nuclear exclusion and initiation of the transcription-independent mitochondrial apoptosis. To examine the role of scarring as a therapeutic target, we focused on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC cells are marked by the expression of p53 and PML compared to other breast cancer subtypes. In cytotoxicity experiments, CL04177 specifically targeted TNBC over other breast cancer subtypes. Further investigation into how this compound can target metastatic cells revealed that scarred features are upregulated in metastasis-initiating cells of organoids when induced to invade in contact with collagen and that CL04177 can induce apoptosis specifically in these invading strands. <i>In vivo<\/i>, CL04177 showed favorable pharmacokinetics and -dynamics and a clear safety profile. Importantly, when dosed at 10-fold below its Maximally Tolerated Dose, CL04177 strongly reduced primary tumor mass and metastatic dissemination to the liver of TNBC cell line-derived orthotopic xenografts. This data indicates a new concept of scarred p53 in cancer progression and metastasis. Moreover, peptides that release scarring markers from nuclear structures can eliminate aggressive cancers <i>in vitro<\/i> and, most importantly, <i>in vivo<\/i>, e.g., in p53-mutated, metastatic TNBC. This ability introduces a conceptually new therapeutic option, especially for types of cancer for which there is a high unmet medical need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastasis,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diana Putavet<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marjolein P.

A variety of tumor types, particularly those associated with enhanced lipid and\/or iron content, or which experience increased oxidative stress (including drug tolerant persister cells), are sensitive to ferroptosis, rendering ferroptosis a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, currently available ferroptosis inducers show limited activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, suggesting a need for novel molecular targets to validate the clinical utility of ferroptosis induction. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of kidney cancer, is typically initiated by inactivation of VHL resulting in constitutive activation of HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945;, which contribute to disease progression, including by promoting lipid accumulation that sensitizes ccRCC cells to ferroptosis.<br \/>Methods: We performed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of HIF-2&#945; followed by structure-activity-relationship studies for validation. The molecular target of these inhibitors was identified using the Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability assay, and target validation was confirmed using siRNA and NMR. <i>In vitro<\/i> efficacy was determined in a panel of cancer cell lines and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy was verified using mouse models of cancer.<br \/>Results: We identified a novel molecule, KD061, which decreases HIF-1\/2&#945; and induces ferroptosis <i>in vivo<\/i> through oral administration by targeting Iron Sulfur Cluster Assembly 2 (ISCA2). ISCA2 is a component of the late mitochondrial Iron Sulfur Cluster (L-ISC) assembly complex and ISCA2 inhibition either pharmacologically or using siRNA triggers the iron starvation response, resulting in iron\/metals overload and death via ferroptosis. ISCA2 inhibition also decreases HIF-2&#945; protein levels by blocking iron-responsive element (IRE)-dependent translation, and at higher concentrations, also decreases HIF-1&#945; translation. These studies reveal a novel function of ISCA2 in extra-mitochondrial Fe-S assembly that may be limiting in cancer due to the increased need for these proteins in DNA replication and maintenance. Outside of ccRCC, a 92-cell line screen reveals a variety of tumor types sensitive to ISCA2 inhibition including melanoma and clear cell ovarian cancer. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with KD061 resulted in &#62; 65% tumor growth inhibition<i>, <\/i>associated with significantly increased lipid peroxidation, thus confirming ferroptosis <i>in vivo<\/i>, and with decreased HIF-1\/2&#945;.

Despite the development of targeted therapies, treatment success has been hindered by primary or acquired resistance. New therapeutic strategies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients. NXP800 is a GCN2 small-molecule activator that phosphorylates eIF2a inducing selective ATF4 transcription which stimulates stress-induced genes leading to apoptosis. NXP800 has been previously validated in ovarian cancers with <i>ARID1A<\/i> mutations, well-known players in cholangiocarcinoma. We sought to determine the treatment efficacy of novel NXP800 in CCA utilizing patient derived xenograft (PDX) preclinical models. Methods In our preliminary studies, four human and two murine CCA cell lines were tested for cell viability using CellTiter-Glo to determine the maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>). Immunoblot analysis of HuCCT-1 cells incubated with 1 mM of NXP800 for 6 hours vs. vehicle was performed. We also evaluated response to GCN2 activation in multiple RNA sequenced PDX models. Xenografts were expanded into the flank of NOD\/SCID mice and treatment begun when tumors averaged 120mm<sup>3<\/sup>. Tumor bearing mice were treated with NXP800 (35 mg\/kg) or vehicle via oral gavage five days on, two days off, for 28 days. Tumor volume and animal weight were collected twice weekly. Predicted sensitive signatures were determined using multi-omics. Results IC50 dose response curves showed nanomolar activity in all six cell lines, ranging from 5-170 nM. Immunoblotting demonstrated an upregulation of phosphorylated eIF2a and in turn upregulation of ATF4 with treatment of NXP800 compared to vehicle. Five PDX tumors from patients with intrahepatic or distal CCA was established and validated by histologic analysis. Molecular characterization of the tumor identified tumor mutation and a total tumor mutational burden. RNA sequencing was completed and identified 21-gene signatures related to <i>YAP<\/i> activity, which were cross-referenced against our existing PDX model tumor bank. Treatment with NXP800 was associated with a statistically significant decrease in tumor size in three of five PDX models tested, which included an <i>ARID1A, FGFR1<\/i>, and <i>ATM<\/i> mutants. Preliminary multi-omics on the PDX models revealed that sensitivity mechanisms were centered around EGFR signaling.

Proline, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is an oncogene, its expression is deregulated in TNBC, and its status is a prognostic indicator of poor TNBC survival. Recently, a small molecule inhibitor of PELP1 (SMIP34) which binds to and degrades PELP1 was developed. The <i>Objective <\/i>of this proposal is to define the mechanism of action of PELP1 inhibitor SMIP34 in TNBC progression and to pave the path for a novel combination therapy.<b><\/b><br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>We tested the effectiveness of PELP1 inhibitor, SMIP-34, in combination with 140 FDA-approved medications on cell survival of multiple TNBC cell lines. The effect of SMIP34 combination therapy on cell survival was measured using MTT, colony formation, and Annexin V apoptosis assays. Mechanistic studies were done using RT-qPCR, immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation, mass spectrometry, gene reporter, immunofluorescence, and comet assays. Furthermore, the preclinical utility of combination therapy was evaluated using MDA-MB-231 xenografts, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and explants (PDEs).<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>: We performed an in vitro screening of 140 FDA-approved drugs in combination with SMIP34. Results revealed that SMIP34 sensitized TNBC cells to five FDA approved drugs. Of the five drugs, the three drugs Gemcitabine, Valrubicin, and Mitoxantrone, induced DNA damage by inhibiting topoisomerase, a protein that cleaves and reconnects DNA during replication. We validated the ability of SMIP34 to enhance the efficacy of TIs using two additional TNBC cell lines and confirmed their synergistic activity using several in vitro assays including cell viability, colony formation, and apoptosis. In agreement with the role of PELP1 in DNA damage response, Western blotting analyses showed higher levels of &#947;-H2AX in SMIP34+TI combination therapy when compared to monotherapy. Results from the comet assays further demonstrate increased DNA damage caused by the SMIP-34 + TIs combination therapy. Mechanistic studies using Proximity labelling followed by immunoprecipitation identified topoisomerase 2A and 2B (TOP2A and TOP2B) as potential interactors of PELP1. Furthermore, gene correlation analysis using TCGA datasets revealed that PELP1 expression is positively correlated with TOP2A, and TOP2B in TNBC.

IBC accounts for 2-4% of all occurrences of breast cancer and results in 7-10% of breast cancer-related deaths. IBC is only partially treatable with current therapies such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Identification of novel therapeutic targets is urgently required. The main organelle for the synthesis, folding, and modification of proteins is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Since elevated basal ER stress (ERS) is usually found in many cancers including IBC, our hypothesis was that the high basal ERS in IBC constitutes a serious vulnerability that can be targeted. Recently, we developed a small molecule ERX41 that promotes ER stress by blocking Lysosomal acid lipase A (LIPA) function in ER of cancer cells. The goal of the project is to test the utility of ERX-41 in treating IBC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: To study the effect of ERX-41, we have used three well-established IBC model cells. We evaluated the efficacy of ERX-41 as a novel therapeutic for treating IBC using cell viability assays. The long-term effects of ERX-41 on IBC cell survival were evaluated using colony formation assays. Annexin V assays were used to measure apoptosis. Reporter assays, splicing assays, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting were used in mechanistic investigations. The effectiveness of ERX-41 was examined in vivo using KPL4 cell-based xenografts.<i><\/i><br \/><b>Results<\/b>: ERX-41 significantly decreased the viability of all three IBC model cells (SUM149, SUM190PT, and KPL4), with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of about 125 nM in MTT assay. Additionally, ERX-41 treatment significantly decreased IBC cells capacity to form colonies and promoted apoptosis. Specificity of the ERX41 mediated actions were confirmed using LIPA KO cells. Using RTqPCR based splicing assays, we demonstrated increased splicing of XBP1 as early as 6 hours after ERX41 treatment. Western analyses showed robust induction of stress markers (CHOP, PERK, ATF4) in IBC cells upon treatment with ERX-41. In KPL4 xenograft studies, ERX-41 showed significant reduction in the tumor volume. IHC analyses confirmed decreased proliferation marker and increased ER stress markers.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Collectively, our results suggest that ERX-41 is a novel therapeutic agent that targets the LIPA with a unique mechanism of action and implicate ERX-41 binding to LIPA induces ER stress and promotes apoptosis of IBC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Small molecule drugs,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

Early clinical trial data treating RDEB-associated SCC with rigosertib has shown remarkable efficacy in a sub-set of patients and understanding the mechanism of action of rigosertib in this lethal cancer would provide rationale for patient stratification. Multiple mechanisms of action were previously attributed to rigosertib, including polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), PI3-kinase, activated RAS and microtubule polymerization inhibition. Our published data comparing PLK1 siRNA with PI3-Kinase inhibitors, MAPK inhibitors and microtubule disruption favored PLK1 as a mechanism of action without definitive conclusion. We therefore sought to determine the mechanism of action using transcriptomic profiling. Flow cytometry experiments identified three main categories of time to increase G2M in nine separate RDEB SCC keratinocyte populations in culture ranging from 1 to 6 hours after exposure to 1uM rigosertib. Bulk-RNA sequencing of representative populations from time to G2M groupings failed to identify consistent transcriptional change after exposure to rigosertib. However, single cell sequencing was able to identify increases in sub-populations of cells associated with G2M as well as transient emergence of unique populations that were specific to individual patient populations after exposure to rigosertib in culture. Of note a transient population of RDEB SCC keratinocytes only present after 1 hour of exposure to rigosertib was characterized by increased expression of the potassium regulator <i>KCNRG<\/i> which has previously been associated with apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ongoing work is determining the role this gene may play in the mechanism of apoptosis induction in RDEB SCC keratinocytes after exposure to rigosertib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-14 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Cell cycle arrest,Squamous cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In addition, the rapid spread of triple-negative breast cancer makes it difficult to manage using current treatment options such as lumpectomies, mastectomies, radiation, and chemotherapy. The survival rate for patients with triple-negative breast cancer is only 8-16%. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop new and effective treatment options. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of M1 macrophage-derived exosomes to induce cancer cell apoptosis. To test this, we isolated M1 macrophage-derived exosomes to see their effects on triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We induce polarization in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells via lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Macrophage polarization was characterized using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR, nitric oxide production, and bright field microscopy. We characterized exosomes using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The apoptosis marker, caspase 3\/7 activation, was assessed using confocal microscopy in MDA-MB-231 cells. M1 macrophage-derived exosomes were isolated, characterized, and incubated with breast cancer cells to see their anticancer effects. Data showed the induction of apoptosis in 48 hours in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We conclude that exosomes derived from M1 macrophages may have the capability to induce apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-14 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Macrophages,Extracellular vesicles,Antitumor effect,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

In this study, we set out to determine why acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is largely refractory to proteasome inhibition and if we could sensitize human AML to this class of drugs. Efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in myeloma partly depends on disruption of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). This is driven by an accumulation of misfolded proteins that activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress response (ISR). Due to their highly secretory nature, myeloma cells exhibit relatively elevated baseline endoplasmic reticulum stress, and are thus sensitive to proteasome inhibition as they readily activate a terminal UPR. However, we found that proteasome inhibition fails to significantly disrupt proteostasis in human AML cells. We recently discovered that hematopoietic stem cells utilize distinct pathways to regulate proteostasis, and we hypothesized that AML cells co-opt stem cell proteostasis pathways to cope with proteasome inhibition and preserve proteostasis. To test this, we first performed RNA-sequencing which revealed that AML cells respond to proteasome inhibition by activating two distinct proteostasis pathways normally utilized by hematopoietic stem cells: autophagy and the heat shock response. Concurrent proteasome and autophagy inhibition significantly increased unfolded protein content in multiple human AML cell lines. This proteostasis disruption was sufficient to induce a terminal ISR marked by activation of the eIF2&#945;-ATF4-CHOP signaling axis that severely attenuated protein synthesis, reduced proliferation, and induced widespread apoptosis in human AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples. In contrast to AML cells, dual proteasome and autophagy inhibition was well tolerated by healthy human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, suggesting a tractable therapeutic window for treating AML. Indeed, dual proteasome and autophagy inhibition was tolerated <i>in vivo<\/i>, and decreased leukemia burden in mice xenografted with human AML cell lines. Similar to autophagy inhibition, disabling the heat shock response by deleting Heat shock factor 1 (<i>HSF1<\/i>) sensitized human AML cell lines to proteasome inhibitors. Treatment of <i>HSF1<\/i>-deficient AML cells with a proteasome inhibitior induced a significant increase in unfolded protein, activated the ISR, reduced growth and protein synthesis, and led to severe apoptosis. Concurrent <i>HSF1<\/i> deletion and proteasome inhibition dramatically reduced AML disease burden <i>in vivo<\/i> and extended median survival from 40 to 140 days. Overall, this study revealed that AML cells hijack stem cell proteostasis pathways to promote growth, survival, and therapeutic resistance. Targeting the unique configuration of the proteostasis network is uncovering new therapeutic strategies to eliminate AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-09 Proteasome inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome inhibitors,Autophagy,Heat shock proteins,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The unchecked activation of the Androgen Receptor (AR) spurs CaP development and progression. Mutations or the presence of AR splice variants can add complexity to tumor ecology, leading to chemoresistance. This study aims to develop novel inhibitors targeting the &#8220;Achilles Heel&#8221; of AR activity: the N-terminal domain (NTD). This would circumvent the limitations of LBD (Ligand Binding Domain) therapies and offer a superior treatment option for patients. Though the AR-NTD is an intrinsically disordered protein, which complicates structure-based drug design, we have developed a unique small molecule inhibitor, ASR600, which specifically targets AR-NTD and promotes AR and AR- variants degradation by ubiquitination at previously unknown sites.<br \/>Methods: Mass-spec analysis was performed to identify distinct ubiquitination sites in AR's NTD. To perform spatial transcriptome analysis, CytAssist Visium (10X genomics) was used. Furthermore, we used western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and PDX mice studies in CRPC mouse models to examine the impact of ASR600 on CRPC.<br \/>Results: Four AR ubiquitination sites: K845, K847, and K913 (LBD) and K311 (NTD) are already identified. Interestingly, ASR600 continued to inhibit AR expression even with mutated ubiquitination sites. Mass spectrometry analysis of ASR-mediated mono-ubiquitinated N-terminal AR identified K16 as a unique ubiquitin acceptor. Altering this ubiquitination site rescues AR expression from ASR600-mediated degradation, emphasizing AR N-terminus as an ASR600 target. To discern the role of the K16 ubiquitination site in AR protein turnover, we evaluated AR protein stability in LNCaP cells that stably expressed ARWT or AR-K16R constructs. Our data indicates the pivotal importance of K16 for AR transcriptional activity. Invivo, ASR600, when used as a sole agent, exhibited inhibitory responses in PDX of clinically aggressive, AR-expressing tumors. Spatial gene expression analysis revealed marked expression differences in AR signature genes between control and ASR600-treated PDX tissues. Crucially, AR signaling, and related markers mainly aligned with epithelial markers rather than stromal ones. In contrast, the ASR600-treated PDX tumor showcased reduced AR signaling within epithelial cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Targeting AR-NTD has received a lot of attention, but its innately disordered structure has hindered progress. ASR600 targets AR-NTD specifically by ubiquitinating the protein at a novel location, K16. Our in vivo, PDX studies, combined with the spatial analysis, lay a strong foundation for initiating IND-enabling TOX studies, followed by a phase-I clinical trial for ASR-600 in CRPC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Small molecule inhibitor,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, systematic characterization of the cellular effects of emerging drug candidates is limited. Screening such agents against the approximately 900 diverse cancer cell lines in the PRISM assay can provide insights into drug specificity and cancer subtype selectivity and, leveraging the rich genomic and functional characterization of PRISM cell lines, support for annotated mechanisms of action. Our goal was to generate a large, high-quality, oncology-focused dataset that can benefit the cancer research community by characterizing new test agents of high clinical relevance. In the past year, this effort has been utilized to screen a total of 180 test agents with plans to extend testing to an additional 140 over the next year. The collection includes biologics (e.g., cytokines, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates), targeted protein degraders, and small molecules. Supporting the quality of the screening collection and the robustness of the PRISM assay, the majority of inhibitors (including mutant-selective KRAS inhibitors, and inhibitors targeting the WRN helicase, a preferential vulnerability in cancers with microsatellite instability) tested to date closely mimic the effects of genetic knockout and\/or knockdown of their annotated target, as measured by CRISPR and shRNA data available through the Dependency Map Portal (depmap.org). Further, while we observe strong modality-independent co-clustering of test agents annotated to act on the same target(s) (e.g., tucatinib with the antibody-drug conjugates T-DM1 and T-DXd for HER2), intriguing differences in efficacy and selectivity emerge in individual cell line models. All PRISM reference screening data and analyses will be made publicly available through depmap.org to serve as a benchmark for new drug development candidates and to further the efforts of researchers worldwide to match emerging cancer therapies to the patients most likely to benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-14 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutics,High-throughput screening,Public dataset,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
