Growing evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies indicates that increased obesity is associated with increases in cancer incidence, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70% and 40% of American adults can be classified as overweight and obese, respectively. However, treatment strategies for dealing with cancer in obese patients have not advanced apart from lifestyle interventions. However, several signaling mechanisms have been proposed related to the inflammatory and metabolic impact of obese adipocytes in promoting cancer progression. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding led to no specific treatment strategies have been proposed which can specifically downregulate the key regulator by which obese adipocytes promote cancer progression. Thus, translational research initiatives are immediately needed to provide mechanistic justifications for these striking statistics in order to better serve this growing segment of the population.<br \/>Here, we have shown the role of nanoscale physical communication between breast cancer cells and adipose tissue in promoting cancer progression. Using high-resolution optical and electron microscopy, we have found that breast cancer cells form nanoscale tubular communications with obese adipocytes. Moreover, the cancer cells hijack mitochondria from obese adipocytes. However, coculturing cancer cells and obese adipocytes in the Boyden chamber, allowing exosomal and paracrine communication but blocking direct physical communication, revealed negligible mitochondria transfer. This observation indicates an active transfer of mitochondria via nanotube. A significantly higher rate of mitochondria transfer from obese adipocytes to cancer cells has been observed than non-differentiated pre-adipocytes. The transfer of mitochondria results in an increase in the metabolism of the cancer cells. The mechanistic investigation of the nanotube formation revealed actin's presence as the major component in the nanotube. The exocyst-GTPase protein complex has a prime contribution in actin remodeling and nanotube formation. Inhibition of exocyst-GTPase using a pharmacological inhibitor results in a significant reduction in nanotube-mediated mitochondria transfer.<br \/>Conclusion: Our goal is to (i) investigate the direct physical connection between adipocytes and cancer cells and the effect on cancer progression and (ii) eliminate mortality related to obesity-associated breast cancer severity by introducing a new therapeutic strategy. Here, we have shown how cancer cells communicate with obese adipocytes and receive additional metabolic power for proliferation. The <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation of the same is under progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Comorbidity,Obesity,Mitochondria,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The mechanistic basis of how <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i> loss of function (LOF) leads to oncogenesis remains to be elucidated. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular mechanisms downstream of <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i> inactivation resulting in oncogenesis and identify associated therapeutic dependencies. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 technologies, we generated <i>ATP6AP1<\/i>-knock out (KO), <i>ATP6AP2<\/i>-KO and non-target (NT) control immortalized Schwann cells, the likeliest cell of origin of GCTs. Compared to NT controls, <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i>-KOs displayed increased cellular proliferation, migration, and anchorage independent growth. <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i>-KOs, but not NT controls, demonstrated <i>in vivo <\/i>tumorigenesis upon subcutaneous implantation in NSG mice. In addition,<i> ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i>-KOs, compared to NT controls, displayed abnormal bulk endocytic function, evidenced by reduced endocytic cargo delivery to lysosomes in a DQ-Red BSA assay, and increased LC3BII\/LC3BI ratio and expression of the autophagy marker GABARAP, indicating altered autophagic flux. ATAC-seq analysis of our cell modes revealed changes in chromatin accessibility upon <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i> inactivation, affecting transcription factors (TFs) associated to the Wnt pathway, including LEF\/TCF (canonical Wnt) and NFAT (non-canonical Wnt), and TFs associated to autophagy pathways, among others. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed expression changes in key Wnt pathway components upon <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i> LOF, such as biphasic modulators (<i>DKK1<\/i>, <i>DKK2<\/i> and <i>SFRP1<\/i>), secreted ligands (<i>WNT2<\/i>, <i>WNT9a<\/i> and <i>WNT7B<\/i>), transcriptional regulators (<i>TLE1<\/i>, <i>TLE2<\/i>, <i>TLE3<\/i> and <i>TLE4<\/i>) and receptors (<i>LGR5<\/i>, <i>FZD7<\/i> and <i>FZD1<\/i>). Consistent with these findings, <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i>-KOs displayed upregulation of downstream canonical (MYC, Cyclin D1) and non-canonical (NFATC1, CALM1) Wnt targets at the mRNA and protein levels, and increased sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of the Wnt pathway, with significantly lower IC50s to IWR-1, compared to NT controls. Lastly, <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i>-KOs displayed increased sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition or induction of autophagy and\/or endocytic processes, with lower IC50s to Chloroquine, N-Ethylmaleimide, Torin-1 and Bafilomycin-A1 compared to NT controls. Taken together, we demonstrate that <i>ATP6AP1<\/i>\/<i>AP2<\/i> inactivation leads to the acquisition of oncogenic properties <i>in vitro<\/i> and in <i>vivo<\/i>, altered endocytosis and autophagy. Furthermore, our findings suggest that <i>ATP6AP1\/AP2<\/i> LOF results in chromatin accessibility changes leading to activation of an oncogenic transcriptional program with increased signaling via the Wnt pathway. Notably, inactivation of these genes results in unique and previously unknown vulnerabilities, offering potential avenues for therapeutic exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endocytosis,Wnt pathway,Tumorigenesis,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Notably, 95% of PDA cases exhibit <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations, contributing to highly dysregulated cell signaling networks. Despite extensive research into the interplay of various oncogenic pathways in pancreatic tumorigenesis, targeted therapies against these signaling networks have displayed modest efficacy, with most patients rapidly developing therapeutic resistance. Recent studies highlight the significance of the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as a functional biomarker linked to disease progression and resistance. However, understanding the detailed functions of CA19-9-modified proteins in PDA has been limited due to the lack of adequate models for synthesizing CA19-9. To address this challenge, we have developed unique mouse and 3D organoid culture models capable of producing CA19-9. CA19-9 elevation in mice with <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutations results in an aggressive PDA phenotype through increased tumor proliferation and microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Furthermore, our research has identified Fibulin 3 (FBLN3), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, as a secreted, CA19-9-modified protein that stimulates tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that FBLN3 not only facilitates tumor proliferation but also drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes STAT3 pathways activation in the CA19-9<sup>pos<\/sup>, <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant PDA organoids. Additionally, in both CA19-9<sup>pos<\/sup>, <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant PDA mouse models and human PDA, FBLN3 is expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), suggesting its role in TME remodeling. These findings have significant implications for providing novel insights into PDA biology and paracrine signaling mechanisms, identifying FBLN3 as a potential therapeutic target for the improved treatment of this devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cell signaling,Tumor microenvironment,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

RIT1 is a poorly-studied non-classical RAS GTPase and, to date, there are no reported genetically-engineered mouse models of RIT1-driven lung adenocarcinoma. Here, we have generated a conditional knock-in allele within the endogenous mouse <i>Rit1<\/i> locus, introducing the most frequent mutation observed in lung adenocarcinomas (RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup>). Upon intranasal administration of adenovirus encoding the Cre recombinase to induce somatic recombination in the mouse lungs, we observed the formation of discrete adenomas. Although <i>Rit1<\/i><sup>M90I <\/sup>mutation can promote lung tumor initiation in mice, we found that this phenotype is less penetrant than the common <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation. Immunohistochemistry analysis of <i>Rit1<\/i><sup>M90I <\/sup>and <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup> tumors showed expression of typical histological markers associated with lung adenocarcinoma (i.e., TTF1 and SPC), as well as increased levels of Ki67 and pERK expression. Next, to develop potential pharmacological strategies for RIT1-driven lung tumors, we first explored drugs that inhibit the RAS\/MAPK pathway and are either FDA-approved or under clinical development. <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments with cell lines carrying the RIT1<sup>M90I<\/sup> mutation demonstrated high sensitivity to SHP2, MEK, RAF, and RAS inhibitors. <i>In vivo<\/i>, SHP2 and RAS, but not MEK, inhibitors slowed down tumor progression in both cell line and patient-derived xenografts. Our results indicate that, although RAS signaling might be needed for RIT1-dependent growth, these tumors are not sensitive to MAPK inhibition as a monotherapy and, hence, other pathways could contribute to tumor growth. Therefore, we decided to explore whether targeting RIT1 directly, could be a more beneficial strategy for these tumors. In order to inhibit oncogenic RIT1 directly, we have undertaken two complementary approaches. First, because RIT1 mutations were shown to impair its proteolysis, we explored whether restoring RIT1 proteasomal degradation could be a promising strategy. Recently, the development of Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) has demonstrated that targeted degradation can be used as a pharmacological approach for the treatment of cancer. Therefore, we have tested successfully several proof-of-concept PROTAC approaches that caused degradation of oncogenic RIT1 in different cellular models. Second, we used a chemical biology approach to assess whether covalent inhibitors directed against the closely-related GTPase KRAS could cross-react and bind to oncogenic RIT1. We have identified a molecule that binds RIT1 and we are currently characterizing it in our preclinical models. Overall, our work provides comprehensive insights into the oncogenic role of RIT1 in lung cancer emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,Lung adenocarcinoma,Therapeutic target,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Acinar cells, the most probable origin of pancreatic cancer, undergo a rapid cell identity switch towards a duct-like phenotype upon Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> expression and when combined with pancreatitis or the loss of acinar differentiation factors. Metaplastic and dysplastic duct-like cells are heterogeneous with a proportion acquiring features reminiscent of gastric lineages. While some gastric signatures are maintained in the classical PDAC subtype, they are eroded in the more aggressive, basal-like PDAC. Since subtype identity has a major impact on prognosis and therapeutic targetability, druggable targets that regulate cellular reprogramming in pancreatic cancer can be exploited to increase sensitivity to therapy.<br \/>Methods: To elucidate mechanisms responsible for early reprogramming, pancreatic tissue of mice with conditional Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> expression and loss of Pdx1 was analyzed by single-nucleus ATAC-seq. Expression of identified target genes was studied in precancerous lesions and PDAC by using multiplex RNAscope and IHC staining. Computational analyses of publicly available sequencing data were used to establish correlation to PDAC subtype identity. Genes were functionally studied in PDAC cell lines.<br \/>Results: By performing snATAC-seq and RNA-seq of early transformed pancreatic tissue, we discovered that acinar cells with the combined expression of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> and loss of Pdx1 activate expression of a gastric metaplastic gene signature accompanied by elevated levels of the receptor kinase Ror2. Ror2 is also highly expressed in distinct subpopulations of metaplastic and dysplastic cells, associated with a gastric neck cell phenotype and enhanced proliferative capacity. In contrast, Ror2<sup>Low<\/sup> lesions are characterized by a gastric pit cell-like and a senescent phenotype. Genetic ablation of Ror2 resulted in a shift in lesion identity, enriching those with a pit cell and senescent identity. In PDAC, we found that Ror2 anti-correlates with a similar gastric pit cell phenotype that is maintained in the classical subtype PDAC but is strongly associated with the more aggressive basal-like subtype. Overexpression of ROR2 in human PDAC cell lines with a classical differentiation induced loss of the classical gene signature as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ROR2 enforces a strong dependency on AKT signaling, causing increased vulnerability of ROR2-expressing cells to AKT inhibition, but increased resistance to the KRAS inhibitor MRTX1133.<br \/>Conclusions: We discovered Ror2 as a critical determinant of precancerous lesion as well as PDAC subtype identity. Its role in driving an aggressive PDAC phenotype that is inherently resistant to Kras inhibition suggests that inhibiting this receptor tyrosine kinase will enhance sensitivity to the new generation of targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Receptors,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Notably, while RTKs have been classically described as transmembrane receptors, they can also translocate to the nucleus, even though the functional importance of this process remains largely unexplored for most RTKs. Here, we report a novel role for the nuclear form of the RTK human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) in driving primary breast cancer growth and metastasis. Firstly, using different patient-derived organoids (PDOs) established from metastatic breast cancer patients, we demonstrated the robust translocation of the activated phosphorylated HER3 receptor (pHER3) from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in response to its ligand Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). Interestingly, the nuclear translocation was observed not only in the HER2-positive breast cancer subtype but also in luminal and triple-negative breast cancer-derived cells. In order to decipher the functional role of nuclear HER3 (nHER3), we identified and mutated its nuclear localization signal, resulting in decreased nuclear translocation of the receptor while its membrane form remained intact. This reduction in nHER3 remarkably impeded primary tumor growth and metastatic spread in different patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Conversely, selective overexpression of HER3 in the nucleus led to increased primary tumor growth and metastatic burden in vivo. In order to decipher the mechanism of action of nHER3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation followed by global mass spectrometric analysis to identify the protein binding partners of the receptor in the nucleus. Specifically, nHER3 was found to interact with different transcription factors such as the AP-2 family of transcription factors and with major chromatin remodeling complexes like the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, implicating its role in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of PDOs expressing the wild-type or the mutated form of HER3 revealed the modulation of several key growth regulators such as early growth response 3 (EGR3) by nHER3. The nHER3-EGR3 axis further controlled downstream effectors like the immune chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL8. Accordingly, PDX from breast cancer cells overexpressing nHER3 showed significantly increased immune infiltration, suggesting a possible role of nHER3 in regulating the tumor microenvironment. Altogether, we report here a novel non-canonical role of the nuclear form of HER3 receptor in driving breast tumorigenesis, with key implications for our understanding and targeting of RTK signaling in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB3,Organoids,Gene regulation,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Previous studies have suggested that wild-type (wt)-RAS signaling may modulate cancer progression and drug resistance in these tumors. However, the interplay between oncogenic KRAS and wt-RAS-like GTPases in lung cancer biology and treatment remains debated. Here, we investigated the impact of increased wt-KRAS dosage in LUAD harboring mutant KRAS on lung cancer phenotypes and response to anti-KRAS therapies. Increased wt-KRAS dosage occurs in LUAD due to the loss of LZTR1, a proteostatic regulator of RAS-like GTPases. <i>LZTR1 <\/i>mutations, deletions, or downregulation co-occur with oncogenic KRAS mutations in more than 40% of LUAD patients. Using a global protein stability screen, we identified LZTR1 as the main regulator of the stability of wt-KRAS, but not of the oncogenic KRAS mutants. Proteomic analysis of LUAD cells confirmed that LZTR1 loss leads to elevated expression of wt-KRAS, but not of KRAS-G12D, indicating that <i>LZTR1<\/i> loss affects wt-RAS rather than mutant KRAS signaling. <i>LZTR1<\/i> loss in LUAD patients is associated with poor prognosis and hypoxic expression signatures. In a mouse model of <i>Kras-<\/i>mutated LUAD, <i>Lztr1<\/i> haploinsufficiency promoted tumor initiation and progression. Moreover, <i>Lztr1<\/i> loss results in hypoxic tumors with inflamed, tortuous, insufficiently perfused, and leaky vessels. Integrative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis revealed increased RAL\/TBK1 pathway activity in <i>LZTR1<\/i>-depleted lung cancer cells and <i>Lztr1<\/i>-deleted tumors. This leads to enhanced secretion of proangiogenic and proinflammatory factors, such as VEGF and TNF&#945;, by <i>LZTR1<\/i>-deficient cells and an increased number of neutrophils in <i>Lztr1<\/i>-deleted tumors. TNF-activated neutrophils present at vascular branching points can modulate vascular remodeling by influencing the formation and function of blood vessels. Pharmacological inhibition of RAL\/TBK1 signaling with amlexanox, an anti-NF-&#954;B\/TBK1 drug, reduces TNF&#945; secretion, decreases the number of neutrophils, and normalizes the tumor-associated vasculature. We demonstrated that increased wt-KRAS dosage, but not other small GTPases, mimicked the effects of LZTR1 loss on RAL\/TBK1 signaling and VEGF secretion, suggesting that LZTR1 loss alters the heterogeneity of KRAS-mutated lung cancer by modulating wt-KRAS levels. Furthermore, MRTX1133 a selective inhibitor of KRAS-G12D, showed limited effect in the <i>Kras-G12D<\/i>, <i>Lztr1<\/i>-loss LUAD model, whereas the combination of MRTX1133 and amlexanox suppress tumor growth, likely due to the restoration of the tumor vasculature by RAL\/TBK1 inhibition. Our study reveals novel insights into the role of wt-KRAS dosage in mutant KRAS lung cancer and identifies potential therapeutic strategies to target patients with dysregulated KRAS proteostasis due to LZTR1 loss.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Ubiquitination,Signal transduction,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
