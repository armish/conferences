While the pivotal role of the immune system in regulating tumor progression is well-acknowledged, the precise mechanisms through which aging influences anti-tumor T cell immunity and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remain elusive. In this study, we employed syngeneic murine tumor models (B16, MC38, and E0771) in young (2-4 months) and aged (20-24 months) cohorts to elucidate the early impacts of aging on tumor development and T cell responses. Our findings demonstrate that aged mice exhibit accelerated tumor growth across various models. In-depth analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) uncovered distinct alterations in the CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population, characterized by decreased activation status and diminished tumor specificity in aged mice. Correspondingly, aged mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. To unravel the underlying environmental factors contributing to compromised anti-tumor T cell responses and ICB resistance, we characterized the immune and metabolic landscapes of the aged tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumors. Furthermore, we established a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma in both young and aged mice, unveiling novel functions and mechanisms associated with age-related T cells actively impeding effective tumor control. In the context of increasing average life expectancy, comprehending the intricate interplay between age-related T cell dysfunction and cancer assumes paramount importance. Such insights hold the key to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies tailored for the growing population of older patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,T lymphocytes,Immuno-oncology,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In addition, recent studies have underscored the adverse effects of aging on T cells. Reprogramming T cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and differentiating them back to the T-cell lineage has proven to be complex and time-consuming. In particular for TIL applications, de novo T cell production via iPSCs requires each TCR in the final product to be derived from an independently established iPSC clone. To overcome these barriers, we developed a novel technology called Rejuvenation, which bypasses the need for reprogramming of T cells into iPSCs. Rejuvenated TIL products retain their TCR diversity while offering several significant advantages, including reduced T-cell epigenetic age, improved expansion capacity, stem cell-like phenotype, and enhanced secretion of cytokines upon activation by target antigens. In this study, we used TIL derived from patients with melanoma and NSCLC. Rejuvenated TIL were generated by the transient expression of transcription factors in a process called &#8216;Partial Reprogramming&#8217; and returned back to a T-cell lineage phenotype by a process called &#8216;Redirection&#8217;. Partially reprogrammed TIL showed an altered morphology resembling adherent stromal cells and down-regulated conventional T-cell markers including CD3, CD4, and CD8. Redirected T cells reacquired a conventional CD4\/CD8 phenotype including morphology, surface markers and function, and demonstrated decreased epigenetic age (&#62;7 years younger, N=3). We also observed a higher proliferative capacity, improved metabolic state, and increased expression of biomarkers associated with T-cell stemness, including CCR7 and CD62L, when compared with untreated TIL. Rejuvenated TIL demonstrated improved cytokine secretion, including IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and IL-2 in functional assays. Immune repertoire analysis revealed a significant polyclonal population of putative tumor-reactive TCRs. In vivo functionality was also evaluated using a xenograft model of engineered A375 melanoma cell line that agonizes T-cells in hIL2-NOG mice. Adoptive transfer of rejuvenated TIL resulted in significantly improved suppression of tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with TIL expanded by conventional methods. These results were also confirmed in other surrogate models, including rejuvenated PBMC, TCR and CAR T cells, demonstrating the broad applicability of Rejuvenation technology. Our results indicate TIL Rejuvenation enhances the functionality and antitumor characteristics of T cells, while preserving a broad TCR repertoire. This technology holds substantial promise and may pave the way for the development of the first rejuvenated autologous polyclonal TIL therapy for treatment of advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Adoptive immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Its primary ligand, 4-1BBL (CD137L), is found on antigen-presenting cells and various immune cells. The interaction between 4-1BBL and 4-1BB provides crucial costimulatory signals to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, amplifying their activation and effector functions. However, recent studies have shed light on a distinct role of 4-1BB in T cells. Prior work has revealed that 4-1BB can distinguish intratumoral regulatory T cells (Tregs) from peripheral Tregs and other CD4 lineage T cells in cancer patients, and the overexpression of 4-1BB on Tregs has been associated with unfavorable survival outcomes. Additionally, targeting 4-1BB with IgG2a isotype antibodies has shown significant anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical models by depleting Tregs. Furthermore, agonist monoclonal antibodies targeting 4-1BB have not only shown promise in inducing tumor regressions but also demonstrated improved outcomes in mouse models of autoimmune diseases induced by autoreactive CD4+ T cells. These findings indicate the existence of specific ligands or factors that modulate 4-1BB function on T cells that can vary depending on the disease state.<br \/>Methods: To identify potential ligand(s) involved in the modulation of 4-1BB function, we developed an innovative CRISPR\/Cas9-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) screening system that integrates CRISPR\/Cas9-guide mediated gene activation, high avidity bead-based selection, serial enrichment, and flow cytometry-based monitoring. This screening platform provides enhanced sensitivity for identifying extracellular interactions between receptor-ligand partners that have not been fully characterized before, even with low-affinity.<br \/>Results: Through our unbiased CRISPRa screen, we discovered that Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein (MAG), also known as siglec-4, a member of the siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) family, interacts with 4-1BB <i>in trans<\/i>. Our study demonstrated that MAG binds to activated T cells via 4-1BB and inhibits their activation and proliferation, suggesting a potential role of the MAG-4-1BB interaction in modulating T cell function. Notably, our data revealed that trans-binding to MAG-positive cells inhibits c-Jun signaling in activated T cells. Furthermore, the presence of MAG on target cells can hinder Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell activity.<br \/>Conclusion: Utilizing a highly efficient cell-based CRISPRa system, we discovered a novel interactor of 4-1BB capable of modulating T cell activation through its interaction with 4-1BB. This interaction suggests an immunosuppressive role of 4-1BB, explaining the paradoxical roles of 4-1BB in T cells. These findings provide crucial insights for the development of precise therapeutics targeting 4-1BB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Immune checkpoint,T cell,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Here, we highlight a hitherto unknown role of HDAC8 in immune cells by presenting data on conditional targeting of HDAC8 in T cells and the effects of selective HDAC8 inhibitors (HDAC8i) on T cell-dependent immune responses. First, as a genetic approach, we produced C57BL\/6 mice with floxed exon 3 of the HDAC8 gene suitable for targeted deletion of HDAC8 and, after crossing with syngeneic CD4cre mice, demonstrated conditional deletion of HDAC8 and enhanced acetylation of SMC3, a classic HDAC8 substrate, in their T-cells. Next, in a pharmacologic approach, we tested isoform-selective inhibitors of HDAC8 (OJ-1, PCI-34051) and assessed effects on Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cell suppressive function. Finally, we performed flow cytometry, RNAseq, CHIP-seq and mass spectrometry to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which HDAC8 knockout affected Treg function. Our data demonstrate that knocking down or inhibiting HDAC8: (i) impaired murine Treg suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, including inhibiting the ability of Tregs to promote mouse cardiac allograft survival (p&#60;0.01); (ii) decreased Treg function in homeostatic proliferation assays (p&#60;0.01), e.g., involving adoptive transfer of WT or HDAC8-\/- Tregs plus WT conventional T cells into immunodeficient hosts; (iii) decreased intratumoral Tregs, increased CD4 and CD8 T cells, increased production of effectors such as IFN-g and granzyme-B, and limited growth of syngeneic mouse non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (p&#60;0.01) (whereas no effect of Hdac8i on tumor growth was seen in immunodeficient hosts, indicating the key action was via immune cell targeting). Mechanistically, HDAC8 co-precipitated with Foxp3 and NFAT5 and promoted the deacetylation of Foxp3 and NFAT5, and knockout of HDAC8 enhanced the acetylation level of NFAT5 and promoted cytokine expression. Hence, our combined genetic and pharmacologic studies establish the importance of HDAC8 in Foxp3+ Treg cells and show that therapy with selective HDAC8 inhibitors can be a novel therapeutic approach in immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Histone deacetylase,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

During cancer progression, tumor cells interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, it is essential to delineate the communication dynamics between cancer cells and TIICs to identify novel pathways for therapeutic targeting. <i>BRMS1<\/i> is a metastasis suppressor gene that is frequently downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We, and others, have shown that loss of BRMS1 results in increased distant metastatic disease. Given the strong correlation between immune suppression, metastasis, and immunotherapy resistance we sought to elucidate if BRMS1 contributes to these processes. Specifically, we hypothesized that loss of BRMS1 in LUAD cells influences the immune cell composition, shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment and decreasing tumor response to immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: To experimentally address our hypothesis, we generated <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup><i> P53<\/i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> <i>Brms1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice inducing spontaneous tumors with Ad-Cre intratracheal inoculation.

Gene ontology and GSEA highlighted a diminished immune response signature in <i>Brms1<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>tumors. In contrast, hallmark gene sets like IFN&#947; response, IL6 signaling, and inflammation are highly enriched in <i>Brms1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup><\/i>tumors. mMCP-counter suggested a decrease in CD8+ T cells in <i>Brms1<sup>-\/- <\/sup><\/i>tumors. Likewise, scRNA-seq data confirmed a significant decrease in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the <i>Brms1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis showed a reduction in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with low proliferative potential (Ki67+) in the <i>Brms1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. Postmortem on our syngeneic mouse tumors after a 30-day anti-PD1 antibody treatment revealed a significantly larger mean tumor size in the <i>BRMS1<sup>KD<\/sup><\/i> group compared to the WT group (942.4 mm&#179; vs. 184 mm&#179;; p&#60;0.023). Immunophenotyping on these tumors using flow cytometry also demonstrated reduced cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the KD group post-treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggest that reduced BRMS1 expression in LUAD alters CD8+ T cell composition and primary tumor response to immunotherapy. Implications of our findings underscore the potential of BRMS1 as a therapeutic target in the context of immunotherapy-resistant LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,BRMS1,Immunotherapy Resistance,Metastasis suppressor genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

As such, current immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), target exhausted CD8 T cells with the hope of reinvigorating the CD8 T cells to drive tumor clearance. However, many tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), can evade CD8 T cell detection via downregulation of the antigen presentation molecule, major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) as either primary or acquired resistance to immunotherapy. We have previously reported that agonistic CD40 antibody (&#945;CD40), which promotes the maturation and licensing of dendritic cells to drive T cell priming, synergizes with ICB to induce tumor rejection dependent on both CD4 and CD8 T cells in mouse models of PDAC. Given the potential mechanisms of resistance to CD8 T cell immunity, we hypothesized that interrogation of the mechanisms underlying &#945;CD40-induced CD4 T cell rejection of PDAC will reveal targets for improving CD4 T cell-directed immunotherapies. Here, we show that implantation of an MHC I deficient PDAC cell line derived from the genetically engineered <i>Kras<\/i><i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i><i>Trp53<\/i><i><sup>R172H<\/sup><\/i><i>Pdx1-Cre <\/i>(KPC) mouse model results in normal tumor establishment and progression. Upon treatment with combined &#945;CD40 and ICB, tumor growth was significantly decreased in a CD4, but not CD8, T cell-dependent manner. Using genetic knockout mice, we determined that tumor regression was perforin-independent and identified host expression of IFN&#947; as requisite for therapeutic efficacy. To identify the cellular subset mediating CD4 T cell-rejection of the tumor, we assessed the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) positive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which possess the ability to directly synapse with CD4 T cells to drive anti-tumorigenic T cell programs. We determined that macrophage and myeloid cells were dispensable for treatment efficacy, however non-immune cells in the TME can also interact with CD4 T cells through expression of MHC II. Interrogation of stromal cells reveals an increase in the proportion of MHC II+ subsets after combined &#945;CD40\/ICB treatment, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of MHC II+ tumor cells. These data support the notion that CD4 T cell control of tumors may be mediated by both direct and indirect mechanisms of tumor killing. Findings from this work will elucidate non-canonical mechanisms of CD4 T cell-mediated rejection of tumors and may be leveraged to discover novel translational targets for immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,CD40,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Whereas initial preclinical studies on STING agonists exhibited boost in anti-tumor response, clinical trials combining STING agonist and immune checkpoint blockade agent PD-1 reported that only small subset of patients benefited from the treatment. This study highlights a potential key mechanism underlying the lack of benefit from STING agonist observed in most clinical trial patients. We reveal a phenomenon known as chromosomal instability (CIN), characterized by persistent chromosome segregation errors over multiple rounds of mitosis, drives chronic activation of cGAS (cyclic GMP&#8210;AMP synthase) through continuously supplying its substrate in the form of micronuclei. Chronic activation of cGAS stimulates degradation of its downstream target STING in a feedback-loop manner. This consequently attenuates type I interferon signaling upon STING activation, blunting its anti-tumor response. Remarkably, we show suppression of CIN, achieved through introduction of mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), or inhibition of cGAS activity, either by pharmacological agent or total genetic ablation of cGAS using CRISPR-Cas9, restores type I interferon production and anti-tumor immunity upon the administration of STING agonist, MSA-2 in four of the five advanced tumor models. Furthermore, we show this restoration of type I interferon signaling and anti-tumor immunity is cancer cell STING-dependent as genetic deletion of STING in the tumor cells nullifies this effect. In summary, we provide a mechanistic insight underlying the limited anti-tumor response observed in STING agonist trials and propose potential strategies, through finetuning of CIN level or inhibition of cGAS activity, to illicit stronger anti-tumor immunity in combination with STING agonist treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Tumor immunity,Inflammation,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Christy Hong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lindsay Caprio<sup>2<\/sup>, Mercedes Duran<sup>1<\/sup>, Meri Rogava<sup>2<\/sup>, Hsiang-His Ling<sup>2<\/sup>, Sreeharsha Gurrapu<sup>2<\/sup>, Leon Ebel<sup>2<\/sup>, Melody Di Bona<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Izar<sup>2<\/sup>, Samuel  F.
