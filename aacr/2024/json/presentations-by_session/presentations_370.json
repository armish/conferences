[{"Abstract":"The BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Susceptibility 2) gene is critical for preserving genome integrity by regulating homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Germline mutations in BRCA2 predispose individuals to a high risk for ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. BRCA2 contains eight BRC repeats that mediate binding to RAD51. It remains unclear how exactly the different BRC repeats regulate RAD51 functions. In our study, we explore the importance of each BRC repeat, their interconnections, and their impact on RAD51 binding and filament stability. We engineered amino acid substitutions into the BRC FxTAS motif required for specific contacts within a hydrophobic binding pocket of RAD51 to disrupt BRC binding to RAD51. We further created mutations in RAD51 (F86E\/A89E) that either prevent self-association but retain binding to the BRC repeats or a mutation (K133R) that results in a hyper-stable RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. Using both cell-based models and biochemical analyses, we have begun studies to parse out the specific functions of each BRC repeat. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate single amino acid changes into each BRC repeat within the context of the full-length BRCA2 protein to comprehensively characterize the contribution of each BRC repeat to HDR and response to chemotherapeutics such as PARP inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA2,Homologous recombination,DNA repair,RAD51,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Julia  R.

Identification of the patient population for PARP inhibitor therapy is imperative to reduce recurrence of EOC and improve the survival outcomes of patients. Current biomarkers for PARP inhibitor therapy consist of an array of genes involved in the HR repair pathway in EOC, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. Through TCGA analysis, we found that the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) gene is mutated in 10.3% of all EOC patients and considerably enriched in BRCA1 mutated EOC patients. However, the role of KMT2C in HR repair and PARP inhibitor sensitivity of EOC remains largely undefined.<br \/>Methods: BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO1-NR cells were transfected with KMT2C siRNA and assayed for KMT2C protein expression by western blotting. DR-GFP (HR) and EJ5-GFP (NHEJ)-SKOV3 cell lines were co-transfected with the ISceI-expressing plasmid pCBA-ISceI and KMT2C siRNA. GFP-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. SKOV3 cells were transfected with KMT2C siRNA and the expression of BRCA2 and Rad51 mRNA was determined using quantitative RT-PCR analysis.<br \/>Results: siRNA-mediated knockdown of KMT2C resulted in marked down-regulation of KMT2C protein in PEO1 and PEO1-NR cells. KMT2C knockdown caused a significant decrease in ISceI-induced HR activity in DR-GFP-SKOV3 cells (p &#60; 0.05). In contrast, KMT2C knockdown had no effects on ISceI-induced NHEJ activity in EJ5-GFP-SKOV3 cells. As a control, Rad51 knockdown caused complete suppression of HR activity and had no effects on NHEJ activity. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of key HR genes showed that KMT2C knockdown resulted in a moderate but significant down-regulation of BRCA2 (p &#60; 0.05) and Rad51 (p &#60; 0.01) expression in SKOV3 cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that KMT2C partakes in the HR repair pathway in EOC. However, the contribution of KMT2C to HR activity is not rate-limiting. Based on the known function of KMT2C in histone modification, we speculate that KMT2C serves to positively regulate the transcription of HR genes and therefore promote HR activity. Future investigation into the exact roles of KMT2C in HR repair, etiology of EOC, and diagnostic biomarkers for the PARP inhibitor sensitivity of EOC is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,KMT2C,BRCA,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

While CRISPR knock-out, achieved through in-del mutations via cellular repair mechanisms, has proven remarkably effective, the knock-in system for exogenous fragment insertion encounters challenges due to limited specificity and efficiency. Two primary methods for exogenous fragment insertion, namely NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) and HR (Homologous Recombination), exist. HR allows for the construction of DNA insertions with precise junctions but is comparatively less efficient than NHEJ. To address these limitations, our system focuses on enhancing the efficiency of HR-based genome editing. Primarily, we have optimized the Lenti All-in-one CRISPR system to augment the delivery and targeting efficiency of the Cas9-gRNA complex. The system has been successfully employed to knock out Glutamine Synthetase (GLUL) in HEK293T cells, exhibiting superior efficiency compared to commercially available tools. Secondly, we have implemented a pseudo-lenti system to amplify the entry capacity of donor DNA with homology arms into target cells. This technique has shown an improved HR effect in the experiment to tag a GFP at the C terminals of CDC25A. Lastly, we leverage proximity effects by fusing Cas9 with a capture protein that can grasp a bait sequence attached to the donor DNA, thereby facilitating its transfer to the target sites. Our system has demonstrated exceptional efficacy as a CRISPR knock-out platform and a powerful tool for DNA tagging functionality on target genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Homologous repairing,Knock-in,Genome Editing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Recently, cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitors have emerged as therapeutic options to treat cancer. We have previously implicated CDK9 in genome integrity maintenance through HR repair by modulating BRCA1 recruitment to double-stranded break sites. CDK9 is a component of the positive transcription elongation (PTEF-b) complex and more recently was proposed by the hereditary breast case-control (BEACCON) study as a putative breast cancer (BC) predisposition gene in non-<i>BRCA<\/i> families. Differently from <i>BRCA1<\/i>-linked BCs, loss-of-function mutations in <i>CDK9<\/i> were significantly correlated with ER-positive and Lobular BCs. CDK9 expression is also elevated in metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) tissue and correlates with poor prognosis in OC patients. Here we characterize the BRCA1\/BARD1\/CDK9 complex using protein-protein interaction assays. Our data indicate that the CDK9\/BARD1 interaction occurs indirectly through BRCA1. We also generated a separation-of-function mutation in CDK9 (mutCDK9) that disrupts its interaction with BRCA1 but retains its kinase activity and preserves its role in transcription. We rescued the mutCDK9\/BRCA1 interaction using a complementary mutation in BRCA1 (cmutBRCA1), that retains BRCA1 role in cell viability. Further, we employed CRISPR-based genome editing to generate genetically defined haploid HAP1 cell lines that express mutCDK9 in various <i>TP53BP1<\/i> and <i>BRCA1<\/i> backgrounds. The mutCDK9 cells preserve global RNA transcription and the phosphorylation status of the RNA polymerase II. We observed that mutCDK9 cells are more sensitive to the PARPi, rucaparib when compared to wild-type cells in proficient and deficient <i>TP53BP1<\/i> backgrounds. However, mutCDK9 expression did not affect the sensitivity of HAP1 cells expressing cmutBRCA1. Collectively, our data suggest that CDK9 acts in genome integrity maintenance by HR through its interaction with BRCA1 independently of its canonical role in transcription.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,CDK,DNA damage,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Hence it is of great interest of both pharmaceutical and academic field to develop the WRN inhibitors.

WRN proteins of different length have been successfully purified and utilized to develop multiple biochemical assays such as unwinding assay and ATPase assay. We have also validated different cellular assays, including proliferation and immunofluorescence, to assess the cytotoxicity and the influence of downstream biomarkers of WRN inhibitors. A WRN knock-out cell line has been generated to better appreciate the inhibition mechanism. In addition, we have generated a WRN-HiBiT knock-in cell line to evaluate WRN degraders or target-compound interactions. Lastly, multiple CDX models utilizing different MSI or MSS cell lines have been validated to help determine the efficacy of WRN inhibitors thus shed light on the drug indications.

CRISPR was used to induce frameshift alleles in Exons 10 and 11 and with PE, we created two RMS patient specific LOF variants in Exons 5 and 17. We generated a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with heterozygous excision of Exon 11 of <i>Brca2<\/i>. This allele is now being crossed into two different previously established GEMMs of RMS: a myoblast-specific (MyoD1-Cre) conditional loss of <i>p53,<\/i> and a gain-of-function mutant <i>p53,<\/i> LSL-p53<sup>R172H <\/sup>(Nakahata, et al. <i>Dis. Model. Mech., <\/i>2022), to assess changes in the pace of tumorigenesis and metastatic potential. Through an X01 agreement with the Gabriella Miller Kids First Program, we have submitted paired tumor-normal samples for additional whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (tumor only) on &#62;500 patients with RMS, including those with germline variants in <i>BRCA2<\/i>.<b><\/b><b> <\/b><b>Results:<\/b> Using CRISPR, we generated cell lines heterozygous for the frameshift variants c.1345dup, c.5680del, and c.5680dup.

F-actin, a crucial cytoskeletal protein, influences DNA repair and impacts genomic stability. F-actin dynamics also shape the glioma stem cell (GSC) phenotype, affecting self-renewal and migration. Altered F-actin organization contributes to GBM resistance to conventional therapies. Understanding F-actin's multifaceted role is vital for developing targeted strategies to overcome treatment resistance and enhance outcomes for GBM patients. This study goes deeper into the intricate interplay between the F-actin cytoskeleton and the acquisition of resistance in GBM cells. Our primary goal was to explore the effects of pharmacological or genetic F-actin depolymerization on the reversal of acquired resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) in GBM cells, particularly focusing on the underlying mechanisms involving DNA repair, the glioma stem cell (GSC) phenotype, and therapeutic implications. To establish resistant sublines, GBM U87-MG cells underwent cycles of IR and TMZ exposure, revealing a significant increase in IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for TMZ and ID<sub>50<\/sub> values for IR through viability assays. Subsequent characterization of these sublines growth was in both adherent and spheroid cultures uncovering a distinct sphere-forming capacity. Notably, alterations in DNA repair and the Rho GTPase pathway were observed, with evident disorganized F-actin polymerization in resistant cells, especially at the periphery of spheroids. Elevated expression of stemness markers (Nestin, CD133, and CD44) highlighted a GSC-like profile in the resistant cells, a characteristic further accentuated in spheroid cultures. To assess the relevance of the actin cytoskeleton in maintaining the resistant phenotype, cells were treated with Rho-GTPase inhibitor (C3) or actin polymerization inhibitor (Cytochalasin D). Both treatments resulted in reduced TMZ IC<sub>50<\/sub> and IR ID<sub>50<\/sub> values, partially attributed to the negative modulation of DNA repair capacity - observed by alkaline comet and host-cell reactivation assays. Additionally, F-actin disassembly was found to impact the expression of stemness markers, further reinforcing the connection between cytoskeletal dynamics and the GSC phenotype. Overall, our data strongly suggest that F-actin cytoskeleton dynamics plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of resistance in GBM. Targeting these cytoskeletal components sees a promising pharmacological strategy for resensitizing recurrent and resistant GBM tumors, not only by diminishing DNA repair capabilities but also by influencing the GSC-like phenotype, thus opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Actin cytoskeleton,Resistance,Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuli Thamires Magalhães<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Fábio Luís Forti<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biochemistry, IQ USP, São Paulo, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4e45a630-3c40-4657-b98c-42b35c08830b","ControlNumber":"3467","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the upstream signaling mechanisms regulating MRE11 in DNA repair are unclear. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which MRE11 is regulated by deacetylation by the SIRT2 sirtuin deacetylase and tumor suppressor protein. We overexpressed MRE11 in HEK293T cells, induced DNA damage through radiation treatment, and performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies with and without ionizing radiation (IR). Additionally, we evaluated the acetylation of MRE11 with and without the presence of SIRT2. In a series of functional experiments, immunofluorescence staining assays were performed in U2OS-265 Fok1 cells with SIRT2 knockdown to determine the effect of on MRE11 recruitment to DNA damage sites. Co-IP studies and in vitro DNA pulldown assays were performed to determine the role of SIRT2 in impacting MRE11 interaction with RAD50 and NBS1 and binding to DNA damage. We also examined for IR-induced RPA70 foci formation and downstream ATM-dependent signaling. We found that SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates MRE11. Furthermore, SIRT2 deacetylation facilitated MRE11 binding to DNA but not interaction with RAD50 and NBS1. Finally, SIRT2 deacetylation facilitated DNA end resection and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of KAP1. In conclusion, our results define a role for SIRT2 in directing MRE11 localization and binding to DNA to promote DNA end resection and ATM-dependent signaling through deacetylation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In contrast to protein-coding mRNAs, certain lncRNAs carry out their functions within the nucleus. A detailed elucidation of the kinetics of lncRNAs contributes to a comprehensive understanding of their bona fide biological characteristics. Consequently, advancements in the in vivo visualization of lncRNAs have continued. Currently, various techniques, including RNA imaging technologies, have been employed to facilitate real-time tracking and visualization of RNA molecules within living cells. Taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) is an oncogenic lncRNA, playing a pivotal role in cancer cells by resolving R-loops formed at stalled replication forks, particularly under replication stress conditions such as Hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Despite its significance, the dynamic regulation of TUG1 under replication stress conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, we developed a stem loop-based live imaging system enabling real-time visualization of TUG1, providing insights into its subcellular localization and dynamic roles in physiological contexts. Upon treatment with HU, a chemical that interferes with replication, TUG1 expression was rapidly upregulated in the nucleus within 20 minutes. Additionally, we observed TUG1 molecules relocating close to the nuclear membrane. Considering the reported relocation of collapsed forks to the nuclear pore complex, this suggests that TUG1 may be involved in this relocation structure. These data indicate that TUG1 is associated with the fork restore mechanism occurring at the relocated collapsed forks, and the current live-cell imaging system holds potential for further uncovering the critical roles of TUG1 in cancer cells. Our stem loop-based imaging may contribute to a more precise understanding of RNA dynamics in live cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,DNA repair,Glioblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

MSCs are important for the maintenance and responsiveness of skeletal tissues to environmental mechanical challenges. Beyond regulating proliferative and differentiative capacity of MSCs, emerging evidence suggests that physical activity is associated with improved recovery from DNA damage caused by environmental genotoxic stressors associated with stress and aging. Highlighting the possible crosstalk between DNA repair and bone health, defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER), which removes bulky DNA adducts, are associated with myelosuppression and progeroid aging phenotypes that result in bone defects and lipidodystrophies in mice. Cancer, early aging syndromes, and certain musculoskeletal diseases are associated with disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that transduces environmental mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix into the nucleus of a cell. Loss of LINC complex elements is associated with breast cancer progression and poorer prognosis. We hypothesize that LINC-mediated mechanical stimulation into the nucleus is critical for repair of bulky DNA adducts. Our pilot project showed that mechanical stimulation applied in the form of low intensity vibration (LIV) improved NER of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts in cultured MSCs. Our findings show a 20% increase in repair of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts in LIV treated samples compared to non-vibrated samples at 24 hours (P&#60;0.005). We also quantified the effect of LINC complex disruption on cisplatin-induced DNA damage removal. Intact MSCs showed significant adduct removal after 24 hours, while LINC disruption significantly reduced DNA repair (P&#60;0.001). Furthermore, initial experiments suggest that LINC disrupted cells do not arrest at DNA repair checkpoints, therefore, loss of LINC complex may reduce entry into senescence increasing DNA mutagenesis. In conclusion, these findings suggest a novel interaction between mechanical stimulation, the DNA damage response, and LINC complex in DNA repair in multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we suggest that LINC-mediated mechanical changes associated with LIV treatment may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat deleterious musculoskeletal conditions associated with anti-cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Nucleotide excision repair,Mechanotransduction,Cisplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

LS is caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, <i>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6<\/i>, and <i>PMS2<\/i>. Identification and classification of these mutations is important in LS diagnosis for guiding treatment plans and preventative care for patients&#8217; and their families. However, the consequences of some variants in these genes are not immediately obvious, granting them classification as variants of uncertain significance (VUS).

The most successful DDR targeted therapies inhibit the DNA damage sensor, PARP, a protein that recognizes single strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks as well as other DNA secondary structures induced by single strand gaps that can initiate chromosome instability and cell death. Building on the initial clinical success of PARP inhibitors, development of DDR targeted therapeutics has become increasingly popular, however, the clinical outcomes with these therapeutics have not met expectations and thus a new approach to targeting the DDR pathway is needed. NERx Biosciences has developed a novel strategy of targeting the DDR by intervening upstream of the DDR kinases and targeting specific DDR sensors. The human ssDNA binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), is a critical sensor for the DDR, serving to sense the ssDNA at replication forks that arise from replication stress (RS) and is a novel target for cancer therapy. We have discovered, developed, and characterized a novel small molecule RPA inhibitor (RPAi) NERx-329 that blocks the RPA-DNA interaction and elicits a state of chemical RPA exhaustion that results in <i>in vivo<\/i> anticancer activity. Extensive chemical optimization enabled in vitro and in vivo analyses to elucidate mechanism of action, cellular engagement, and therapeutic activity of RPA-targeted agents<b>. <\/b>Biochemical reconstitution of the ATR signaling pathway shows that NERx-329 disrupts ATR kinase activity, further suggesting a novel mechanism of action driven by RPA inhibition induced replication catastrophe. In vivo analysis reveals activity in a series of lung and ovarian patient derived xenograft models of human cancer. Single agent activity results in a tumor growth delay, which can be enhanced in combination therapy with DDR inhibitors as well as traditional DNA damaging cancer therapeutics. Data demonstrate that tumor growth observed in vivo is a function of NERx329 bioavailability and not development of a specific resistance mechanism. In an effort to identify formulations effective in enhancing oral bioavailability, we have pursued the development of Spray-dried dispersions (SDD). PK analysis reveal a dose-dependent substantial increase in C<sub>MAX<\/sub> and AUC, allowing for optimal dosing regimens for efficacy and safety studies. In addition, specific genetic predictors of RPAi sensitivity have been identified and results demonstrate specific genetic alterations increase RPAi activity in vitro and in vivo. NERx-329 represents the first clinically viable agent to target the DDR pathway by disrupting the RPA-DNA interaction and holds the potential for significant impact in cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,DNA damage response,DNA repair inhibition,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Recent work has demonstrated that the addition of ATM inhibitors enhances the cytotoxicity and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy of ATR inhibitors by abrogating the ATR inhibitor mediated G<sub>1<\/sub> cell cycle arrest and enhancing chromosomal damage.<sup>1<\/sup> Prior to causing cell death, damaged chromosome fragments can end up in the cytosol where they are detected by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors such as cGAS, resulting in the induction of inflammatory signaling pathways and an anti-tumor immune response. This suggests that the mode of action of DDR inhibitors may involve the tumor microenvironment (TME). We therefore aimed to assess the influence of combined pharmacological ATR and ATM inhibition on the TME to better understand how this could be exploited therapeutically.<br \/>In line with published results in human tumor models, the treatment of murine colon cancer MC-38 cells <i>in vitro<\/i> with a combination of ATR inhibitor tuvusertib and ATM inhibitor lartesertib led to cell death. Further analysis revealed an activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, an upregulation of PD-L1 and the release of inflammatory cytokines. These results confirmed the activation of immune signaling pathways upon combined inhibition of ATR and ATM.<br \/>To analyze the stimulation of an anti-tumor immune response upon tuvusertib + lartesertib treatment <i>in vivo<\/i>, MC-38 cells were transplanted into immunocompetent C57BL\/6J mice. Immunoprofiling by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that treatment with tuvusertib + lartesertib indeed altered the TME in this setting. In line with the <i>in vitro<\/i> findings, a significant upregulation of PD-L1 on immune and tumor cells could be observed after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment even though MC-38 cells expressed high levels of PD-L1 already. Immunoprofiling did not reveal any changes in the TME immune cell content at these early time points. Interestingly, PD-L1 expression as well as tumor immune population changed after prolonged (23 days) treatment. PD-L1 was still expressed on tumor cells but to a significantly lesser extent and a depletion of CD8+ T-cells was observed. However, a significant increase in NK cells could be detected.<br \/>In summary, we show that inhibition of the DDR through a combination of ATR and ATM inhibitors influences the TME in the MC-38 tumor model. These findings suggest an additional mode of action beyond direct cancer cell cytotoxicity. Further studies on how this may be leveraged therapeutically, for example through a combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, are warranted.<br \/>1.

Topoisomerase I inhibitors stabilize DNA-topoisomerase cleavage complexes (Topo1cc) that lead to double-strand breaks and activation of DNA damage response (DDR). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) mediates signal transduction in the DDR as an important regulator. AZD5305 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1. Since PARP1 is a key component driving the repair of trapped Topo1cc, we aimed to investigate if combinations of Dato-DXd with AZ5305 lead to synergistic anti-tumor effects in preclinical models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated the cytotoxic effect of the combination of Dato-DXd with AZD5305 in a panel of six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and five triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in a 7-day viability assay. We evaluated PARylation inhibition and gH2AX response by Western blotting. Topo1cc accumulation in response to combination treatment was evaluated by immunofluorescence. This combination was evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> in TROP2+, HRD-negative gastric cancer (GC) N87 cell line xenograft at varying concentrations of AZD5305 and in a TROP2+, PARPi-resistant Ovarian cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) model (CTG-3718).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The <i>in vitro <\/i>combination screen demonstrated enhanced cell killing by the Dato-DXd and AZD5305 combination over either single agent in both NSCLC and TNBC cell lines. Combination benefit was observed at all doses regardless of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. We observed dose-dependent increase in PARylation inhibition and enhanced induction of gH2AX in the combination treatment. In a N87 tumor model, while Dato-DXd and AZD5305 provided 84% and 31% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as monotherapies respectively, the addition of AZD5305 to Dato-DXd resulted in 95% TGI. This effect was observed with multiple dose levels of AZD5305. In a TROP2+, ovarian cancer PDX model, AZD5305<i> <\/i>demonstrated limited monotherapy activity (&#60;10% TGI) and Dato-DXd demonstrated robust monotherapy activity with 72% TGI. Additional anti-tumor activity was observed for the combination treatment compared to either monotherapy with 88% TGI. All treatment groups were well tolerated <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Dato-DXd combination with AZD5305 increased cytotoxic activity and pharmacodynamic response <i>in vitro<\/i>. This combination led to superior tumor growth inhibition in a GC xenograft model and a PARP1i-resistant Ovarian PDX model <i>in vivo<\/i>.
