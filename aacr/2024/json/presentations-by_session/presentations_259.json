However, there are uncertainties regarding the choice between the primary or the metastatic tumor for neoantigen prediction in individual patients. Here, we conducted a thorough examination of somatic variations in 676 patients who had paired primary and metastatic solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Patients were enrolled in the Total Cancer Care protocol (NCT03977402) to which patients provided an IRB-approved written informed consent within the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). Whole-exome sequencing of 756 primary and metastatic tumor pairs was performed (N = 676 patients). These included Genitourinary (n=83), Gynecological (n=97), Gastrointestinal (n=213), Thoracic (n=33), Cutaneous (n=24), Breast (n=108), Endometrial (n=49), Sarcoma (n=35), Head-and-Neck (n=106) and others (n=8). The data was analyzed through the ORIEN AVATAR Molecular Analysis Pipeline for somatic mutation variant detection and variant annotation. In this analysis, we focused on somatic events that result in an in-frame alteration (such as missense, in-frame deletion and in-frame insertion) and out-of-frame protein-altering mutations (such as frameshifts, de novo start, out-of-frame, and nonstop gain). Clonal population structure was determined based on pyclone-vi.<br \/>Results: For in-frame events, bladder cancer, melanoma, and gynecological cancers shared close to 75% of the mutations between paired primary and metastatic cases. In contrast, sarcoma and thyroid cancer had a low overlap (~ 25%) of variants. For out-of-frame events, these events tend to have a lower proportion of shared somatic variants between primary and metastasis than in-frame variants. Oncogenic drivers (e.g., BRAF V600E, KRAS G12A, and TP53 loss-of-function) were highly likely to be present in both paired primary and metastatic tumors. Next, we performed additional analysis on evolutionary selection of protein-coding variants via dN\/dS calculation. We found no significant global shift in dN\/dS ratio between paired primary and metastatic tumors across malignancies. However, we found increased selection of protein-coding variants in brain and liver metastatic sites, which correlated with increased homologous recombination deficiency within these sites.<br \/>Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates genetic variations that exist when comparing paired primary and metastatic tumors that appear to vary by histology. Variants are potentially undergoing negative selection supported by the preferential loss of out-of-frame events in metastatic tumors and positive selection in specific metastatic sites. Overall, understanding the clonal structure will be key to neoantigen prediction for effective neoantigen-based vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Metastasis,Clonal evolution,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

To understand the underlying genetic and mutational processes associated with ecDNA formation and presence, we conducted an analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 14,778 cancer patients representing 39 tumor types from the Genomics England cohort. Our findings revealed focal amplifications driven by ecDNA in 17.1% of tumor samples, exhibiting varying frequencies across tissues. Notably, liposarcomas (55.4%) and HER2+ breast cancers (46.4%) displayed higher rates compared to lower rates found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (2%). In addition to oncogenic amplifications such as HER2 derived from ecDNA during cancer evolution, ecDNAs that did not contain oncogenes were enriched for immunomodulatory genes (e.g., CXCL6, LRRC32, and HLA-G). Immunomodulatory ecDNAs exhibited reduced T cell infiltration.<br \/>In the context of intrinsic and environmental mutational processes, deamination clock-like, tobacco smoking, and APOBEC cytidine deaminase signatures positively correlated with ecDNA presence. Conversely, mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) and POLD1\/POLE deficiency signatures exhibited a negative correlation. Mutational processes associated with tobacco exposure, UV light, and spontaneous deamination primarily occurred before ecDNA formation, while signatures of homologous recombination repair deficiency tended to manifest post-ecDNA formation.Notably, ecDNA was enriched at metastatic sites and significantly associated with shorter overall survival in multivariable analysis (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17-1.47), underscoring its clinical relevance. This study enhances our understanding of the mutational processes and tissue contexts that shape the ecDNA landscape in human cancer and highlights its implications for clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Drug resistance,Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In patients with HER2 negative MBC, two ADCs have FDA approval: sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), both with topoisomerase-I (topo-I) inhibitor payloads. Given the many other ADCs in development, there is great interest in using ADC after ADC to maximize treatment benefit for patients. However, there is limited understanding regarding resistance mechanisms to ADCs and impact on ADC sequencing. We conducted a translational study to address this, and here we report the incidence of <i>TOP1<\/i> mutations and clinical impact on ADC sequencing.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: All patients with MBC treated with ADCs at a large academic medical institution (Massachusetts General Hospital) who had comprehensive plasma-based genotyping (500 gene GuardantOMNI panel) were included. Since both SG and T-DXd have topo-I inhibitor-based payloads, we particularly focused on <i>TOP1 <\/i>mutations, variant allele frequency (VAF), and germline\/somatic characterization. Incidence of <i>TOP1<\/i> mutations in the ADC cohort was compared to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Clinical &#8220;cross-resistance&#8221; was defined as progressive disease (PD) as best response to second ADC (ADC2) or treatment time on ADC2 of less than 60 days.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Based on comprehensive plasma-based genotyping we identified 4 distinct <i>TOP1<\/i> mutations: S57C, R364H, W401C, G359E, at a frequency of 6.0% (4\/67) at the time of disease progression on ADC compared to a frequency of 0.5% described in primary breast cancer in TCGA. Two of the amino acids found to be mutated are known to form direct interactions with the DNA backbone (G359) or the topoisomerase inhibitor itself (R364). For clinical resistance, one patient was briefly on ADC2 but stopped after 1 dose for toxicity; among the other 3 patients, two had cross-resistance to ADC after ADC, with both ADCs containing topo-I inhibitor payloads. Median duration on first ADC was 455 days compared to a median of 52 days for ADC2. Finally, one patient treated sequentially with 3 ADCs (all with topo-I inhibitor payloads) was found to have rising TOP1 VAF with progressive ADC treatments.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: This is the first report describing emergence of <i>TOP1<\/i> mutations under selective pressure from ADCs and the impact on mediating cross-resistance to ADC after ADC with topo-I inhibitor payloads. Novel ADCs with alternative payloads may potentially be more effective when used sequentially after an ADC with a topo-I inhibitor. Further biomarker research is needed to optimize ADC sequencing for patients with <i>TOP1<\/i> mutant MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Biomarkers,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

All the data are collected to the &#8220;Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT)&#8221; under written informed consent. Up to date, over 60,000 CGP data have been deposited with a 99.7% consent rate. This study aims to analyze mutational landscape of gynecologic cancers, especially with poor prognosis, by using this database.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed CGP datasets from 3,006 gynecologic cancer patients using FoundationOne&#174; CDx (F1CDx), the most commonly tested in Japan. This study was ethically approved by our institutional ethics committee (#2021341G) and the Information Utilization Review Board of C-CAT (#CDU2022-026N).<br \/>Results: Endometrial cancers (n=561) showed high rates of tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) (13.9%) and MSI-high (MSI-H) (10.8%), especially in endometrioid carcinomas. <i>POLE <\/i>exonuclease mutations were less frequent (1.4%) compared to TCGA data (7%), while <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations were more common (54.4% vs. 29% in TCGA), suggesting the impact of prognosis of the molecular subtypes. Other frequently mutated genes included <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (41%), <i>PTEN<\/i> (35%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (31%) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (26%). In 839 cervical cancers, TMB-H prevalence was 14.2%, with low MSI-H at 1.5%. TMB-H was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas (20.6%) than adenocarcinomas (8.3%). Frequent mutations included <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (32%), <i>STK11<\/i> (20%), <i>TP53<\/i> (20%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (14%), and <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (11%). <i>TP53<\/i> mutations were significantly higher than TCGA data (&#60;5%), particularly in mucinous carcinomas (60%), indicating a prevalence of HPV-independent tumors with poorer prognosis. Actionable mutations were generally more frequent in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas, including <i>KRAS <\/i>(32.2%), <i>TP53 <\/i>(29.4%), <i>CDKN2A <\/i>(18.3%), and <i>ERBB2 <\/i>(16.7%). In 1,606 ovarian cancers, the ratio of TMB-H was 5.0%, and MSI-H was 1.2%. TMB-H rates varied between 3.3-6.5% across histological types, while the ratio of MSI-H was significantly lower in serous carcinomas (0.3%) than non-serous carcinomas. Pathogenic mutations in the <i>POLE <\/i>exonuclease domain were rare in cervical (0.0%) and ovarian (0.2%) cancers.<br \/>Conclusion: The C-CAT database offers insights into the mutational landscape of various cancers and histological subtypes, especially those with poor prognosis, highlighting the unmet needs for drug development in these gynecologic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Tumor mutational burden,Microsatellite instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Compared to average-onset esophagogastric cancer (AOEGC), EOEGC are more likely to be genomically stable, have diffuse histology, and present with more advanced disease. Here, we utilized a large real-world data cohort to characterize EOEGC with molecular and immune signatures.<br \/>Methods: 5,175 esophagogastric cancer (EGC) samples (&#60;50 yrs, n=530; &#8805;50 yrs, n=4645) were tested by next generation sequencing (NGS) (592, NextSeq; WES, NovaSeq) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) (NovaSeq) (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). EGC patients with age &#60;50 and &#8805;50 were classified as EOEGC and AOEGC, respectively. Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)\/microsatellite-instability (MSI) was tested by IHC and NGS. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) totaled somatic mutations per tumor (high<u>&#62;<\/u>10 mt\/MB). Pathway enrichment determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Immune cell fractions were calculated by deconvolution of WTS: Quantiseq. Statistical significance was determined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons (q &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Results: EOEGC had higher frequency of <i>CDH1<\/i> (18.9% vs 6.5%) but lower frequency of <i>TP53<\/i> (65.9% vs 74.4%) mutations compared to AOEGC (all q&#60;0.05). EOEGC had higher frequency of <i>CCNE1<\/i> (6.8% vs 4.4%), <i>MYC<\/i> (6.1% vs 4.1%) and <i>FGFR2<\/i> (3.45% vs 1.87%) copy number alterations and <i>ARHGAP26<\/i> (5.67% vs 2.2%) fusion. EOEGC had lower frequency of TMB high (3.8 vs 10.1%) and dMMR\/MSI-H (1.3% vs 5.7%) (all p&#60;0.05). EOEGC had pathway enrichment of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (NES: 1.8, FDR: 0.0) and angiogenesis (NES: 1.3, FDR: 0.24). EOEGC had lower median MAPK pathway activity score (MPAS) (-0.16 vs 0.13, p&#60;0.05). Analysis of inferred immune cell infiltrates showed that EOEGC had increased infiltration of B cells (4.7% vs 3.9%) and M2 macrophages (3.6% vs 3%) but decreased infiltration of M1 macrophages (3.7% vs 4%) (all q&#60;0.05). EOEGC had increased T cell inflamed signature (31.3% vs 26.1%, p&#60;0.05) and increased expression of <i>HAVCR2<\/i> (<i>TIM3<\/i>) but decreased expression of <i>FOXP3<\/i> and <i>CD274<\/i> (PD-L1) (FC: 0.84-1.09, all p&#60;0.05). There was no difference in <i>LAG3<\/i>, <i>CTLA4<\/i>, and <i>IDO1<\/i> gene expression.<br \/>Conclusion: EOEGC has several unique molecular and tumor immune microenvironment features. In this real world cohort, EOEGC has increased frequency of <i>CDH1<\/i> mutations, <i>ARHGAP26<\/i> fusions, enrichment of EMT and angiogenesis pathways, decreased MAPK pathway activity, decreased frequency of TMB high and dMMR\/MSI-H, and a unique immune cell infiltrate with decreased M1 macrophages and increased M2 macrophages. These unique differential characteristics present therapeutic opportunities but also demonstrate the limitations of currently approved therapies in this subset of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Esophageal cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

We previously reported the results of screening the first ~53,000 individuals in the US with this test from real-world (RW) practice. Here, we report the RW experience with repeated MCED testing in ~5800 individuals.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This MCED test analyzes targeted methylation in cell-free DNA and uses machine learning to detect a Cancer Signal (CS) and determine its Cancer Signal Origin (CSO). We analyzed results returned through August 2023 for those with a &#8220;No Cancer Signal Detected&#8221; (NCSD) result in Year 1 and an additional consecutive test. We excluded tests from clinical studies and sites that limited data sharing. Systematic collection of outcomes was attempted for all cases with a &#8220;CS detected&#8221; (CSD) result and continues via a quality assurance (QA) program.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In this RW cohort, a second test was ordered in 5794 individuals (58% male, average age=61.3 y, range: 24.0-89.0 and 42% female, average age=60.5 y, range: 23.0-89.0). Median interval between blood draws was 12.9 months, and 81% (4693\/5794) were tested 10-18 months after the initial test. Among the 5794, 26 received a CSD result in the second test, of which 20 were within 10-18 months, corresponding to a CSD rate (CSDR) of 0.45% (95% CI 0.31%-0.66%; 26\/5794). The CSDR was slightly higher in males (0.50% [0.32%-0.81%; 17\/3367]) vs females (0.37% [0.2-0.7%; 9\/2427]) and was lower than the Year 1 CSDR of 0.95% (95% CI 0.87-1.0; 510\/53,744). The top CSOs reported during second tests were: Lymphoid, Head &#38; Neck, Bladder and Urothelial, Colon &#38; Rectum, Anus. Among the 26 CSD cases, the QA program confirmed 12 clinical outcomes (8 with a cancer diagnosis, 4 with no cancer diagnosis), and 14 cases are still under investigation or without outcomes at this time. Among 8 cases with a confirmed cancer diagnosis, accuracy of the 1st CSO prediction was 100%, and diagnoses reflected invasive cancers across multiple cancer types including anus, colon, head &#38; neck, urothelial tract, ovary, and lymphomas. Staging information was available in 5 cases, including 4 stage I cancers (4\/5, 80%; anus, head &#38; neck, lymphoma, bladder) and one stage IV cancer (ovary).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> A subset of individuals who returned for MCED testing had cancers detected, including cancers without recommended screening, underscoring the potential value of annual screening with this MCED test. There may be systematic differences in this limited population of individuals who returned for repeat screening, reducing the signal detection rate through potential early adopter bias. Clinical data return was incomplete, and confirmed 8 cancers, including 4 stage I cancers. All cancers were found at the predicted CSO, demonstrating the clinical utility of this unique test feature that directs diagnostic work up.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

Whether natural language processing (NLP) combined with multimodal integration across datasets can produce a mineable resource and improve discovery of relationships between tumor genomics and clinical phenotypes is unknown.<br \/>We hypothesized that NLP could automatically annotate a pan-cancer corpus of 82,464 patients with tumor genomic sequencing. To develop algorithms to annotate free-text reports, we leveraged the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC), a structured curation of EMR from five cancer types (non-small cell lung (NSCLC), breast, colorectal, prostate, and pancreatic cancer), to train and validate several Transformer and rule based-based NLP models. After automating the generation of NLP annotations alongside medication, demographic, tumor registry, survival, and tumor genomic sequencing data, we tested whether clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in the smaller BPC cohort might be discoverable in the larger cohort.<br \/>In 5-fold cross-validation, NLP Transformers accurately annotated the presence of cancer (AUC=0.99), cancer progression (AUC=0.97), and sites of disease (AUC=0.99) from radiology reports, and presence of prior outside treatment (AUC=0.98) and hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 receptor status (AUC=0.98, 0.98) from clinician notes. In addition, rule-based models, trained on non-BPC data and validated on the whole BPC cohort, annotated smoking status from clinician notes (ACC=0.95), and Gleason score (ACC=1.0), PD-L1 status (ACC=0.98), and mismatch repair deficiency (ACC=0.98) from histopathology reports. NLP annotations were merged with genomic and other structured clinical data to create a Clinicogenomic, Harmonized Oncologic Real-world Dataset (MSK-CHORD). Finally, we tested if associations not apparent in the BPC might be discoverable in MSK-CHORD. We found positive associations between Gleason score and gene-level alterations in prostate cancer including TP53, PTEN and BRCA2 (q&#60;0.1), none of which were adequately powered for detection in the BPC. We found PD-L1 status was associated with better survival following immunotherapy treatment in NSCLC, but only in the larger MSK-CHORD was this association statistically significant. In breast cancer, NF1 mutations were associated with prior therapy in both cohorts, but this association was only significant in MSK-CHORD.<br \/>The infrastructure generating MSK-CHORD uses a combination of on-premise and cloud computing resources and open-source development operation applications to automate processes. Once annotations are created, data is imported into a local instance of cBioPortal, where researchers can visualize data and perform analyses. The system generating MSK-CHORD demonstrates how large-scale data delivery and integration can fuel cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Databases,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.
