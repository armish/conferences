[{"Abstract":"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor, located in the brainstem, and traditionally thought to be immune-excluded with no significant infiltration by cytotoxic T-cells, and therefore not amenable to immunotherapies. Focused ultrasound technology (FUS) for drug delivery is being investigated for DIPG in both preclinical and clinical trial settings. In this study, we sought to study the effects of FUS and radiation therapy (RT) on immune cell infiltration in DIPG tumors to assess their ability to alter the immune microenvironment and potentially enhance combination immunotherapies. Specifically, we generated single-cell RNAseq profiles for 27,780 cells from syngeneic orthotopic DIPG tumors (KPAP cell line containing H3K27M mutation, ATRX and P53 loss, and PDGFRA overexpression) after 14 days of tumor growth across the following treatment arms: vehicle control, FUS, and RT (n=2 each group). FUS was applied by 4-point sonication around the tumor with a pressure of 0.6 Mpa at days 8 and 11 post tumor implantation (PTI). RT was administered in fractions of 3 Gy daily from days 8 to 11 PTI (12Gy total). We leveraged a set of algorithms for network-based inference of regulatory protein activity to infer a set of context-matched gene regulatory networks from which protein activity can be inferred by expression of downstream targets. By this approach, we identified distinct clusters of immune cells segregating by cell type as inferred by singleR and activity of known lineage markers. Strikingly, we found that both RT and FUS significantly depleted a TGFb-expressing population of immune-suppressive macrophages as compared to vehicle controls. Importantly, FUS only additionally increased T-cell infiltration into the tumor micro-environment over three-fold as compared to vehicle controls, which was not observed in response to RT. Further protein validation is underway. This has significant implications for therapeutic combinations of FUS-mediated drug delivery with immune checkpoint inhibitors in DIPG, such that in addition to drug delivery, FUS-mediated immune modulatory effects may provide more proinflammatory response to enhance immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Focused ultrasound,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq),Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

The aldolase family comprises three members, namely ALDOA, ALDOB, and brain-specific ALDOC. Low-grade gliomas and glioblastoma (GBM) are characterized by shared genetic events, including chromosome 1p\/19q codeletion, EGFR amplification, and ATRX loss of function, in which ALDOC plays a role. Additionally, ALDOC is responsive to IDH1 mutations. If patients display IDH1 mutations, it is expected that ALDOC performance will be relatively higher. This finding suggests a more favorable prognosis. The ALDOC promoter region's function is impeded by hypermethylation, which declines as glioma progresses. The regulatory mechanisms and implications remain unclear. We established a multi-omics profile and identified several crucial mechanisms activated upon the loss of ALDOC expression. Among these mechanisms, we found HMGB1 to have a key role in linking the immune response, tumor microenvironment, and epigenetic modifications. We compared the proteomic and secretomic platforms in an ALDOC overexpression\/knockdown model, which showed abundant HMGB1 expression following ALDOC inhibition. Importantly, there is an inverse correlation between ALDOC expression and HMGB1 protein levels. Additionally, our findings reveal that upregulation of ALDOC promotes its translocation to the nucleus, thereby enhancing its binding affinity with HMGB1. This, in turn, enables extracellular release of HMGB1 in GBM, which triggers signaling via receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and several cytokines. Moreover, HMGB1 remodels the immune microenvironment and upregulates multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H3, and MHCs. Not all GBM models exhibited significant effects when combined with immune checkpoint blockade using HMGB1 blockade. However, ALDOC knockout mice demonstrated poorer survival and treatment efficacy, suggesting that ALDOC may be crucial for a personalized immunotherapy strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,IDH1,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.-F.

Previous studies have suggested that BPM 31510 induces ROS through high intra-cellular levels of ubidecarenone in aggressive cancer phenotypes both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> through induction of mitochondrial ROS. Furthermore, we have previously observed efficacy of BPM 31510 in a highly aggressive <i>in vivo<\/i> orthotopic rat C6 glioma model where BPM 31510 was administered in combination with radiotherapy. In a pancreatic xenograft mouse model, we previously reported that BPM 31510 impacted the immune cells in the TME by increasing absolute number of infiltrated CD8+ T-cells and decreasing absolute number of infiltrated CD4+ T-cells. Moreover, an <i>ex vivo<\/i> study of PBMC&#8217;s from healthy volunteers suggests that BPM 31510 increases T-cell viability and function while also decreasing T-cell exhaustion. Currently, an ongoing first-line phase 2b study of BPM 31510 in glioblastoma in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide will assess the clinical efficacy and potential for mechanistic synergy of multiple ROS-inducing mitochondrial mediated regimens on this aggressive cancer phenotype. BPM 31510 will be assessed in this study to provide further evidence for the impact of ROS on immunomodulation. Taken together, BPM 31510 increases mitochondrial ROS\/OXPHOS in cancer cells while impacting TME-related immune cell modulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Reactive oxygen species,Cancer therapy,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

A promising novel immunotherapy consists of autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with autologous tumor antigens (ATA) from a lysate of irradiated self-renewing autologous cancer cells. An open-label, phase 2 trial was conducted in 57 patients with primary GBM. Here we report correlations between survival and DC-ATA doses. Two autologous intermediate products were manufactured for each patient: a tumor cell line established from resected GBM, and DC differentiated from cryopreserved peripheral blood monocytes (MC). Patients were enrolled prior to standard radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. DC-ATA were manufactured during RT\/TMZ, divided into individual doses, then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. For each patient-specific vaccine batch, cell numbers were calculated using a hemocytometer; viability was determined before cryopreservation (cryo) using trypan blue and post-cryo using 7ADD per flow cytometry. After RT\/TMZ, up to 8 doses were injected s.c. concurrent with TMZ over 6 months. Patients were grouped into tertiles based on DC-ATA cell numbers and survival. Prism 10.03 was used to generate survival curves and calculate correlation coefficients and log-rank and T-Test comparisons. As previously reported, cell line success rate was 71\/73, sufficient MC numbers were collected by leukapheresis for 63\/65; DC-ATA was successfully manufactured for 60\/60; 57 patients were treated; median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10.4 and 16.0 months respectively. Correlations were strong between total and viable DC-ATA pre-cryo (0.97, p&#60;0.0001) and post-cryo (0.95, p&#60;0.0001), but weaker between DC-ATA pre- and post-cryo (0.30, p=0.02), and between viable DC-ATA pre- and post-cryo (0.37, p=0.004). When patients were grouped by OS tertiles, medians were 9.8, 18.1, and more than 36 months. There were no differences in the average millions (M) of DC-ATA pre-cryo (10.0, 9.7, 9.6), viable DC-ATA pre-cryo (8.5, 7.8, 7.9), DC-ATA post-cryo (9.0, 10.3, 10.8) or viable DC-ATA post-cryo (6.0, 7.3, 7.4). Similarly, when patients were grouped into tertiles by DC-ATA numbers, there were no differences in OS curves associated with DC-ATA pre-cryo, viable DC-ATA pre-cryo, DC-ATA post-cryo, or viable DC-ATA post-cryo. Pre-cryo viable DC-ATA numbers ranged from 0.27 to 27.0 M. An ineffective dose was not identified; pre-cryo viable DC-ATA doses of less than 2M were associated with OS of 10.4, 13.0, 13.3, and 36.4+ months. Also, there was no OS difference by number of MC used to manufacture DC or by number of DC manufactured. In conclusion, there was no evidence for a dose\/response relationship between DC-ATA dose and OS for any of the parameters tested. This data supports that pre-cryo cell counts can be used to establish treatment doses. Pre-cryo viable cell counts of 2M DC-ATA per dose seem sufficient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Vaccines,Glioblastoma,Dendritic Cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

While immune checkpoint blockade leads to significant benefits in the treatment of TNBC when in combination with chemotherapy, recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance still remain major challenges. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor (CSF-1Ri) to shift the phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in murine models of TNBC, and the potential benefit of such in enhancing standard of care chemotherapy. We focused on targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as they are the most abundant immune infiltrate in the TNBC TME and are associated with worsening overall survival (OS) and metastasis free survival (MFS). Targeting TAMs, specifically M2-like TAMs, has been shown to inhibit tumor progression and improve OS in the clinic. We selected pexidartinib (PLX) as the CSF-1Ri of choice, given its translational potential (FDA approved) and gemcitabine (GEM) as chemotherapy, given its ability to target myeloid derived suppressor cells and M2-like TAMs. For primary TNBC we employed 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells transfected with luciferase reporter gene in BALB\/c mice as an immunocompetent model. Mice were injected with 100,000 cells in the 4<sup>th<\/sup> mammary fat pad, and tumors established over the course of fifteen days. Mice were then exposed to daily administrations of PLX (8 mg\/kg), and weekly administrations of GEM (60 mg\/kg). Tumor volumes were recorded every other day. The TME was analyzed with flow cytometry (FC), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF). For the metastatic model, mice were inoculated with 100,000 4T1-luc cells in the flank. On day six, mice were exposed to treatments as outlined above. Mice underwent survival surgery to remove the primary tumor on day thirteen and were then treated with adjuvant therapy. Metastasis and OS were tracked.<br \/>FC analysis indicated only combination therapy (11.8% &#177; 2.1) significantly decreased total TAMs compared to vehicle (22% &#177; 2) in the primary tumor. Combination therapy also showed the greatest depletion of M2-like TAMs (2.2% &#177; 0.6), with a significant decrease compared to both vehicle (15.6% &#177; 0.4) and GEM (6.6% &#177; 0.9). This TME modulation was confirmed using IHC and mIF. After four cycles of treatment, combination therapy (232.9 mm<sup>3<\/sup> &#177; 130.8) had a significant effect on tumor burden compared to GEM alone (369.7 mm<sup>3<\/sup> &#177; 165.8), indicating a correlation between tumor phenotype and therapeutic benefit. Furthermore, combination therapy led to the greatest prolongation of MFS and OS in the resection model, indicating that combination therapy has efficacy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. In conclusion, targeting TAMs in TNBC primes the tumor for combination with chemotherapy in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor microenvironment,Tumor associated macrophages,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Unfortunately, many patients with breast cancer are thought to be intrinsically resistant. One potential mechanism of resistance is a myeloid suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting myeloid suppression is under investigation as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumors to ICI. In our trial, NCI-9844, we demonstrated that the combination of the epigenetic modulator, entinostat with ICIs&#8212;nivolumab (anti-PD-1) + ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), leads to a 25% objective response rate in patients with advanced breast cancer. Work in our preclinical models showed entinostat decreases suppressive function by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We hypothesized that entinostat decreases intra-tumoral MDSC suppression via the STAT3\/AP-1 axis and drives cellular shifts within the TME to improve response to ICI. Here, we examined expression of upstream, downstream, and interacting factors within the STAT3 pathway in MDSCs treated with entinostat. Macro-dissected lung metastases from entinostat treated NeuN mice revealed differential gene expression of AP-1 subunits JunB and FOSL1 in MDSCs identified by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Western blot of isolated intratumoral MDSCs from lung metastases revealed decreased STAT3 phosphorylation upon entinostat treatment. In an entinostat treated MDSC-like cell line, J774M, JunB phosphorylation and FOSL1 were both decreased. scRNAseq also revealed decreased gene expression of STAT3 upstream receptors IL4RA and IFNGR1 and increased expression of STAT3 negative regulator SOCS3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is planned to further narrow the molecular mechanism of action. Cell-cell communication analysis of scRNAseq data was performed to evaluate the contribution of entinostat treated macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells on MDSC function. We observed increased frequency of DC populations (classic DC2s and Ccr7 DCs). Following combined treatment with entinostat + ICIs, we also found increased DC to T cell signaling strength for receptor-ligand pairs involved in T cell activation, including Tnfsf9__Tnfrsf9, Cd70_Cd27, H2-dmb2_Cd4, and Cd80_Cd28. Analysis of macrophage-T cell interactions revealed a synergistic decrease in signaling associated with immunosuppression after combined treatment, such as Cd80_Ctla4, Tnf_Tnfrsf1b, and Entpd1_Adora2a. Suppressive function of treated sub-populations of macrophages is planned to determine functional effect of findings. Finally, we are using imaging mass cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing to evaluate proposed mechanisms in patient specimens (NCI-9844). The goal of this work is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving myeloid suppression of the TME thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Breast cancer,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Myeloid immune suppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

However, the response rate to ICB therapy remains low (below 20%). This limited response rate can be attributed to the considerable heterogeneity observed in HCC cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent research has highlighted the pivotal role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in orchestrating various components within the TME of HCC. Although the significance of lipid metabolism-associated CAFs in the efficacy of ICB therapy has been demonstrated in HCC murine models [1], the functions and contributions of other CAF subtypes remain largely unknown. Therefore, identifying CAF heterogeneity could advance our comprehension of HCC TME and potentially augment ICB efficacy.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on tumor biopsy specimens obtained from patients with advanced HBV-related HCC who had participated in a pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) phase II clinical trial (NCT03419481). Our objective was to examine the dynamic alterations in the HCC TME before and during anti-PD1 treatment (upon 2-cycle). We utilized the Seurat and Cellchat packages for bioinformatics analysis which enabled us to investigate the associations between changes in the proportions of CAF subtypes and the patients' clinical responses, as well as the potential cell-cell interactions involving CAF and other TME components.<br \/>Results: We identified four CAF subtypes within the TME: cycling, inflammatory, matrix, and vascular CAFs in our anti-PD1 HCC patient cohort. Among the anti-PD1 non-responders, there was a significant increase in the proportions of cycling CAFs (cCAFs) and matrix CAFs (matCAFs) compared to the responders. Notably, matCAFs exhibited a high enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) Terms related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), whose higher proportion correlated with poor prognosis of patients. Moreover, a distinct collagen pathway signal was found between matCAFs and two immunosuppressive cell types, namely regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages in the non-responders.<br \/>Discussion and Conclusion: The presence of matCAFs within the HCC tumor may associate with the development of an immunosuppressive TME and unfavorable prognosis for patients. Targeting this specific CAF subtype holds promise as a potential strategy to overcome resistance to ICB therapy.<br \/>Acknowledgments: The CUHK Strategic Seed Funding for Collaborative Research Scheme and The Li Ka Shing Foundation.<br \/>References: 1.

Recent reports have suggested a rise in the incidence of CCA globally. Current treatments for CCA have limited effectiveness, with only 20-30% response rates in patients with advanced cancer. Thus, there is a growing need to investigate new therapeutic targets for CCA. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a potential target for novel therapies. The TME plays an important role in progression and metastasis of cancer through facilitating immune escape. Recent studies have demonstrated potential roles for heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in tumorigenesis. Sulfatase 2 (SULF2) is a heparan sulfate editing sulfatase that removes the 6-O sulfate moiety within the heparan sulfate (HS) chains and alters the affinity of HS chains for growth factors and cytokines and their receptors, thus modulating HSPG function in cell signaling pathways. HSPG specific sulfatases have been recently identified as a potential therapeutic target in CCA. We aimed to assess the effects of anti-Sulfatase-2 antibody on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of syngeneic CCA xenografts in C57BL6 mice. Mice bearing syngeneic CCA xenografts were treated with an anti-sulf2 antibody, and the tumors compared to untreated control xenografts. After treatment, the tumors were harvested and analyzed by Cytometry by time of flight (Cytof) to identify changes in the types and numbers of immune cells in the tumor xenografts. Treatment with anti-sulf2 antibody resulted in a decrease in immunosuppressive cells such as tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) compared to the control. There was also an increase in anti-tumor cells such as T-cells and NK cells, suggesting that suppressing sulf-2 in the microenvironment can shift the TME toward an anti-tumorigenic rather than a pro-tumorigenic environment. In summary, our work demonstrates the potential to target Sulfatase 2 as a therapeutic mechanism for immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment. Future experiments to determine the relationship between specific clinical phenotypes and the number, activities and types of immune cells seen in the TME, and experiments in other hepatobiliary cancers models, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and gallbladder cancer, will be conducted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Sulfatases,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

This includes endometrial (~45%), bladder (~20%), and gastric (~15%). ARID1A mutations usually lead to a loss of protein expression or function, which results in tumor progression. The loss of ARID1A has been linked to genomic instability, potentially making the tumor more immunogenic\/ amenable to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, there is a discrepancy between clinical and mechanistic studies in determining the consequence of ARID1A-loss on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME): clinical studies have shown that ARID1A mutation is a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy success, whereas another mechanistic study found that ARID1A-loss results in a cold TIME that is less amenable to immunotherapy. Considering this controversy, our overarching objective is to use multiple high-dimensional microscopy-based techniques to robustly and comprehensively characterize the TIME sculpted by ARID1A-loss. We study this in the context of gastric cancer, a disease which has heterogenous responses to PD-1 based immunotherapy and also shows frequent (10-25%) mutations in ARID1A. We looked at two retrospective cohorts with 250 patients each, one from UK (Leeds) and one from Japan (KCCH). To ascertain ARID1A-loss in these patients, we have set up an IHC-based assay comparing ARID1A expression between tumor and stroma regions. From this, we derive a ratio. In both studies, we were able to clearly stratify the cohort into ARID1A-loss and ARID1A-wildtype. Leeds had about 23 cases (10%) of ARID1A-loss, while KCCH had 39 cases (17.9%). Looking at the clinical parameters, we realized that ARID1A-loss does not stratify for survival nor staging of the tumor, which is also seen in ARID1A-mutation studies. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC), we saw differences in the immune cell population. ARID1A-loss patients seem to have a greater proportion of CD3+ cells in the Leeds (1423 vs 666 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p = 0.0269) and KCCH cohorts (1457 vs 1268 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p = 0.1745). Interestingly, CD68+ cells also show an increase in the ARID1A-loss population in the Leeds (802.1 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup> vs 580.3 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p = 0.0649) and KCCH cohorts (659 vs 623.2 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>). However, CD20+ cells show no changes in abundance for either cohort (249.1 vs 193.2 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p = 0.4985; and 361.6 vs 357.5 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p = 0.9634) respectively. Overall, there seems to be an increase in the T-cell population in ARID1A-loss tumors and an increase in the macrophage population in stroma regions of ARID1A-loss tumors. The B-cell population remains unchanged. To complement our preliminary findings, we will leverage hyperplex and spatial transcriptome techniques to uncover the interactions between tumor cells and the TIME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ARID1A,Tumor suppressor gene,Microenvironment,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Norbert Sheng Cong Tay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Fen Peng<sup>1<\/sup>, Heike Grabsch<sup>2<\/sup>, Anand  D.

Our previous data demonstrated that fucosyltransferase 5 (FUT5), a glycosyltransferase responsible for the terminal step in synthesizing Lewis antigens, may contribute to peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer. In this study, using clinical samples of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common subtype, we found that high expression of FUT5 is associated with a worse outcome. By employing multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine T cell subsets, we found a significant decrease in CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>-<\/sup>CD8<sup>-<\/sup> (double negative, DN) T cells in FUT5<sup>high <\/sup>(n=10) compared to FUT5<sup>low<\/sup> samples (n=10), while there is no difference in the abundance of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T cells, CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>helper T cells or CD4<sup>+<\/sup>Foxp3<sup>+<\/sup> regulatory T cells. Tumor-infiltrating DN T cells has been shown to mediate potent anti-tumor response. In addition to their cytotoxic capabilities, DN T cells largely exhibit modulatory functions on other T cell subsets. To further investigate, we performed additional IHC staining and observed a significant increase in proliferating (Ki67<sup>+<\/sup>) CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tissue resident memory cells, which are known to be important for cancer immunity. In addition, we observed a decrease in metastases in the FUT5 knockdown group, accompanied by an increase in DN T cells in ascites and omental metastatic tumors in humanised mice, as revealed by flow cytometry, confirming a direct immunomodulatory role of FUT5. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of FUT5 in promoting immune evasion by suppressing anti-tumor DN T cells, which could provide novel insights for immunotherapy in HGSOC, which has a low response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (This research is supported by RGC SRFS2223-7S05, HMRF 08192286 and LSCCB under the Health@InnoHK Program launched by ITC, HKSAR).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Ovarian cancer,Immunomodulation,Double negative T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The lack of effective screening strategies and the typically late stage of detection are contributors to a considerable annual death toll of HNSCC. Additionally, the anatomical proximity of the malignancy to delicate structures of the head and neck leads to tremendous treatment-related morbidity. Therefore, there is great interest in developing life-saving therapies and strategies for treatment de-escalation. The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (&#945;PD-1) has been approved for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and as a frontline therapy for unresectable disease. However, only about a quarter of patients respond to &#945;PD-1 therapy. The immunosuppressive effect of TGF&#946; has been widely described as relevant to the HNSCC tumor microenvironment. However, attempts to blockade TGF&#946; have failed mainly due to the widespread side effects of disrupting a highly promiscuous cytokine. Integrin &#945;v&#946;6 is a major activator of the inert latent TGF&#946; into the active, immunosuppressive form. With its high relative specificity to HNSCC tissue, inhibition of &#945;v&#946;6 could offer a safer approach for disrupting TGF&#946; to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. After screening &#593;v&#946;6 expression levels of HNSCC cell lines via flow cytometry, cell lines FaDu and CAL27 were selected for further investigation due to high endogenous ITGB6 expression (FaDu 35.57% cells ITGB6+, CAL27 95.69% cells ITGB6+). The cell lines were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of &#945;v&#946;6 using a lentiviral system. Both knockdown and control shRNA cell lines were pretreated with 1 &#956;g\/mL of doxycycline for five days to induce the shRNA and subsequently co-cultured with TALL-104 T-cells. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy of the co-culture revealed that the knockdown of &#945;v&#946;6 substantially increased T-cell killing over 24hrs (FaDu CTRL shRNA 6.72%&#177;2.49 dead vs. FaDu ITGB6 shRNA 12.80%&#177;3.16 dead, p&#60;0.001). However, treatment of FaDu and CAL27 cell lines with active-TGF&#946; showed no change in PD-L1 expression via flow cytometric analysis. To determine whether the T cell evasive effect of &#945;v&#946;6 is driven by other immune checkpoints on the cancer cells or by the direct effect that TGF&#946; has on immune cells, we show the generation of relevant mouse &#945;v&#946;6 shRNA knockdown cells. These syngeneic in vivo studies will facilitate cytokine profiling to uncover the dynamics of tumor-immune cell interactions in response to &#945;v&#946;6 inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,TGF-&#946;,T cell,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>William  J.

Experimental evidence from murine models suggests that STK11 loss contributes to lineage plasticity, while clinical observations indicate its impact on differentiation phenotypes in patients. However, the intricate interplay between differentiation states, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and clinical outcomes remains poorly elucidated. This study aims to comprehensively characterize these interactions to enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics underlying STK11-deficient NSCLC pathogenesis and therapeutic responses.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> By leveraging large multi-omics datasets, we already demonstrated the low immune infiltration in TTF1-low and neuroendocrine MLDD subsets of LKB1-deficient tumors. In this study, we used GEMM-derived two KPL (Kras, TP53, and STK11 mutations) and one KPL-restored line to inject subcutaneously in F1 hybrid mice of B6 and Sv129 backgrounds.

Our comprehensive analysis, combining flow cytometry and Nanostring techniques, revealed that STK11 mutant lines displayed notably low infiltration of CD8+ T-cells, an elevated proportion of exhausted T-cells, and a manifestation of the TTF1-low immune phenotype characterized by high myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increased KLRC1\/KLRC2 expression. The presence of MDSCs in the STK11 mutant line correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines but exhibited an inverse correlation with MHC-2 expression. MHC-2 expression was inversely correlated with CD8+ T-cell percentage and positively correlated with na&#239;ve T-cell percentage.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The data obtained from the study indicates that the MDSC phenotype seems to be important for immune evasion in STK11-loss tumors.

The Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 1 (TREM1) is recognized for its role in amplifying inflammatory responses, yet its specific pro-tumorigenic mechanisms have remained elusive. This study employs Trem1-deficient mice and a novel inhibitor, VJDT, to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting TREM1 in cancer. Both genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibiton of Trem1 led to remarkable reductions in tumor growth in mouse models of melanoma (B16F10) and fibrosarcoma (MCA205). In-depth analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled that TREM1 deficiency resulted in a decrease in the frequency and suppressive capabilities of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment, concomitant with an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and enhanced T cell activation. Furthermore, TREM1 inhibition not only curtailed tumor growth but also potentiated the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 therapy, primarily by mitigating MDSC frequency and reversing T cell exhaustion. Notably, in melanoma xenografts from patient samples, pharmacological TREM1 inhibition via VJDT treatment significantly downregulated critical oncogenic pathways linked to cell proliferation, migration, and survival. This research underscores the pivotal role of TREM1, expressed both within cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, in driving cancer progression. Consequently, targeting TREM1 for therapeutic intervention holds promise for reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor milieu and augmenting the success of immune checkpoint therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Among those is the greater understanding of immune system components within the TME as mediators of tumor growth control. NR2F6 is an orphan nuclear receptor, which was shown to serve as an immune intrinsic checkpoint component and has been suggested to elicit tumor-intrinsic suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Correspondingly, genetic depletion of NR2F6 in CD8 T cells abrogates the immune-activating cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IFNg). In addition, genetic ablation of NR2F6 in melanoma cells activates CD8 T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity partly by suppressing the expression of tumor-intrinsic immune repressors NACC1 and FKBP10. Notably, combined genetic ablation of tumor cells (NR2F6 KO melanoma) and stroma cells (NR2F6 KO mouse) resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of tumor growth compared with ablation of either tumor cells or TME. The latter provides the foundation for screening NR2F6 inhibitors, which are expected to have a strong systemic (tumor inhibition and immune cell activation) effect on tumor growth. Interestingly, single-cell transcriptomic data from human tumors identified high expression of NR2F6 in stroma cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and tumor-associated endothelial cells (TAEs). Consistent with these, scRNAseq analysis of mouse melanoma revealed higher expression of NR2F6 in SMA+ immune suppressive myo-CAFs than in immune activating CAFs. Studies that directly reveal the role of stromal NR2F6 in anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth and the state of NR2F6 inhibitors will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Tumor microenvironment,Stroma,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

AMG 510 also exhibited promising anticancer activity in human PDAC, with 21% response rate and over 70% patients experiencing certain level of tumor control. However, targeting KRAS oncogenes faces the major challenge of therapy resistance, which severely limited its survival benefit. While multiple studies have elucidated potential resistance mechanisms to G12Ci in lung cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance in PDAC remains elusive. Here, using KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-driven mouse PDAC model, we found that similar to the clinical observation, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors exhibit only partial response to AMG 510 treatment.

Interestingly, we discovered that the expression of CD24, which was recently identified as a new &#8216;do not eat me&#8217; signal, is significantly upregulated on the surface of persist tumor cells after G12Ci treatment which suppresses the function of anti-tumor macrophages. Anti-CD24 blocking mAb enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in vitro and significantly sensitizes KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors to AMG 510 treatment in vivo in a macrophage-dependent manner.

Understanding the composition and function of myeloid cells within the PDAC microenvironment may help identify promising targets for PDAC immunotherapy. Tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) contribute to organogenesis and tissue regeneration and metabolism. In this study, we discovered a distinct population of pancreas TRMs that highly express lymphatic vessel hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1). Single cell RNAseq data reveal that LYVE-1+ TRM cluster in the pancreas expresses high levels of complement activation genes and transcription factors such as c-Maf and Stab1. RNAseq data also confirm that LYVE-1+ TRMs express enriched genes related to mannose binding, endocytosis, and glutathione metabolic process, while LYVE-1 negative macrophages express enriched genes related to antigen processing and presentation, T cell activation, and phagocytosis. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis demonstrates that LYVE-1+ TRMs express M2-like markers, including increased CD163, CD206 and decreased MHC Class II molecule. During PDAC development and progression, LYVE-1+ TRMs expand and localize around the tumor border, promoting fibrotic stroma formation. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) also reveals abundant infiltration of LYVE-1+CD14+CD68+ macrophages in human PDAC tumors and colocalized with collagen deposition. This subset of macrophages also highly express c-Maf. Through the use of Lys-Cre-c-Maf <sup>f\/f<\/sup> mice, we demonstrate that depletion of c-Maf from myeloid cells significantly reduces LYVE-1+ TRMs and polarizes them to resemble an M1-like phenotype. In conclusion, our findings suggest that LYVE-1+ macrophages are a unique subset of myeloid cells within the pancreas and likely play a critical role in PDAC progression and immunotherapeutic resistance. Future work will focus on targeting LYVE1+ TRMs using various approaches, such as conditional knockout mice and small molecule inhibitors, to determine their therapeutic potential for PDAC treatment.<br \/>Presented by Dr. Hong Li","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Immunotherapy, specifically anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody, proves ineffective for pancreatic cancer patients due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). STING agonist has emerged as the most effective immune modulator to regulate immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy across many different cancer types. However, two challenges hinder the use of STING agonist in pancreatic cancer: (A) STING agonist strongly stimulates induction of B regulatory cells (Bregs) in pancreatic tumor and lymph node, leading to an intrinsic resistance to STING agonist and a severe compromised efficacy. (B) Most STING agonists are used by local intra-tumor injection in clinical trials, which only shrinks the local tumors without inhibiting distal tumors or metastasis, whereas it is also not feasible for intra-tumor injection for pancreatic cancer in clinical trials. In response, we developed a first-in-class dual functional drug (SH-273) to overcome STING resistance by eliminating Bregs in both tumors and lymph nodes for long-term efficacy in pancreatic cancer. SH-273 has dual function to stimulates STING function (EC50 100 nM) and inhibits PI3K&#947; (IC50 7 nM) that eliminate Bregs to overcome STING resistance. Interestingly, SH-273 achieved dual function with an opposite mechanism in regulating IRF3 phosphorylation in myeloid cells (increase) vs. in Bregs (decrease). In addition, we developed an albumin nanoparticle of SH-273 (Nano-273) for systemic delivery to enhance drug targeting to tumor and lymph node to activate systemic anticancer immunity. 3D imaging results indicated that albumin nano formulation greatly enhanced drug lymphoid draining and pancreatic tumor penetrating. Nano-273, combined with anti-PD-1, achieved long-term median survival of 200 days in LSL-KrasG12D; LSL-Trp53R172H\/+; Pdx1cre\/+ (KPC) mice (a substantial 67% increase from 120 days without treatment). The 80-day survival extension is significant as KPC mice mimic human pancreatic cancers with Kras\/P53 mutations that are unresponsive to other available therapies. Single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that Nano-273, combined with anti-PD-1, reduces Bregs by 5 to 7-fold while increasing other B cell subtypes by 4-fold in both pancreatic tumors and lymph nodes, compared to control group or group treated with STING agonist alone. These findings suggest that Nano-273 overcomes STING resistance by eliminating Bregs and induced systemic immunity to achieve long-term anti-tumor efficacy in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,B cells,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Despite encouraging efficacy in some patients, the development of primary and acquired resistance and severe toxicity associated with these treatment regimens, together with the overall low response rates, have limited their widespread use. Mining publicly available transcriptomic datasets, we have demonstrated that the response to ICB in patients with melanoma is influenced by the functionality of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, it is of significance that we have demonstrated that 17-&#946; estradiol (E2), working through myeloid cell intrinsic estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;), promotes tumor growth in preclinical mouse models by polarizing tumor associated macrophages towards an immune-suppressive state in a manner that suppresses CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cell functionality and limits ICB efficacy independent of gender. Transcriptomic analysis of tumor infiltrating myeloid cells isolated from E2-treated syngeneic tumors revealed that the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway was suppressed and that this activity could be reversed by the addition of fulvestrant a Selective Estrogen Receptor Downregulator. The importance of type I IFN signaling in E2-regulated tumor growth was confirmed in syngeneic mouse tumor models (B16F10-melanoma and LLC1-NSCLC cells) by showing that inhibiting type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) activity using blocking antibodies reversed the protective effects of E2 deprivation (ovariectomy) on tumor growth. Further, using <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures of macrophages from mouse bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from deidentified human donors, we demonstrated that E2-dependent inhibition of type I IFN signaling could be attributed to increased efferocytosis by myeloid cells. These findings were recapitulated <i>in vivo<\/i> using an IFN reporter mouse (<i>Mx1-egfp<\/i>) implanted with labelled tumor cells (mCherry-Spectrin labelled LLC1), where we demonstrated that E2 mediated-suppression of myeloid cell intrinsic interferon signaling within the tumor microenvironment is contingent upon their engulfment of apoptotic cancer cells. Mechanistically, this enhanced efferocytosis was attributed to increased expression of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) in E2-treated myeloid cells- as either genetic or pharmacological depletion of CX3CR1 in mouse reversed E2-mediated tumor growth (B16F10 and LLC1), myeloid cell polarization (from immunosuppressive to proinflammatory), myeloid cell intrinsic type I IFN signaling and reinvigorated CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cell function. Taken together, our results highlight the potential clinical utility of targeting the E2\/ER-CX3CR1 pathway as a means to enhance response to ICBs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor associated macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Many cytokines, especially the immunomodulatory Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) superfamily members, exist as both membrane and soluble proteins. Trimeric members of the TNF superfamily are known to be susceptible to protease cleavage resulting in their release from the membrane. Membrane and soluble versions of the immunomodulators may have different activity. Several studies have shown that membrane expressed TNFSF members more efficiently cross-link TNFSF receptors resulting in a stronger activation or inhibition signal. Moreover, the activity of membrane expressed proteins is confined to the cells that express the protein and the cells that interact with the protein expressing cell. Thus, directing the expression of immunostimulatory proteins to the membrane could be a transformative way to enhance the activity while mitigating the toxicity by limiting systemic exposure. In this study we utilized Nutcracker Therapeutics Inc. unique mRNA platform to develop a membrane stabilized version of tumor necrosis factor super family member 14, also known as LIGHT, with superior co-stimulatory activity and stability. LIGHT is an immunomodulatory cytokine that primarily acts on lymphocytes and innate immune cells through the cis or trans binding of HVEM or lymphotoxin beta receptor (LtbR). LIGHT has been implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases and is currently being evaluated in the development of immunotherapies against cancer. LIGHT stimulatory activity depends on the displacement of the inhibitory BTLA that is normally bound to HVEM and LtbR. Studies have shown that membrane bound LIGHT, but not soluble LIGHT, can effectively displace BTLA. In this study, we hypothesized that the advantageous activities of mRNA derived membrane expressed LIGHT could be further enhanced with an engineered LIGHT molecule that is less susceptible to membrane shedding. We made multiple variants of Engineered LIGHT where different regions of the putative protease sensitive sites were replaced with either a flexible or rigid linker. In short, we found that i) the soluble version of LIGHT can inhibit immune stimulatory capability of membrane expressed LIGHT; ii) membrane bound LIGHT enhances co-stimulation of antigen-specific T cells; iii) engineered LIGHT enhances membrane expression and increases stability; and iv) a design using a novel rigid linker to replace the putative protease sensitive region of LIGHT showed best overall activity. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our integrated platform to design and deliver an enhanced, membrane stabilized LIGHT molecule. This engineered transmembrane molecule represents a new class of drug uniquely enabled by nanoparticle delivered mRNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mRNA,Immuno-oncology,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

On the contrary, Tregs infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) impede effective anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting tumor-specific T cell responses and generating a suppressive TME, thus promoting tumor progression. Clinically, Tregs have been proven to play a significant role in resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) leading to lower response rates. Hence, targeting Tregs would lead to activation of tumor-specific effector T cells and improved long-term anti-tumor immune responses with ICI treatment. CCR4, a chemokine receptor highly expressed on Tregs, spearhead the migration of Tregs and their accumulation in the TME, by responding to the chemokines CCL22 and CCL17 secreted by the inflamed cells in the tumor. CCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in various solid tumors. This warrants the therapeutic targeting of CCR4-expressing Tregs to enable effective and durable anti-tumor immune responses. We sought to discover and develop novel small molecule antagonists of CCR4 for use in cancer therapy. Multiple series of CCR4 antagonists were identified by iterative medicinal chemistry efforts and SAR based approach. These compounds were optimized towards attaining required potency, acceptable physicochemical properties, high selectivity and desirable pharmacokinetic profile to achieve anti-tumor activity. Aurigene&#8217;s CCR4 antagonists exhibited potent inhibition of CCR4 activity in the reporter-based &#946;-arrestin recruitment assay. This translated well into potent inhibition of CCL22-mediated chemotaxis of CCR4-expressing Tregs in an <i>in vitro<\/i> cell migration assay. Furthemore, the lead compounds showed desirable drug-like properties and excellent pharmacokinetic exposure in rodents. In an ongoing study in a syngeneic mice tumor model, one of the lead compounds is being evaluated for impact on Treg infiltration, CD8:Treg ratio in the tumor and efficacy. In summary, we have identified novel CCR4 antagonists with desirable drug-like properties that are being evaluated further to identify a clinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokine receptor,Regulatory T cells,Tumor microenvironment,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Rashmi Nair<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chandrasekhar Abbineni<sup><\/sup>, Krishna Chaitanya Talluri<sup><\/sup>, Amit A Dhudashiya<sup><\/sup>, Aravind AB<sup><\/sup>, Naveen Kumar R<sup><\/sup>, Ramya R<sup><\/sup>,  D.

Thus, many immunooncology therapies are being developed to modulate the macrophage differentiation program towards the anti-tumor M1 subset, while hindering the M2 subset associated with tumor progression. Monocyte-derived macrophages comprise a crucial in vitro cellular tool to evaluate the plasticity potential between the different polarization states. Several hurdles like their in vitro adherence, low cell number yield and the donor-to-donor variability pose technical challenges when using in vitro differentiated macrophages for compound screening and titration or functional assays.<br \/>At Reaction Biology we have established human macrophage assay pipelines to evaluate the novel macrophage polarization compounds in vitro. By isolating monocytes from frozen PBMC stocks it is possible to have access to the same donor or group of donors PBMC for repetitive analysis. We have developed a differentiation protocol that allows us to use different plate format from 6-well to 48 well plates, and thus increase and modulate the throughput according to the required readout.<br \/>The effect of therapeutic compounds can be analyzed by flow cytometry. Our data shows that human primary monocytes grown under M1 polarizing conditions express high levels of CD86 and CD80 in contrast to those cultivated under M2 polarizing conditions, with high expression of CD163, CD206, and CD209. Cell culture supernatant can be used to determine cytokine secretion. The functionality of the different macrophage subtypes can be further investigated using a pH-sensitive phagocytosis tracker, like pHRodo-Zymosan or pHRodo-Ecoli, which shows differential uptake according to differentiation profile. Moreover, treated macrophages can be used in coculture with T cells to investigate their capability to foster or inhibit an immune response.<br \/>Our data shows the value of monocyte-derived macrophage assays in the evaluation and efficacy assessment of TME modulators.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Monocyte,Differentiation,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, has well-defined immunosuppressive functions in several leukocyte populations within the TME. Since the STAT3 protein has been challenging to target using conventional pharmaceutical modalities, we investigated the feasibility of applying systemically delivered RNA interference (RNAi) agents to silence its mRNA directly in tumor-associated immune cells. In preclinical murine tumor models, chemically stabilized acetylated small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively silenced <i>Stat3<\/i> mRNA in multiple relevant cell types in TME and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN), reduced STAT3 protein levels, and increased cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. In murine models of CPI-resistant tumors, RNAi-mediated <i>Stat3<\/i> silencing resulted in tumor growth inhibition, which was further enhanced and resulted in tumor regressions in combination with CPIs. Our findings suggest that targeting <i>STAT3<\/i> directly and reducing STAT3 protein in the suppressive immune cell populations in the TME and TDLN may overcome some of the current limitations of immunotherapy and be of therapeutic benefit especially for cancer patients who failed to respond to standard immunotherapy treatments alone. A human active STAT3 conjugate is currently in Phase 1 clinical trial for treatment of immunotherapy refractory cancer types (NCT06098651).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,RNAi,Efficacy,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
