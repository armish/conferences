[{"Abstract":"Multiple studies have shown that the plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cancer patients differs from healthy individuals in both fragment length and fragment end motifs (FEMs). Yet, there is a lack of understanding regarding how the two factors combined can be associated with cancer and gene transcription. In this study, we evaluated cfDNA fragmentomics in plasma from lung cancer patients (n = 17) and healthy individuals (n = 7) using targeted sequencing (lung cancer: n = 12, healthy: n = 7) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (lung cancer: n = 5). A personal gene expression profile was established with H3K36me3 cell-free chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (cfChIP-seq). cfChIP-seq isolates nucleosomes with histone marks of active transcription directly from plasma, meaning cfDNA enrichment with cfChIP reflects gene activity in the cells of origin. Short cfDNA fragments were isolated using <i>in vitro<\/i> size-selection. Somatic mutations were identified from input cfDNA through the AVENIO pipeline. The findings were validated in an external public dataset comprising of WGS-cfDNA data from healthy individuals. Cancer patients contain a larger fraction of short (&#60;150bp) cfDNA fragments compared to healthy individuals. Cancer patients also demonstrate an enrichment of distinct FEMs compared to healthy individuals. Investigating the association between gene activity and fragment lengths revealed that genes with high expression display an enrichment of short cfDNA fragments (median = 19.99%, IQR: 16.94% - 27.13%, <i>P &#60;<\/i> 0.0001) compared to genes with low expression. Furthermore, distinct GC-rich FEMs are enriched in active genes. Combining the frequency of short cfDNA fragments with the presence of distinct FEMs results in a further enrichment of the highest expressed genes (median = 37.85%, IQR: 30.10% - 39.49%, <i>P &#60;<\/i> 0.0001). <i>In vitro <\/i>size selection of short cfDNA also results in enrichment of GC-rich FEMs. <i>In vitro<\/i> size-selection can isolate cfDNA representing active genes and <i>in vitro<\/i> size-selection enrichment correlates with the cfChIP-seq enrichment (Spearman&#8217;s &#961; range: 0.499-0.882). This study expands the knowledge regarding cfDNA fragmentomics. We document how cancer patients and healthy individuals have different fragmentomic features. In addition, we shed new light on how gene activity in the cells of origin is associated with cfDNA fragment lengths and FEMs. Together, the results can increase the utility of liquid biopsies by determining gene activity in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Epigenetics,Gene expression,Histone methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Here we describe workflow and performance of the Agilent Bravo automated liquid handling platform with the Agilent Avida targeted enrichment solution for next generation sequencing of somatic variants and methylation profiling. This solution can effectively analyze low-input tumor DNA or cfDNA samples. The Avida Duo workflow enables highly sensitive detection of single nucleotide variant (SNV), insertions and deletions (INDEL), copy number variation (CNV) and DNA methylation profiles from a single sample, without any sample splitting.<b> <\/b> Methods and Results: Panels, reagents, and automated workflows for Avida DNA, Avida Methyl, and Avida Duo Methyl (combined DNA &#38; methylation) kits were developed to accommodate up to 96 samples on the Bravo NGS workstation. The automated solution supports independent single-day workflows for somatic variants or methylation sample preparation. The Avida Duo analysis combines both workflows without sample splitting, streamlining the process and reducing sample consumption. Leveraging a focused cancer hotspot panel, we demonstrate excellent reproducibility and low allele frequency (SNV at sub 1%) variant detection in cfDNA samples and reference standards with as little as 10ng DNA input. We exhibit similar performance with a larger ~300 kb target region tumor profiling panel. Finally, we demonstrate DNA methylation detection in the standalone or combined (&#8220;Duo&#8221;) workflows across differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with a panel of ~3400 targets. Conclusions: Automation of the Avida targeted enrichment solution with the Bravo NGS workstation enables a sensitive, high-throughput, end-to-end analysis for detection of genomic alterations and DNA methylation changes from a single low-input cfDNA or tumor DNA sample.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Copy number alterations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

A pilot study was conducted with the STRECK Cell-Free DNA BCT tube to determine the impact of processing time on cfDNA quantity and quality utilizing two complementary quality control assays.&#8239;4 STRECK DNA BCT tubes were drawn from 40 donors. Plasma samples were analyzed, with half processed immediately and the other half stored for five days before processing. Two QC assays were performed to compare results at the two processing time points. The Alu EFIRM assay measured Alu element concentration (copies\/mL). The Cell-free DNA ScreenTape assay evaluated Qubit DNA concentration (&#956;g\/mL) and %cfDNA. Descriptive statistics and paired sample t-tests were performed to&#8239;compare mean concentrations at the two processing time points, with and without identified samples with cytolysis.<br \/>Median, mean, and range were recorded for each assay measure (Table 1). A reduction in cfDNA quantity was observed at the 5-day processing time point. Five 5-day processing samples were identified with high DNA quantity and a high Alu element concentration. The five samples experienced hemolysis and clotting as a result of handling and processing at odds with standard protocol. There was a significant difference between the mean DNA quantities of the processing time points following exclusion of the five samples. There was no change in significance between the mean Alu concentration and %cfDNA following exclusion (Table 2).<br \/>Both assays successfully detected samples with high nuclear DNA, a major contaminant for cfDNA assays, and identified a reduction in cfDNA at the 5-day processing time point. Proper handling and processing procedures are necessary to avoid cell lysis and maximize cfDNA quality and yield. This pilot establishes a starting point for future evaluations of liquid biopsy tube types, processing delays, and preanalytical cfDNA quality variables.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The investigation of different liquid biopsy biomarkers may lead to a better understanding of the cancers they are designed to detect and facilitate optimal management. This study aimed to identify and compare the epigenomic and genomic profiles of tumor biomarkers in circulation using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and exosomal DNA (exoDNA) in plasma and saliva samples collected from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).<br \/>Methods: In a prospective trial, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on paired cfDNA and exoDNA from saliva versus plasma of 16 HNSCC patients. cfDNA was directly extracted from plasma and saliva, while exoDNA was extracted from purified exosomes after characterization. DNAs were then converted by Zymo EZ DNA Methylation-Direct kit and libraries were constructed with xGen&#8482; Methyl-Seq Kit and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform. Sequencing data analyses were performed using Bismark, GATK, and methylKit for methylation pattern and cfTools for Tumor Fraction Estimation (TFE).<br \/>Results: Methylation data demonstrated heterogeneities across sample types. Comparisons of ctDNA as a reference for exoDNA showed 7147 hypermethylated and 9984 hypomethylated regions for plasma samples but showed 131 hypermethylated and 123 hypomethylated regions for saliva samples. Comparisons of plasma as a reference for saliva, 37 hypermethylated and 95 hypomethylated regions were noted in exoDNA, while 117 hypermethylated and 262 hypomethylated regions in ctDNA. The mean level of tumor&#8208;derived DNA was above 3%, the lower limit of sensitivity to indicate the presence of tumor cutoff as suggested by the cfTools. There were 3.24%, 3.14%, and 3.14% tumor-derived DNA in plasma cfDNA, plasma exoDNA, and saliva exoDNA, respectively. However, the tumor fraction in saliva cfDNA was below this cutoff (2.88%). A statistically significant (<i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.001) difference in TFE was observed between combined cfDNA and exoDNA data from plasma and saliva, but the difference between combined sample types cfDNA and exoDNA did not reach statistical significance (<i>P<\/i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.306). The linear mixed-effects model for TFE influence between the different groups revealed a significant interaction between sample sources (plasma and saliva) and sample types (cfDNA and exoDNA) (<i>P <\/i>= 0.005), as well as a significant effect of sample source on TFE (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: This pilot investigation provides evidence that exoDNA and cfDNA have different molecular profiles in plasma and saliva samples from the same HNSCC patient, and indicates that saliva carries additional tumor markers for HNSCC.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly recognized as a liquid biomarker in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), showing promise in optimizing therapeutic regimens for various cancers. While CSF has been explored as a source of cfDNA for gliomas, understanding the dynamics of cfDNA abundance and sequencing changes during treatment and recurrence is essential. Leveraging our biobank of longitudinal CSF specimens obtained through CSF access devices, we aimed to determine the potential utility of CSF cfDNA as a monitoring tool for treatment response in glioma patients.<br \/><b>Materials and methods<\/b>: Longitudinal CSF specimens were collected through Ommaya reservoirs (NCT04692337) or ventriculoperitoneal shunts (NCT04692324) from patients with brain tumors, including gliomas. cfDNA was extracted from 1-5 mL of CSF based on available sample volumes and quantified using Qubit. Next-Generation sequencing using PredicineCARE or PredicineSCORE low-pass whole genome sequencing (LPWGS) was performed based on the available cfDNA.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: CSF collected before versus after resection showed an increase in quantified cfDNA (2.97x, range: 1.58-5.26x), indicating the impact of increased parenchymal disruption and closer contact with CSF. Subsequently, CSF cfDNA decreased during chemoradiation and adjuvant treatment and increased at recurrence, even in patients co-enrolled in immunotherapy trials for IL-7 agonists and pembrolizumab. Notably, copy number burden (CNB) increased at recurrence in three patients with known disease progression and decreased throughout immunotherapy treatment in one patient despite concerns of pseudoprogression. In a patient with a hypermutated glioblastoma, CSF cfDNA revealed over 59 genomic alterations, including MAP2K1, KIT, and PDGFRA. Another patient with a progressing EGFR-amplified GBM showed over 200 new variants in the final sample, with EGFR copy number increasing from 2 to over 30.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Analysis of cfDNA throughout a patient&#8217;s disease course, encompassing resection and treatment with standard-of-care and experimental therapies, may aid in disease monitoring and treatment response.

However, current liquid biopsy approaches based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detect only a minority of early-stage cancers, because these tumors shed little ctDNA and plasma sample volume is limited. For liquid biopsy to realize its potential for the early detection of cancer, sensitivity for the earliest stage disease must be improved.<br \/>Methods: We set out to improve sensitivity of liquid biopsy for cancer early detection by exploiting tumor recognition by T cells through sequencing of the circulating T cell receptor repertoire. Using gDNA extracted from blood buffy coats, we studied a cohort of 451 lung cancer patients (86% with stage I disease) and 525 subjects without cancer, enriched for older individuals with a history of smoking. We performed genomic DNA TCR beta chain sequencing to yield a median of 81,088 TCR clonotypes in cancer patients and 112,588 clonotypes in non-cancer controls. We built a TCR sequence similarity nearest neighbor graph to cluster &#62;68M distinct TCR clonotypes into TCR repertoire functional units (RFUs). The TCR frequencies of RFUs were tested for association with cancer status and significantly associated RFUs were combined using a support vector machine model into a TCR RFU cancer score. This model was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and compared to a ctDNA panel of 237 mutation hotspots in 154 lung cancer driver genes (IDT&#8482;) and to a panel of 17 lung cancer related protein biomarkers (Olink&#174;) in 87 subjects.<br \/>Results: We identified 177 cancer-associated TCR RFUs at FDR&#8804;0.10, including 83 RFUs that were enriched in cancer samples with a TCR count log2-fold change between 0.05 and 1.31, and 94 that were enriched in controls with a log2-fold change between 0.07 and 0.40. We observed 56 of the 83 cancer-enriched RFUs had decreasing TCR counts with increasing age across the cohort, coupled with higher counts in cancer patients relative to age-matched controls. The TCR RFU cancer score achieved a cross-validated ROC AUC of 0.69 for cancer status prediction, with the AUC for stage I cancers similar to that of stage II-IV (0.69 vs. 0.70). 44% of stage I cancers (test samples of each CV fold) were detected by the TCR model at a specificity of 80%. We saw a substantial gain in sensitivity for stage I cancer when TCR RFUs were added to ctDNA and proteins, with a ~15-20%-point increase seen at the 90% target specificity level typical for cancer screening tests. Likewise, sensitivity increased at the 99% specificity level used in multi-cancer early detection, with 35% of stage I lung cancers detected, which could not be achieved by any analyte alone.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate detection of a significant fraction of early lung cancer cases from blood by analyzing the circulating TCR repertoire and show that this signal is complementary to established analytes such as proteins and ctDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Early detection,T cell,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

This study explores the CSF liquid biopsy analytes from 3 patients with central nervous system metastases analyzed with the third generation non-enrichment high-definition single cell assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow. The detection of cellular analytes was compared between the CSF and matched peripheral blood (PB) samples. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected in the CSF but not the PB and were subsequently molecularly characterized by single cell genomics and targeted multiplexed proteomics to reveal a clonal population of phenotypically heterogeneous cells. There was a lack of concordance between CTCs and cfDNA of the CSF in the copy number alteration profiles. In an extracellular vesicle surface marker analysis of the CSF, there was a high signal among tetraspanin CD9\/CD63\/CD81, with CD81 signal the highest across all 3 patients. The data indicates that the CSF may be used as a diagnostic or potentially prognostic tool to measure and characterize disease burden.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and the overexpression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes are crucial steps in the development of cervical cancer. We investigated the potential utility of HPV ctDNA as a biomarker for monitoring treatment outcomes in patients with cervical cancer.<br \/>Material and Methods<br \/>We use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to measure the amount of HPV16\/18 ctDNA in plasma of cervical cancer patients. The HPV standard GP5+\/6+ primers were used to determine HPV positivity in our patients. Specific primers were designed to amplify specifically the E6 oncogene of HPV16 and HPV18. Plasmid constructs were made using the PCR-purified products of HeLa and SiHa cell lines which would act as a positive control for the assay. HPV16 and 18 plasmids were serially diluted and then tested in qPCR as a template using different primer sets. Standard curves were made from the recombinant plasmids. This will serve as a positive control and will also provide a correlation between the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR vs ddPCR.<br \/>Results and Discussions<br \/>We hypothesize that our dPCR test will be able to detect minute quantities of HPV ctDNA in plasma of cervical cancer patients as ctDNA levels are expected to be decrease as treatment progresses. The assay sensitivity and specificity will be obtained by comparing results to QPCR. The study samples involve a tumor biopsy and a blood sample at the baseline prior to the therapy and serial blood sampling in different stages of treatment and follow-ups. These samples will also serve for treatment monitoring of these patients through ddPCR. Tumor samples are used to confirm the HPV status of patients using HPV-specific GP5+\/GP6+ qPCR. We have recruited 75 cervical cancer patients with majority of them being squamous cell carcinoma and stage IIB disease. The qPCR results from tumor biopsy revealed HPV 16 was most prevalent (32\/43), followed by HPV18 (6\/43) and HPV 33(2\/43).<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>we will now use Qiagen digital PCR system to understand HPV ctDNA levels in our patient cohort. we believe that our comprehensive sample collection after every treatment milestone and thorough follow-up for upto 2 years after diagnosis will allow us to study the utility of this sensitive test in monitoring disease and relapse. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Droplet digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Preetiparna Parida<sup>1<\/sup>, Krishna Sharan<sup>2<\/sup>, Shirley Lewis<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Rama Rao Damerla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medical Genetics, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9f1ed5ed-53c6-4cd9-ba6e-79e10eb0e615","ControlNumber":"6407","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Due to the diffuse nature of ctDNA however, both extraction and library preparation must be optimized for the efficient downstream next-generation sequencing (NGS) application. We initially addressed the optimization of quality and quantity of cfDNA recovery from healthy and various oncology patients by evaluating QIAsymphony DSP Circulating DNA Kit and Apostle MiniMax cfDNA isolation kits. Overall, the cfDNA yields from Apostle MiniMax kit were approximately 12X higher. We then optimized high-volume automated cfDNA extraction from 1ml, 3ml and 6ml plasma samples using the Biomek i7 for Apostle MiniMax kit. Colorectal, Gastric and Ovarian cancer gave the highest yield of cfDNA whereas, Esophageal, Lung and Kidney cancers were the lowest cfDNA yielding samples. We then analyzed ctDNA from plasma from healthy donors, colorectal, kidney, Breast, and endometrial cancer patients along with Oncospan and Seraseq ctDNA mutation mix (5-0.5% AF) to evaluate the mutation detection efficacy, repeatability, and reproducibility by targeted NGS using TSO 500ctDNA assay ay 10ng, 20ng, and 30ng inputs. For library preparation batches of 48 samples were prepared using a fully automated processes for the library prep, Hybridization capture and post capture enrichment on the Beckman i5 robot. Libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 at 600M Paired-end depth. This method demonstrates an overall concordance of inter-run and intra-run accuracy of variant detection to be 90% demonstrating that this method run as described produces highly repeatable and reproducible variant detection to sub-1% allele frequencies. The inter-run, lot-to-lot, and operator-to-operator variability was &#8805;99%. Down-sample analysis demonstrated high levels of assay performance with sample inputs of 30 ng with &#8805;96% sample passing Illumina cut-off metrics at 150M PE read depth as compared to Illumina recommended 420M PE reads. Taken together, we provide a high-volume automated solution for cfDNA extraction from plasma samples, additionally these data demonstrate a robust, reproducible, and highly accurate targeted DNA sequencing method that can be used for low allele frequency variant detection in cfDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Targeted sequencing,Tumor,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

While early work in liquid biopsy focused on the identification of actionable somatic variations at specific loci, the past decade has seen an expansion into non-genetic features, notably methylation. 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) profiles of cancer are differential from non-cancer at many more loci and so provide a stronger signal. Moreover, recent research has suggested that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) profiles in cfDNA can be a marker for early cancer. However, a standard blood draw yields an average of only 10ng of cfDNA, presenting the dilemma of how to use limited sample to obtain maximum information. Existing methods for measuring methylation using next-generation sequencing cannot distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC and are limited in their ability to detect mutations, with approaches that measure both 5-mC and 5-hmC requiring two separate workflows. Hence, to measure complete genetics, 5-mC and 5-hmC using existing technologies requires three separate workflows, each of which require separate DNA input. We will present a technology which sequences at single base resolution the complete genetic sequence of input DNA fragments integrated with the modification status (unmodified, 5-mC or 5-hmC) for each CpG from low nanogram input quantities of DNA. A hairpin construct is used to create a copy of the original DNA strand. Enzymatic conversion followed by next-generation sequencing enables coupled decoding of bases across the original and copy strand, uniquely reporting one of A, C, G, T, 5-mC, or 5-hmC for each position in the input DNA fragment. Using this technology, we generated whole genome 6-letter data (measuring A, C, G, T, 5-mC, and 5-hmC at single-base resolution across the genome) on cell-free DNA extracted from plasma of healthy volunteers and patients with colorectal cancer at various stages of progression. We demonstrate how the technology can be used to compare 5-mC and 5-hmC methylomic profiles, genomics, and fragmentomics, across different stages of colorectal cancer. In particular, we show how disease progression can be marked by changes in 5-mC and 5-hmC across several loci. We propose that the ability to measure 5-mC and 5-hmC at high accuracy and single base resolution, alongside genomic and fragmentomic profiles, from a limited quantity of DNA will enable greater insight into the ctDNA in plasma and help advance the field of liquid biopsy towards fulfilling its promise.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Liquid biopsies,Sequencing,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

There are multiple tests available that attempt to address each of these needs independently with varying degrees of clinical utility. Caris Assure is a proprietary circulating nucleic acid sequencing platform that couples whole exome and transcriptome (WES\/WTS) sequencing on white blood cells and plasma with advanced machine learning techniques to satisfy all three testing needs on one platform. This test detects SNVs, INDELs, structural variants, copy number, gene expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), fragment length, and aneuploidy of both somatic (tumor and clonal hematopoiesis) and germline origin. Caris&#8217; extensive database of over 350,000 tissue WES\/WTS from solid malignancies was used to train deep learning neural networks to identify the molecular underpinnings of cancer. These networks were then deployed on WES\/WTS data from plasma and buffy coat in pursuit of signals that can inform early detection, MRD and therapy selection.<br \/>Validation studies were performed to characterize the analytic and clinical performance of Assure on over 3000 patient blood samples. These samples include ~1000 non-cancer patients (controls), ~1700 newly diagnosed patients where blood was collected at surgery (early detection), ~500 early-stage patients during adjuvant therapy at multiple time points (MRD), and ~200 locally advanced\/metastatic patients where matched tissue testing was also performed (therapy selection).<br \/>For early detection, stratification of blood samples from patients with stage I-IV cancer versus those with no reported cancer resulted in an AUC &#62; 0.99 and included over 30 types of solid tumors. Notably, at 99.5% specificity, the sensitivities for stages I-IV (n= 119, 54, 50, 27) were 73%, 80%, 76%, and 89%. In the MRD setting for high-risk patients, the disease-free survival of patients whose cancers were predicted to recur was significantly shorter (39.6 mo) than those predicted not to recur (93.4 mo) (HR: 5.18, 95%CI: 2.94-9.09, p&#60;.00001). This performance was observed across multiple lineages of cancer including but not limited to breast, colon, lung, and bladder. Lastly, for therapy selection, detection of driver mutations where blood was collected within 30 days of matched tissue demonstrated high concordance with a PPA of 93.8% and PPV of 96.8%. CHIP correction proved to be essential as ~35% percent of patients had CHIP mutations, including KRAS, BRAF, ATM, BRCA1\/2, findings that could lead to improper therapy selection.<br \/>Herein, we demonstrate for the first time a single liquid biopsy assay that addresses the entire continuum of care in clinical oncology with optimal diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive utility for patients and physicians.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Early detection,Prognostic markers,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, while Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are a well studied phenomenon, CTCCs remain relatively unexplored and ill-defined, with only a few descriptive investigations evaluating their clinical utility. Adding to CTCC complexity is that various subtypes exist, including homotypic clusters consisting of a homogenous population of tumor cells and heterotypic CTCCs made of CTCs with immune\/stromal white blood cells (WBCs). Furthermore, CTCs can undergo Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process characterized by loss of epithelial traits and upregulation of mesenchymal traits, and can form clustered EMTs (CEMTs). Moreover, CTCs can fuse with macrophages forming Tumor Macrophage Hybrid Cells, aka Cancer-Associated Macrophage Like cells (CAMLs) when in circulation. We enumerated all these types of cells and complex aggregates in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> We enumerated the 6 populations from patient samples enrolled in IRB aproved prospective pilot studies. Whole peripheral blood (7.5mL) was filtered and stained with cytokeratin (CK) &#38; CD45\/CD14 to identify CTCs. CTCs were defined as an intact DAPI nuclei and strong filamentous CK. Homotypic CTCCs were defined as &#8805;2 CTCs attached together. Heterotypic CTCCs were defined as &#8805;1 CTC attached to &#8805;1 WBC. EMTs were defined as having DAPI nuclei and weak non-filamentous CK. CEMTS were defined as &#8805;2 EMTs. CAMLs were defined as having an enlarged polynucleated DAPI, and positive for CD45\/CD14 or non-filamentous CK. Median progression free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) over 24 months (m) were evaluated.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> We evaluated the blood of 79 mBC patients. Single CTCs were found in 57% of patients (n=34\/79), homotypic CTCCs 15% (n=12\/79), heterotypic CTCCs 66% (n=27\/79), EMTs 56% (n=44\/79), CEMTs 23% (n=18\/79) and CAMLs 97% (n=77\/79). Over 24 ms, patierns with detectable heterotypic CTCCs &#38; homotypic CTCCs had the shortest response times at mPFS=2.8 &#38; mOS=5.8 ms, or mPFS=2.1 &#38; mOS=4.3 ms, respectively. This was followed by CTCs mPFS=3.7 &#38; mOS=13.7 ms, EMTs mPFS=4.3 &#38; mOS=14.4 ms, CAMLs mPFS=4.3 &#38; mOS=14.4 ms, and CEMT mPFS=4.7 &#38; mOS=13.2 ms. Additionally, CTCCs were rare in HER2+ patients at 4.4% (n=1\/23), but no associations to other hormone statuses were found.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> CTCCs appear to represent an array of subtypes with different biological and clinical meanings. Here we enumerated CTCC subtypes in the blood of mBC patients and stratified the various types to clinical outcomes. These data suggest CTCCs are clinically important and further understanding of their biology in the context of tumor pathogenesis is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

This emerging evidence emphasizes the potential of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) as early indicators for cancer. Despite their significance, CTCs are exceptionally rare compared to normal blood cells, which presents a considerable challenge in detection, particularly during early stages of cancer. Traditional detection methods, such as those based on nucleated cell enrichment, antibody labeling and fluorescence imaging, encounter notable limitations when applied in the context of early detection. These limitations arise from the inherent heterogeneity of CTCs, and the multistep process involved in labeling and manual enumeration, compromising cell viability and resulting in cell loss. This loss becomes particularly problematic in the context of early cancer detection scenarios where the tumor burden is extremely low, and any cell loss can significantly impact assay sensitivity. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative CTC detection approach employing a deep learning framework combined with holographic imaging. This technique utilizes coherent light to generate holograms from cell samples, capturing detailed 3D morphological and optical properties of individual cells. We developed a custom convolutional neural network designed to facilitate high-throughput cell sorting in real-time. Trained on healthy blood samples and diverse cancer cell lines, the dataset consists of more than 50 million cellular holograms enhanced by proprietary Gaussian annotation and image augmentation strategies. Moreover, by combining the morphological signatures from holography with antigen signatures (e.g. HER2\/ER\/PR) in real-time, our model demonstrates the ability to detect less than 1 false positive per 1 million nucleated cells, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for targeted early-stage breast cancer detection. Our technology represents highly sensitive alternative to traditional screening methods, with the promise of enhancing patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Early detection,Breast cancer,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

While extensive research focus has been placed on characterizing the molecular heterogeneity in leukemia by modern omics technologies, comparatively less emphasis has been placed on studying the diversity in holistic morphological changes that occur in single cells in the context of disease. Here, we report on a novel approach to understanding and characterizing different hematological malignancies using ghost cytometry, a recently developed high-content flow cytometric method that leverages high-speed, artificial intelligence (AI) driven morphological characterization and analysis of single cells. We performed morphometric profiling on human bone marrow samples from patients with T and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=5), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=5), multiple myeloma (MM, n=5) and healthy bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) controls (n=6). Morphological profiles from individual cells were analyzed by unsupervised machine learning (universal manifold approximation and projection, UMAP) and compared within disease subsets and against controls. We identified disease-specific cell populations from a mixture of healthy control and disease samples without any labeling, based on completely label-free information. For validation of the specific cell subsets, we overlaid known cell surface markers (e.g. CD45 for blast cells, CD10\/CD19 for B-ALL, CD33\/CD34 for AML, CD38\/CD138 for MM). The intensity of CD45 was dimmer and disease-specific markers were highly expressed in the disease-specific cell population. We also identified a unique cell subpopulation in the disease-specific cell population that could not be distinguished by existing markers. We also analyzed three human myeloma cell lines (AMO1, KMS, and L363) for comparison to the primary MM samples. In the UMAP analysis using LF-GC data, in all three types of cell lines, Bortezomib-resistant cell lines exhibited different distributions from the control parental cell lines. In addition, we observed distinct morphological profiles between primary myeloma samples and myeloma cell lines.<br \/>Here we present a novel cell characterization approach for human hematological diseases that leverages AI-based, label-free, high-speed morphological characterization of single cells. We demonstrate that the approach can be used to identify subtle morphological differences in blast cells from a range of blood cancer subtypes. Application of morphological profiling and AI can be used to identify measurable, disease-related changes in these diseases that have diagnostic, drug screening, and therapeutic monitoring potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Flow cytometry,Leukemias,Multiple myeloma,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

To explore cancer invasion dynamics, the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid invasion assay offers a swift approach to mimicking a tumor micro-region or micro-metastasis. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) time-lapse imaging was chosen for its fluorescence-free and non-destructive advantages in capturing live spheroid movement. However, the subsequent analysis posed challenges, including out-of-focus cells and a voluminous dataset with diverse microscope planes and time points. Our study introduces a segmentation framework featuring in-focus spatial stacking algorithm and novel training architecture that enabling in-depth automated analysis of 3D spheroid invasion behaviors within a microenvironment. Firstly, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids were cultured in a microwell dish and then incorporated into a collagen type I matrix for the 3D spheroid invasion assay. Capturing spheroid invasion dynamics involved acquiring 15 z-plane images (spaced at 20 &#181;m intervals) per timepoint for each spheroid using DIC microscopy at 15-minute intervals over a 28-hour period, employing a 20X objective lens. We refined the Focus Stacking framework into Multiple Slices Blurry Stacking (MSB-Stack) by pre-filtering blurred areas before stacking images. This process produced 6390 slices consolidated into 426 labeled stacked images, highlighting Invasive area, Spheroid core, and Invasive cells post-invasion. We then enhanced Mask R-CNN (Region based-Convolutional Neural Networks) with a weak-to-strong augmentation mechanism, leveraging well-segmented samples from MSB-Stack for training on both fully stacked and blurred images. Blurry Consistency Mask R-CNN (BCMask R-CNN) demonstrates overall improvement across feature extractors, outperforming Mask R-CNN. Using Mean average precision (mAP) as the main metric for instance segmentation and detection, our proposed model achieves 73.0% and 65.2% on mAP @[0.5, 0.95], showcasing robustness. Notably, our best results for mAP @0.5 reach 96.6% and 96.7% on both tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of consistency training in mitigating unclear boundary issues during preprocessing. In conclusion, our proposed method, MSB-Stack, effectively addresses the challenge of unclear boundaries in 3D breast cancer cell DIC microscopy datasets. The integration of weak-to-strong consistency training in our model, BCMask R-CNN, not only mitigates biases but also enhances performance across different backbones, setting the stage for future advancements in cell-tracking tasks and broader migratory analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Spheroids,Image analysis,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Although TKIs can induce long-term remission, they are frequently not curative. Thus, CML is an ideal system to test our hypothesis that transcriptome-based state-transition models accurately predict cancer evolution and treatment response. We collected time-sequential blood samples from tetracycline-off (Tet-Off) BCR-ABL-inducible transgenic mice that recapitulates human chronic phase CML and wild-type controls. From the transcriptome, we constructed a CML state-space and a three-well leukemogenic potential landscape that describes CML state-transition from health to disease. The potential&#8217;s stable critical points were used to define three distinct disease states. The Early state was characterized by anti-CML genes (n=35) that opposed leukemia progression, whereas an expanding number of pro-CML genes characterized the Transition state (n=357) and Late states (n=1,858). Gene modules that were co-regulated at the unstable points in the potential landscape were identified as the drivers of transition between stable disease states. To investigate CML therapies we used two treatments: silencing of BCR\/ABL by readministering Tet (Tet-on, Tet-off [TOTO]) which represented a best-case scenario of disease being cured, and TKI (nilotinib) therapy which represents current clinical practice. TOTO returned the diseased mice transcriptomes to a near health state, without reaching it, suggesting partly irreversible transformation. TKI, however, only reverted the transcriptome to an intermediate disease state, without approaching health, and disease relapse occurred soon after treatment. Finally, using only the earliest time-point as initial conditions, our state-transition models accurately predicted both disease progression and treatment response to both therapies for each individual mouse. In conclusion, these results show state-transition analysis is a valuable approach to gain real time insights into CML development, progression and ongoing treatment response that can also be applied to other type of leukemia and cancers in general. We predicted disease evolution and treatment response in a murine model that recapitulates human disease, supporting this as a potentially valuable approach to time clinical intervention even before phenotypic changes become detectable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Gene expression,Systems biology,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"D.

However, it is a laborious and time-consuming task for a pathologist to directly measure the Ki-67 index. Recently, automation techniques using machine learning techniques such as deep learning have been proposed. In this study, we propose a top-<i>k<\/i> hotspot recommendation method to help Ki-67 index assessment based on nuclei detection detected by a deep learning model. The dataset included a total of 32 diaminobenzidine-hematoxylin (DAB-H) Ki-67 IHC whole slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer obtained by core biopsy. Each of these WSIs was evaluated by a pathologist using the interval of the Ki-67 index estimate and the scores of 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+. Additionally, the search area was manually designated to exclude internal control. We developed a Ki-67 index analysis model based on deep learning and image analysis. Nuclei segmentation used the StarDist model. The detected results were filtered based on nucleus size and nucleus eccentricity. The filtering threshold was determined experimentally. To recommend top-<i>k<\/i> hotspots, a coarse search is performed to move the circle region horizontally and vertically in specific units, and the top <i>k<\/i> regions based on Ki-67 index are found among areas containing more than 500 cells. Next, a fine search is performed around the <i>k<\/i> areas in detail. Finally, the top-<i>k<\/i> hotspots and each detected positive and negative cells, count of positive cells and negative cells, and predicted Ki-67 index are provided. It was confirmed that the Ki-67 score estimated for the detected top-1 hotspot and the pathologist's Ki-67 score had a correlation of Pearson correlation coefficient=0.8153, <i>R<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=0.6648. As <i>k<\/i> increased, the top-<i>k<\/i> accuracy was observed to increase from 68.75% when <i>k<\/i> = 1 and 3 to 75.00% when <i>k<\/i> = 5, based on the pathologist's score. When a pathologist reviewed 10 cases where the Ki-67 score differed from the prediction, 6 cases were judged to be worth reexamining considering the proposed hotspot and Ki-67 index, and 2 cases included stromal cells in cell detection. In two cases, the WSI was judged to be blurry. Cell analysis and top-<i>k<\/i> hotspot recommendation using deep learning and image analysis were performed on Ki-67 IHC stained WSIs and compared with the pathologist's Ki-67 score. Through semi-automatic top-<i>k<\/i> hotspot recommendation, the reliability of diagnosis can be increased as an auxiliary test to Ki-67 index assessment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunohistochemistry,Deep learning,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

To this end, AI applications employing deep learning (DL) can facilitate the translation of image data to enable human interpretation and yield novel oncological insights that would have otherwise remained imperceptible. DL-based methodologies are multimodal, capable of integrating imaging with clinicogenomic data to furnish a more holistic perspective and affording more accurate predictions in oncology. Here, we developed an unsupervised DL workflow to analyze 1,799 H&#38;E images of lung cancer (NSCLC n = 951; SCLC n = 50; others n = 798) incorporating comprehensive patient-level clinical data (electronic health records [ConcertAI]) integrated with genomics (WES and RNA-seq [Caris Labs]). There are three steps in our approach: (1) image preprocessing and filtering, yielding &#62; 30 million image patches; (2) utilizing pretrained SimCLR models from 57 public oncology histopathology datasets with ResNet-18 as a backbone structure to extract 512-dimensional-feature vectors for each patch; (3) using three unsupervised clustering methods (kmeans, DBSCAN, Leiden clustering) to cluster patches and selected Leiden clustering. We identified 635 primary imaging clusters using an elbow method and generated an image feature matrix by calculating correlations between each patch and cluster centroids; these were aggregated and mapped back to source slides. In this proof-of-concept, distinct image feature patterns characterized SCLC and NSCLC samples. For SCLC, one of the salient features was the presence of hemorrhage, which may be associated with higher rates of fine-needle aspiration biopsy procedure for SCLC compared with NSCLC which was confirmed in the EHR data (<i>p<\/i> = 0.032). Derived morphological clusters were correlated with tumor-immune genomic features (Tumor Mutational Burden [TMB], Immunologic Constant of Rejection [ICR], and Miracle scores<sup>1<\/sup>) serving as predictors of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy. By applying linear models, we detected 11, 96 and 249 significantly associated imaging clusters, respectively, highly enriched with immune cells e.g., plasma cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and supporting an infiltrated and inflamed tumor-immune microenvironment. In summary, a multimodal, unsupervised deep learning workflow combining H&#38;E imaging with clinicogenomic data was developed to identify histologic feature clusters associated with well-established tumor-immune genomic signatures of NSCLC immune infiltration and molecular phenotypes. These studies demonstrate enormous potential to yield histopathological and translational insights in NSCLC and SCLC that can empower clinicians to make better therapeutic response predictions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Genomics,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

These methods must be unbiased and user-independent for reproducible data. Cell analytics involves manual processes (e.g., manual cell counting) or reagent-based approaches (e.g., viability kits). In recent years, semi-automated systems have been introduced that can either count cells, measure cell growth by density tracking, and\/or determine cell viability. However, these methods are often time-consuming, require reagents and labeling, and may involve costly instrumentation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made strides in clinical and laboratory research, holding promise for swift integration into cancer research. Here, we present the development and validation of SnapCyte&#8482;, an AI performing accurate, unbiased, label- and reagent-free cell analytics from basic cell culture images, independent of specialized instrumentation.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>Cell images were generated using diverse cell lines (MCF7, PC3, Hela, Raji&#8943;) cultured in various vessels with and without treatments (Taxane, Cisplatin, Heatshock&#8943;).

Images were acquired using the SnapCyte&#8482; adaptor and diverse microscopes (Leica, Hund, Zeiss, Nikon) and cell phones. Multiple datasets of 500 annotated images each were created, with images masked for confluency or for singular live and dead cells by experienced scientists. Object segmentation utilized the UNet architecture for localizing cells in cell culture images and iterative training was applied to achieve the required accuracy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>After multiple training iterations, SnapCyte&#8482; AI detection models achieved 99% precision for confluency and &#62;95% precision and recall for cell count. SnapCyte&#8482; surpassed standard methods (Crystal Violet, WST1, MTT, Presto blue, CyQuant, Incucyte&#174;, and Bio-Rad TC20 cell counter), displaying high accuracy and smaller standard error variation than reagent-based assays. Compared to IncuCyte&#174; Bio-Rad TC20, SnapCyte&#8482; demonstrated similar accuracy and greater user-independent results. Furthermore, SnapCyte&#8482; acquired data in under 10 minutes, with non-invasive measurements, allowing direct use of cells in downstream assays.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> We have developed and validated an AI model for advanced cell analytics.

The few durable treatment options have led to a critical need to advance new therapeutics in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent human clinical trials have demonstrated that new combination of immunotherapeutic regimens provide augmented clinical response in a subset of patients. Computational methods that can simulate tumors from mathematical equations describing cellular and molecular interactions are emerging as promising tools to simulate the impact of therapies entirely <i>in silico<\/i>. To facilitate designing dosing regimens and selecting potential predictive biomarkers, we developed a new computational model to track tumor progression at organ scale while reflecting the spatial heterogeneity in the tumor at cellular and molecular scale in HCC. This computational model is called a spatial quantitative systems pharmacology (spQSP) platform and it is also designed to simulate the effects of combination immunotherapy. The model is first calibrated using clinical outcomes and measured immune cell densities based on recent neoadjuvant HCC clinical trial combining anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cabozantinib (NCT03299946). Then, we validate the results from the spQSP model by leveraging real-world spatial multi-omics data from the same clinical trial. The model output is compared with spatial data from Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). Both IMC data and simulation results suggest closer proximity between CD8 T cell and Arginase 1 (Arg1) positive macrophages among non-responders while the reverse trend was observed for responders. We also compared the model output with Visium spatial transcriptomics analyses of samples from post-treatment tumor resections in the original clinical trial. Both spatial transcriptomic data and simulation results identify the role of spatial patterns of tumor vasculature and TGF&#946; in tumor and immune cell interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first spatial tumor model for virtual clinical trials at a molecular and cellular scale that is grounded in high-throughput spatial multi-omics data from a human clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Mathematical Modeling,Spatial transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Shuming Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Atul Deshpande<sup><\/sup>, Babita  K.

These data modalities represent a valuable and readily available resource for developing new prognostic tools. Given their vast difference in spatial scales, effective methods to integrate the two modalities are currently lacking. Here, we aim to develop a multi-modal approach to integrate radiology and pathology images for predicting outcomes in cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We propose a multi-modal weakly-supervised deep learning framework to integrate radiology and pathology images for survival prediction. We first extract multi-scale features from whole-slide H&#38;E-stained pathology images to characterize cellular and tissue phenotypes as well as spatial cellular organization. We then build a hierarchical co-attention transformer to effectively learn the multi-modal interactions between radiology and pathology image features. Finally, a multimodal risk score is derived by combining complementary information from two images modalities and clinical data for predicting outcome. We evaluate our approach in lung, gastric, and brain cancers with matched radiology and pathology images and clinical data available, each with separate training and external validation cohorts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The multi-modal deep learning models achieved a reasonably high accuracy for predicting survival outcomes in the external validation cohorts (C-index range: 0.72-0.75 across three cancer types). The multi-modal prognostic models significantly improved upon single-modal approach based on radiology or pathology images or clinical data alone (C-index range: 0.53-0.71, P&#60;0.01). The multi-modal deep learning models were significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival (hazard ratio range: 3.23-4.46, P&#60;0.0001).

However, recent clinical trials, including KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061, and ATTRACTION-2, show that the objective response rate (ORR) for ICIs is still less than 20% in patients with advanced GC. Therefore, predicting who will respond to ICIs in advance is essential to make better treatment plans for GC patients. There are potential biomarkers to predict ICI response, but most of them can only be applied to a limited population of patients. For example, Kim ST., et al., (PMID: 30013197) show that patients with MSI-high or EBV-positive responded well to ICIs, but these subtypes account for less than 30 percent of GC patients (PMID:25079317). In this study, we propose a prediction model of ICI response using the 32 GC-specific genes that we identified from mutation data (PMID: 26635139) and showed their close association with survival and ICI response in GC (PMID: 35140202; PMID: 36508166). In addition, since the number of available GC-ICI samples is small, we design our prediction model in Bayesian and ensemble learning frameworks which are robust to small sample size problems.<br \/><i><b>Methods:<\/b> <\/i>We collected mRNA sequencing data from GC-ICI treated patients from our institutions and publications (PMID: 30013197; PMID: 35254400; PMID: 33846173).

We built and trained a classifier to separate responders from non-responders using the expressions of the 32 genes. We proposed to use a Deep Gaussian process (GP) model, a multi-layered extension of a GP that is itself a Bayesian method. We optimized the parameters of each GP model in variational inference. To implement ensemble learning, we trained multiple DGP models with different initializations of the model parameters and data splitting (training\/validation sets). For each training run, the best model was selected based on the prediction performance on the validation set, measured by AUC. The final prediction for a test sample was made by combining the prediction results of all the DGP models by taking the average.<br \/><i><b>Results:<\/b><\/i> We implemented the DGP-based prediction model using PyTorch in Python, and the codes will be publicly available on the GitHub repository (https:\/\/github.com\/hwanglab\/GC_ICI_response_prediction).

While significant attention has been devoted to identifying cancers either from clinical text or through tabular data collected by SEER registries, there has been less emphasis on integrating these distinct modes of data. In our multimodal deep learning approach, we use longitudinal tabular data from the Consolidated Tumor Case (CTC) database that encompass a patient&#8217;s past diagnoses. This tabular information can augment clinical text to aid in the classification of pathology reports indicative of recurrent cancers. Four NCI SEER registries (Louisiana, New Jersey, Seattle and Utah) have manually labeled 61,150 pathology reports with one of six categories, which we refine into a four-class classification problem. Each pathology report is identified as either positive for recurrence, negative for recurrence\/not disease free, new tumor, or an &#8220;other&#8221; (no malignancy\/uncertain) class. Natural Language Processing techniques can extract meaningful information from clinical pathology reports, aiding in the identification of subtle indicators of recurrence by using relevant context. We use a hierarchical self-attention model (HiSAN) to construct document embeddings and classify the pathology report. To further enhance the predictive accuracy of our modeling approach we fuse the textual information from a pathology report with categorical data about patient&#8217;s cancer history. For each report, we create a patient context vector that encapsulates tumor-level information from patient&#8217;s previous cancer(s). The selected CTC records are associated with cancers diagnosed more than 120 days before the date of biospecimen collection stated in the pathology report. The patient context vector is crafted based on diverse categorical features; including cancer staging, patient age, treatment and sites of metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Features are represented using a combination of one-hot encoding and binning. Additionally, we employ patient and feature-level normalization to maintain proportional significance of features for individuals with multiple past diagnoses. We present preliminary results corresponding to different approaches for classifying cancer recurrence; first, we observe that using only the pathology reports as input yields an accuracy of 68%. Secondly, when using only CTC features with an XGBoost model, we achieve an accuracy of 49%. Finally we show that leveraging multiple data modalities, i.e. HiSAN generated pathology report embeddings and CTC data, significantly improves the model&#8217;s predictive accuracy to 76%. This research demonstrates a promising path forward in enhancing classification of clinical text by incorporating longitudinal patient history data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Recurrence,Deep learning,Multimodal,Surveillance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"P.

However, preclinical development as well as quantification of therapeutic potency and resistance require differential labeling of cells with fluorescent dyes or transgenic fluorescent proteins, which may dysregulate the effector cell function or produce undesired cytotoxicity. Deep learning-based image analysis allows the use of brightfield images to co-localize tumor organoids (TOs) with effector cells, and measure TO-specific responses to novel candidate immunotherapies in a label-free manner; this can accelerate their evaluation as therapeutic candidates in cancer patients and shed light on tumor-immune interaction mechanisms.<br \/>Here we record multi-day time-lapse confocal microscopy images of TOs co-cultured with NK cells at increasing concentrations of target to effector cells. Two pre-trained U-Net convolutional neural networks are used to separately segment tumor and immune cells from the brightfield channel, and quantify immune cell infiltration over time. TO segmentation masks are registered with a vital dye (caspase 3\/7) channel to selectively quantify TO cell death and correlate it with estimated immune cell infiltration across a large cohort of patient-derived TO models (including breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, liver, lung and pancreatic cancer), at increasing concentrations of 6 different NK cell types (identified as A through F).<br \/>We find that the estimated density of infiltrating immune cells is highly correlated with TO death, as quantified by fluorescence intensity of caspase over time (median Pearson&#8217;s r=0.89, P&#60;0.001). Higher ratios of effector to target cells lead to higher activation of NK cells as measured by infiltrating cell density. Differential infiltration dynamics are observed across TOs and immune cell lines, as peak infiltration density is affected by co-culture time, ratio of target to effector cells, TO line, and NK cell type. These findings highlight that the paired segmentation models are able to measure varying degrees of infiltration across different types of immune cells and TO models.<br \/>The approach described here is highly scalable and only requires capturing brightfield images of the assay, therefore eliminating the need to label cells and avoiding phototoxic effects or alteration of the immune cells activity. Time series measurements enable quantification of patterns of immune cell activation, including infiltration, migration and co-localization dynamics, which provide insights into the pharmacokinetics and mechanisms for specific immune therapies. Overall, this methodology enables high throughput screening of many therapeutic candidates across dozens to hundreds of unique TO-models, thereby facilitating targeted precision therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Immunotherapy,Immune cell infiltration,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.
