[{"Abstract":"Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that intratumoral oncolytic viruses (OVs) can convert &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;hot&#8221; and overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. However, their modest clinical efficacy to date highlights major gaps in our understanding of how OVs interact with the immune system, and very limited information is available regarding the specificity of the T cell repertoires that emerge within tumors in response to OV therapy.<br \/>To address these gaps, we interrogated the evolution of immune response to OV therapy in mice using oncolytic Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). Leveraging a bilateral flank melanoma mouse model, we identified and phenotypically characterized anti-viral and anti-tumor T cells in local and abscopal tumors with single cell (sc) RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Intratumoral NDV therapy to a single flank tumor resulted in increased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both the injected and distant tumors, higher TCR overlap between treated and distant tumors, and higher frequency of convergent TCR clonotypes, suggesting their non-random expansion, albeit without specificity information.<br \/>To identify the specificity of the emergent TCR clones in an unbiased fashion, we developed an approach based on adoptive transfer of T cells from tumor-bearing control or NDV-treated donor mice into congenically marked recipients with either B16 or NDV antigen stimulation. This allowed the isolation and identification of expanded B16- or virus-specific TCR clones that were then linked to donor tumors to define their relative frequencies, their distribution across the treated and distant tumors, and their associated phenotypic states. We observed significantly greater expansion of B16-reactive T cells adoptively transferred from NDV-treated donors (compared to control donors), suggesting that NDV therapy leads to potentiation of tumor-specific immune response. Intriguingly, virus-specific and tumor-specific T cells appeared to distribute to distinct phenotypic clusters, with virus-specific and tumor-specific T cells found predominantly in the activated-dysfunctional and proliferating clusters, respectively. When looking at the distribution of the TCR clones, virus-specific clones dominated the majority of the response in both treated and distant tumors, despite the lack of virus injection in distant tumors. These results provide insights into understanding the balance between virus- and tumor-directed immune responses elicited by OV therapy and highlight that even in the presence of significant abscopal immune effect, the significant proportion of T cells in &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors represent anti-viral rather than anti-tumor response. These findings provide tools for tracking of immune response specificity and generate rationale for development of OV engineering strategies and combinations that favor anti-tumor rather than anti-viral immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,T cell,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

I-DXd has demonstrated clinical efficacy in adults with heavily pretreated solid tumors (Patel et al., ESMO 2023). We previously reported that I-DXd induced objective responses in PDX models for multiple B7-H3 (<i>CD276<\/i>) expressing pediatric histologies, including rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumor. We extend these results with dose-response testing and include an isotype control ADC (IC-ADC) to evaluate whether B7-H3 expression is required for optimal response.<br \/>Methods: PDX models were dosed with vehicle, I-DXd, or IC-ADC, the latter two at 1, 3, and 10 mg\/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15. Testing was performed using 5 animals per treatment group. Activity was assessed by the PIVOT objective response measure (ORM) (Ped Blood Cancer 2007;49:928-940) that defines objective response as partial, complete, or maintained complete response (PR, CR, and MCR) compared to stable disease (SD) or progressive disease, with or without growth delay (PD2 and PD1, respectively).<br \/>Results: I-DXd showed dose-dependent activity with MCR for all 5 models at 10 mg\/kg. PR or MCR responses were observed in 4 of 5 models to I-DXd at 3 mg\/kg, with no objective responses to I-DXd at 1 mg\/kg. Only the RMS model showed objective response to IC-ADC. For all models I-DXd was significantly more active than IC-ADC.<br \/>Conclusions: We confirm significant anti-tumor activity for I-DXd<b> <\/b>for multiple pediatric solid tumors with B7-H3 expression and provide evidence of a dose response effect for I-DXd and for enhanced efficacy for I-DXd versus IC-ADC. Testing in additional preclinical models (neuroblastoma and glioblastoma) is underway. Due to the uniform high expression of B7-H3 in multiple pediatric histologies, I-DXd warrants evaluation for clinical activity in pediatric solid tumor patients.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{00537290-B5A3-4389-8571-F7552136AE9D}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"9\"><b>Activity for DS-7300a and Isotype Control using the PIVOT Objective Response Measure (ORM)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"9\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Line<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IHC B7-H3 H-Score<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Diagnosis<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">DS-7300a<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Isotype Control<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 mg\/kg<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 mg\/kg<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 mg\/kg<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 mg\/kg<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 mg\/kg<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 mg\/kg<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS-9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">230<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Osteosarcoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OS-33<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">240<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Osteosarcoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SD<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Rh30<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">140<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Rhabdomyosarcoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT11<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">150<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Wilms tumor<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Felix<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">210<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Neuroblastoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Preclinical testing,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Multiple immunotherapy clinical trials have found no evidence of immune reactivity against RMS, which has been attributed to the relatively low tumor mutation burden in these cancers. However, we made an unexpected observation that many patient RMS tumors had a near absence of MHC-I expression, a key requisite for anti-tumor CD8+ T lymphocytes and many immunotherapies. In this study, we explore the etiology of low antigen presentation in RMS and systematically evaluate therapeutic interventions that sensitize RMS to immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Surface MHC-I expression was evaluated on pediatric tumor cell lines (n=65) from five major pediatric tumor types. RNA-seq, whole exome and genome sequencing data were analyzed from RMS tumors (total of n=247) and iPSC models of skeletal muscle development (PMID: 32011235). Epigentic drugs targeting DNA methylation (decitabine), EZH2 (tazemetostat), Class I\/IV HDACs (mocetinostat), and LSD1 (GSK-LSD1) were used at sub-cytotoxic doses on RMS cell lines (n=10) and analyzed for surface MHC-I expression with flow cytometry and gene expression. T cell cytotoxicity assays were performed using engineered human T cells expressing an optimized TCR which recognizes an HLA*A2:01 restricted peptide from PRAME.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: RMS cell line models exhibited a range of MHC-I expression with most having low or undetectable MHC-I expression, similar to that of a known MHC-I negative tumor type <i>MYCN-<\/i>amplified neuroblastoma. Exome sequencing of RMS tumors showed no evidence of loss-of-function alterations in essential antigen processing and presentation (APP) pathway genes. Gene expression profiling by RNAseq and western blotting, however, revealed an absence of core APP genes in many RMS tumors and cell lines. We uncovered that during a specific window of embryonic myogenesis, APP is suppressed and that RMS tumors mimicking this state of development show the deepest loss of APP. Multiple classes of epigenetic drugs were evaluated to rescue APP in RMS. Treatment of RMS using a DNA demethylating agent or HDAC inhibitor exhibited the strongest MHC-I restoration across RMS models with no changes observed using LSD1 or EZH2 inhibitors. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that targeting the RMS antigen PRAME using TCR therapy is enhanced by the inclusion of epigenetic therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions and Significance<\/b>: We revealed that epigenetic suppression of APP is a new hallmark of RMS and normal embryonic skeletal muscle development. Pharmacological reversal of APP pathway downregulation could be achieved using drugs targeting DNA methylation or class I\/IV HDACs, and enhanced T cell cytotoxicity against RMS when used in combination. Overall, these findings may explain the historical lack of RMS responsiveness to immunotherapy and unlocks new immunotherapy strategies against RMS that rely on targeting MHC-I antigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Antigen presentation,Epigenetics,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>David Milewski<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hsien-Chao Chou<sup><\/sup>, Vineela Gangalapudi<sup><\/sup>, Meijie Tian<sup><\/sup>, Yong Kim<sup><\/sup>, Young Song<sup><\/sup>, Jun Wei<sup><\/sup>, Javed Khan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Cancer Inst. - Bethesda Campus, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ab93c4bc-380e-485c-a578-9a4d2fc7e81b","ControlNumber":"10329","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

RMS tumors are classified into four subtypes: embryonal, alveolar, spindle cell\/sclerosing, and pleomorphic. Treatment options for RMS include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy and regimens for patients with relapsed and metastatic RMS remain limited. However, a recent study has reported that pharmacological inhibitors targeting ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) are currently undergoing phase I\/II trials and may be utilized for the treatment of alveolar RMS. Interestingly, we identified that the gene signature of replication stress positively correlated with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expression in the cancer cell line database (CellMinerCDB, discover.nci.nih.gov\/cellminercdb; Pearson correlation (r)=0.66). DHFR is an important therapeutic target for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and its inhibitors are routinely used and clinically approved. DHFR inhibitors are known to exhibit their anticancer effects by inhibiting nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication. In this study, we aimed to explore a potential synergistic interaction using a combination treatment of ATR inhibitors (elimusertib and ceralasertib) and DHFR inhibitors (pralatrexate, methotrexate, and raltitrexated) in multiple RMS cell lines. We used a drug matrix reduction format and found that combined treatment of ATR inhibitors and DHFR inhibitors induced a synergistically decreased RMS cell viability, showing higher synergy in fusion-positive RMS cells than in fusion-negative RMS cells. Mechanistically, ATR inhibitors abrogated DNA damage response checkpoint CHK1 activation caused by DHFR inhibitor, leading to increased &#947;H2AX and decreased DNA replication activity. Accordingly, the accumulation of DNA damage in combination with ATR inhibitor and DHFR inhibitor triggered higher cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death than single agent treatment of DHFR inhibitor. Our findings warrant further research into identifying genomic regions where the DNA damage is enriched in combination treatment by using END-sequencing and synthesis-associated with repair sequencing (SAR-seq). In conclusion, this study provides promising rationale for the combination treatment of ATR and DHFR inhibitors to treat RMS patients, including those with advanced, relapsed, and metastatic states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,ATR,DNA damage response,DNA repair inhibition,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>U.

We sought to improve the efficacy of BAT by better understanding its molecular consequences in prostate cancer. Given that the androgen receptor (AR) regulates cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that SPA induces dependencies on specific metabolic pathways that might be exploited therapeutically. A negative selection metabolism-focused CRISPR-KO screen in LNCaP cells treated with SPA suggested that the deletion of several enzymes involved in de novo nucleotide synthesis enhances growth suppression by SPA. A top hit was cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1). CTPS1 converts UTP to CTP in the final step of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Exposure of SPA-treated prostate cancer cell lines to STP-B, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of CTPS1 (PMID 37008165), increased cell death in vitro and in vivo, indicating that CTPS1 constitutes a metabolic vulnerability in this context. Inhibition of CTPS1 with STP-B induced S phase cell cycle arrest and replication stress, as indicated by phosphorylation of RPA and CHEK proteins, which was augmented by treatment with SPA. CTPS1 likely becomes a vulnerability in SPA-treated prostate cancer due to the downregulation of MYC by SPA, which we found leads to a reduced abundance of enzymes required for nucleotide synthesis and nucleotides, particularly CTP. This rewires nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathway such that de novo synthesis of CTP is required to avoid replication stress and cell death. Altogether, this work suggests that inhibition of CTPS1 may enhance the efficacy of BAT through the induction of replication stress. Selective inhibitors of CTPS1 have entered clinical development (NCT05463263), increasing the feasibility of a combination therapy clinical trial design for patients with prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT),Nucleotide metabolism,Replication stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

AZD5335, an FR&#945;-targeting antibody conjugated to AZ&#8217;s proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, AZ14170132, is currently being investigated in the FONTANA Phase 1\/2 clinical trial (NCT05797168). Since homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) and mutations in genes involved with homologous recombination repair (HRRm+) are associated with sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, we evaluated the efficacy of AZD5335 in ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models assessed for HRRm, as described<sup>1<\/sup>. Sixteen ovarian cancer PDX models were each treated with a single dose of AZD5335 (5 mg\/kg IV). Of the HRRm- cohort, 8\/11 (73%) cohort responded to treatment with a tumor regression &#62;30% from baseline. In the HRRm+ cohort 4\/5 (80%) responded to AZD5335. PARP1 can act as a positive regulator of genomic stability by counteracting TOP1-induced DNA damage (Malanga and Althaus, 2004) that led to the hypothesis that the efficacy of TOP1i drugs can be enhanced by combination with PARP inhibitors. To evaluate for potential synergy of AZD5335 with the PARP1 inhibitor, saruparib (AZD5305): Three FR&#945;-expressing cancer cell lines, KB, IGROV-1 and OVCAR-3, were treated with AZD5335 +\/- saruparib, revealing evidence of synergistic cytotoxicity. These results encouraged us to investigate this combination in pre-clinical HRRm+ <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft models (OVCAR-3 and OV2022F). In OVCAR-3 xenograft models, single agent activity with saruparib (1 mg\/kg PO QD x28) was 37% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and with AZD5335 (0.625 mg\/kg IV x1) was 50% TGI while combined administration at the same doses improved TGI to 86%. Similar combinatorial activity was seen in OV2022F with TGI 61%, 54%, and 97% for saruparib, AZD5335, and saruparib +AZD5335, respectively. In conclusion, AZD5335 exhibits a similar degree of single agent antitumor activity in both HRRm+ and HRRm- preclinical models, and the efficacy can be potentiated by combining with the PARP inhibitor, saruparib. 1.

We and others have previously reported that propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist commonly used to treat heart disease and anxiety, increased the overall survival of patients with advanced angiosarcoma when used alone or incorporated into chemotherapy regimens. Treatment of angiosarcoma has been hampered by the relative lack of suitable models to analyze molecular responses to treatment. To overcome this hurdle and understand the vulnerability of angiosarcoma to propranolol, we capitalized on the similar morphological and clinical characteristics between human angiosarcoma and canine hemangiosarcoma, which occurs in thousands of dogs each year. The objectives for the PRO-DOX clinical trial were to assess tolerability and clinical benefit of propranolol in dogs with hemangiosarcoma when given as an adjunct to chemotherapy. We conducted a phase I study using a continuous reassessment model with three dose cohorts (0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 mg\/kg PO q 8 hrs) in dogs diagnosed with stage 1 or stage 2 splenic hemangiosarcoma. Following splenectomy, propranolol was onboarded using a dose escalation strategy over 12 days prior to the start of doxorubicin (30 mg\/m2 intravenously every three weeks, five rounds). Twenty dogs were enrolled and distributed across the dose cohorts based on the study design. One dog in the highest cohort experienced acute hypotension after six months on propranolol, which resolved with dose reduction. Although a statistically significant survival benefit was not seen in this study when compared to historic controls, a subset of dogs (n=8 or 40%) exceeded the expected survival of 4-6 months. Notably, three dogs diagnosed at or below age five survived over two years. Gene expression analysis of tumors obtained from the short-, mid-, and long-term survivors revealed sets of genes associated with immune responses (e.g. lymphocyte activation, positive regulation of T cell activation), antigen processing, cell adhesion, and mitochondrial metabolism in the long-term survivor group. Our findings suggest that age (&#60; 6 years) may predict a favorable outcome, and immune mediated responses differ between the short and long-term survivors. Ongoing experiments seek to define the specific molecular properties and immune responses contributing to these outcomes, with potential implications for human angiosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Combination therapy,Doxorubicin,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

AR is a nuclear hormone receptor that stimulates anabolic cell metabolism. We hypothesized that the high activity of AR in prostate cancer creates unique dependencies on cellular machinery to support this high rate of anabolism. We observed that androgen treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer resulted in increased abundance of <i>MYO1E<\/i>, a class I myosin that facilitates intracellular vesicular trafficking, in tumor biopsies. Similarly, MYO1E protein increased in AR+ prostate cancer cell lines upon treatment with androgens. Notably, a specific small molecule inhibitor of MYO1E, pentachloropseudilin (PClP), induced cell death of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2-4uM, but was non-toxic to AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. Expression of AR in these AR-negative lines conferred sensitivity to PClP, while deletion of AR in an AR-positive line conferred resistance to PClP, indicating that AR expression was required and sufficient for sensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines to PClP. Previous studies have suggested that AR globally increases protein synthesis and proteotoxic stress, and we asked whether this may create a dependency on MYO1E for secretion of protein-containing vesicles to manage proteotoxic stress. Initial experiments suggest that AR increases global rates of protein synthesis, as assessed by puromycin-incorporation assays, and inhibition of MYO1E increases phosphorylation of EIF2A, suggestive of activation of the integrated stress response.

It is most prevalent in Southeast Asia with a high incidence rate of ~15\/100,000. While mutations of the MAPK pathways are found in nearly one-fifth of head &#38; neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in Western countries (TCGA-HNSCC Firehose cohort, N=512), and some of which are druggable in HNSCC setting (e.g. <i>MAPK1<\/i> and <i>HRAS <\/i>mutations), we sought to determine the cumulative mutational rate of this potentially druggable pathway in 164 micro-dissected NPC cases using recently published next-generation sequencing data (98 whole-exome and 63 whole-genome-sequenced cases). An overall rate of 9.32% cases of NPC harbored MAPK pathway mutations (16 mutations in 15 tumors). Four genes are recurrently mutated: 4 <i>NRAS<\/i> (all Q61R\/L hotspot mutations), 3 <i>HRAS<\/i> (G12S, Q61R, S106L), 2 <i>BRAF<\/i> (R726H, Y647*), and 2 <i>SHC4<\/i> (Q519R, A552T) mutations. Among which, both patients bearing <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations died of NPC, suggestive of the biological importance of <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations in NPC progression. Prompted by an independent clinical report on an advanced NPC patient with somatic co-mutations of <i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E and <i>KRAS<\/i>p.G12D being sensitive to the B-raf\/C-raf inhibitor sorafenib, we first examined the biological functions and potential druggability of this particular <i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E mutation in NPC, as it<i> <\/i>represents a hotspot mutation site across 20 cancer types (<i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E\/A\/R\/V\/* found in 137\/70655 pan-cancer samples, cBioPortal). Based on the NPC clinical report, we hypothesized that this <i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E hotspot mutation could drive NPC tumorigenesis and might be potentially sensitive to the B-raf inhibitor sorafenib. By ectopic expression of <i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E mutation, <i>BRAF<\/i>-wildtype (wt) and <i>EGFP<\/i>-control gene into a recently developed <u>E<\/u>pstein-<u>B<\/u>arr <u>v<\/u>irus-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma [EBV(+)NPC] cell line, NPC43, we determined the biological functions of this mutation in NPC. We showed that NPC43-<i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E-expressing cells significantly drove a 4-fold increase in 3D tumoroid growth vs. <i>BRAF<\/i>-wt and <i>EGFP<\/i>-control cells on day 7 (flat-bottom low attachment plates). Further, wound healing assay demonstrated a significantly higher migration rate of NPC43-<i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E cells achieving ~80% wound healing (at 96h) vs. 30% and 10% healing in <i>BRAF<\/i>-wt and <i>EGFP<\/i>-control cells. Lastly, our preliminary drug study showed that NPC43-<i>BRAF<\/i>p.G469E cells displayed higher sensitivity to low dose sorafenib (33.3nM and 100nM) than <i>BRAF-<\/i>wt and <i>EGFP<\/i>-control cells, achieving ~20% and 30% growth inhibition at 72h, vs. no growth inhibition in control cells. Thus, <i>BRA<\/i>Fp.G469E hotspot mutation can drive NPC tumorigenesis, and may confer sensitivity to raf inhibitors such as sorafenib in NPC. Potential druggability of other <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations in NPC should be investigated.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> The study was supported by Research Impact Fund (R4015-19F), Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong SAR during 6\/29\/20-9\/7\/21.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Head and neck cancers,Precision medicine,RAF kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Its well-known genetic heterogeneity presents a major challenge for precision medicine development. We report a newly developed panel of 20 HNSCC patient-derived cultures (HNSCC-PDCs) from advanced or recurrent HNSCC, with comprehensive somatic and germline characterization for precision medicine (PM) discovery. The PDCs retain genetic heterogeneity of the original patient tumors, and xenografts of which also phenocopied HNSCC patient tumors. Importantly, somatic and germline events that were never or seldom captured by long-established HNSCC cell lines are represented by the PDC panel, including <i>HRAS-CASP8<\/i> co-mutations, <i>EGFR-AS1<\/i> germline mutation, exonic germline <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation, sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway and FGFR pathway mutations. We hypothesize that drug screening with this newly developed HNSCC-PDC panel that recapitulates HNSCC patient genetics may identify new gene-drug sensitivity relationships for precision medicine development in advanced HNSCC. Here, data from our pilot drug screen of 38 selected FDA approved\/Phase I-II clinical trial agents first reveal: 1) HNSCC-PDC with the hotspot <i>HRAS<\/i>p.G13R, together with <i>CASP8<\/i>p.L183S, is sensitive to tipifarnib vs. tipifarnib-resistance in a long-established HNSCC cell line, SNU899 with the same <i>HRAS<\/i> mutation. Subsequent high-content imaging cell death assay further demonstrates a dose-dependent tipifarnib-induced cell death in <i>HRAS<\/i>p.G13R-mutated PDC, but not in SNU-899; 2) <i>TP53-EP300<\/i> co-mutated HNSCC-PDCs are most sensitive to cisplatin with ~340 nM sensitivity (mean IC<sub>50<\/sub>) among all PDCs tested, which is 22 times more sensitive than that reported in Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) HNSCC cell lines; 3) <i>EGFR-AS1<\/i> (c.2361G&#62;A)-germline mutated PDCs, and <i>MAPK1<\/i>-mutated PDCs, are both hypersensitive to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi: erlotinib and mobocertinib), which independently credentialed gene-drug sensitivity relationships reported in exceptional responders in HNSCC clinical trials. Further signaling investigation in PDC models demonstrates phospho-MAPK activation as a reliable surrogate biomarker for EGFRi sensitivity in HNSCC; 4) <i>FRS3<\/i>-mutated PDCs are sensitive to FDA-approved FGFR pathway inhibitors; and 5) <i>TP53<\/i>-wildtype HNSCC-PDCs are 150-fold more sensitive to novel p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors vs. <i>TP53<\/i>-mutated PDCs, a phenomenon that cannot be captured in long-established <i>TP53<\/i>-wildtype HNSCC cell lines. Lastly, 4 pan-PDC effective agents are identified with nM sensitivities and high drug activities (i.e. drug-induced growth inhibition) in more than half of our PDC models. These include 3 FDA-approved agents, TAK-981, Selinexor (a novel XPO1 inhibitor), and trametinib, as well as the preclinical agent JQ1. In conclusion, our pilot HNSCC-PDC drug screen identifies new gene-drug sensitivity relationships for HNSCC PM development and new pan-effective agents for advanced HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Precision medicine,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuen Keng Ng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenying Piao<sup>2<\/sup>, Cecilia Pik Yuk Lau<sup>3<\/sup>, Peony Hiu Yan Poon<sup>2<\/sup>, Tin Yu Samuel Law<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Ying Kuen Chan<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuxiong Su<sup>5<\/sup>, Chin Wang Lau<sup>6<\/sup>, Zigui Chen<sup>7<\/sup>, Laura Ren Huey Ip<sup>2<\/sup>, Thomas Chung-Kit Yeung<sup>2<\/sup>, Sai Fung Yeung<sup>2<\/sup>, Jason Hoi-Lam Ngan<sup>2<\/sup>, Zoey Wing Yee Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Noah R.

Yet, most of these genetic aberrations remain undruggable. <i>Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)<\/i> is somatically mutated in ~3.6% of HNSCC (18\/504 cases, TCGA-HNSCC Firehose cohort, USA), and the majority of these <i>ALK<\/i>-mutated HNSCC cases are of advanced stage diseases. Here, we hypothesized that <i>ALK<\/i> mutations might plausibly contribute to HNSCC progression and could be potentially druggable. Unexpectedly, analysis of HNSCC genomic events revealed a novel co-occurrence relationship between <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> genomic aberrations in TCGA-HNSCC Firehose cohort (Odds Ratio=2.41; N=522 samples with CNV data), with subsequent validation in an independent metastatic MSK-MetTropism HNSCC cohort (Odds Ratio=5.12; N=412). Consistent with this newly identified co-occurrence relationship, we showed that all 7 HNSCC-relevant<i> ALK<\/i> point mutations were potent drivers for HNSCC invasiveness and clonogenic growth only in corroboration with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> aberrations in HNSCC cell models, highlighting the functional importance of this novel <i>ALK\/PIK3CA<\/i> cooperativity in HNSCC, likely reminiscent of <i>ALK\/MYCN<\/i> cooperativity in neuroblastoma. Further, by clonogenic assay, we demonstrated pharmacologic vulnerabilities of all 7 <i>ALK<\/i> point mutations (including extracellular domain mutations) to ALK targeting by ceritinib in FaDu cell background with endogenous <i>PIK3CA <\/i>amplification. Strikingly, we were able to capture, for the first time, spontaneous emergence of a druggable <i>ALK<\/i> somatic mutation directly from a <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-altered HNSCC patient-derived culture (PDC) upon forced acquisition of anoikis-resistance <i>ex vivo<\/i> (PDC-25-AR), demonstrating co-evolution of <i>ALK\/PIK3CA<\/i> aberrations in HNSCC likely associated with cancer progression. Patient-derived culture-xenograft (PDCx) of PDC-25-AR displayed remarkable sensitivity to ALK targeting, PI3K targeting, as well as their combination, with induction of apoptosis in these tumors compared to vehicle control.

These lesions may evolve into carcinomas, eventually spreading to the ovary and peritoneum. Recent research in normal tissues and gynecologic liquid biopsies of individuals without HGSC has demonstrated that somatic <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations accumulate and clonally expand with age, suggesting that <i>TP53<\/i> somatic evolution is part of the normal aging process&#8203;. To date, however, <i>TP53 <\/i>somatic evolution in the normal fallopian tube epithelium has not been characterized and it is unknown whether <i>TP53<\/i>mutations are more abundant in individuals with germline mutations in <i>BRCA1 <\/i>or <i>BRCA2 <\/i>(<i>BRCA <\/i>carriers) who are at a higher risk of developing HGSC&#8203;. In this study, we aimed to characterize age-related <i>TP53 <\/i>somatic mutations in the normal fallopian tube epithelium across the human lifespan and to determine whether the <i>TP53 <\/i>mutational landscape is altered in <i>BRCA<\/i> carriers.<b> <\/b>Our cohort consisted of 46 autopsy cases (age: 0-91 years) from individuals at low-risk of developing ovarian cancer and 48 prophylactic surgery cases (age: 32-69 years) from <i>BRCA <\/i>carriers. Fallopian tube tissues were collected, frozen, and macrodissected using a 1mm biopsy punch, enriching for the fallopian tube epithelium. DNA was extracted from each sample and sequenced for <i>TP53 <\/i>using ultra-deep duplex sequencing (mean depth: ~12,000x). Pathogenicity was determined using a machine learning algorithm (AlphaMissense) and a well-established predictor of <i>TP53<\/i> pathogenicity (Seshat). Preliminary analyses in the normal fallopian tube epithelium collected across human lifespan demonstrated that the mutational profile (e.g. indels, splice, nonsense, missense, and silent mutations) in the aging fallopian tubes mirrored the mutational profile of HGSC. We also observed that the number of unique <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations and pathogenic clones increased with age, revealing <i>TP53 <\/i>somatic evolution. Additionally, the number of large <i>TP53<\/i> mutant clones (&#62;2 duplex mutant reads) increased exponentially with age, staring at age 30. When comparing the fallopian tubes of <i>BRCA <\/i>carriers to age-matched normal fallopian tubes, the percentage of pathogenic large clones in <i>BRCA<\/i> carriers was 22.8% vs. 6.0% in low-risk individuals (Fisher exact test, p &#60; 0.0001), suggesting increased <i>TP53<\/i> somatic evolution in the fallopian tubes of <i>BRCA<\/i> carriers.

While the safety profile of T-DXd is manageable, ILD is an important identified risk and considered as an Adverse Event (AE) of special interest (Powell et al ESMO Open 2022). The therapeutic options for patients that develop ILD are limited to steroid medications, including prednisone and methylprednisolone. Hence, a greater understanding of T-DXd-associated ILD pathophysiology has the potential to guide alternative interventions to prevent ILD progression and improve patient care. Here, we used advanced human lung models to explore if T-DXd can affect pulmonary epithelial cell homeostasis and function. Transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis of bronchial epithelial cells cultured under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions revealed that genes and pathways associated with senescence, inflammation, and barrier integrity were dysregulated upon treatment with T-DXd. These transcriptomic findings linked to senescence and inflammation were confirmed in follow-up ALI experiments where T-DXd was shown to activate the p53 pathway, and upregulate pro-senescence, -inflammatory and -fibrotic mediators. Similarly, T-DXd activated senescence- and inflammation-associated markers in a microphysiological alveolar lung-on-chip system, thus indicating that T&#8209;DXd has similar effects in alveoli epithelia. In addition, T-DXd induced epithelial injury of ALI cells, which was reflected by loss of barrier function and release of epithelial damage markers. These changes were also accompanied by upregulation of mesenchymal cell markers, suggesting cells transition to a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype. Whereas the payload (deruxtecan; DXd) and IgG control antibody-DXd conjugate (IgG-DXd) could recapitulate effects measured with T-DXd on lung epithelial cells, trastuzumab did not have any effect, suggesting limited contribution of HER2 targeting to T-DXd-induced epithelial changes in the experimental models used. Altogether, these data demonstrate that DXd can drive epithelial mechanisms and pathways associated with pulmonary fibrosis, inflammation, and damage, which are dysregulated events observed in ILD. Ongoing studies aim to evaluate the translation of these discoveries to the clinic and to support the development of novel therapeutic strategies to manage or prevent ILD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-01 Biology of cell and tissue damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.
