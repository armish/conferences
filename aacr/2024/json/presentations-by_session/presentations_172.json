[{"Abstract":"Background: Radiotherapy (RT) has a pivotal role in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), providing effective tumor control and functional preservation. Hypoxia is a cause of radioresistance in HNSCC. We have developed an oxygen saturation endoscopic imaging (OXEI) method to assess real-time tissue oxygenation levels. However, the clinical significance of OXEI in patients with HNSCC receiving RT remains unclear. We evaluated the association between pretreatment tumor oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2<\/sub>) quantified by OXEI and clinical outcomes of patients with HNSCC receiving RT.<br \/>Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with HNSCC scheduled to receive RT at 2 institutions. The primary endpoint was the association between pretreatment tumor StO<sub>2<\/sub> and complete response (CR) rate 8 weeks after completion of RT. Secondary endpoints evaluated the impact of StO<sub>2<\/sub> on 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates after RT initiation. We also evaluated the cumulative incidence of local failure (LF). To explore the relationship between tumor hypoxia assessed by OXEI and gene expression profile, we performed RNA sequencing of 4 tumor samples collected from 2 patients (2 samples\/patient) before RT. The hypoxia score for each sample was calculated by gene set variation analysis based on HNSCC mRNA-based hypoxia signatures. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to evaluate whether the biological pathways (Hallmark, Reactome, and KEGG gene sets) showed significant associations with tumor hypoxia.<br \/>Results: Of the 50 patients enrolled from March 2019 to February 2022, we analyzed 37 who underwent RT and OXEI. Thirty-six (97%) patients received current platinum-based chemotherapy. The median (range) pretreatment tumor StO<sub>2<\/sub> of 60 (45-84)% was lower than that of normal mucosa, 66 (56-84)% (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). Patients with tumor StO<sub>2<\/sub> &#60; 60% were classified as the hypoxia group (n =19), and those with tumor StO<sub>2<\/sub> &#8805; 60% as the non-hypoxia group (n =18). The CR rate 8 weeks after RT was not significantly different between the hypoxia and non-hypoxia groups (84% vs. 100%, respectively; <i>P<\/i> = 0.23). After a median (range) follow-up of 33 (9-45) months, the hypoxia group had worse 1-year PFS (74% vs. 94%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.017) and OS (89% vs. 100%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.015) and higher LF rates (21% vs. 6%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.036) compared with the non-hypoxia group. RNA sequencing confirmed that tumor StO<sub>2 <\/sub>reflected expression-based hypoxia scores. GSEA showed upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and KEAP1-NFE2L2 pathways in hypoxic samples (StO<sub>2<\/sub> of 59%) compared with non-hypoxic samples (StO<sub>2<\/sub> of 70%; adjusted <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01), consistent with the fact that hypoxic stress increases ROS production.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that pretreatment tumor StO<sub>2<\/sub> quantified by OXEI correlates with 1-year PFS, OS, and LF rates of patients with HNSCC receiving RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Clinical radiotherapeutic studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Hypoxia,Image analysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Surgery is the primary treatment, and while radiation may reduce the risk of local recurrence, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain. Therefore, it is crucial to develop reliable predictions for personalized care and improved management. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the survival of patients with intracranial HPC.<br \/>Methods: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2000-2019). Patients with other malignancies or lack of pathological diagnosis were excluded. T-tests and chi-square tests compared variables, while Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests, and Cox regression identified prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Patient records were randomly divided into training (80 %) and validation (20 %) sets. Univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to identify the significant factors linked to survival, which were used to establish a nomogram for predicting the 3- and 5-year OS and CSS.<br \/>Results: Of the 367 included patients, 121 underwent surgery and 246 underwent surgery + ART. The median survival time was 54 months. Patients who underwent surgery had 5-year OS rates of 61% and 86% for CSS, while those treated with surgery + ART had 81% and 96% survival rates, respectively. The two treatment groups showed significant differences in the OS and CSS (p&#60;0.022 and p&#60;0.017, respectively). Age &#8805; 50 years was a poor prognostic factor for OS, whereas ART, localized stage and regional stage were good prognostic factors. No significant factors were associated with CSS. To construct the OS Nomogram, three predictors, age, stage, and treatment method, were chosen. In the training and validation sets, the C-indices are 0.799 and 0.736, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the 3- and 5-year OS in the training set were 0.594 and 0.617, respectively, whereas those in the validation set were 0.56 and 0.59. For the CSS nomogram, two factors, age and stage, were utilized. The C-indices for the training and validation sets are 0.814 and 0.774, respectively. In the training set, the AUCs for 3- and 5-year CSS were 0.585 and 0.605, respectively, and 0.563 in the validation set. The most important risk factor was the distant stage, while the most important protective factor was age less than 50 years.<br \/>Conclusion: This study shows that ART has a significant impact on the treatment of Intracranial HPC and provides better survival outcomes. ML has been used to create prediction models to support personalized patient care. These findings provide valuable insights into the management of this rare brain tumor and the potential of data-driven approaches to improve treatment and outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Clinical radiotherapeutic studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Machine learning,Prognosis,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the clinical significance and mechanisms of lncRNAs in malignant progression are unknown.<br \/>Methods: LINC01770 expression was determined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, and its prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were used to determine the potential function of LINC01770, and its biological effects were investigated using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments. Mass spectrometry-coupled RNA pull-down assays and western blotting identified LINC01770 interacting proteins, followed by confirmation using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Ferroptosis and lipid peroxidation were detected using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: LINC01770 was overexpressed in NPC tissues according to microarray screening. Patients with NPC showing high LINC01770 expression experienced shorter survival and worse prognosis. <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments suggested that knockdown of LINC01770 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NPC cells. Sequencing and functional complementation experiments showed that LINC01770 regulates the proliferation and metastasis of NPC through TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1). Meanwhile, RIP and PCR experiments suggested that LINC01770 and TEAD1 were common targets of microRNAs miR-615-5p and miR-1293. Overexpression of LINC01770 promoted ferroptosis <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> through the TEAD1\/Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4)\/transferrin receptor (TFRC) pathway.<br \/>Conclusions: LINC01770 is a prognostic biomarker for NPC and participates in the regulation of TEAD1 signaling pathway through competitive binding to miRNA-615-5p and miRNA-1293, resulting in NPC metastasis and progression. Radiation resistant cells are in a delicate balance between lipid peroxidation and increased vulnerability to ferroptosis, suggesting that ferroptosis could be used to kill NPC cells and reverse their radiotherapy resistance during the malignant progression of NPC caused by high expression of LINC01770. Thus, inducing ferroptosis could be used to treat recurrent and refractory NPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Radioresistance,Long noncoding RNA,Ferroptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Emerging evidence indicated the involvement of estrogen receptor&#946; (ER&#946;) signaling in BC progression and the association of ER signaling with DNA repair pathways which are involved in radio-resistance. Therefore, we evaluated the association between ER&#946; signaling and the sensitivity to BC cells.<br \/>Methods: We compared the inhibitory effect of RT on BC cell viability between ER&#946; positive [5637 and T24 expressing control short-heparin RNA (shRNA)] and ER&#946; negative (5637 and T24 expressing ER&#946;-shRNA) cells. Moreover, we compared DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via &#947;-H2AX foci formation, as well as the expression levels of DNA repair genes, in these cells after RT. Finally, in a mouse xenograft model, we evaluated it on the growth of ER&#946; positive tumor treated with radiation combined with mock or tamoxifen treatment.<br \/>Results: <i>In vitro<\/i> experiment showed that ionizing radiation reduced the numbers of viable cells in ER&#946; negative cells more significantly than those in ER&#946; positive cells. Moreover, tamoxifen treatment reduced the numbers of viable cells more than mock treatment in ER&#946; positive cells, while tamoxifen didn&#8217;t show significant effects in ER&#946; negative cells. The down-regulation of ER&#946; resulted in a delay in DSB repair 4-24 hours after RT. We then established radio-resistant cells and confirmed considerable elevation of the expression of ER&#946; as well as DNA repair genes including RAD51 and RAD54. Estradiol treatment induced the expression of these genes and tamoxifen abolished these effects. Finally, in vivo experiment showed that tamoxifen enhanced the cytotoxic effects of RT in xenograft bearing mice.<br \/>Conclusions: These results indicated that ER&#946; signaling inversely correlated with sensitivity to RT in BC. Thus, ER&#946; inhibition have a potential of enhancing the cytotoxic effects of radiation, especially in ER&#946; positive BC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Estrogen receptor &#946;,Radiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

In our studies, PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR inhibitors, anti-angiogenesis therapies, CDK4\/6 inhibitors, DDR interventions, epigenetic modifications, and immunotherapy-containing regimens will be future combination options. The genomic signature of TW2.6 has been figured out in our study(AACR2020 &#38; 2023), too, mainly with PIK3CA H1047R mutation, high TMB(8.42 muts \/Mb)\/MSS, VEGF-A amplification, p53\/MYC\/HRAS\/DDR2\/ PDGFRbeta\/EPHB1\/ATM mutations, FAT1 loss, amplification of TERT\/ FGF10\/CCND3\/SOX9\/IL-7R\/SDHA\/RICTOR\/FLCN, CDK12\/PTPRD loss of function, CDK8 mutation, &#38; deletions of STK11\/ARID1B\/MITF\/TNFAIP3 and molecularly-guided novel interventions will be designed. Purpose &#38; Methods: Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor(volasertib), gluconate(blocking citrate transport &#38; glucose metabolism), IAP inhibitor(Debio1143), glutaminase 1 inhibitor(CB839) were tested on TW2.6 to evaluate synergistic effects with radiation. Results: TW2.6 was resistant to volasertib, gluconate, or radiation alone; but sensitive to Debio1143 and CB839. Volasertib significantly enhanced radiation. The flow cytometry revealed volasertib and radiation resulted in a significant G2\/M arrest. Western blotting showed volasertib and radiation increased p-histone3, p-CDK1, &#38; cyclin B levels and induced apoptosis. Gluconate, CB839, or Debio1143 each had significant synergistic effects with radiation. The radiosensitization efficacy would be volasertib&#62;gluconate&#62;CB839&#62;Debio1143. Conclusions: In Taiwan, patients with R\/M HNSCC progressing within 3 months after CCRT could be rescued by early ICIs. Recently, sequential CCRT followed by ICI or Debio-1143 with CCRT showed potential survival benefits. In our studies, novel agents such as PLK inhibitor, gluconate, and CB839 had even better radiosensitization compared with Debio1143.

Ionizing radiation (IR) and some chemotherapeutics strategically target cancer cells by causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, cancers like GBM often develop resistance to DSB-inducing therapeutics due to dysregulated DNA repair. Homologous Recombination (HR) is an error-free DSB-repair process consisting of proteins that are often dysregulated in GBM, causing overactive DNA-repair, therapy resistance, and poor patient outcomes. Proteins involved in the HR-repair process have been extensively investigated; however, therapeutic resistance remains common. Here, we provide an alternative approach to target DSB-resistant GBM by modulating the dNTP pool instead of solely targeting DNA-repair proteins. Our goal is to understand the interplay between dNTP pools and DSB- repair. dNTPs are a necessary constituent to repair DSBs; however, the role of the dNTP pool in DNA damage repair is not fully understood. Previous research shows that the dNTP pool remains unchanged after inducing DSBs, highlighting the importance of a tightly regulated dNTP pool. Using a neutral comet assay, we quantified accumulated double-stranded breaks in different treatment groups. We then analyzed these groups using immunofluorescent microscopy to examine distinct proteins involved in HR-mediated repair. We carried out RNA sequencing analysis to determine differential gene expression. We quantified cell viability and apoptotic cell populations via flow cytometry and Alamar blue assays. We determined protein interactions using immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assays. We found that increasing the dNTP pool prior to IR treatment led to impaired DNA DSB repair in GBM cells as determined by a neutral comet assay. When analyzing key proteins involved in HR via immunofluorescence, we observed a significant decrease in RPA70 localization to the DNA damage site, indicating a disruption in end resection, a necessary phase of HR. Our RNA sequencing results show that increasing the dNTP pool in LN229 GBM cells prior to IR treatment caused significant changes in gene expression when compared to IR treatment alone. The most impacted pathways most were apoptosis, p53 cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. The pathway analysis has identified genes of interest in the synergistic dNTP + IR treatment model. Significant increases in apoptosis and decreases in viability were observed 48 hours after inducing DSBs in LN229 cells with elevated dNTP pools. Not only do these data suggest that HR efficiency is reduced due to end resection impairment, but they also show that as a result, cell viability is destabilized due to prolonged DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis. The identification of this impairment may be essential in finding novel therapeutic approaches to sensitize therapy resistant GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,Homologous recombination,Combination therapy,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Previous reports from Dr. Julie Schwarz&#8217;s laboratory have shown that cervical cancer cells with altered AKT\/mTOR pathways show increased reliance on glucose and exogenous glutamine. The laboratory has introduced PIK3CA E545K mutation and PTEN null mutation in cervical cancer cell line SiHa. Further, to evaluate the role of glutamine metabolism in these genotypes, these cells were cultured in sequentially lower levels of glutamine until these cells were able to proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation. These isogenic long-term glutamine-deprived (QD) cells allow us to tease out the role of these specific mutations in cellular metabolism. In our study, long-term glutamine deprivation inhibits the proliferation of rapidly proliferating PI3K-AKT-altered cell lines. Even though glutamine is required for GSH synthesis, which quenches reactive oxygen species, QD cells were refractory to cisplatin and irradiation. Since PI3K-AKT altered were dependent on exogenous glutamine, it was expected that QD cells would have lower GLS levels to inhibit glutaminolysis. However, GLS levels in WT and QD were similar. Altogether, these data indicate that in PI3K-AKT altered cervical tumor glutamine antagonists can reduce tumor proliferation. Further glutamine reduction does not alter GLS levels and hence GLS can be targeted as well to further improve treatment outcomes. To evaluate the alternate metabolic dependencies in cervical cancer tumors, both cellular as well as secreted metabolites were evaluated. To identify alternative pathways that are activated in these glutamine-deprived cell lines, we cultured these cells in uniformly labeled 13C glucose. Mass spectrometric studies also evaluated the protein levels of various metabolic intermediates in glutamine-deprived cell lines compared to control cells. To confirm our observations, we used kit-based assays to evaluate metabolites in the cells. To further confirm the change in the metabolite pathway we evaluated changes in transcriptional changes of regulating proteins\/enzymes. This pre-clinical study reinforced efforts that are anticipated to reveal new metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. This study also helped us evaluate druggable metabolic targets that can be targeted for effective tumor eradication along with conventional treatment. This understanding will help advance the pre-clinical trials persistent to the cure of cervical cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Cancer progression,Microenvironment,Radiosensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Julie  K.

Our study explores the inhibition of BUB1, a critical mitotic checkpoint kinase, in conjunction with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This approach has the potential to overcome resistance, thus enhancing the efficacy of treatment and improving treatment outcomes for lung cancer patients. We analyzed BUB1 expression in lung cancer using TCGA datasets and patient tissue microarrays (TMAs). In vitro experiments used four NSCLC and two SCLC cell lines with BUB1 inhibitor (BAY1816032), Paclitaxel, Cisplatin and Olaparib. Cells were irradiated (2, 4, or 6 Gy), and assays measured proliferation, long-term effects, DNA damage, and repair. Bioinformatic analysis in NSCLC subtype, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) demonstrated marked overexpression of BUB1, correlated with cancer stage, tumor grade and survival. Lung cancer TMAs revealed elevated expression of BUB1 protein in SCLC that correlated with poorer survival. BUB1 inhibition (BUB1i) induced cytotoxicity in LUAD cell lines at micromolar concentrations, while nanomolar concentrations enhanced cell death significantly when combined with radiation. Furthermore, BUB1i sensitized LUAD cells to different classes of chemotherapy (Paclitaxel, Cisplatin), and PARP inhibitor (Olaparib) alone (chemo-sensitization) or with radiation therapy (chemo-radiosensitization). H2030 and H1975 demonstrated higher chemo-radiosensitization efficacy compared to A549, likely due to genetic differences, potentially including a p53 mutation that improves sensitivity by affecting DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Preliminary investigations revealed DNA double-strand breaks, indicated by prolonged &#947;H2AX foci, and the inhibition of the NHEJ DNA damage repair pathway after BUB1 ablation. Among SCLC cell lines, NCI-H1876 demonstrated higher radiosensitivity upon BUB1 ablation compared to NCI-H2198, potentially due to genetic differences\/mutations affecting radiation response. The study highlights the potential of BUB1i in enhancing the sensitivity of NSCLC and SCLC cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and provide rationale to explore BUB1i as a novel approach to enhance lung cancer therapy in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Chemotherapy,Radiotherapy,Radiosensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

It commonly occurs in individuals with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or C related cirrhosis. Despite conventional treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, the prognosis for HCC remains poor. The optimal treatment for patients with HCC is contingent on various factors, including the size and location of the tumor, the functional capacity of their liver, and their overall health status. Radiation therapy (RT) is a prevalent cancer treatment modality that targets rapidly dividing tumor cells by utilizing high-energy radiation. It is frequently administered alongside other treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, to improve the likelihood of successful cancer management. The timing of RT may vary, as it can be delivered before, during, or after other therapies depending on the patient's specific clinical situation. It's important to note that there are limits to the amount of radiation a patient's body can safely receive over their lifetime. For this reason, RT is often combined with other cancer treatments to enhance its effectiveness in sensitizing HCC cells. Fluoxetine is an anti-depressant drug that has also been shown to inhibit the growth of HCC. However, the potential role of fluoxetine in combination with RT for the treatment of HCC remains uncertain. In this study, we aim to identify whether fluoxetine may sensitize HCC to RT and evaluate its underlying mechanism. In this study, we employed the MTT assay and colon information to assess the cytotoxic effects of fluoxetine and radiotherapy (RT) at varying doses on HCC. Our findings, obtained through flow cytometry, revealed that the combination treatment can elicit extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis in HCC cells. Specifically, this combination led to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of cleaved-caspase-3, -8, -9, Fas, and FasL. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in the activation of PARP-1 and TUNEL, signifying DNA damage induction. Furthermore, we observed that fluoxetine not only enhances this DNA damage but also inhibits DNA repair, as shown through flow cytometry by the suppression of p-ATM and p-CHK2. Our western blotting assay confirmed that fluoxetine effectively inhibits HCC progression by activating LC3B, indicating the induction of autophagy in HCC cells. Moreover, the combined treatment, as demonstrated by transwell and wound healing assays, significantly reduced the migration and invasion capabilities of HCC cells. To conclude, the induction of apoptosis, DNA damage, and autophagy emerges as a crucial mechanism contributing to the heightened sensitivity of HCC cells to RT when combined with Fluoxetine. These results suggest that the combination of Fluoxetine with RT presents a promising novel approach for the treatment of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Radiation therapy,DNA damage,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.-X.

While radiation is effective at targeting tumor cells, it also has the unintended consequence of killing lymphocytes, which are among the most sensitive cells to radiation within the erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages. This phenomenon is known as radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) and is considered a negative prognostic factor in various malignant solid tumors. It occurs severely in over 40% of solid tumor patients who receive radiotherapy. Some previous studies have shown promising results with IL15 therapy in increasing circulating lymphocytes in cancer patients. However, until now, no studies have investigated the impact of IL15 in the context of radiation-induced lymphopenia. Our study aims to investigate whether IL15 can boost lymphocyte numbers and decrease tumor burden following radiation treatment in a mouse model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To conduct our study, we subcutaneously injected TSA tumor cells into the flank region of mice. Once the tumors reached a palpable size, approximately 50mm<sup>3<\/sup>, we divided the mice into four groups: Control (Con), Irradiation (IR), Control with IL15 (Con+IL15), and Irradiation with IL15 (IR+IL15). The irradiated mouse groups received a radiation dose of 2 Gray in the thorax and 1 Gray in the spleen for five consecutive days, simulating the severe radiation-induced lymphopenia observed in cancer patients. After the radiation treatment, the IL15-treated groups received IL15 in combination with recombinant IL15 in a 1:6 ratio weekly. Throughout the experiment, we monitored the circulating lymphocytes and tumor growth. After two weeks following the last radiation dose, we euthanized the mice, collected blood, spleen, and tumor samples, and identified immune cells using flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The radiation treatment significantly increased tumor growth while decreasing the number of lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and NK cells, in the blood. IL15 administration led to an increase in the number of lymphocytes both in the blood and within the tumor compared to the irradiated group. We observed a trend toward reduced tumor growth in the group that received both IL15 and radiation (IR+IL15) compared to the group that received radiation alone (IR).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> IL15 effectively boosted the number of lymphocytes in both the bloodstream and tumors, resulting in slower tumor growth in the IL15-treated group compared to the irradiated group. This study is of significant importance as it demonstrates the potential of IL15 to counteract radiation-induced lymphopenia in mice with TSA tumors. Further testing of these findings is currently underway in MC38 tumor-bearing mice, a cell line known to be more radiation-sensitive.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune cells,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Mouse models,Radiation ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Priti Gupta<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Min Wang<sup><\/sup>, Steven Lin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Radiation Oncology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5919cad2-4f13-490d-b69b-edaad71faa53","ControlNumber":"4907","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Not surprisingly, several small molecules and peptide-based radioligands that target FAP have been introduced into human clinical trials, but preclinical and clinical data suggest that these radioligand therapies suffer from inadequate tumor uptake, short tumor residence times, or unwanted uptake in the healthy tissues. Hence, there remains an unmet need for development of new FAP-targeted radioligands with improved therapeutic properties. For this purpose, we have designed and synthesized a higher affinity and specificity FAP-targetingligand (FAP8) and linked this ligand via a PEG spacer to both a well-known metal chelator (DOTA)and a 4(-iodo)-phenyl butyric acid pharmacokinetic extender to yield the trifunctional conjugate, FAP8-IP-DOTA. Binding affinity and FAP specificity studies reveal that FAP8-IP-DOTA exhibits high affinity and selectivity for FAP (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1.6 nM) relative to its ubiquitous homologs&#8217; prolyloligopeptidase (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 16.5 nM) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 865.0 nM). Moreover,<sup> <\/sup><sup>177<\/sup>Luand<sup> <\/sup><sup>111<\/sup>In radiolabeled forms of the conjugate were found to bind a FAP-transduced cell line (HEK-FAP) with a K<sub>d<\/sub> = 3.0 &#177; 2 nM, and this binding was completely suppressed upon co-incubation with unlabeled conjugate, i.e., further confirming FAP&#8217;s specificity. SPECT\/CT imaging studies following intravenous injection of<sup> <\/sup><sup>111<\/sup>In labelled FAP8-IP-DOTA into mice expressing HT29, MDA-MB-231, KB or 4T1 tumors then demonstrated high tumor uptake and remarkably prolonged tumor retention of &#62;8 days. Biodistribution studies of the<sup> <\/sup><sup>177<\/sup>Lu labelledFAP8-IP-DOTA conjugate in mice implanted with either FAP-negative 4T1 tumor cells or FAP-transduced HEK tumor cells at different time points further revealed declining tumor radioactivity from 12.0 to 2.0 % ID\/g and 21.0 to 12.0 %ID\/g between 1h and 168h post injection, respectively. Importantly, uptake of the same conjugate in the healthy tissues was minimal over this time course, with most radioactivity clearing rapidly. Comparative dosimetry analyses showed tumor: healthy tissues ratios of &#62;5-fold for all major organs. Finally, analysis of tumor inhibiting activity demonstrated that<sup> <\/sup><sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAP8-IP-DOTA suppressed tumor growth between 60% and 100% in all xenograft models tested (HT29, MDA-MB-231, KB and 4T1), with remarkably improved overall survival rates compared to untreated groups. Based on these promising results, we suggest that FAP8-IP-DOTA warrants further evaluation for possible translation into human clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Radiation therapy,fibroblast activation protein ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

A very-high risk group of SHH-activated MB harboring TP53 mutations (TP53mut-SHH) account for a substantial proportion of treatment failures after radiotherapy with a uniformly fatal outcome. Through optimizing radiation as a selection pressure and employing a functional genetic approach through whole-genome CrisprCas-9 dropout screening, the present study aims to identify drivers of radiation resistance and uncover unique vulnerabilities to sensitize these tumours to therapy. The dropout screen was conducted across a panel of established in vitro<\/i> models of sporadic murine TP53mut-SHH, which resemble the human disease with profound radio-resistance. Initial results reveal that targeting the DNA damage response confer radiation sensitization. However, consistent hits across all models demonstrate non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) as being synthetically lethal with radiation specifically in TP53mut-SHH. Genetic knockout experiments confirm genes encoding main proteins involved in NHEJ are synthetically lethal in combination with radiation. A small molecule drug screen targeting NHEJ revealed such vulnerabilities may be therapeutically exploited in TP53mut-SHH and are able sensitize these tumours to radiation. Using our unique approach of leveraging newly established models of TP53mut-SHH with a combination of functional genetic screening and small-molecule drug screening, this study highlights the genetic mechanisms of treatment resistance and reveals novel approaches for radiation sensitization. Here, we develop a novel approach to identify targets that are synthetically lethal with radiotherapy and identify multiple synthetically lethal targets at the genetic level which can be therapeutically targeted, allowing the development of new treatments to overcome current barriers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Radiosensitization,Radioresistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Immunogenic tumor cell death induced by radiation is known to activate innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophage activity in the irradiated tumor microenvironment (TME) has been implicated to play a critical role in post-RT innate immune responses. However, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) due to their phenotypic plasticity convert from initial antitumor M1 phenotype to protumor M2 macrophages resulting in relapse and metastasis of any surviving tumor cells. Therefore, strategies regulating tumor macrophages post-radiation can enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of radiation therapy. Here, we report targeting HDAC6 function with a novel selective inhibitor (SP-2-225) as a potential therapeutic candidate for combination with RT. When administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 25mg\/kg, SP-2-225 resulted in significant tumor suppression in the immunocompetent SM1 murine melanoma model. Phenotyping of tumor immune infiltrate indicated a profound decrease in M2 macrophages resulting in an M1\/M2 macrophage ratio and an increase in CD8 effector memory T-cells. Further, in-vitro co-culture studies using trans-well assays indicated that irradiated tumor cells attract M2 macrophages, and treatment with SP-2-225 abrogated the M2 macrophage migration but did not alter M1 macrophage migration. In addition, 24 hours post-RT, intratumor administration of SP-2-225 treated M1 macrophages as adoptive cell therapy resulted in diminished tumor growth. The combination of conditioned M1 macrophages with an irradiated tumor microenvironment resulted in an increased M1\/M2 ratio and infiltration of effector memory and central memory CD8 T-cells underscoring the influence of transplanted macrophages on the local antitumor immunity. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the ability of HDAC6 inhibitors to regulate macrophage function and phenotype as a cell therapy for use in combination with radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-04 Radiation therapy combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,Macrophages,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

As BCa frequently occurs at an advanced patient age, its diagnosis may follow radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of prostate cancer. Currently, data is limited regarding the influence of RT on the clinical course and genomic landscape of subsequent BCa, mainly due to a paucity of samples. From prior studies, pelvic radiation confers an increased risk of BCa, with resulting tumors that are largely genomically similar to non-RT tumors with the exception of an increase rate of genomic insertions. Our current study looks to expand on these findings by characterizing the genomes of the largest cohort of RT-associated bladder cancers to date.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We identified<b><i> <\/i><\/b>BCa cases from patients with a prior history of pelvic radiation for prostate cancer, and tumor only targeted sequencing was performed using Foundation Medicine (FMI) on FFPE tissue (n=41). For control cases (CTRL), patients with no prior record of pelvic radiation and who had previously underwent standard of care FMI sequencing were included (n=41). Sequencing data were re-aligned to hg38 and mutation calling was performed on the newly aligned sequences.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>CTRL and RT cohorts had similar distributions of patients based on race and smoking status. While cT stage was similar between the two cohorts, the CTRL cohort was biased toward higher cN and cM stages with no difference in overall survival (median OS: CTRL = 20m, RT = 23m), though the advanced stage of the CTRL cohort could mask a worse prognosis in the RT cohort. Latency specific analysis revealed short latency tumors (&#60;10 years from RT) had a significantly shorter overall survival than long latency tumors (p&#60;0.01, HR=5.59, CI=1.81-17.3), and a numerically, but not significantly, shorter survival than CTRL patients (p=0.17, HR=1.55, CI=0.82-2.94). Long latency tumor patients had a significantly longer overall survival than CTRL patients (p&#60;0.01, HR = 0.22, CI=0.07-0.63). In line with prior studies, RT samples had increased numbers of insertions (p&#60;0.01). In addition, we also detected an increase in SNVs in the RT samples (p&#60;0.01). Of note, <i>KDM6A <\/i>alterations were enriched within the RT cohort (CTRL = 10\/41, RT = 30\/41, p&#60;0.001), with series of splice site mutations exclusive to RT samples (p&#60;0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Patients diagnosed with BCa within a short interval following pelvic radiation have a worse prognosis. Genomic analysis showed RT-associated tumors having an increased number of insertions, SNVs, and <i>KDM6A<\/i> splice site mutations compared to non-RT tumors. Overall, the spectrum of recurrent alterations within the cohorts were consistent with previous studies, with the exception of the KDM6A mutations.

This condition is driven by germline mutations in the <i>TP53<\/i> gene which plays a primary role in the regulation of the radiation response. Aberrant TP53 function contributes to radiation vulnerability and a greater risk of secondary, radiation-induced malignancies (RIMs). As a result, therapeutic options for LFS patients are often limited to exclude radiotherapy (RT), which may otherwise be beneficial for the treatment of certain primary tumors. Data from our lab demonstrate an aberrant transcriptomic response to irradiation (IR) in mutant p53 patient skin fibroblasts compared to wildtype; however, it is unknown whether reprogramming this radiation response can decrease the risk of RIM in LFS. Metformin, a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug, is associated with lower cancer incidence and may decrease cancer-related mortality in murine LFS models. In addition to its potential anti-tumorigenicity, studies have shed light on the ability of metformin to prevent IR-induced damage in normal tissue; hence, we hypothesize that metformin can reprogram the radiation response to protect against radiation injury and delay the onset of RIM in LFS.<br \/>METHODS: To establish a murine model of RIM in LFS, and to investigate whether metformin can delay tumor onset in this model, whole-body or localized IR were administered to mice harboring a hotspot <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> mutation in the presence and absence of metformin. Serial MRI was conducted to monitor for tumor development. To understand the effect of metformin on the mutant p53 radiation response <i>in vivo<\/i>, a similar murine workflow was established and irradiated skin was collected longitudinally from untreated and metformin-treated cohorts for whole transcriptome sequencing. Sequencing data were functionally validated in a separate cohort of mice using flow cytometry. In parallel, we performed RNA sequencing on LFS patient fibroblasts to characterize the effect of metformin on the human radiation response.<br \/><b> <\/b><br \/>RESULTS: We demonstrate that IR decreases tumor latency in TP53<sup>R172H\/+ <\/sup>mice, and that metformin significantly delays tumor onset within the radiation field. Moreover, transcriptomic data revealed that metformin upregulates apoptosis following IR in TP53<sup>R172H\/+ <\/sup>mice. Flow cytometry analysis of the radiation response validated these findings, demonstrating that metformin promotes the apoptosis-driven clearance of damaged, potentially tumorigenic cells following IR. Transcriptomic data from patient cell lines will be presented.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we show that metformin may delay RIM in LFS mice, and have begun to characterize the biology underpinning this reprogrammed response to IR. This study is the first to highlight metformin as a radioprotective agent in the context of germline mutant p53, with the potential to broaden RT treatment options for LFS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-05 Radiation-induced late effects\/second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Radiotherapy,Metformin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

CRT confers a 20-25% 5-year overall survival in patients with LS-SCLC. In this study, we utilized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to demonstrate CRT resistance of SCLC and identified CRT resistance candidate genes from various SCLC PDX that represent the majority of molecular subtypes (n=4 that include SCLC-A and SCLC-N subtypes). RNA-seq data identified <i>TNIK<\/i> (Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase) as one such gene that is consistently upregulated in SCLC PDXs exposed to CRT compared to single modality treatments.

H3K27M-DMGs are heterogenous, comprised of an average of 6 genetically distinct subclones. Some subclones harbor mutations in genes previously linked to radiation resistance, such as <i>TP53<\/i>. We have found subclones are also functionally distinct, with some clones harboring intrinsic radiation resistance. Extracellular signaling between clones is linked with therapy resistance and tumor progression in other tumors, and we hypothesized that radioresistant H3K27M-DMG release small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that impact the radiosensitivity of neighboring tumor cells. We found that all patient-derived H3K27M-DMG samples examined (n=6) produced sEVs (&#60; 220nm), indicating this is a common feature in this tumor type. We isolated sEVs from a radioresistant (RR) patient-derived H3K27M-DMG cell line and used them to treat radiosensitive (RS) DMG cells. Using flow cytometry to profile sEV uptake dynamics, we found that RR-sEVs are internalized by RS cells within 2 hours of exposure and are retained at 18 hours (p&#60;0.001, compared to control). This uptake can be significantly abrogated by proteinase K treatment of the sEVs, (p&#60;0.001), indicating that uptake involves sEV surface proteins. We then applied a biosensor approach to assess single-cell phenotypic changes in RS DMG after RR-sEV treatment on radiation-induced cell death, DNA damage, and cell senescence, three dynamic processes. Using a genetically encoded death indicator (GEDI), we found that RR-sEVs significantly enhanced the survival of RS cells after acute radiation exposure (p&#60;0.001). This was due to enhanced DNA damage repair as measured by 53BP1 foci (p&#60;0.01). Small RNA sequencing of sEV cargo demonstrated that RR-sEVs express multiple miRNAs that are involved in oncogenic signaling such as the miR-7 family, miR-1246, and miR-1290 at several log fold higher than RS-sEVs. Overall, this data reveals the first functional role for sEVs in the context of radiation induced tumor transformation in DMG. We plan to further investigate the primary route of sEV uptake and define the mechanism through which sEV cargo alters radiosensitivity. This study provides new insight into the impact of heterogeneity and sEVs in mediating radioresistance in H3K27M-DMG and may lead to the development of novel radiosensitizers, which are critically needed for all patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Radioresistance,Extracellular vesicles,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

With the widespread use of immunotherapy to treat cancer, immune effects of radiation are an important consideration in design of sequential and combination therapies. While radiation has been found to deplete lymphocytes, less is known about its effects on the myeloid compartment, which includes both immune activating and suppressive populations. We hypothesized that a network-based analysis of single cell proteogenomic data generated from tumor-infiltrating immune cells can identify druggable proteins in pathways driving unwanted immunosuppressive changes with radiation, particularly among myeloid cells.<br \/><u>Methods: <\/u>Proteogenomic (CITE-Seq) analysis was conducted on CD45+ immune cells from unirradiated and irradiated orthotopic 4T1 murine mammary tumors three- and ten-days after tumor irradiation (8 Gy x 1 or 8 Gy x 3). Based on expression of select surface proteins, analysis of the CITE-Seq data resulted in eight distinct immune clusters, including three myeloid clusters &#8212; monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. Using VIPER (virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon), an algorithm that infers protein activities from weighted expression on each protein&#8217;s downstream targets, we identified distinct functional subpopulations within these eight clusters. Further profiling subclusters enriched by RT using the OncoTarget algorithm, we identified druggable proteins with significant inferred activity as potential targets of therapeutic interest.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> As expected, lymphocytes were persistently depleted after RT on both radiotherapy schedules. However, three distinct subclusters of myeloid cells with immune-suppressive phenotype became enriched following tumor irradiation, with greater enrichment at the lower radiation dose of 8 Gy x 1: TAM2, PMN1, and PMN4. Surface protein expression enabled us to define the immunophenotype and isolate these three cell clusters from murine 4T1 tumors as well as human renal cell carcinoma tumors for further functional analyses. OncoTarget identified a number of druggable targets, including PARP1 for the PMN1 subcluster.<br \/><u>Conclusion:<\/u> Suppressive myeloid subpopulations induced by radiation were identified among the immune cells. Combining radiation therapy with inhibitors of these cell populations may provide therapeutic benefit over radiation therapy alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies. Future work will experimentally determine if inhibition of druggable protein targets in these myeloid subpopulations improves the overall efficacy of RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immunosuppression,Single cell RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
