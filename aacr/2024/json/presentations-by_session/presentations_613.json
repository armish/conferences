[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often diagnosed late with many patients (pts) not responding to first line therapy or only responding for a limited time. BNT116 is an intravenously administered uridine RNA-based lipoplex cancer vaccine comprising six mRNAs (MAGE A3, CLDN6, KK-LC-1, PRAME, MAGE A4, MAGE C1), each encoding a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) frequently expressed in NSCLC. Here, we present preliminary results from pts with advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC (ECOG 0-1) receiving BNT116 + docetaxel (DTX).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>LuCa-MERIT-1 (NCT: 05142189, EudraCT: 2021-004739-94) is a first-in-human, open label, Phase I trial to determine safety (dose limiting toxicities [DLTs]; treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]) and clinical activity (RECIST v1.1) of BNT116 alone or in combinations. The cohort reported here will inform the dose of BNT116 in combination with DTX. Pts must have progressed on PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy. Biomarker analysis includes e.g., immunogenicity (ELISpot, n=3), cytokines (MSD, n=20), ctDNA (Avenio ctDNA Surveillance, n=~20), and PD-L1 (IHC, n=20).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of 01 DEC 2023, 20 pts (median age 66 years) have received BNT116 in addition to DTX at 75 mg\/m2 Q3W. The combination demonstrated a manageable safety profile. All pts experienced at least one TEAE. TEAEs &#8805;Grade 3\/4, (incidence rate &#8805;10%) include neutropenia (n=10 [50%]), pneumonia (n=3 [15%]), hypertension (n=3 [15%]), lymphocyte count decreased, diarrhea, and fatigue (each n=2 [10%]). Serious TEAEs were observed in ten pts (50%), of which three were considered as related to BNT116 (Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome, Grade 3 bronchospasm, and Grade 3 pyrexia) and three were considered as related to DTX (Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 rash, and Grade 4 febrile neutropenia). No DLTs within the dose confirmation period or deaths under treatment were observed. Seven of 20 pts (35%) had a partial response, 10 of 20 pts (50%) had stable disease. The objective response rate was 35% (95% CI: 15.4-59.2) and the disease control rate was 85% (95% CI: 62.1-96.8). Robust antigen-specific T-cell responses and cytokine induction were observed even with the addition of DTX and the use of prophylactic dexamethasone on Day 2 of each cycle.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>BNT116 + DTX shows encouraging antitumor activity, consistent induction of immune responses, a manageable safety profile, and no signs of additive toxicity. Updated safety and clinical activity data will be presented along with additional biomarker data.<br \/>(Funded by BioNTech)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor antigen,Vaccines,Biomarkers,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"B.

BI1361849 is an RNA-based cancer vaccine, encoding for 6 tumor-associated antigens, including MUC1, survivin, NY-ESO-1, 5T4, MAGE-C2 and MAGE-C1, to balance systemic antigen-specific immune response. This open-label multicenter 2-arm Phase IB study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of the addition of BI1361849 to durvalumab with or without tremelimumab for NSCLC.<br \/>Methods. Patients with metastatic NSCLC were enrolled in one of the two arms, Arm A: BI1361849 + durvalumab and Arm B: BI1361849 + durvalumab+ tremelimumab, to determine Recommended Combination Dose (RCD) for durvalumab according to a standard 3 + 3 design with a starting dose of 1500 mg and possible de-escalation to 750 mg, and a fixed total dose of BI1361849 at 960 &#956;g and tremelimumab at 75 mg. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS), based on irRECIST and RECIST. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, Fisher exact test, and Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/>Results. A total of 57 patients were treated with 23 patients in Arm A and 34 patients in Arm B for safety analysis. Among them, 36 patients received at least 75% of the scheduled doses of durvalumab and tremelimumab and at least 4 vaccine doses in the first 2 cycles to meet efficacy analysis requirement with 17 patients in Arm A and 19 patients in Arm B. The RCD was durvalumab at 1500 mg, BI 1361849 at 960 &#956;g, and tremelimumab at 75 mg. Both arms had comparable treatment related adverse events (56-57%) with generally low grade and manageable within current guidelines. Both arms had a comparable rate of treatment discontinuation (22-24%). For efficacy analysis, patients in Arm A had 29% ORR and 71% DCR, median months of 10, 7.3 5.7, and not reached for DOR, irPFS, PFS, and OS, respectively. In contrast, Arm B yielded 11% ORR and 53% DCR, median months of 6, 2.5, 2.5 and 10 for DOR, irPFS, PFS, and OS, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions. Overall, the doublet and triplet regimens were well tolerated. In comparison to recent published studies treated with durvalumab and\/or tremelimumab, incorporation of BI1361849 to durvalumab yielded comparable or better treatment response, PFS, and OS than durvalumab alone or with chemotherapy. However, tremelimumab did not add clinical benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Vaccines,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.-T.

Amivantamab (ami), an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity, demonstrated pre-clinical activity against WT tumors overexpressing <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>MET<\/i>. We examined ami monotherapy activity in WT-NSCLC after disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The WT-Ad and WT-Sq cohorts of the CHRYSALIS study enrolled pateints (pts) with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma histology, respectively, without evidence of <i>EGFR, ALK<\/i>, and <i>MET<\/i> Exon 14 skipping activating mutations. Pts received ami monotherapy at the approved dose (1050 mg; 1400 mg if &#8805;80 kg) weekly for the first 4 weeks and biweekly thereafter. Response was assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1. Plasma samples were collected pre-treatment, with ctDNA analyzed by Guardant Health (Redwood City, CA).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the WT-Ad cohort, 41 pts received ami (30 with &#8805;1 post-baseline disease assessment; 11 discontinued due to adverse events [AEs], disease progression, or physician decision), with a median follow-up of 6.2 mo. The median age was 62 years, 63% were men, and 37% were Asian. The objective response rate (ORR) was 7% (3\/41), the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 29%, and the median duration of response (DoR) was 4.2 mo (95% CI, 4.1-not estimable [NE]). Among pts with detectable ctDNA (n=24), 9 pts had <i>KRAS\/HER2<\/i> mutations. The ORR for pts with and without <i>KRAS\/HER2<\/i> mutations was 0% (0\/9) and 20% (3\/15), respectively. The corresponding median PFS for pts with and without <i>KRAS\/HER2<\/i> mutations was 1.4 mo (95% CI, 1.4-NE) and 4.2 mo (95% CI, 1.6-NE), respectively. In the WT-Sq cohort, 14 pts received ami (12 with &#8805;1 post-baseline disease assessment; 2 discontinued), with a median follow-up of 6.3 mo. Median age in the WT-Sq cohort was 71 years, 57% were men, and 43% were Asian. ORR was 21% (3\/14) with a median DoR that was NE and 2 pts with a DoR &#8805;6 mo. The overall CBR was 43% (6\/14), median PFS was 4.0 mo (95% CI, 2.2-7.3), and median OS was NE. Most common treatment-emergent AEs in both cohorts were rash (grouped term; 66% for WT-Ad, 57% for WT-Sq) and infusion-related reactions (63% WT-Ad and 57% WT-Sq). Grade &#8805;3 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 17% of pts in the WT-Ad cohort and 21% the WT-Sq cohort. One (2%) pt in the WT-Ad cohort experienced grade 2 interstitial lung disease. Four pts in WT-Ad and 2 pts in WT-Sq cohort discontinued due to TRAEs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Ami demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in pts with refractory WT squamous and adenocarcinoma NSCLC, particularly in those lacking <i>KRAS\/HER2<\/i> activating mutations.

Two first-generation selective RET inhibitors selpercatinib and pralsetinib have been approved for patients with RET-driven solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. However, critical unmet medical needs remain due to drug resistance caused by RET mutations in patients treated with the first-generation RET inhibitors. To address this emerging clinical issue, we discovered a highly potent and selective RET inhibitor with novel chemical scaffold through structure-based drug design, APS03118. Preclinical studies showed APS03118 had stronger in vitro and in vivo biological activity than the first-generation RET inhibitors targeting a broad range of RET fusions and mutations. Importantly, APS03118 was highly potent against a series of resistant RET mutations including the solvent front mutations RET G810C\/R\/S (IC50 0.04-5.72 nM) and gatekeeper mutations RET V804E\/L\/M (IC50 0.04-1.36 nM). Off-target screen analysis using the 468-kinase panel demonstrated APS03118 was highly selective for RET. APS03118 was orally bioavailable with good ADME and PK properties and markedly suppressed tumor growth in various RET-driven mouse xenograft tumor models (tumor growth inhibition 87-108% at 10-30 mg\/kg BID). In addition, APS03118 exhibited excellent brain penetrating properties with strong efficacy in the in vivo orthotopic brain tumor model. GLP toxicity studies showed acceptable safety profiles. APS03118 received IND approval from both US FDA and China NMPA, and was granted the fast-track designation by FDA. We recently achieved First-in-Human milestone for APS03118 and the Ph 1 clinical trial is ongoing. As of January 5, 2024, three dose levels have been tested. Plasma exposure of APS03118 increased proportionally following single and repeated administration of APS03118 at different doses. APS03118 was well tolerated in NSCLC and thyroid cancer patients harboring RET fusions or mutations relapsed on the chemotherapy, multi-kinase inhibitor and first-generation RET inhibitor therapy. In addition to the favorable safety profiles, we observed sign of efficacy in the RET altered cancer patients in response to APS03118 treatment even in the early clinical trial testing. Partial response and stable disease were observed in patients 2-4 months after administration of APS03118 and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) dose has not been reached. Dose escalation for APS03118 is continuing. Taken together, APS03118 is a novel highly potent and selective next-generation RET inhibitor overcoming resistance following treatment with the first-generation RET inhibitors. APS03118 warrants further clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,RET,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

MEK-inhibitors have been explored, with limited clinical efficacy. Our pre-clinical data demonstrated efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ceritinib in NRAS-mutant and BRAF-mutant melanoma cells lines. There was synergy observed combining the MEK inhibitor trametinib with ceritinib (compared to trametinib alone) in BRAF-WT melanoma xenografts, with dual suppression of MAPK and mTOR signaling (Verduzco et al, Mol Cancer Ther 2018) Further, in our anti-PD-1 resistant mouse melanoma models, combination of ceritinib and trametinib was highly effective when administered subsequent to anti-PD1. (Phadke et al, Cancer Immunol Res 2021)<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We conducted a phase 1\/2 trial of ceritinib monotherapy and then combination of trametinib with ceritinib in patients with advanced melanoma after failure of anti-PD-1 (and prior BRAF\/MEK inhibitors if eligible.) Primary objective was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination, with secondary objectives of tumor response (RECIST 1.1) and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In the initial phase 2 portion to explore single-agent activity, patients received oral ceritinib monotherapy at 450 mg daily (QD). In the subsequent phase 1 portion, patients started at dose level (DL)1 of 300 mg PO QD ceritinib + 2mg PO QD trametinib, with a BOIN design to guide dose escalation in cohort sizes of 3. DL 2 was 450 mg + 2 mg QD, while DL -1 was 300 mg + 1.5 mg QD of the combination. Tumor biopsies and blood samples were obtained on day 1 and day 15.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We enrolled 28 patients with unresectable\/metastatic melanoma. Median age was 66, 10 female, 26 stage IV, 11 <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant, 4 <i>BRAF V600<\/i>-mutant, with median 3 prior lines of prior therapy. There was no objective response observed to ceritinib monotherapy in 11 patients; prolonged stable disease of 6 and 8 months was seen in 2 pts. Median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI 1.91, NA); median OS was 7.3 months (95% CI 2.4, NA). Two patients had grade 3 AST\/ALT elevation; there were no unexpected toxicities. Of the 17 patients on the combination regimen, 12 received DL1. Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 rash and grade 2 glaucoma led to de-escalating to DL -1 for other patients. Overall, most frequent grade 3\/4 toxicities were grade 3 rash (n=3), grade 3 hypertension (n=2), and grade 3 ALT\/AST elevation (n=2). MTD was determined at DL -1 of 1.5 mg trametinib + 300 mg ceritinib QD. Two patients had partial response (12%), both <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant; 6 had SD (3 lasting &#8805;6 months). Median PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI 1.94, 6.18) with median OS of 7.8 months (95% CI 5.1, 13.2). Overall, patients with immediate prior line of anti-PD-1 before trial treatment had a trend toward improved OS (10.2 months vs 5.1 months; p=0.21); no differences were seen based on NRAS or BRAF-status.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Ceritinib does not appear to have meaningful single agent activity in treatment-refractory advanced melanoma. Efficacy of the combination with trametinib is modest, and the inability to dose-escalate the combination due to overlapping toxicities such as rash may have contributed. Analyses from baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies, including immunohistochemistry and single cell RNA seq to explore drug effect on mTOR and MAPK pathways as well as immune infiltration, are ongoing and will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Targeted therapy,Phase I,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Here, we present final phase 1 results from the ASPEN-02 study.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b>ASPEN-02 is an open-label, multicenter phase 1\/2 study designed to evaluate the safety and activity of EVO in combination with azacitidine (AZA) in subjects with newly diagnosed (ND) higher-risk (HR) or relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) MDS. Adult subjects with ND HR (IPSS-R &#62; 3.5) or R\/R MDS were enrolled into phase 1 cohorts receiving escalating doses of EVO (20 mg\/kg Q2W, 30 mg\/kg Q2W, and 60 mg\/kg Q4W) combined with AZA (75 mg\/m2 IV\/SC x 7d) in a 28-day treatment cycle. A phase 1 dose expansion portion enrolled adults with ND HR MDS into two dosing cohorts determined to be safe at EVO 40 mg\/kg Q4W and 60 mg\/kg Q4W. This clinical trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04417517.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of June 2, 2023, 65 subjects were treated in the phase 1 portion, including 13 subjects with R\/R MDS [EVO doses of 20 mg\/kg Q2W (n=1) or 60 mg\/kg Q4W (n=12)], and 52 subjects with ND HR MDS [EVO doses of 40 mg\/kg Q4W (n=23) and 60 mg\/kg Q4W (n=29)]. Of 52 ND HRMDS subjects, 9 (17.3%) had therapy-related MDS. Multi-hit TP53 mutations were present at baseline in 2\/13 (15.4%) R\/R MDS and 3\/52 (5.8%) ND HR MDS patients. 13\/13 (100%) R\/R MDS patients had received prior hypomethylating agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Median age was 70 (range 24 - 88) years, and baseline ECOG scores were 0 (n=27, 41.5%), 1 (n=31, 47.7%), or 2 (n=7, 10.8%). No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. Treatment-emergent AEs and treatment-related AEs for EVO were reported in 65\/65 (100%) and 35\/65 (53.8%) subjects respectively; discontinuation, however, was infrequent. Seven (10.8%) subjects experienced a serious adverse event related to EVO. There were no EVO-related deaths on study. Preliminary PK indicated dose-proportional pharmacokinetics consistent with prior studies. Objective response [complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), marrow CR (mCR), hematologic improvement (HI)], per modified International Working Group 2006 criteria, was observed in 19\/52 (36.5%) ND HR [CR=8, mCR=9, HI=2] and 2\/13 (15.4%) R\/R [mCR=2] MDS subjects.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>The myeloid checkpoint inhibitor EVO was well tolerated in combination with AZA with an initial safety and activity profile comparable to that of historical AZA monotherapy.

In the phase 1\/2 study (NCT03648372), suba showed dose-dependent upregulation of an IFN-1 gene signature in peripheral blood (PB) and plasma levels of several IFN-1-induced cytokines, and an increase in activated NK, CD8, and CD4 T cells in PB. Here, we report pharmacodynamic data from skin and tumor biopsy samples from this study.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> In phase 1, 84 pts received suba IV at escalating doses (3-120 mg) twice-weekly (BIW) or once-weekly in 21-day cycles. In phase 2, 25 pts with refractory NSCLC, cervical cancer, or CRC received suba 90 mg BIW. Skin and tumor biopsies were collected at screening and on cycle 1, day 8 (C1D8, skin) or C2D8 (+7 days; tumor). Target engagement (TE) and levels of SUMO2\/3-conjugates were assessed using IHC. Immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was measured by IHC and multiplex IF.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> In skin samples collected 1-3 hours after D8 dosing, suba &#8805;10 mg demonstrated dose-dependent TE as seen by suba-SUMO adduct formation and dose-dependent SUMO2\/3 inhibition at &#8805;60 mg. Assays of paired tumor samples from pts with CPI-na&#239;ve MSS-CRC (90 mg BIW, n=3), cervical cancer (90 mg BIW, n=1), CPI-exposed non-squamous NSCLC (90 mg BIW, n=2), and melanoma (25 mg BIW, n=1) showed robust TE in the post-dose sample, along with SUMO2\/3 inhibition or stabilization. Suba&#8217;s effects on the TME were assessed through PD-L1 IHC. There was an increase in PD-L1 combined positive score in most on-treatment tumors, consistent with suba&#8217;s ability to enhance IFN production, leading to induction of an inflammatory landscape in the TME. Multiplex IF analysis revealed significant CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration in samples from CPI-na&#239;ve (cervical cancer) and CPI-exposed (melanoma and NSCLC) pts. In contrast, biopsies obtained from MSS-CRC pts did not exhibit an increase in T cell density, suggesting that &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors may be less susceptible to suba-mediated immune remodeling. Accordingly, biopsies from pts with cervical cancer and melanoma displayed a significant increase in T cell activation and density of activated CD11c+HLA-DR+ myeloid dendritic cells within the TME, as well as a marked increase in HLA-class I expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> Suba-mediated inhibition of SUMOylation led to marked changes in the TME across different indications, supporting the hypothesized immune-activating mechanism of action of the drug. Our findings support continued development of suba in solid tumors. Suba is being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in NSCLC, cervical cancer, and melanoma (NCT04381650).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,SUMOylation inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

ATR and ATM genes have a synthetic lethal relationship in cancer and ATMi synergistically potentiates the efficacy of ATRi <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Here, we studied the combination potential of the highly potent, oral agents tuvusertib and lartesertib. The open-label, multicenter study DDRiver Solid Tumors 320 (NCT05396833) investigated safety, tolerability, PK and PD of tuvusertib + lartesertib in pts with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. PK samples were analyzed by a validated LC\/MS method, and PD via &#947;-H2AX in <i>ex vivo<\/i>-stimulated CD45+ fraction by flow cytometry. As of 03.01.2024, 42 pts received ascending doses of tuvusertib + lartesertib. 5 pts experienced DLTs (Table 1). Frequent TEAEs (&#8805;25 % of pts, any grade) were: anemia 62 %, nausea 45 %, fatigue and vomiting (43 % each). Grade &#8805;3 TEAEs occurred in 21 (50 %) pts; those in &#8805;3 pts were: anemia (n=9), decreased platelets (n=5), fatigue and decreased neutrophils (n=3 each). Preliminary steady-state PK showed rapid absorption: median T<sub>max<\/sub> of ~2-3 h (tuvusertib) and ~1-3.5 h (lartesertib); mean elimination half-life range of ~3.2-4.5 h (tuvusertib) and ~5.5-8.7 h (lartesertib); minimal accumulation. Exposure of the combination was consistent with respective monotherapies, indicating no clinically meaningful mutual drug-drug interactions. Preliminary PD showed complete or almost complete target inhibition 1-6 h after tuvusertib &#8805;130 mg and rebound above baseline after 24 h and target inhibition ~50 % across all time points at lartesertib &#8805;100 mg. 6 pts (2 ovarian, 2 uterine, 1 prostate cancer and 1 melanoma) had stable disease &#62;16 weeks; 3 remain on treatment. Multiple tolerated combination doses were identified.

Food and gastric acid-reducing agents e.g. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may modify the solubility, bioavailability, safety and efficacy of oral cancer drugs. Polymedication in cancer patients is common and food restrictions can impact patient compliance and wellbeing. In order to adequately inform drug dosing in clinical trials, effects of food and high gastric pH on D0123 bioavailability were studied over three cycles in patients treated in the dose escalation of a Phase 1 study of D0123 in combination with Carboplatin (CTID NCT03968653).D0123 was given on Days 1-3 and 8-10 of each 21-day cycle in combination with carboplatin on Day 1. Current standard administration of D0123 is in fasted conditions and PPIs are prohibited. Dose-limiting toxicities were evaluated in cycle 1. The effect of food and high-gastric pH were assessed in cycles 2 and 3, respectively. In cycle 2 on Day 10, patients were receiving a high-fat meal and in cycle 3, the PPI lanzoprazole 30 mg BID was administered from Day 7 to 11. PK parameters (area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C<sub>max<\/sub>)) were determined post-Day 10 dose and compared between cycle 1 (fasted) and cycle 2 (fed) or 3 (high gastric pH). Preliminary data from 3 cohorts, 3 dose levels (n=10) resulted in about 5 pairwise comparisons for food and for high gastric pH effects. Absence of D0123 accumulation between cycles was confirmed, allowing for inter-cycle comparison.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7775953F-4B5A-49C8-B3C5-9848F3189B21}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mean change [ min ; max ]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Effect of food (cycle 2 versus cycle 1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Effect of high gastric pH (cycle 3 versus cycle 1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC<sub>24<\/sub><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-3% [ -17% ; +8% ]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-31% [ -39%; -23% ]<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">C<sub>max<\/sub><sub> <\/sub><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-10% [ -26% ; 0% ]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-33% [ -41% ; -20% ]<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Oral bioavailability of D0123 appears pH-dependent, suggesting that co-medication with PPIs should be avoided. In contrast, food intake has a limited impact on drug absorption, at all doses tested. Furthermore, D0123 administration with food may increase treatment convenience and tolerability, leading to its implementation in other D0123 trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,WEE1,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Moda is being evaluated in phase 1\/2 trials for multiple myeloma and in a phase 1\/2 trial in solid tumors. Here, we present PD data in tumor biopsies and peripheral blood (PB) from the phase 1\/2 study of moda as monotherapy in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors (NCT04157517).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: A total of 21 pts were treated with moda 0.1-1.5 mg\/kg every 3 weeks. Tumor biopsy samples were collected at screening and on cycle 2, day 2 (C2D2). Biopsies were evaluated by multiplex immunofluorescence (using a Multiomyx platform) and RNASeq. PB samples were collected pre-dose on C1D1 and at timepoints after treatment. PB samples were evaluated by CyTOF to assess PD changes in immune cells.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: No clinical tumor responses (partial or better) were observed in the 21 pts. Analysis of tumor biopsies revealed two subgroups defined by differences in upregulation of CD38 expression after moda treatment, with differential intratumoral PD changes. The CD38 gene has IFN response elements within its promoter region. Thus, correlation of tumor PD with changes in CD38 expression is of interest because, along with being a target of moda, an increase in CD38 expression may indicate drug activity in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, in the subset of pts in whom an increase in the percentage of CD38+ lymphocytes in response to moda was reported, there were also increases in CD8 and CD4 T cell activation, (%CD69) as well as CD8 T cell cytotoxic function (%GzB). Additionally, moda led to increase in CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes, indicating an enhanced myeloid response in several pts, and minimal changes in FoxP3+ Tregs regardless of changes in CD38 expression. Moda treatment led to an increase in activated and cytolytic natural killer (NK) and CD8 T cells in all pts. This was accompanied by increased NK and CD8 T cell proliferation (%Ki67) in PB, without sustained increase in exhaustion markers. CD4 T cells were also activated in response to moda and there was no increase in circulating FoxP3+ Tregs. Enhanced myeloid cell response, measured by increased proliferation of monocytes and dendritic cells, along with upregulation of costimulatory molecules, were also seen. Importantly, immune PD changes in the PB were seen in most pts and there were no immune PD differences identified between the two patient subsets defined in the biopsy analysis.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: PD biomarker data from this phase 1\/2 trial in pts with advanced solid tumors demonstrated that moda enhances innate and adaptive immune activation in PB and within tumors. The presence of a differential intratumoral PD response in a subset of pts with elevated CD38+ cells highlights that tumor intrinsic factors may play a role in driving moda&#8217;s activity in tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Innate immunity,Interferons,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

To minimize potential thrombocytopenia previously seen with antagonism of this target, ASTX295 was designed to have a short half-life (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) with decreased bone marrow (BM) exposure. ASTX295 has proapoptotic and tumor growth inhibitory activity in preclinical cancer (CA) models. We report here the safety and preliminary efficacy of the phase 1 and dose expansion portions of Study ASTX295-01.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>ASTX295-01 is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, phase 1\/2 study to assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of ASTX295 (NCT03975387). Eligible patients (advanced solid tumors with Wild-Type [WT] TP53, ECOG PS 0-2, adequate organ and bone marrow function, etc.) had oral administration of ASTX295 starting at a daily dose of 15 mg. Dose escalation was by standard 3 + 3 with cohorts testing multiple regimens. Safety was assessed by CTCAE and disease was assessed by RECIST 1.1. Safety and efficacy and dosing recommendations were overseen by the Data Safety Review Committee.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b>83 subjects were enrolled in over 14 cohorts, evaluating daily (QD) and intermittent dosing regimens and the effect of food. The mean age of subjects on study was 60.1 year, 56.9 were male, with 2.94 (0-15) prior chemotherapy regimens. For PK exposure, the total weekly AUC for 400 mg QD and 660 twice a week (BIW) are similar. The median t<sub>max<\/sub> is 3 hours and mean t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> is 4-6 hours. PD demonstrates p53 pathway modulation. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue were dose limiting. RP2D regimens were 660 mg BIW and 400 mg QD and these regimens were expanded with a total of 25 additional subjects. The most common treatment related AEs for both regimens were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting at 76.2%,76.2%, and 33.3% respectively, for daily and 71.4%, 47.6%, and 33.3%, for intermittent. Grade 3 GI AEs were reported in 14.3% of subjects in the daily cohort vs 9.5% in the intermittent; none had Grade &#8805; 4. One subject had grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Based on decreased incidence and duration of GI AEs, 660 mg BIW was selected as the RP2D.Multiple objective responses were seen, including 1 subject with non-small cell lung CA and 3 subjects with liposarcoma (LPS), a tumor with frequent MDM2 amplification. For LPS the ORR is 7.9% (de-differentiated 7.7%, well differentiated 8.0%), with a PFS of 7.95 and 9.66 months respectively, along with a 16-week disease control rate of 69.2% and 72.0%. Five subjects with GBM were enrolled, 4 with MDM2 amplification, 3 of whom showed evidence of tumor regression, with one subject remaining on study for &#62; 34 cycles.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>ASTX295 was well tolerated at doses producing p53 pathway modulation with manageable toxicities, notably avoiding significant thrombocytopenia.

Amanitin inhibits RNA polymerase II, effectively stopping transcription and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, regardless of their proliferation status. It's shown cytotoxicity in vitro against BCMA-positive myeloma cell lines and non-proliferating primary CD138+ cells from refractory myeloma patients withefficacy even in cells with low BCMA density.<br \/>Clinical Study: HDP-101-01 is a first-in-human, open label, non-randomized, multicenter, phase 1\/2a trial in patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed or is refractory, aiming to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and\/or the Recommended phase 2 Dose in Phase 1. Dose escalation is guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. The primary objective in phase 2 is to assess anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Study Progress: As of November 2023, 18 patients (7 females, 11 males) were enrolled in 5 consecutive dose cohorts of 20, 30, 60, 80, and 100&#181;g\/kg. Patients had a median age of 70 years (48-82), were heavily pre-treated and multidrug-resistant, and had a median of 6,5 prior treatments (2-15).<br \/>Study Results: Preliminary data shows that pharmacokinetics of HDP-101 aligns with expectations, and exposure to HDP-101 is dose proportional. Free payload was not detected in serum at a limit of detection of 30 ng\/mL, and no anti-drug antibodiesor immunogenic reactions were noted. 17 of 18 patients were evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in the 5 treatment cohorts. Initial cohorts were well tolerated, without any DLTs, including no signs of hepatic and renal toxicities, infusions reactions, or ocular disorders. All patients in Cohort 5 had Grade 1-4 transient thrombocytopeniawith platelet reductions starting on Cycle 1 \/ Day 2 (C1\/D2), a nadir on C1D5, and full recovery by C1D15 at the latest without any clinical sequelae or interventions. Notably, subsequent dosing with HDP-101 did not produce similarly deep episodes of thrombocytopenia, supporting the possibility that this event is not due to a direct cytotoxic effect against megakaryocytes. After Cohort 5, mitigation strategies are being considered and further dose and schedule optimization is planned with fractionated dosing and\/or with premedication.<br \/>Efficacy: Cohort3 has a patient with stable disease (SD) after 15 cycles. Cohort 5 has 4 ongoing patients with promising results after 3-4 cycles: 2 patients achieved PR, and 2 have SD.<br \/>Updated data will be presented at the AACR2024 meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Amanitin,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),RNA Polymerase II,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

VISTA may contribute to resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies and correlates with a poor prognosis. KVA12123 is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to VISTA at neutral and acidic pHs. It was designed to improve pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics as well as reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). KVA12123 exhibited strong anti-tumor activity alone and in combination with anti-PD1 in preclinical studies. It demonstrated an excellent safety profile in non-human primates. The VISTA-101 clinical trial is a first-in-human, Phase 1\/2, multicenter, open-label, safety, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation of KVA12123, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, in adult patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05708950).<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>The phase 1 of<b> <\/b>VISTA-101 is an accelerated Bayesian Optimal Interval Design consisting of two arms: Part A) KVA12123 monotherapy dose escalation from 3 mg to 1000 mg including 6 cohorts and Part B) KVA12123 dose escalation from 30 mg to 1000 mg in combination with 400 mg fixed dosing of pembrolizumab including 4 cohorts. The primary objectives are safety, tolerability and to define a recommended phase 2 dose. Safety, PK and receptor occupancy data were considered during dose escalation. VISTA-101 is also assessing PD and predictive biomarkers of response. Patient tumor response is evaluated by iRECIST.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Forty-two patients have been enrolled in the dose escalation monotherapy arm of the study. KVA12123 was administered at doses ranging from 3 to 1000 mg every 2 weeks over a 6-week cycle. KVA12123 was well tolerated at all dose levels and no DLTs were observed. The most frequently observed adverse events were grade 1 or 2 transient infusion-related reactions. No evidence of CRS-associated cytokines were detected. PK analysis demonstrated greater than dose-proportional exposure consistent with target-mediated metabolism. A VISTA receptor occupancy assay demonstrated full target engagement at doses of 30 mg and above. PD analysis indicated a dose-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory myeloid derived cytokines and chemokines involved in immune cell activation and recruitment to the tumor microenvironment including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL10. Increases in nonclassical monocytes, NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also demonstrated, consistent with observations made in preclinical models and indicative of VISTA target engagement. Patient tumor response evaluations in the monotherapy arm will be reported. The study continues to evaluate KVA12123 both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab to define the recommended phase 2 dose.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Solid tumors,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

It serves as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target. We conducted a first-in-human, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 clinical trial following the classical \"3+3\" dose escalation design. The endpoints of this clinical trial are to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK)\/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of EpCAM CAR-T. The trial is still ongoing, and our interim analysis results revealed a favorable safety profile of EpCAM CAR-T. No treatment-related deaths were observed within the 4-week follow-up period after infusion. 2 (12.5%) patients in high dose group (3*106) experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and 8 (50%) patients experienced grade 1-3 CRS. EpCAM CAR-T showed promising efficacy in gastric cancer. In gastric cancer group, the overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) reached 20.0% and 90.0%, respectively. However, the efficacy of EpCAM CAR-T in treating colorectal cancer was suboptimal, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 0% and disease control rate (DCR) of 50%. In our study, we observed that patients in gastric cancer (GC) group who developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) had a weak response to CAR-T cell therapy, which is consistent with previous observations in animal models. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from GC group patients receiving EpCAM CAR-T treatment to explore the potential antagonism between CRS and treatment efficacy. Our findings underscore the significant role of monocytes in the regulation of CRS and treatment response. Specifically, we identified an increased abundance of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent CD36+ monocytes in non-responders experiencing CRS. In a mouse model, we demonstrated that blocking TLR signaling in monocytes attenuated CRS induced by EpCAM CAR-T cells. Conversely, CD16+ monocytes were enriched in responders, displaying upregulated antigen presentation pathways and enhanced tumor infiltration capacity. In vivo, experiments revealed that blocking the antigen presentation pathway or inhibiting tumor infiltration of CD16+ monocytes resulted in reduced anti-tumor response of EpCAM CAR-T cells. Our findings highlight the critical role of intrinsic monocyte subpopulations as determinants of CAR-T efficacy and CRS. These insights may provide valuable strategies for predicting and enhancing the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cancer immunotherapy,Gastric cancer,Monocyte,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"TIanhang Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhengmao Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhongen Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuxuan Dong<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Yuanyuan Zhu<\/b><sup>4<\/sup>, Mei Feng<sup>4<\/sup>, Shenglin Mei<sup>5<\/sup>, Weijia Fang<sup>6<\/sup>, Di Zhu<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Fudan University, Shanghai, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Science,Fudan University, Shanghai, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Clinical Translational Research Center, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b68a16ca-03a4-4912-bc96-818258c80b70","ControlNumber":"10491","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Optimal LD for allogeneic cell therapies remains to be established. Most research has focused on HM, where patients (pts) have likely undergone HSCT and are, therefore, LD experienced in contrast to ST pts. Consequently, ST pts may require higher doses of LD chemotherapy to achieve LD depth comparable to HM pts. This study sought to compare LD with higher doses of cy across our early phase 1 trials (NCT04960579\/NCT05239143) which are enrolling ST and MM pts, respectively.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> P-BCMA-ALLO1 and P-MUC1C-ALLO1 are 3+3 phase 1 dose escalation studies enrolling heavily pre-treated pts.

BCMA targeting immunotherapies, such as bispecific T-cell engagers (TCE) and autologous CAR-T provide high response rates, but relapses are common. Autologous CAR-T are logistically challenging due to the need for apheresis, prolonged manufacturing and occasional manufacturing failures. Importantly, pts who have progressed after a prior BCMA targeting immunotherapy are an emerging area of high unmet need. Emerging data indicate that autologous CAR-T have lower clinical activity in pts ho have progressed on TCE.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>P-BCMA-ALLO1 is an allogeneic CAR-T therapy manufactured from healthy donor T-cells available &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; and being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (P-BCMA-ALLO1-001) in RRMM pts. This primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of P-BCMA-ALLO1, and the key secondary objective is to investigate the anti-myeloma activity. The pts must have progressed on a prior proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The study allows enrollment of pts who have received prior BCMA targeting therapy. The study is exploring escalating P-BCMA-ALLO1 doses and several different lymphodepletion chemotherapy (LD) regimens. Here we report the safety and early efficacy results for the 5 pts who were treated with P-BCMA-ALLO1 after having progressed on BCMA targeting CAR-T, TCE or both.
