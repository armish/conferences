[{"Abstract":"Chronic inflammation is a major driver of lung cancer and contributes to its pathogenesis by inducing genetic and epigenetic alterations. These, in turn, modulate the microenvironment to facilitate emergence of tumor promoting immune evasive mechanisms. The evolution of epigenetic events and their role, both alone, and in association with lung cancer specific genetic drivers in initiation of lung cancer is not well delineated. Specific pathological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have distinct cells of origin, suggestive of cell type-specific changes in driving their development. We employed lung organoid models with chronic exposure to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) to elucidate sequential, cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations and their role in co-operating with genetic events to drive development of NSCLC. We examined epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations over a 6-month exposure period by DNA methylation arrays, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq. We observe that CSC exposure causes distinct morphological changes in organoid structure and composition, accompanied by an increase in proliferative potential. Using flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining approaches, we demonstrate a chronic inflammation-driven shift in stem cell populations accompanied by reduction in differentiated cell types. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches identified distinct temporal changes in transcriptional signatures in CSC exposed organoids suggestive of evolution of an immune evasive and pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a downregulation of interferon signaling and upregulation of Myc targets and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in CSC treated organoids. Notably, co-culturing organoids with key immune cell populations, demonstrate the ability of the CSC exposed organoids to modulate shifts in immune cells from a pro- to anti- inflammatory state. In accordance with this shift in immune cell phenotype, CSC treated organoids secreted decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as measured by multiplex ELISA assays. Genome wide DNA methylation analysis reveal that CSC methylated genes were associated with differentiation and cell fate commitment as well as transcription factor activity. Finally, we demonstrate that introduction of key NSCLC-specific driver events at the 6-month time point sensitize only CSC treated organoids to tumor formation in vivo, leading to the development of distinct genetic driver-specific subtypes of NSCLC. Altogether, our results demonstrate the ability of chronic inflammation to drive key cell type-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic changes leading to the development of distinct subtypes of NSCLC. Our findings will help identify molecular correlates for early detection and aid development of novel therapeutic strategies for disease interception.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Chronic inflammation,Epigenetics,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Smoking exposes respiratory epithelial tissues to various carcinogens. Evaluating the effects of these carcinogens administered intratracheally in mouse models would allow us to study lung carcinogenesis in a relevant manner and determine therapeutically targetable pathways.<br \/>Cigarette smoking exposure was mimicked in vivo using a smoke machine and the condensate was subjected to chemical analysis. In addition to nicotine, cigarette smoking condensate included significant levels of the carcinogens, Nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) and Benzo(&#945;)pyrene (BP). Next, a mouse model of cigarette smoking-induced carcinogenesis was developed by exposing ICR mice to intratracheal exposure to NNK and BP three times a week for 18 months.<br \/>Mice chronically exposed to NNK and BP developed epithelial dysplasia at 4 months of exposure and lung cancers at 8-12 mo. of exposure at significantly increased rates relative to controls. Histology revealed myeloid inflammation in murine lung tissues. Exposure of lung epithelial cells to cigarette smoking condensate led to increased production of pro-inflammatory IL-1&#946;. Downstream mediator of IL-1&#946; signaling, Interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK4), was overexpressed in murine lung tissues exposed to carcinogens in vivo. Two-thirds of human tissue sections obtained from archived lung cancers also exhibited overactivated IRAK4 expression.<br \/>In lung cancer cell lines, IRAK4 immunofluorescence revealed a microtubule like pattern of expression in lung cancer cells. Immunoblotting confirmed IRAK4 colocalization within purified microtubules. Using mass spectrometry on isolated microtubules, we observed that phosphorylation decreased in various tubular proteins after IRAK4 inhibition. Inhibition of IRAK4 using small molecule specific inhibitors resulted in decreased invasion in lung cancer cell lines.<br \/>These data show that chronic intratracheal exposure of smoking associated carcinogens leads to dysplasia and malignancies in mouse models. This exposure also leads to myeloid inflammation and activation of IRAK4 in lung tissues. Therapeutic targeting of IRAK4 can have potentially beneficial effects in lung cancer models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Inflammation,Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4),Environmental pollution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Our previous work suggests this is a dynamic process: tobacco smoking increases the size of mutated clones, which contain shorter telomeres and higher Ki67, while smoking cessation appears to be associated with the expansion of clones with near-normal mutational burden and an overall reduction in Ki-67 expression. To understand how these long-term changes take place, we have performed ex vivo functional assays to quantify the competitive advantage imparted by smoke. We have then explored the transcriptomic landscape of these cultures to determine how differential smoke exposure modulates epithelial cell dynamics before and after smoking cessation.<br \/>Primary basal cells from bronchial explants were co-cultured following different regimes of exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). We find that, upon acute exposure, pre-exposed cells have a ~20% higher chance of proliferating per week than smoke-na&#239;ve cells. To test this in a more physiological model, long-term epithelioid cultures were established with chronic exposure to low-dose CSE for months. As before, we observe that over time, pre-exposed cells outcompete the smoke-na&#239;ve, suggesting that smoke imparts a beneficial adaptation on re-exposed cells even at low doses. To elucidate this mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing of 48 different combinations of acute and chronic exposure to CSE. Genes were classified into distinct modules according to their regulation following exposure, re-exposure and cessation. Differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis showed that metabolic pathways, including both nutrient and detoxification pathways, are predominantly enriched in these modules. In particular, following cessation, cells with the highest cumulative exposure to CSE displayed senescent-like features which are suppressed with chronic re-exposure. Further analysis and in vivo validation of these results will help elucidate how these changes affect the likelihood of premalignancy and may provide valuable targets for cancer prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,Premalignancy,Smoking,Carcinoma: squamous cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

PDAC is projected to soon become the second leading cause of cancer death. Tobacco is one of the main risk factors for PDAC. Incidence of PDAC increases 2-fold among tobacco users, and 20-35% of PDAC cases are attributed to smoking. However, the specific pathways activated by tobacco carcinogens remain elusive.This research project addresses the impact of carcinogens in pancreatic cancer etiology. We hypothesize that carcinogens in tobacco increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), which elevates the Nrf2 redox pathway to facilitate PDAC initiation and progression. Specifically, we focus on two major subclasses of carcinogens: the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Using mouse pancreatic ductal organoid cultures, we found that acute carcinogen exposure increases Nrf2 activity, which is sustained after \"intermediate\" exposure (5 passages). Intriguingly, chronic exposure (10 passages) downregulates Nrf2 activity, which has been shown to be associated with acquired metastatic potential. Furthermore, we found an upregulation in NFkB and EGFR signaling after intermediate exposure, which are involved in microenvironment remodeling and increased proliferative potential. Overall, we demonstrate that acute carcinogen exposure elevates ROS levels and activates the Nrf2 pathway, whereas prolonged exposure upregulates NFkB and EGFR pathways. Furthermore, we have established a novel carcinogenesis model using 3D organoid culture to recapitulate each step in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Collectively, this project contributes to our understanding of tobacco-related PDAC pathogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,Organoids,Pancreatic cancer,Tobacco,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Remarkably, over 50% of diagnosed female cases and 15-20% of male cases are never-smokers. Notably, NSCLC in never-smokers exhibits distinctive clinical and pathological features, notably a higher incidence of tumors with EGFR mutations, setting it apart from its counterpart in smokers. Despite the improved disease-free survival observed with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, eventual relapse and limited responsiveness to immunotherapy are common, underscoring the urgency to comprehend the molecular mechanisms driving the escalating prevalence of NSCLC in never-smokers and develop targeted preventive and interceptive therapeutic strategies. The preponderance of females among NSCLC patients who never smoked has prompted an exploration into the potential contribution of estrogen to lung tumorigenesis. In contrast to prevailing research focused on estrogen receptor-mediated signaling, our investigations have yielded compelling evidence supporting the involvement of estrogen metabolism in lung carcinogenesis among never-smokers. This group is the first to report that estrogen is metabolized extensively in both mouse and human lungs, resulting in the generation of various derivatives, including the potential carcinogen 4-hydroxyestrogen (4-OHE). Notably, recent findings from our laboratory indicate that prolonged exposure of nonneoplastic human bronchial epithelial cells to 17&#946; estradiol or 4-OHE, at concentrations approximating physiological levels, induces the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks and cellular transformation. A comprehensive analysis was performed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the transformation process. Isolated transformed clones obtained after 9, 18, and 22 wks of exposure to 4-OHE were subjected to karyotyping, F.I.S.H., and RNA and exome sequencing. A longitudinal progression of aberrant chromosomal rearrangements and copy number alterations was observed, that increased with time of 4-OHE exposure. In addition, RNA-Seq analyses revealed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway was highly enriched at the early timepoint (9 wks), while replicative stress-related signaling pathways were induced at all timepoints. To determine if the differentially expressed genes were also dysregulated in clinical lung cancer cases, TCGA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data were examined. Interestingly, many of the genes upregulated after estrogen exposure were similarly overexpressed in the LUAD samples and often associated with a worse prognosis. In conclusion, our data support the role of estrogen metabolites in promoting lung cancer among never-smokers.

The studies were carried out by chronically injecting intraperitoneally <i>Bap1+\/- <\/i>and <i>Bap1+\/+<\/i> (wild-type, WT) mice with minimal doses of asbestos (in some experiments, as low as 0.0125 mg x 8 injections; total, 0.1 mg\/mouse) and then monitoring the mice for tumor formation for up to 90 weeks. Pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic factors in the TIME were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) for immune cell markers. With either type of asbestos and at each dose tested, MMs occurred at a significantly higher rate and earlier onset time in <i>Bap1<\/i>-mutant mice than in WT littermates. MMs from mice injected with chrysotile, but less so with crocidolite, had widespread adhesions in the peritoneal cavity owing to an overwhelming immune response, particularly at the higher dose used. IHC staining demonstrated an increased number of immune cells in granulomas and MMs. In particular, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages were found mainly in granulomas, whereas pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages were predominant in MMs. IF staining revealed that the relative number of M2 macrophages was strikingly greater in chrysotile-induced than crocidolite-induced MMs, suggesting that chrysotile induces a more profound immune response. MMs from <i>Bap1<\/i>-mutant mice showed upregulation of both CD39\/CD73-adenosine and Ccl2\/Ccr2 pathways, which collectively are known to mechanistically create favorable conditions for neoplastic transformation, invasion, and the development of an immunosuppressive TIME, in part by attracting M2 macrophages. This implies that chemoprevention and immunotherapy strategies targeting these pro-tumorigenic immune pathways could be beneficial in <i>BAP1<\/i> mutation carriers. In conclusion, we provide evidence that low-level exposures to either chrysotile or crocidolite in germline <i>Bap1<\/i> heterozygous mice result in a markedly increased risk of MM characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Drawing parallels to humans, these experimental findings suggest that exposure of <i>BAP1<\/i> mutation carriers to even minimal doses of different forms of asbestos may be associated with significantly enhanced susceptibility to MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Carcinogenesis,Tumor suppressor gene,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Some hallmark mutations in cancer-associated genes, such as BRAF and EGFR, are important in analyzing many cancer types. With the emergence of digital PCR (dPCR) technology, high-sensitivity and quantitative mutation analysis can be performed, lending valuable support to cancer research. In this work, we introduce a new and innovative dPCR method, the dPCR PanCancer assays (RUO), designed for concurrently detecting multiple hallmark mutations in BRAF and EGFR.<br \/>This work includes two novel PanCancer assays for BRAF and EGFR, each tailored to target a spectrum of mutations associated with these genes, facilitating a comprehensive mutation analysis. The dPCR assay for BRAF targets multiple V600 hallmark mutations, and the dPCR assay for EGFR targets various important deletions on exon 19. This also includes a reference gene as a control for PCR efficiency in the duplex reaction. Here, we present our initial data from various sample types, including blood, plasma and FFPE samples. Through a meticulously optimized dPCR setup, we achieved exceptional sensitivity and specificity, enabling the detection of multiple mutations in a single channel at allelic frequencies below 1%.<br \/>Both dPCR PanCancer Kits (RUO) have potential use in research for pre-screening samples (e.g., prior to next-generation sequencing) or monitoring cancer cells. They simultaneously assess the mutations, reducing time and costs and saving sample material. Additionally, our technology is adaptable to other cancer-associated genes, where similar assays can potentially be developed. Overall, we have demonstrated that our dPCR PanCancer Kits (RUO) provide a robust, fast and efficient technology to identify critical mutations, ultimately enhancing our understanding of BRAF and EGFR-driven cancers.<br \/>The dPCR PanCancer Kit is for research use only. Not for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Mutagenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,BRAF,Digital PCR,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Mouse models of BC carcinogenesis have been established using N-butyl-N-(4-hydro-oxybutyl) nitorosamine (BBN) for a long time, but there are few reports of UTUC carcinogenesis with high incidence. Therefore, the UTUC carcinogenesis mouse model is expected. The aim of this study is to establish a novel mouse model of UTUC carcinogenesis and to identify the characteristics of this model.<br \/>Methods: We used two strains (C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c) of male and female mice and fed 0.05% BBN from 6 weeks old to the harvest day. Both sides of upper urinary tract from mice drinking BBN or tap water were subjected to whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) to assess its genetic similarity to human UTUC. Microbiome in gut were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (16S rRNA-seq). Metabolic differences in feces, serum and liver between UTUC mice and healthy mice were evaluated by comprehensive metabolomic analysis. Inflammatory mediators were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).<br \/>Results: Only BALB\/c female showed higher incidence of UTUC than BC, while the other strains rarely had UTUC. This model showed SBS5-like mutational pattern. The frequent mutated gene list showed similarity to human UTUC. In terms of gene expression, this model belonged basal subtype. We detected 593 differentially expressed genes between cancerous side and non-cancerous side of upper urinary tract in this model, which could also classify human UTUC and adjacent normal samples. The cancerous side of upper urinary tract enriched several inflammation related pathways such as Nfkb and Tnf pathway. We validated the upregulation of inflammatory gene expression in upper urinary tract (<i>Il6<\/i>, <i>Il1b<\/i>, <i>Tnfa<\/i>, <i>Relb<\/i>) by qPCR (all: p &#60; 0.05). 16S rRNA-seq revealed that <i>Firmicutes<\/i> was enriched in feces. Metabolomic analysis revealed that some amino acids in feces and FAD in serum were upregulated. Feeding with amino acid mediated diet changed gut environment. <i>Firmicutes<\/i> in feces and FAD in both feces and serum were downregulated consistently. This diet suppressed inflammatory gene expression in upper urinary tract (<i>Il6<\/i>, <i>Il1b<\/i>, <i>Tnfa<\/i>, <i>Relb<\/i>, <i>Cd38<\/i>, <i>Tnfrsf1b<\/i> and <i>Kdm1a;<\/i> all: p &#60; 0.05). Finally, UTUC was disappeared but not BC in this model treated by BBN with amino acid mediated diet.<br \/>Conclusion: We have established a novel mouse model developing UTUC with high incidence that genetically mimics human UTUC. In addition, amino acid mediated diet can change both microbiome and metabolome in gut of this model, downregulate host&#8217;s inflammatory reaction to BBN in upper urinary trat and suppress the UTUC carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Carcinogenesis,Microbiome,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Hence, the goal of the study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms that trigger malignant transformation in the bladder using physiologically relevant arsenic concentrations observed in BCa patients. In our results, we observed significantly elevated levels of arsenic in the urine of BCa patients, ranging from 20 to 50 mg\/L, in stark contrast to the levels observed in healthy controls (&#62;10 mg\/L) and the recommended guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We used a median physiological concentration of arsenic (30 PPM) in drinking water-induced bladder hyperplasia in male and female mice over six months. Likewise, chronic exposure of healthy bladder epithelial cells (TRT-HU1) to similar arsenic concentrations (250nM:30 PPM) for 12 months resulted in malignant transformation, and arsenic-transformed cells (AsT) were capable of inducing tumors in xenografted and orthotopic models. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanism responsible for this malignancy remains to be elucidated. Our molecular analysis has pointed towards the activation of stem cells, notably ALDH1A1 (with a 50,000-fold increase), as a pivotal factor driving this transformation.<i> <\/i>Furthermore, our research has demonstrated that the activation of ALDH1A1 is contingent on the induction of Metal Response Element-Binding Transcription Factor-1 (MTF1). Consequently, silencing MTF1 inhibited the expression of ALDH1A1 and its associated malignant properties in As-transformed cells, strongly suggesting that MTF1 functions as the master regulator in As-induced bladder carcinogenesis. We have also observed similar molecular signatures (MTF1 and ALDH1A1 expression) in arsenic-exposed versus non-exposed mice and bladder cancer patients. In conclusion, our studies suggest that activation of stem cells is a critical step in arsenic-induced bladder carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Environmental exposure,Arsenic,Cell signaling,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Cadmium exposure can cause irreversible damage to lungs, liver and kidney including cancers. Alarmingly, abnormally high levels of cadmium are found in human prostate tissues. Studies on rodents have shown cadmium exposure causes liver, lung, and prostate cancers. The mechanism of carcinogenesis caused by Cd is multifactorial and specific organ carcinogenesis remains unclear. We and others have reported that the CXC-chemokine IL-8 drives cancer progression in prostate cancer (PCa). We tested a hypothesis that chronic cadmium-exposure induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-8, which individually or combined promote carcinogenesis and progression. The study used two non-transformed prostate epithelial cell lines (RWPE-1 and NHPrE1) to test whether continuous exposure to Cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2<\/sub>) perturbs cytokine expression pattern and selective silencing of elevated cytokines delays carcinogenesis and invasive potential. The CdCl<sub>2<\/sub> exposed cells and culture conditioned media were analyzed regularly for changes in inflammatory milieu and for hallmarks of carcinogenesis. These studies measured changes in cell proliferation, production of cytokines (IL-8, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IFN-&#947;, TGF-&#946;, and others), activation of Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-&#954;B), and pro-tumorigenic factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A and B), cellular motility, and invasive potential, etc. Cells exposed to CdCl<sub>2<\/sub> showed increased cell proliferation and clonogenic potential and specifically, increased expression of IL-8, it&#8217;s receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1&#946;, and other cytokines &#38; related genes. While un-exposed RWPE-1 cells did not express IL-8, it was the first cytokine to increase when exposed to CdCl<sub>2<\/sub>, followed by activation of NF-&#954;B (p65-rel), VEGF-A, &#38; B, CXCR1 and other markers. Gene silencing of IL-8 suppressed motility, invasion, and survival activity. These data supported that immediate-early IL-8 expression probably upregulates NF-&#954;B mediated inflammatory signaling axis which is critical for Cd-induced carcinogenesis and may expose targets for countermeasures to prevent metal-induced toxicity &#38; carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemical carcinogenesis,Prostate cancer,Interleukin-8,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Risk factors include age, genetics, and lifestyle, but the underlying stimuli remain largely uncertain. One potential emerging cause of PCa is exposure to metal carcinogens as cadmium (Cd) which is now classified as a group I human carcinogen. Chronic exposure to Cd on epithelial cells has been extensively shown to induce carcinogenesis, making it a likely contributor to PCa development. In this study, we expand this information by examining how chronic Cd exposure affects prostate-derived myofibroblast (WPMY-1) cells transforming into a cancer-associated fibroblast like phenotype. To study the transformation, WPMY-1 cells were treated with 500nM of Cd for a period of 11 months establishing the WPMY-1 Cd model. Fibroblasts are a crucial tumor microenvironment (TME) component and potentially contribute to PCa progression when transformed and activated into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). To begin, we used an MTT assay to measure the effect of Cd toxicity on normal prostate myofibroblasts versus WPMY-1 Cd. The data showed that 10&#181;M Cd solution was toxic to WPMY-1 cells, but WPMY-Cd cells depicted high cell viability at 50 &#181;M dose, conferring to chronic Cd exposure improved resiliency to Cd toxicity. We analyzed the expression of CAF-specific markers in WPMY-Cd cells, such as vimentin, FAP, &#945;-SMA, and PDGFR-&#946;. WPMY-Cd cells showed a distinct upregulation for these markers when compared to untreated WPMY-1 cells, suggesting that chronic exposure to Cd promotes CAF-like phenotypic transformation in WPMY-Cd. To further ascertain the cancer-promoting properties of WPMY-Cd, an <i>in vitro<\/i> 3-D spheroid assay was performed by growing the cells on a Matrigel scaffold. The WPMY-Cd cells formed many more tumor-like spheroid structures than WPMY-1 and exhibited sprouting. The sprouting spheroids displayed lamellipodium and filopodium-like structures, demonstrating the initiation of migratory phenotype in WPMY-Cd. Additionally, previous research suggests that CAFs may play a role in PCa progression by promoting tumor growth via the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. We tested this theory by exposing Cd-treated epithelial (BPH-Cd) cells to conditioned media containing secretions from CAFs and WPMY-Cd. WPMY-1 Cd conditioned media in conferring cell migration on epithelial BPH-Cd cells was confirmed by a wound healing assay wherein BPH-Cd cells treated with WPMY-1 Cd conditioned media led to complete wound closure in 24 hours as compared to WPMY-1 and CAF conditioned media. Overall, there is considerable evidence that Cd exposure in fibroblasts may play a crucial role in PCa disease progression and is a promising area for researching PCa treatment strategies against a crucial component of the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Chemical carcinogenesis,Tumor microenvironment,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sakshi  V.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, induced by exposed to intrinsic (e.g. oncogenes) and external factors (e.g. chemotherapies), is an important factor in both tumor progression and responses to chemotherapies. Recent studies have demonstrated that the progression of ER stress may result in the emergence of cancer stem cells (CSC), which also arise as a consequence of metastasis. However, the mechanism of targeting ER stress signaling in cancer stem cells remains to be investigated.<br \/><b>Aim:<\/b> (i) To investigate the mechanistic role of Oxysterol binding protein-like 3 (OSBPL3) in TNBC and its links with breast cancer mortality, particularly caused by chemotherapeutic resistance and metastasis; and (ii) to test a hypothesis that OSBPL3 facilitates the abnormal activation of ER stress and cancer stemness, result in the resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis in TNBC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The expression level of OSBPL3 in TNBC was determined by immunohistochemical staining and the mRNA expression profiles from the TCGA database. Roles of OSBPL3 in cancer cell growth, metastasis, stemness and activation of ER stress were determined by molecular and cell biology methods. Immunoprecipitation was used to examine the binding of proteins and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), promoter luciferase reporter assay was included for detecting the transcription of OSBPL3 in TNBC. TNBC xenograft nude mice were used to study the inhibition of tumor development.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> OSBPL3 is a novel TNBC target, which is overexpressed in TNBC tissues and significantly associated with clinical pathology of advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis of tumor patients. Mechanistically, Increased OSBPL3 induced ER stress and ER stress agonist (tunicamycin) treatment results in the translocation of XBP1, an ER stress sensor, into the nucleus to induce OSBPL3 expression through direct binding to the OSBPL3 promoter. In addition, OSBPL3 facilitates the stemness induced by ER stress via phosphorylating GSK3&#946; and transporting accumulated &#946;-catenin to the nucleus to promote the expression of stemness-related transcriptional factors, ultimately resulting in tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, OSBPL3-specific siRNAs encapsulated by jetPEI nanocarriers prominently inhibit tumor growth and epirubicin-induced resistance in vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified an important role of OSBPL3-ER stress-XBP1 feedback loop in the stemness and resistance to chemotherapy, representing a future biomarker and therapeutic target of TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer progression,Chemotherapy,Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Obese women are at greater risk for developing breast cancer than lean women, however the mechanisms of how obesity increases breast cancer risk are not well understood. There is also limited knowledge on how environmental toxins may interact with obesity to promote breast cancer. Acrylamide, a probable carcinogen, is a biproduct in starchy foods cooked at high temperatures, which are prevalent in the obesity-inducing Western diet. Acrylamide is metabolized by the CYP2E1 enzyme into the epoxide, glycidamide, which is known to induce DNA damage. CYP2E1 activity is elevated in obesity, which could enhance DNA damage in obese individuals. Acrylamide exposure is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in epidemiologic studies, but the evidence has been contradictory. To investigate how acrylamide impacts DNA damage in the obese mammary gland, three-week-old FVB female mice were randomized to receive a low-fat (LFD; 16% kcal from fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) and either 0.7 mM acrylamide water or control water. HFD-fed mice gained significantly more weight than LFD-fed mice, and exposure to acrylamide did not impact weight gain compared to respective controls. Mammary epithelial cells from acrylamide-treated mice had increased DNA damage compared to controls measured by COMET assays, with the highest DNA damage present in epithelial cells from obese acrylamide-treated mice. Mammary epithelial cells from acrylamide-treated mice also had enhanced oxidative DNA damage, measured by 8-OHdG adducts, and an additive effect was observed between acrylamide exposure and obesity. To investigate the impact of acrylamide <i>in vitro<\/i>, COMMA-D mammary epithelial cells were treated with vehicle, 9.8 &#181;M acrylamide, or 0.5 mM glycidamide for 24 hours, then COMET assays and immunohistochemistry for markers of DNA damage were performed. COMMA-D cells treated with acrylamide-metabolite glycidamide showed significantly increased double strand DNA breaks compared to vehicle-treated cells, however acrylamide-treated cells did not. Interestingly, acrylamide-treated cells demonstrated significantly higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species compared to both glycidamide and vehicle-treated cells. These studies suggest acrylamide exposure enhances DNA damage in mammary epithelial cells via conversion to the genotoxic metabolite glycidamide and through generation of oxidative stress, which is exacerbated by obese conditions. These studies suggest that long-term acrylamide exposure through foods common in the Western diet may enhance DNA damage in mammary epithelial cells, potentially enhancing obesity-induced breast cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Breast cancer,Acrylamide,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a &#8220;long-chain&#8221; subtype of PFAS, has high bioaccumulation potential with a long elimination half-life. PFOS is frequently detected in drinking water leading to its high absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies demonstrate that PFAS exposures promote intestinal inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction. However, how a long-term PFOS exposure affects colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is not known. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to delineate the effect of PFOS exposure on CRC cell proliferation and test the potential mitigation strategy for the harmful effects of PFOS.<br \/>Methods: SW480 and HCT116 cells have been treated with 1 ug\/mL PFOS and proliferation was measured at 1, 2, and 3 months using the Presto Blue Cell Viability Reagent fluorescence assay. Proliferation markers were assessed by qPCR and Western blot. Control and PFOS exposed cells were treated with sulforaphane, a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) inducer, at concentration 5, 10 and 20 uM for 72 hours.<br \/>Results: We show that chronic, low-dose PFOS exposure promotes proliferation of SW480 and HCT116 cell lines starting at 3 months since the first exposure. The increase in proliferation is associated with upregulation of Cyclin D, pAkt and FASN. We also show that sulforaphane significantly decreases proliferation of HCT116 and SW480 cells, and its efficacy is significantly higher in PFOS exposed CRC cells. The current studies show no effect on sulforaphane on normal colon epithelium cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Our studies suggest that chronic PFOS exposure promotes proliferation of CRC cells by increasing pro-carcinogenic gene expression and signaling. Furthermore, our findings suggest that supplementation of diet sulforaphane can potentially mitigate the harmful effects from PFOS exposure. Our studies warrant further investigation of the mechanisms behind the effect of PFOS exposure on cancer progression that would guide development of effective intervention strategies to mitigate the harmful effects of the exposure to &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Colon cancer,Lipid metabolism,Environmental pollution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We previously elucidated that ABCC3 expression is downregulated in colorectal cancer through the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. However, it remained unclear how downregulation of ABCC3 expression contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis. We here explored the role of ABCC3 in the progression of colorectal cancer-in particular, focusing on the regulation of bile acid export. First, we performed experiments with clinical samples of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients to confirm whether ABCC3 expression is already downregulated in colorectal adenomas. Next, we investigated the effect of ABCC3 expression on intracellular bile acid concentrations using ABCC3 knockdown and overexpression colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29, SW620). The intracellular concentration of deoxycholic acid, which is known to have carcinogenic effects, was verified with fluorescently labeled deoxycholic acid. Then, we tested whether activation of oncogenic signaling by deoxycholic acid is affected by ABCC3 expression changes. Finally, we examined the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have been suggested to inhibit the carcinogenesis of FAP, on the expression of ABCC3 in experiments with colorectal cancer cell lines. Gene and protein expression analysis of colorectal adenomas isolated from FAP patients revealed that ABCC3 were downregulated as early as at the stage of adenoma formation, and many other genes related to bile acid efflux were also downregulated. Knockdown or overexpression of ABCC3 increased or decreased intracellular concentration of deoxycholic acid in colorectal cancer cells, respectively. Forced expression of ABCC3 suppressed deoxycholic acid-induced activation of MAPK signaling. Finally, we found that several NSAIDs increased ABCC3 expression in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting that ABCC3 could be one of the targets for therapeutic intervention of FAP. Our data thus suggest that downregulation of ABCC3 expression contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis through the regulation of intracellular accumulation of bile acids and activity of MAPK signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Deoxycholic acid,Familial adenomatous polyposis,ABCC3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

PFOS, one the most frequently detected PFAS in drinking water, is readily absorbed in the GI tract and distributes predominantly to the plasma and liver. Even though recent studies demonstrate that PFOS can cause an imbalance of cecal gut microbiota, alter microbiota diversity, and promote inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction, there is still not much known about the effects of PFOS exposure on normal and pre-malignant intestinal tissues and its contribution to carcinogenesis. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate the effects of PFOS on normal (I) and malignant intestinal cells (II).<br \/>Methods: The effect of PFOS on gene expression profile was assessed by RNAseq analysis in intestinal tissue of C57BL\/6 mice. Tumor organoids were established from Apc\/VillinCre mice (adenoma models). Organoid cultures, colorectal cancer (CRC) and primary normal intestinal cell lines have been treated with 1&#956;g\/ml of PFOS. To access the mechanisms involved in PFOS-induced intestinal alterations, qRT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, cytokine array and metabolomics analysis have been performed.<br \/>Results: The RNAseq analysis showed that PFOS exposure is associated with transcriptome alterations with exacerbated changes in pathways involved in lipid metabolism, immune system regulation and pro-carcinogenesis signaling. PFOS exposure leads to a significant decrease in expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coa synthase 2 (HMGCS2), a rate limiting ketogenic enzyme, in intestinal tissues. We also showed that PFOS exposure upregulates fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme of <i>de novo<\/i> lipogenesis, programmed death-ligand, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and altered the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and metabolites. Using HMGCS2 knockout cells, we identified the possible contribution of HMGCS2 in cytokine regulation and activation of oncogenic pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, our data suggests that PFOS may induce gastrointestinal pathological changes that can increase the risk of CRC development. Further studies are warranted to determine the functional significance of PFOS-mediated downregulation of HMGCS2 and upregulation of lipid metabolism in intestinal cells. Delineating the effects of PFOS on intestinal epithelium may contribute to development of interventional strategies to eliminate harmful effects of these environmental pollutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Colorectal cancer,Lipid metabolism,Environmental pollution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

About half of all new liver cancers worldwide each year occur in China due to a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV DNA integrates into the human genome, disrupting the endogenous tumor suppressors\/regulatory genes or enhancing the activity of proto-oncogenes. It would be useful to examine the different NGS-based databases to provide a more unbiased and comprehensive survey of HBV integration. We aimed to take advantage of publicly available datasets of different regional cohorts to determine the disparity landscapes of integration events among sample cohorts, tissue types, chromosomal positions, individual host and viral genes, and genic locations. By comparing HCC tumor with non-tumorous liver, landscape of HBV integration was delineated at gene-independent and gene-dependent manners. Moreover, we performed mechanistic investigations on how HBV-<i>TERT<\/i> integration led to <i>TERT<\/i> activation and derived a score to predict patients&#8217; prognostication according to their clonal disparity landscape of HBV integration. We revealed a global geographical disparity of HBV integration that the landscape of HBV integration between HCC and non-tumorous liver varied in regional cohorts, suggesting the different degrees of clonal enrichment. In the Mainland China, Hong Kong and Mongolia cohorts, HCC tumors had higher numbers of events than the non-tumorous livers, whereas in the French and US cohorts, the reverse was true. Moreover, most HBV integrations were positionally enriched at the telomeres and centromeres, and this highlighted the novel co-involvement of HBV integration at these regions, which likely introduces greater genomic instability. Furthermore, we constructed a large meta-cohort of multiple ethnicities to refine the landscape of HBV integration. This enabled the identification of events at key HCC-related genes (e.g., <i>TERT<\/i>, <i>KMT2B,<\/i> and <i>CCNA2<\/i>) and gene families (e.g., cyclin, cadherin, and contactin). As <i>TERT<\/i> is the most frequently integrated gene by HBV, we further investigated the mechanistic modulation of <i>TERT<\/i> transcription activation by combining and analyzing our in-house sample cohort with a previous report and luciferase reporter assays. This revealed the positive concurrent influence by both the orientation and relative distance of HBV integration (closer to transcription start site) from the <i>TERT<\/i> gene. Additionally, we observed clonal disparity of HBV integration among patients and the higher level of the clonal disparity score correlated with poor prognostication of HCC patients. Our study uncovered the different levels of clonal enrichment of HBV integration and identified mechanistic insights and prognostic biomarker.

These mutations often result in some of the most adverse outcomes in HCC, making p53 a prime target for therapeutic intervention. The concept of &#8220;hyperstability&#8221;of p53 is essential in understanding its gain-of-function and dominant-negative effects in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms driving this hyperstability are not completely understood. In this study, we have identified FKBP52, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, as a crucial factor in stabilizing and accumulating p53, irrespective of the type of mutation. Furthermore, our study suggests that FKBP52 could be a valuable biomarker for predicting HCC outcomes. We observed a notable link between FKBP52 levels and the histological differentiation in HCC samples. To corroborate these observations, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using liver cancer models. These experiments highlighted the dual nature of FKBP52&#8217;s impact on hepatocytes, which varies according to cell type. Given its connection to HCC severity, FKBP52 seems to contribute negatively to the disease&#8217;s progression. The insights gained from this study on how FKBP52 influences p53 stabilization are critical. We suggest that targeting the processes upstream of FKBP52 could lead to more effective HCC treatments. These findings emphasize the importance of further investigating this pathway, potentially paving the way for new strategies in liver cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinogenesis,p53,Prognosis,Gastrointestinal cancers: liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

KSHV infection precedes the development of KS, an AIDS-associated malignancy. While the incidence of AIDS-KS globally has seen a decline, this endothelial cancer is refractory to treatment. The standard of care for AIDS-KS has gone virtually unchanged for over 20 years and effective treatments against the oncovirus KSHV have yet to be developed. 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose), 2-FDG (2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose), and2-DFM (2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose) are sugar analogs. 2-DG and 2-FDG are D-glucose analogs and strong glycolysis inhibitors. 2-DG is also a D-mannose analog so that can inhibit N-glycosylation. In this work we aimed to further characterize and compare the inhibition of the three drug analogs on KSHV replication and pathogenesis.<br \/>Design\/Methods: We determined the ability of each drug to inhibit KSHV reactivation and infection by flow cytometry using the KSHV producer cell line iSLK.219 Virus titers were measured by de novo infection of na&#239;ve AdHEK293 cells and quantifying the number of AdHEK293 infected cells. We further characterized sugar analog inhibition assessing viral glycoprotein expression by western blot and quantifying virion production by qPCR. To show that N-glycosylation impairment is the main contributor of virus replication inhibition, we carried out D-mannose rescue experiments and analyzed activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). When UPR cannot be resolved, it leads to either apoptosis or autophagy. For this reason, we analyzed the cellular fate of reactivated sugar analog-treated cells by western blot using apoptotic and autophagic markers. Additionally, we calculated the cell death index using the IncuCyte&#174; machine.<br \/>Results: All three sugar analogs negatively affected KSHV replication and virion infectivity, but 2-DFM displayed the strongest inhibition. Viral glycoproteins K8.1 and gB were down-regulated and virion production was diminished especially with 2-FDG and 2-DFM sugar analogs. D-mannose could rescue viral glycoprotein expression and virion infectivity, but could not reverse the number of reactivated cells, indicating that N-glycosylation is the main target of the drugs. In line with this, all analogs triggered UPR and even overcame KSHV-induced suppression of the PERK pathway. Finally, 2-DG, 2-FDG, and 2-DFM played a protective role in reactivated cells, displaying the autophagic marker instead of the apoptotic signature observed in the untreated cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, this work identifies the non-toxic inhibition of N-glycosylation by sugar analogs as an important viral target and reinforces the potential of 2-DG as an antiviral for KSHV and other enveloped viruses. We also found that 2-DFM is a more potent and target-oriented compound and a promising therapeutic antiviral agent against an oncogenic virus.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-01 Chemical, environmental, and virus-induced carcinogenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Unfolded protein response (UPR),Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,AIDS-related malignancies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Up to 40% of patients with high risk MDS will transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer with significant morbidity and an overall 5-year survival of less than 35%. Both MDS and AML have been linked to hypermethylation of cytosine residues. Hypermethylation in the 5&#8217; regulatory region can result in epigenetic downregulation of gene expression, and it has been speculated that hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes can contribute to malignant transformation. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), most commonly cytidine analogs, are compounds that are used clinically to decrease 5&#8217;-cytosine methylation, with the aim of inducing the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes resulting in a halt of tumor progression. 5-Aza-4&#8217;-thio-2&#8217;-deoxycytidine (Aza-TdCyd or ATC) is a cytidine analog that incorporates an aza modification (nitrogen in place of carbon) of the cytosine base and a thioether modification of the deoxyribose sugar. ATC is a promising new DNMT1i that has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies of solid tumors. Based on these prior studies, we sought to characterize the potential therapeutic effect of ATC in MDS.Mice that express a NUP98::HOXD13 (NHD13) transgene develop an MDS that closely recapitulates all of the key features of human MDS, including pancytopenia, dysplastic morphology, and transformation to AML. We transplanted NHD13 and wild-type (WT) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into WT recipients, and used this model of MDS to investigate the therapeutic potential of ATC. We found that ATC treatment led to both T and B lineage lymphoid leukemia (ALL) originating from the NHD13 cells. Surprisingly, ATC treatment also led to T and B lineage ALL in the WT cells, and further experiments demonstrated that non-transplanted, healthy WT mice developed T and B cell ALL after treatment with ATC. In sum, all mice that received at least 8 cycles of ATC therapy at the 1.0 mg\/kg dose developed leukemia. Whole exome sequencing of tumors revealed thousands of acquired mutations, almost all of which were C&#62;G transversions in a previously unrecognized, specific 5&#8217;-NCG-3&#8217; context. These mutations involved a number of genes well-known to be involved in human lymphoid leukemia, such as Notch1, Pten, Pax5, Trp53, and Nf1. Treatment of the human U937 and CEM cell lines in vitro showed thousands of acquired C&#62;G transversions in a similar context. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ATC can be a potent mutagen in human and mouse cells, both in vitro and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Mutagenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Leukemias,Sequence context,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Building on advanced sequencing data of healthy, pre-leukemic, and myeloproliferative neoplasm patient samples, we seek to uncover normal and malignant patterns of APOBEC3C overexpression in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of lentiviral APOBEC3C and an editase-mutated APOBEC3C in normal cord blood, healthy bone marrow, and MPN patient hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells (HSPCs) allows us to study the effects of deaminase dysregulation in hematopoietic cells. In addition to APOBEC3, we are exploring the upregulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1), as we have previously shown that these two innate immune deaminases are synchronously upregulated in the high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) stem cell population compared to normal aged bone marrow. These overexpression studies show novel differential gene expression changes, RNA hyper-editing sites, and DNA mutation signatures induced by APOBEC3 mutagenesis, which can be cross-referenced to gene expression and mutation signatures seen in hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumor cancers. In addition to mutation patterns, the regulation of LINE-1 elements has been shown to be another important function of APOBEC3 enzymes. In these studies, we examine the effects of APOBEC3 overexpression on repetitive element expression in hematopoietic cell populations and have found that there are strong cell type and context patterns across the APOBEC3 family and between cell types within the hematopoietic system. We will use this comprehensive study of APOBEC3 deregulation to uncover predictive biomarkers of malignant transformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB02-02 Mutagenesis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Differential gene expression,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
