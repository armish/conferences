[{"Abstract":"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant cancer predisposition disorder caused by germline variants in the <i>TP53 <\/i>tumor suppressor gene. LFS has recently been redefined as a &#8216;spectrum&#8217; disorder to reflect the highly variable cancer types with largely unpredictable ages-of-onset and disease severity. The broad functional gradient associated with different <i>TP53<\/i> variants is thought to contribute to LFS heterogeneity, although it is still poorly understood and there is an unmet clinical need for risk stratification strategies to improve variant interpretation and patient care. Here, we performed an unsupervised cluster analysis leveraging p53 mutagenesis datasets (Kato et al., 2003 &#38; Giacomelli et al., 2018) that revealed five <i>TP53 <\/i>mutational clusters with unique mutation patterns, structural features, and functional consequences. Stratifying germline carriers based on the five clusters exposed important clinical characteristics to consider for patient management, such as ages-of-onset, tumor type development, and survival outcomes. In particular, we discovered an osteosarcoma-prone subgroup comprised of monomeric mutant p53 carriers with aggressive cancer phenotypes. We also identified a cluster of <i>TP53 <\/i>variants found more often in non-cancer and healthy older populations, and carriers of these variants that developed cancer had less &#8220;LFS-like&#8221; phenotypes including an older age-of-onset and a significantly higher frequency of colorectal cancers. Remarkably, our <i>TP53 <\/i>variant clustering strategy could also stratify breast cancer survival among germline carriers. This work provides a new framework to delineate the LFS spectrum toward the development of machine learning-based approaches for personalized cancer surveillance plans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,TP53,Machine learning,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Management of high-grade tumors is surgery followed by chemoirradiation (CRT). Radiographic progression is assessed using contrast-enhanced MRI with reporting captured in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The ability to harness large scale EHR data is limited by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) tumor progression criteria, which defines progression as an aggregate of clinical and\/or radiographic parameters requiring clinician judgement. As a result, glioma progression is not captured systematically in large data sets, limiting Progression Free Survival (PFS) as an outcome endpoint in data analysis. We developed an AI-based method using natural language processing to capture PFS parameters for analysis of MRI radiology reports. 1088 available brain MRI radiology reports for 81 patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM) were aggregated in the NIH Integrated Data Analysis Platform. MRI reports were systematically analyzed and PFS manually captured using RANO criteria as ground truth. Common report terms indicating progression were compiled and included in task prompts applied to Large Language Model (LLM) Extraction Tools. The words <i>progression<\/i> (n=1047) and <i>stable<\/i> (n=1133) did not necessarily indicate either overall progression or stability in a report. Yet, in the 24 (30%) patients who progressed within 3 months of CRT, <i>recurrence<\/i> and <i>mass effect<\/i> occurred in 3.7% and 53% of reports, respectively, which was comparable to the term frequencies of 5.8% and 54% in patients with stable disease. Thus, <i>mass effect<\/i> and <i>recurrence<\/i> could not necessarily be used alone as terms to signal overall progression. The analysis identified other commonly employed radiology report terms relevant to determining tumor progression including <i>enhancement<\/i> (n=2445), <i>perfusion<\/i> (n=2085), <i>enhancing<\/i> (n=1785), <i>resection<\/i> (n=1576), and <i>increased<\/i> (n=1331), which allowed for experimentation with more detailed LLM extraction task prompts. Our method flagged radiographic progression prior to clinician-coded progression in 43 (53%) patients. Future directions include handling further clinical context such as surgical features, radiation therapy dates, progress notes, and the coadministration of agents such as bevacizumab and steroids. These results indicate the feasibility of LLMs to identify tumor progression dates using EHR text with potential transferability to large glioma data sets pending further optimization and validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Progression,Glioma,artificial intelligence,natural language processing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

In our cancer genetics clinic, we provide care for 10-20 young (&#60;50 age) CRC patients per year. But, only a fraction (~15%) of these young CRC patients are found to have CRC-predisposing germline mutations which doesn&#8217;t provide a hereditary factor that can explain EOCRC. Other genetic studies have found that the spectrum of somatic alterations was largely comparable between EOCRC and adult-onset CRC, particularly common are mutations occurring in <i>APC<\/i> and other members of the WNT pathway. Since a genetic etiology has not turned-up, we are exploring possible lifestyle factors. We hypothesize that vitamin A (retinol) deficiency is a likely etiologic factor because vitamin A is an essential nutrient that is not made by the human body. Thus, young individuals might be prone to any cancer-initiating effects of a vitamin A deficient diet. Indeed, many population-based studies (including ones on well-nourished populations) have reported a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in pre-school-aged children. Since <i>APC<\/i> mutation commonly occurs in early-onset CRCs, we conjecture that vitamin A (retinol) metabolism and <i>APC<\/i> mutation-induced activation of WNT signaling may be co-factors in promoting EOCRC. Accordingly, we have been investigating whether there is a functional connection between WNT and vitamin A\/retinoic acid (RA) signaling, and if <i>APC<\/i> mutation generates an imbalance in a WNT:RA-linked mechanism that contributes to CRC development by impeding retinoid-induced colonic stem cell (SC) differentiation. We previously reported that RA signaling mainly occurs in aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) SCs and that <i>APC<\/i> mutation leads to overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs and incomplete differentiation during CRC development. Thus, our findings suggest that <i>APC<\/i> mutation attenuates RA signaling in ALDH+ SCs, which might explain how vitamin A deficiency contributes to EOCRC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cancer stem cells,Early Onset of CRC ,Vitamin A Deficiency,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

This automated process integrates single cell transcriptomic data from publicly available sources with our in-house generated datasets from ex vivo translational efforts and clinical programs. Relevant public datasets are identified and retrieved using an automated Python-based GEO dataset crawler tool, and standardized metadata are curated. A reference atlas of 31 immune and 4 non-immune cell types is generated from the database and is used to consistently label cells across datasets. Additionally, cell-level gene expression integration and normalization across datasets is achieved using generative modeling techniques. To facilitate multiuser visualization and interrogation of the curated and integrated datasets, we have developed Cellect, a customized version of CellxGene Gateway.<br \/>Results: The current single-cell database comprises 15 million cells analyzed in &#62;5,000 samples collected from &#62;2,500 patients across 160 curated unique human studies, spanning oncology (56%), autoimmune disease (AID, 21%), and viral infection (15%), with the remaining being from reference healthy tissues (8%). We focused dataset curation on indications of interest for our internal clinical development efforts. Uniquely, data from approximately 300 patients who received standard of care (SOC) treatment including immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) therapy were integrated to delineate mechanisms of drug response and resistance.

As the degree of tumor heterogeneity during cancer progression can cause evolution of cell states that can either compete or co-operate resulting in therapeutic failure, the study objective was to identify drug resistance networks that can serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach was conducted in a progression model of acquired drug resistance and its reversal comprised of a treatment-na&#239;ve patient-derived SUM149 cell line, along with two isogenic derivatives and representing drug-resistant (rSUM149) and resistance-reversal states (rrSUM149). Global gene expression analysis in IBC patients (n=87) recorded responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Based on the data, targeted multikinase inhibitors were evaluated in viability and signaling assays.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We identified specific ribosomal proteins associated with resistance acquisition, which correlated with high levels of pERK, CDK1, XIAP, and SOD2. Conversely, the resistance reversal in rrSUM149 showed almost complete normalization to the profile of SUM149. However, VIPER analysis revealed proteins related to ribosomal processes (AGO2, Exportin 1, RPL5) that did not revert in rrSUM149, suggesting this pathway may have pleiotropic effects in governing drug resistance. Notably, genes linked to ribosomal processes were significantly enriched (P&#60;0.001) among the overexpressed genes in IBC patients (n=87) who exhibited pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This is crucial as IBC tumors, including rSUM149, exhibit MAPK hyperactivation including in the presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment with Merestinib, a multikinase inhibitor, suppressed pERK, peIF4E, downstream targets like CDK1, and ribosomal protein IMP3 underscoring the impact on protein synthesis signaling crucial for countering translational dependence in cancer cells. Additionally, Merestinib synergized with EGFR-TKI (lapatinib) in increasing cell death in all three states.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Overall, our study describes adaptive changes in response to both therapeutic stress and therapy break that have the potential to serve as biomarkers or extended for pharmacological interrogation toward precision medicine for this rare, understudied cancer. Furthermore, the ability of Merestinib, in clinical trials, to target translational dependence is attractive as cancer cells often appropriate these signaling pathways to gain tolerance to various stress stimuli.

As a part of the &#8220;ASAP&#8221; study, which focuses on the implementation of comprehensive molecular profiling and deep clinical annotation of electronic health records in participants diagnosed with or at risk of developing cancer, we have established a microbiome-associated biobank and corresponding clinical dataset to systematically explore the dynamics of the gut microbiome as patients progress through cancer treatment. We describe a pilot project where we explore the baseline microbiome samples collected from ASAP participants, particularly from those with endometrial and ovarian carcinomas.<br \/>Methods: Stool samples from patients were collected at the time of enrollment in the ASAP study and sampling is repeated every three months to align with the additional biosampling procedures. Microbial DNA was extracted from the baseline stool samples and subjected to sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. After generating species level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), alpha diversity measures were generated in the form of the inverse Simpson index. In order to determine whether there was a difference in alpha diversity between individuals with ovarian (N = 37) and endometrial (N = 35) carcinomas, we employed a t-test with 100,000 permutations to derive an empirical p-value.<br \/>Results: We present sequencing results from the initial n=297 samples. Our comparison of the alpha diversity between ASAP study participants with ovarian and endometrial carcinomas showed a significant difference between the two groups, with the ovarian cancer patients having a lower alpha diversity (empirical p-value = 0.03915). Due to the uniform sampling, biobanking, and analytical procedures, our study allows the ability to explore microbiome features amongst various cancer diagnoses while minimizing laboratory and analytical differences that plague microbiome reproducibility.<br \/>Conclusions: We observed a significant difference in alpha diversity between patients with endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. Although the current results are preliminary, the wealth of information available in the ASAP protocol will allow us to continue exploring the association of the gut microbiome with cancer and the associated treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cancer genomics,Biobank,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

A significant factor contributing to the mortality of PC patients is the development of resistance to second-generation antiandrogen therapies, particularly androgen receptor-signaling inhibitors (ARSI), which is pronounced in patients with late-stage PC, metastatic castration-resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC). Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics beyond AR signaling inhibition for patients with mCRPC. One of the key drivers of resistance to ARSI and a critical feature of CRPC is cancer metabolism reprogramming to elevated glycolysis. However, the current research on finding drugs to impede high-glycolytic tumor growth is hurdled by a resistance raised from metabolic plasticity. The aim of this research is to quickly repurpose existing drugs for inhibiting high-glycolytic mCRPC growth while proactively circumstancing resistance from metabolic plasticity through computational approaches. To do this, we imputed a large number of drug responses in patients with mCRPC using a computational algorithm (OncoPredict), identified drugs that were projected to show higher sensitivity in high-glycolytic tumors, and performed in vitro validation. Furthermore, to maximize drug efficacy, we identified biomarkers for drug candidates. By implementing this computational pipeline, we identified a number of drugs with various mechanisms of action that show higher efficacy in mCRPC with high glycolysis. Furthermore, we successfully validated the efficacy of these nominated drug candidates including an anti-parasitic agent, an HSP90 inhibitor, and a CDK inhibitor. These drug candidates exhibited superior tumor growth inhibition in <i>in vitro<\/i> models of high glycolysis-induced advanced PC. In conclusion, this study introduces an innovative <i>in silico<\/i> approach to unveil the existing drugs&#8217; unknown potential for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. Our findings hold promise for development of effective therapeutics for combating this challenging disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Drug repurposing,Cancer metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.-C.

The ability to accurately subtype patients can inform prognosis and guide therapeutic approaches. With the integration of multi-omics data, it is possible to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning unique AML subtypes, with intent to identify potential drug targeting pathways in a precision medicine strategy.<br \/>Method: RNAseq datasets from Beat-AML (discovery, N=462), TCGA-AML (validation, N=173), and Leucegene (validation, N=452) were analyzed through non-negative matrix factorization to delineate distinct transcriptomic-driven molecular subtypes within AML. A curated set of the top 1,000 most variable genes was utilized to minimize analytical noise. GSVA was used for pathway analyses across Hallmark, KEGG, Reactome, and the immune microenvironment was characterized via xCell. Recurring DNA variants were examined in each subtype. Clinical outcomes of each subtype were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed by a log-rank test. These insights were subsequently validated in two independent cohorts - TCGA AML and Leucegene. The most influential components of immunological effector mechanisms, which characterize poor prognostic subpopulation, were assessed using bootstrap forest partitioning as a feature selection technique.<br \/>Results: Our Beat-AML analysis identified 5 distinct clusters. Cluster 3 consisted of 20% of AML cases (n=86), and displayed a worse overall survival with a HR (95% CI) of 1.41 (1.03, 1.92, P=0.03). This cluster was characterized by three co-mutations: FLT3, NPM1, and DNMT3A. Pathway analysis highlighted biological processes key to antibody therapy intervention, specifically complement pathways, NK cell cytotoxicity, and FCGR-mediated phagocytosis as enriched within this subpopulation. Concurrently, oncogenic (PI3K\/AKT\/MTOR, TGFB, NOTCH) and metabolic pathways (fatty acid and oxidative phosphorylation) were activated. Immune profiling indicated increased levels of M2 macrophages. Using bootstrap forest partitioning, C2 and ITGAM were identified as key genes defining cluster 3. These observations were confirmed in TCGA AML and Leucegene cohorts.<br \/>Conclusion: Our comprehensive analysis identified a distinct high-risk AML subgroup characterized by unique genomic, transcriptomic, and immunological patterns. The combined presence of NPM1\/FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations in cluster 3&#8212;each previously attributed with varied prognostic outcomes&#8212;warrants in-depth biological investigation. With these consistent AML subgroup results identified across three independent cohorts (total of 1,087 patients), we highlight the complexities within the molecular landscape of AML and emphasize the need for tailored therapeutic approaches - a transformative shift in AML treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Immuno-oncology,Gene expression profiling,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The IPSS-Mol model, a scoring system that combines molecular and clinical features to stratify MDS patients, can identify individuals at high-risk of developing Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), enabling the targeted application of disease-modifying therapies. However, the molecular evolutionary patterns in MDS and their impact on Overall Survival (OS) and Leukemia-Free Survival (LFS) remain unexplored. Shifting from conventional static mutational analyses used by IPSS-Mol to a dynamic evolutionary approach, we employed the ASCETIC framework to analyze data from the IPSS-Mol Database (3,323 patients, 152 genes) and understand the dynamics of MDS progression. According to ASCETIC, genes related to DNA methylation displayed low ranks, indicating their tendency to manifest early in the progression of the disease. In contrast, genes associated with cellular signaling typically appeared in the later stages of tumor progression, while genes involved in RNA splicing exhibited intermediate ranks.Regarding molecular evolution in MDS, ASCETIC identified five clusters, each characterized by distinct evolutionary signatures and significantly different OS and LFS rates (p &#60; 0.001). The median OS for the C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 clusters were 79.3, 64.1, 28.9, 16.2, and 14.8 months, respectively. Subsequently, we compared ASCETIC's clusters with the different risk groups defined by the IPSS-Mol score. Among the 1158 patients initially classified as V-Low\/M-Low risk by IPSS-Mol, ASCETIC identified 55 patients placed in C4 and C5. These patients exhibited lower OS (p = 0.005) and LFS (p = 0.02). Conversely, among the 905 IPSS-Mol M-High\/V-High risk patients, ASCETIC identified 468 patients (51.7%) classified as low risk (C1-C2-C3), who were associated with longer median OS and LFS (p &#60; 0.001). The differences between conventional mutational analyses and our evolutionary approach primarily, but not exclusively, arise from the evaluation of TP53 mutations and ASXL1. In the IPSS-Mol model, a higher risk is conferred if multi-hit TP53 alterations occur or in the presence of ASXL1 mutations.Conversely, ASCETIC assesses the impact of mutations differently. It considers not only the Variant Allele Frequencies of individual- and\/or co-mutations but also the evolutionary trajectories that lead to TP53 and\/or ASXL1. This approach results in different risk weights assigned to each evolutionary trajectory.Lastly, we identified patients with NPM1 mutations, classified as MDS patients in the original dataset but now categorized as AML according to 2022-WHO. Within this high-risk context, ASCETIC differentiated between patients with shorter and longer Overall Survival (OS) (p &#60; 0.001).Our study reveals the influence of evolution on MDS prognosis, offering insights into the integration of the ASCETIC framework with the IPSS-Mol. Validation on external cohort is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutations,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Myelodysplastic Neoplasms,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ivan Civettini<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina Crippa<sup>1<\/sup>, Federica Malighetti<sup>1<\/sup>, Matteo Villa<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Aroldi<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabrizio Cavalca<sup>2<\/sup>, Alex Graudenzi<sup>3<\/sup>, Lorenza Maria Borin<sup>2<\/sup>, Luca Mologni<sup>1<\/sup>, Rocco Piazza<sup>1<\/sup>, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniele Ramazzotti<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Informatics, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c0f0fa3e-c2f7-46d8-b1e4-fb393d415c0c","ControlNumber":"5577","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

However, challenges such as the lack of uniform standards, in both clinical and omic data, hinder the effective utilization of these datasets, thus impeding our understanding of cancer biology and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.Addressing these challenges, we have created a novel collection of pan-cancer omics datasets with extensive clinical data harmonization and consistent omic data normalization.Here, we focused on patient-derived gene expression microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. To navigate the complexities presented by the diverse clinical descriptions inherent in these datasets, we leveraged our proprietary ontology, machine learning models, and domain expert quality control processes to homogenize the clinical data elements.Datasets were then selected based on sample composition, molecular data compatibility, and clinical data availability, then passed through a uniform preprocessing and normalization pipeline to maximize data quality. Finally, gene names were aligned on a single annotation reference, and potential batch effects were adjusted before expression data were merged together.We obtained a total of 32,825 transcriptomic sample profiles from 470 datasets, covering 13,435 genes and 45 clinical data elements, across 30 cancer types. Healthy tissue was favored over adjacent tissue, to minimize the risk of introducing biases related to cancer patient background genomic profiles into downstream analyses. We compared our collection with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the most commonly used RNA-seq transcriptomic dataset in cancer research. It covers 30 out of the 33 TCGA cancer types, with on average 4.2 times more samples per cancer type ([0.3; 45.5], median 3.4). Despite the two data collections being based on distinct technologies, we observed a Pearson correlation of 0.69 over the 11,753 genes in common, and a 100% overlap of the differentially expressed genes between genders. This consistency highlights cross-technology reliability and complementarity.We have built and continuously enriched a comprehensive dataset collection enabling the secondary analysis of high-quality omic data. This initial work - focused on microarray datasets - allows us to streamline design, exploration and validation of various omics data-driven studies in cancer research.Our ongoing efforts involve not only the continued integration of microarray datasets but also the integration of pan-cancer RNA-seq and single-cell data. This initiative is set to expand further, encompassing a broader range of omics datasets in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Clinical data,Datasets collection,Secondary data aggregation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Personalized treatment relies on two key technological advancements: algorithms tailored to each patient&#8217;s molecular profiles, and comprehensive datasets detailing the effects of patient diversity on drug response. Despite recent advancements in machine learning-based models, each new algorithm requires curation of numerous datasets, which poses a significant burden to researchers who need to evaluate and compare various algorithms. Currently, datasets include extensive genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics measurements along with drug response data (i.e., cell viability) for each cell line, collected through the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and other initiatives. Additional omics data is available for tumor organoids and patient samples generated by consortia such as Human Cancer Model Initiative (HCMI) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). However, to date there has been little public effort to annotate and harmonize these data across repositories.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><b> <\/b>To address this need, we developed the Python package <i>coderdata<\/i> that collates the most up-to-date cancer omics and drug response data. We curated four public cancer datasets, establishing reproducible pipelines that standardize data retrieval, formatting, and integration so the datasets can be built on a cluster if needed. The datasets undergo bi-monthly<i> <\/i>synchronization with FigShare, ensuring the data is up to date and available. Scientists can use<i> coderdata<\/i> to retrieve and format data on the command line interface as well as within Python scripts.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b><i>Coderdata<\/i> is a straightforward Python package that will enable the development and benchmarking of diverse machine learning applications in cancer research. At its core, it represents reproducible data harmonization that enables heterogeneous datasets to be analyzed in bulk. This Python package downloads and standardizes data from multiple consortia-related resources including HCMI, CPTAC, CCLE, and BeatAML, together representing 4931 multi-omics samples from across 250+ cancer types. These datasets include cancer data metrics such as copy number, mutation, transcriptomics, proteomics, miRNA, methylation, and drug response data.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The applications of machine learning in cancer biology are hampered by the distributed nature of existing datasets. As such, the collection and standardization of data by <i>coderdata<\/i> substantially reduces the time investment required for data curation in cancer research. Direct access to benchmark multi-omics and drug response datasets enables scientists to focus on algorithm development for tumor drug response prediction, potentially accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Multiomics,Databases,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

It is projected to be the leading cause of death in adults under 50 years old by 2030. Although progress over the last couple of decades has improved the clinical management of patients affected by CRC, there is a lack of accurate biomarkers to stratify CRC patients. Among several other biomolecules, lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are non-coding transcripts under 200 nucleotides that can regulate gene expression. Furthermore, lncRNAs are important players in oncogenesis and cancer progression and have the potential to be used as reliable biomarkers. Through this study, we explored the clinical relevance of lncRNAs in colorectal cancer. To analyze the distribution of lncRNAs, we utilized de-identified FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) blocks from Augusta University (n = 88). FFPE blocks were sectioned to extract tissue segments and were subsequently stained using H&#38;E (hematoxylin and eosin dyes) to identify the tumor and adjacent normal regions. The quantification of the gene expression was performed using a medium-throughput NanoString platform. Further analyses were performed using clinicopathological features of the institutional cohort and an independent Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. TCGA contains genomic data along with clinical and molecular characterization of over 11,000 samples of various lineages. In the institutional cohort, <i>ZFAS1<\/i> showed higher gene expression in the low survival group for stage II and III colorectal cancer patients, while no significant difference was observed in stage I and IV patients. <i>ZFAS1<\/i> expression did not significantly correlate with other clinicopathological parameters, including race, alcohol consumption, tobacco consumption, age, grade, and family history of cancer. In an orthogonal TCGA analysis, higher <i>ZFAS1<\/i> expression was associated with genomic perturbations, including significantly altered tumor mutational burden (TMB), aneuploidy, fractional genome alteration, and microsatellite instability. Further, a 21-gene signature was developed for prognostication using gene co-expression network analysis. The gene signature was significantly associated with overall and disease-free survival in the TCGA-CRC cohort. Immune deconvolution analysis of the RNA sequencing data revealed that higher expression of the 21-gene signature was associated with increased infiltration of regulatory T cells while being inversely correlated with the overall level of T cells. In conclusion, our study identified the clinicopathological role of <i>ZFAS1<\/i> lncRNA and its interaction genes with prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Further investigation into the therapeutic relevance of the <i>ZFAS1<\/i>-related gene signature may prove invaluable in improving the clinical outcomes of colorectal cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Gene expression analysis,Long noncoding RNA,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

The immunosuppressive microenvironment of PDAC comprises suppressive cell populations that include myeloid cells, cancer associated fibroblast subpopulations, and regulatory T cells that reduce T cell infiltration and cytotoxic function. We have developed a murine personalized cancer vaccine to enhance cytotoxic T cell function against PDAC, PancVAX (Kinkead et al, <i>JCI Insight<\/i> 2018). Survival benefit with PancVAX was dependent on the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy to increase the number of cytotoxic CD8 T cells infiltrating tumors and maintain their cytotoxic function (Huff et al, <i>JCI Insight<\/i> 2023). Yet, the impact of cell-cell communication on effector T cell function arising from the immunosuppressive microenvironment of PDAC remains unknown. We previously developed a ligand-receptor inference method called Domino that infers inter- and intra-cellular signaling networks in single-cell RNA-seq data (Cherry et al, <i>Nat Biomed Eng<\/i> 2021). However, this technique is limited to data from single conditions. Understanding how this combination immunotherapy alters cellular signaling networks requires new computational tools that identify changes in regulatory networks between treatment conditions. We developed capabilities for assessment of differential signaling with Domino founded on a basis of differential signal receipt. Active receptors are identified by receptor expression in recipient cells that is correlated with downstream transcription factors in the intracellular signaling cascade. Identification of causative ligands for receptor activation is assessed by a probability of interaction for ligand-receptor interactions between cell types. This probability metric considers mean expression of ligand and receptor genes as well as the number of sender cells for comparison across treatment groups. Comparing communication networks in PancVAX alone to PancVAX with ICI, PancVAX with ICI enhances cell-cell adhesion and interferon gamma signaling in cytotoxic CD8 T cells towards exhausted CD8 T cells. Macrophages in PancVAX with ICI enhance expression of immune checkpoint ligands towards CD8 T cells, despite the presence of blocking ICI antibodies. Intracellular signaling downstream of PD-1 in exhausted T cells shows diminished numbers of transcription factors linked to PD-1 signaling. This software informs prioritization of inhibitory signals for modulation in future immunotherapy regimens and can be applied generally to other tumor subtypes and treatment contexts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell signaling,Pancreatic cancer,Systems biology,Cancer vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Multiple studies using experimental strategies, as well as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) technology, have shown the existence of subpopulations of PDAC CAFs, with divergent physical and biological characteristics. However, how these CAF subpopulations translate to clinical practice remains unclear. Using a combination of sc- and bulk RNAseq data, we present two CAF subtypes with permissive (permCAF) and restraining (restCAF) characteristics in patients, and developed a clinically usable single-sample classifier (DeCAF) using using 11 independent datasets with high reproducibility (AUC = 0.961). We found that the permCAF patients tend to be associated with a &#8220;myxoid&#8221; histological features, while restCAF samples were more &#8220;collagenized&#8221; (p = 0.018). Patients with permCAF tumors had a median overall survival (OS) of 18.5 m compared to 30.2 m for restCAF tumors, with a stratified HR = 1.66 (p &#60; 0.001) for patients with permCAF tumors. Basal-like tumors were found to be associated permCAF subtype (p &#60; 0.001). DeCAF and PurIST (basal-like\/classical) subtypes were independently associated with OS (p &#60; 0.001). Analysis of a phase Ib trial FOLFIRINOX in combination with a CCR2 inhibitor (PF-04136309; NCT01413022) , we found that in patients with classical tumors, increasing permCAF probability was associated with response (r = -0.688, p&#60;0.001). Tumors with permCAF subtype are enriched in neutrophils using CIBERSORT and may explain the positive response to CCR2 inhibition. More intriguingly, we found similar associations with OS in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC, p = 0.001) and mesothelioma (MESO, p = 0.019). DeCAF subtypes are associated with histological subtype in MESO (p = 0.021) and grade in KIRC (p = 0.056). Taken together, DeCAF subtypes explain the role of CAF subtypes in patients, provide a foundation for the translation of preclinical studies, and facilitate the design of future therapeutic approaches and clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Heterogeneity,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xianlu Laura Peng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Kharitonova<sup>2<\/sup>, Joseph Kearney<sup>3<\/sup>, Yi Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Priscilla Chan<sup>4<\/sup>, Changfei Luan<sup>4<\/sup>, Brian Belt<sup>5<\/sup>, Roheena Panni<sup>6<\/sup>, Arthi Hariharan<sup>4<\/sup>, Ian McCabe<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Morrison<sup>4<\/sup>, Ashley Cliff<sup>4<\/sup>, David  C.

Although genomic based approaches are used more extensively for identifying the right treatment approach, only a few patients benefit from this because a) only a limited number of mutations have been classified as driver mutations that are of &#8216;significance&#8217; and b) in case of multiple mutations, the approach to identify right drug or drug combinations is not well understood. In this regard, there is a need for approaches that use artificial intelligence where exhaustive omics data is effectively processed, mined and utilized to device personalized therapy. Therefore, we used OncodynamiX an AI driven Cancer Biology platform to identify the right drug(s) for patients that had limited or no treatment options. We present here 2 case studies, one patient with stage 4 uterine serous adenocarcinoma and another one with endometrial adenocarcinoma.<br \/>Methods: OncodynamiX platform has over 15 million data points, including mutation, CNA, mRNA and protein data for 1500 cell lines as well as potency, efficacy, target, phenotype and network information on more than 250 drugs. Based NGS data from the patients, OncodynamiX platform identified direct or indirect targetable alterations and then picked drugs or compounds shown to be active in the altered pathways. Based on this, a drug-gene alteration matrix was created which formed the basis for identification of appropriate drug(s).<br \/>Results: The first patient with uterine serous adenocarcinoma had the following mutations: PIK3CA (Gain of function, GoF), TP53 (Loss of Function, LoF), PPP2R1A (LoF), APC (Conservation of function); Copy number amplification or high expression was reported for the following genes: BRD4, MYC, NOTCH3, CCNE1 and MUC16. Based on the drug-gene alteration matrix and all available drug data, WEE1 inhibitor was suggested to be the best therapy option for this patient. Accordingly, the patient was treated with WEE1 inhibitor in a then ongoing clinical trial. The second patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma had FBXW7, BRCA1, and PIK3R1 LoF, PIK3CA GoF and TP53 switch of function mutations, amplifications in CCNE1, FGFR1, NSD3, ZNF217 and ZNF70033 and loss of PTEN and FAS. For this patient, Pazopanib and Evrolimus combination was recommended and the patient was treated accordingly. Both patients responded well for the treatment as measured by RECIST response and continued with the treatment for over a year.<br \/>Conclusion: The studies presented above highlight the promise of this AI-based approach in personalized medicine. In multiple cases we have used OncodynamiX approach where clear clinical benefit was demonstrated. To further validate this approach, we are initiating a clinical trial with 250 patients. Such approaches should be adopted more widely for significant improvement in life expectancy as well as in quality of life of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Machine learning,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

The glycosylation scheme varies between research groups, presenting clinical concerns that demand understanding in cancer research beyond the glycome. Our work aims (a) to enhance the canonical framework by identifying potential glycosylation-associated genes (glycogenes) and (b) to advance translational cancer study, offering a unified perspective on integrative omics and explainable machine learning with glycogene integration.<br \/>The expansion of the glycosylation framework involved initial text mining from curated databases like OMIM, InterPro, and Reactome. Dysregulation of identified genes was affirmed across 29 TCGA solid cancers, encompassing over 7,000 patients with primary tumors. And healthy tissue data from GTEx facilitated tumor-normal comparisons. Subsequently, integrative omic analysis, involving transcriptome and methylome, was applied to confirm the stratification feasibility of glycogenes and to revealed cancer clusters within the UMAP space. After cluster discovery, profiling from survival analysis and drug response prediction highlighted clinical differences between clusters. Employing a survival forest model and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), personalized assessments, including a 5-year survival predictor and risk factors for individuals, were developed.<br \/>Our study verified over 3,000 glycogenes, expanding the conventional configuration of glycosylation and constituting 10-30% of differentially expressed genes between tumors and healthy tissues. Whether transcriptome or methylome alone, glycogenes demonstrated stratification ability. Advanced omic integration further discovered 16 cancer clusters out of 29 TCGA cancers, associated with anatomical source, morphology, and genomic similarity. Utilizing drug resources from GDSC, this specialized geneset exhibited drug predicting ability, displaying a distinct drug response profile among the 16 clusters. To finalize the clinical potential, a survival forest for 5-year survival model construction concluded forecasters with a time-dependent AUC (0.77 to 0.92 on average) for each cancer cluster. With XAI implementation, survival risk factors were developed and assessed for each individual locally.<br \/>Here we identified over 3,000 glycogenes, elaborating the classic glycosylation structure and emphasizing genomic importance in cancer research. Glycogenes demonstrated translational potential, supported by diverse survival distributions and drug responses across cancer clusters discovered by the integrative omic approach. The integration of XAI provided a tailored perspective for implementing glycogenes in clinical cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Glycosylation,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-H.

Although dramatic responses to <i>BRAFV600E<\/i>-mutated ATC are seen with BRAF\/MEK inhibition, treatment resistance inevitably develops, limiting survival. In this study we sequentially profiled <i>BRAFV600E<\/i>-mutated ATC at diagnosis, after BRAF\/MEK targeted therapy and at the time of disease recurrence using both bulk and single-cell DNA\/RNA sequencing. We profiled (~400-800 single cells) for each patient - Patient 1 (n = 704 cells); Patient 2 (n = 817 cells) and Patient 3 (n = 407 cells). At diagnosis, we show that tumor cell populations were characterized by a predominance of arm-level aneuploidies. Across all patients, there is a sharp decline in tumor cells post BRAF-targeted treatment. Interestingly, we observe at least 2 distinct tumor subclones present in the pre-treatment tumor and subsequently there was an expansion event that occurred in each patient after BRAF treatment. This was associated with acquiring unique copy number aberrations (CNA)events and the dominance of these subclones in the recurrent disease. For Patient 2, we also performed single-cell RNA sequencing and show that the recurrent tumor cells have high proliferation and stem-cell like cell states even though they had higher differentiation scores. Importantly, correlating the scDNAseq identified CNA with the inferred CNA from scRNAseq, we show proof of concept that copy number aberrations can be directly correlated with gene expression changes and gene dosage effects. Collectively our data reveal an early polyclonal dissemination model of clones in BRAF-mutated ATCs and suggests that treatment resistance to BRAF inhibition develops as a results of incomplete elimination of viable tumor cell reservoirs in ATC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Single cell DNA sequencing,Targeted therapy,Resistant clones,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

During the past two decades, much effort has been devoted to understanding tumor biology and developing targeted therapeutics, which have significantly improved patient survival. With the increasingly available multi-omics data from healthy controls and lung cancer patients, we constructed gene regulatory networks for the two main subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer. In addition, differential networks were constructed by integrative analysis of data from lung cancer tissue and tissues from healthy lungs.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Transcriptomics and genomic data were obtained from the patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissue available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and both types of omics data of normal lung tissue were downloaded from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. The networks for each subtype and the differential networks were constructed by utilizing our newly developed machine learning tools, two-stage penalized least square (2SPLS) approach, and analysis of variance of directed networks (NetANOVA), respectively.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For the top three identified subnetworks of LUAD, we identified some well-known genes associated with lung cancer, such as EGFR, IRF1, KRAS, ERBB2, PIK3CA, MYC, at bootstrap frequency &#62;90%. Based on the top three subnetworks with a bootstrap frequency of 100%, results from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated several significant pathways, primary immunodeficiency signaling and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells. GO enrichment analysis showed statistically significant biological processes, including immune response, extracellular matrix organization, and significant KEGG pathways such as Hematopoietic cell lineage. The differential networks between LUAD, LUSC, and healthy lungs showed the same regulations across all three groups, such as the regulation between EEF2 and RACK1, the perturbations between LUAD and healthy (two-way regulations between HIGD2A and ARL10), and LUSC and healthy (GRB14 regulates EIF3E) respectively. In addition, we identified the differences between LUAD and LUSC, such as bi-directional regulations between CLTB and ARL10.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Although all groups share most regulations, we identified differential gene regulations between healthy lung tissue and lung cancer tissue and between LUAD and LUSC of NSCLC. Using multi-omics data generated from lung tissues, coupled with advanced machine learning methods, the causal relationships between genome-wide genes from the analysis will help us understand the molecular mechanism of lung cancer and facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Gene regulation,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

These changes give rise to heterogeneous collections of cells or clones, each with distinct (epi)genomic profiles within a single tumour. Accurate characterisation of these changes is crucial for understanding the mechanisms driving the disease, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and personalising treatment strategies. Due to the technological constraints of short-read and array-based approaches, cancer research has historically had a strong focus on detecting small genomic changes like SNPs and small indels (SNVs) as well as the broad characterisation of large-scale copy number changes (CNVs), mostly ignoring other important variant classes and epigenetic modifications. Here we demonstrate how Oxford Nanopore native long-read sequencing enables the direct detection of not only SNVs, but also break point-resolved simple and complex structural variants (SVs and CNVs), haplotype phasing of all variant types, and identification of DNA modifications like 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5hmC) from a single tumour-normal dataset. We illustrate how our end-to-end somatic workflow streamlines analysis for the different variant classes and benchmark somatic SNV and SV calling performance using well characterised cancer cell lines and in-silico benchmarking datasets at different sequencing depths. Finally, we use real-world tumour-normal pairs to showcase a comprehensive sample to answer tumour-normal analysis using Nanopore sequencing. This includes the characterisation of complex patterns of somatic SVs in the different cancer samples, the identification of unique 5mC methylation patterns, exploring characteristic differences in 5hmC levels between tumour and normal samples as well as showing how Nanopore long reads enable haplotype and clone specific CNV calling as well as phasing of genetic and epigenetic variation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Bioinformatics,Epigenetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Tumor microenvironment changes, including extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations, result the changing of mechanical characteristics of the tissue, play a crucial role in cancer progression and metastasis, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), one of a major histology type of lung cancer. This study focuses on elucidating how mechanical characteristics, especially those related to the ECM, influence LUAD and the signaling pathways involved.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b>: <\/b>Cell culture, transfection, Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Transwell assay, scratch wound-healing assay were used to investigate the behavior changes of LUAD cells under different treatment. Bioinformatics analyses, and machine learning-based integrative approaches were employed to build the SVM_Score, which was built with relevant base membrane (BM) genes. Patient-derived tumor organoids, myofibroblasts, and co-culture systems were established. Sorafenib, which can inhibited collagen and fibronectin synthesis, was used to explore the proliferation and migration changing of lung cancer cells co-cultured with myofibroblasts.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><b>: <\/b>Mechanical stress, simulated by matrix application, enhanced LUAD cell migration and invasion, correlating with ECM alterations and EMT pathway activation. SVM_Score predicted LUAD patient prognosis and EMT propensity across multiple datasets, revealing its robust prognostic capabilities. Lower SVM_Scores were associated with worse survival outcomes, increased cancer-related pathways, higher Tumor Mutation Burden and altered immune microenvironment characteristics. SVM_Score was also linked to myofibroblast-secreted COL5A1, a key marker for mechanical stress. Patient tissues with low SVM_Scores exhibited higher COL5A1 expression, enhanced EMT propensity, and increased internal mechanical stress. Sorafenib, by inhibiting COL5A1 secretion, attenuated the pro-tumor effects of myofibroblasts, inhibiting proliferation and migration of LUAD cells, and rendering LUAD cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><b>: <\/b>This comprehensive study unveils the intricate relationship between mechanical stress, ECM alterations, and LUAD progression. SVM_Score emerges as a potent prognostic tool, reflects tumor mechanical characteristics.

It is expected that by 2030, PanCa will become the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States due to the lack of understanding of the complexity of disease, early diagnostic methods, and extremely poor survival. Despite great advancements in biomedical research, there are very limited modalities available for the early detection of PanCa and its treatment. Thus, understanding of disease biology and identification of newer diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are high priority research in the field. Our group has identified Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein -13 (TRIP13) as an oncogenic protein which contributes to early events of PanCa.<br \/><b>Methodology-<\/b> High dimensional omics and structural elucidation of TRIP13 was conducted using publicly available databases like Consurf, Phosphosite, GTEx and GEPIA2. Molecular biology techniques were applied to cross validate all our bioinformatics data. qPCR, immunoblotting and IHC analysis was performed in progressive PDAC cell lines and human tissues to decipher the expression level of TRIP13 in various pathological staging including functional enrichment analysis using Linkdomics.<br \/><b>Results-<\/b> The structural elucidation analysis revealed that most of the functionally exposed residues, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation sites situated at AAA domain of TRIP13. As compared to normal, TRIP13 is significantly over expressed in pancreatic tumor samples. Pathological staging 2 and 1 (early stages) showed relatively higher expression of TRIP13 as compared advanced stage. Of the total 7 isoforms of TRIP13, only one isoform (TRIP13-001) has shown the over expression in pancreatic tumor samples and shown association with poor survival. In correlation studies, TRIP13 has shown positive association with other pancreatic cancer biomarkers (CEACAM5, S100A4, MUC1, MSLN, CA125). The functional enrichment analyses suggest that TRIP13 is involved in important patho-physiological pathways like DNA repair, viral carcinogenesis, cellular senescence, and cell cycle. Our wet lab experiments also support our computational biology observation.<br \/><b>Conclusion-<\/b> This integrated computational biology study suggests a potential role of TRIP13 in pancreatic cancer progression <i>via<\/i> modulation of important oncological pathways.

PS101 consists of microclusters of perfluorobutane microbubbles and perfluoromethylcyclopentane (PFMCP) microdroplets. Acoustic cluster therapy (ACT) consists of PS101 administered intravenously and insonated over a tumour with diagnostic ultrasound (2 MHz or above), which fuses the components of PS101 to form larger ACT bubbles that are temporarily trapped in capillaries, followed by low frequency (0.5 MHz) insonation, which induces oscillation of the ACT bubbles, stretching capillaries. Given concurrently with chemotherapy, this enhances delivery of chemotherapy to target tissues.<br \/>Methods: We describe a first-in-human phase1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of ACT treatment and the chemotherapy regimens FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in patients with liver metastases of colorectal origin (NCT04021277). The dose escalation cohorts evaluated safety of 20 &#181;L\/kg and 40 &#181;L\/kg dose levels of PS101 combined with chemotherapy. The primary assessment of anti-tumor activity consisted of within-patient comparison of radiographic responses between ACT-treated lesions (insonated) and control lesions (non-insonated).<br \/>Results: We had previously treated mice bearing SW620 xenografts treated with a control arm of Irinotecan at 60 mg\/kg IP or Irinotecan plus PS101 at 2ml\/kg and insonation in the experimental arm and showed a difference in survival in the experimental arm 34 days Vs 54 days p &#60;0.01 (1). In the first in human clinical trial 8 patients were enrolled into the dose escalation part of the study, of which 2 subjects were not evaluable for dose escalation decision. There were no CTCAE grade 3, or above AEs or SAEs related to PS101 or the ultrasound. 4\/8 patients discontinued treatment due to AEs - all related to chemotherapy. Median plasma concentration of PFMPC 5 minutes after the injection was 117 ng\/ml (n=3, range 82 to 158) in the 20 &#181;l\/kg cohort and 233 ng\/ml (n=4, range 217 to 275) in the 40 &#181;l\/kg cohort. 5 out of 6 patients had greater shrinkage of the insonated lesion compared with control lesions. The median percentage difference in maximum diameter of lesions between baseline and week 8 assessments, for insonated and non-insonated lesions, was -16% (range 25 to -42) and -3% (range 12 to -19), respectively. The dose expansion part of the study is ongoing, randomizing patients receiving FOLFIRI chemotherapy up to 10 patients each between 20 &#181;l\/kg and 40 &#181;l\/kg dose levels.<br \/>Conclusions: Following preclinical activity in xenograft models, the ongoing first in human study of ACT in patients with colorectal cancer has shown clinical translation of differential activity in insonated metastasis.

Lipidomic alterations within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may influence the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. In combination with anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab, NUC-7738 (3'-deoxyadenosine [3&#8217;-dA] which is phosphorylated and protected with a phosphoramidate moiety attached at the 5&#8217;-position) has shown promising activity in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma (Phase 2; NCT03829254). NUC-7738 generates sustained intracellular levels of 3&#8217;-dATP, which profoundly alters RNA regulatory processes in tumor cells, resulting in impaired cellular responses and changes in expression of proteins related to lipid biosynthesis. To interrogate components of the TME before and after NUC-7738 + pembrolizumab treatment, we developed a novel workflow incorporating Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) to co-register lipidomic changes with molecular markers. Machine learning accelerated the interpretation of complex data obtained from paired patient biopsies.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>Snap frozen paired biopsies from patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma treated with NUC-7738 &#177;pembrolizumab were analyzed by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-MSI. Specific metabolic (e.g., ASAH1) and immune (e.g., CD8, CD20) markers were investigated by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) post DESI-MSI. Target selection was guided by bulk RNA-seq data. Raw MSI data was visualized using Waters HDI&#174; software. Data extracted from selected regions of interest was exported into MetaboAnalyst 5.0 for statistical analysis. LIPID MAPS&#174; Structure Database was used to assign lipid species. mIF\/mIHC images were analyzed by HALO&#174; AI.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>Single 10 &#181;m tissue sections allowed co-registered DESI-MSI and mIF, suitable for further informatic and AI-enabled image analysis. This facilitated direct comparison of lipids, cells, and protein expression in the TME, before and after treatment with NUC-7738, a compound known to cause profound changes in poly(A) tail regulation. MSI data analyses of the TME uncovered intra-tumoral heterogeneity of the lipidome and demonstrated changes following treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>This platform provides a powerful investigative tool to simultaneously explore the myriad of factors in the TME that contribute to tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. Further analyses of the role of the lipidome in the TME and intra-tumoral heterogeneity will be explored in paired biopsies from patients with PD-1 inhibitor refractory melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor heterogeneity,Imaging,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, AS relies on a population-based observational paradigm in which standard testing frequencies may not match the patient&#8217;s tumor dynamics, resulting in a delayed diagnosis of progressive disease. To address these issues, we propose to advance AS towards a patient-specific predictive paradigm by leveraging computational tumor forecasts obtained with a biomechanistic model informed by mpMRI and clinical data collected during standard AS.<br \/>Here, we present a retrospective study with n = 16 PCa cases. All patients had three mpMRI scans obtained over 2.6 to 5.6 years during AS. Our biomechanistic model describes PCa growth in terms of the dynamics of tumor cell density as a combination of tumor cell mobility and net proliferation. The model is defined on the patient&#8217;s prostate geometry, which is segmented on T2-weighted MRI data. Tumor cell density estimates are derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps obtained from diffusion-weighted MRI data. To facilitate modeling, the longitudinal imaging datasets are non-rigidly co-registered for each patient. We initialize the model with the tumor cell density map obtained from the ADC map of the first scan. The model is parameterized by minimizing the model-data mismatch in tumor cell density at the second scan date, and then we perform a tumor forecast up to the third scan date. Finally, we build a logistic classifier from a panel of model-based biomarkers calculated from the personalized model forecasts (e.g., tumor volume, total proliferation activity) at the times of histopathological assessment (i.e., biopsy, surgery) to classify tumors as low risk (Gleason score 3+3, n = 16) or intermediate-high risk (Gleason score &#8805; 3+4, n = 15).<br \/>We obtained a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for tumor volume of 0.89 at both model calibration and forecasting horizon. The spatial fit of tumor cell density yielded a median Dice score and CCC of 0.80 and 0.59 at the second mpMRI date, and of 0.76 and 0.60 at the third mpMRI date, respectively. The logistic classifier of PCa risk yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.90 and operates at optimal sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.7%, 93.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The time trajectories of PCa risk obtained from the temporal predictions of the model-based biomarkers enabled identification of PCa progression by more than 1 year. Thus, while further development and validation over larger cohorts are required, these results suggest that our forecasting technology is a promising tool to predict PCa progression in AS and, hence, optimally guide monitoring and treatment decisions during AS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-09 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Magnetic resonance imaging,Active surveillance,Computational oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

While the importance of nuclear atypia has been known for centuries, its cause remains unclear. Nuclear shaping has been studied extensively in vitro, leading to the liquid drop model of nuclear shaping, which states that nuclear shape changes can occur due to excess area in the form of wrinkles or folds in the lamina. When the lamina becomes fully taut, the nucleus reaches a limiting steady shape. Wrinkles allow the nuclear shape to mirror the cell shape such as in invading cancer cells. The applicability of this model to nuclei in cancer tissues from human patients is untested. Here, tissues were stained for nuclear lamina proteins to test for the presence of excess area in the lamina. Diagnostic relevance of the drop model was assessed by quantitative Fourier analysis of high-resolution images of lamin-stained nuclei.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Deidentified patient tissues from breast, colon, head and neck, and skin were immunostained for lamin B1 and imaged at high resolution (60X, 1.5 NA). Nuclei were then roughly segmented by the deep learning program Cellpose, followed by segmentation with a custom approach that sensitively detects micron-scale variations in the laminar contour. An Elliptical Fourier Analysis was performed to quantify nuclear irregularity by describing nuclear shape with a series of elliptical harmonics. More irregular nuclei are described by larger Fourier coefficients at higher frequencies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Folds and wrinkles in the nuclear lamina were observed in healthy tissue from all four tissue types studied, indicating the presence of excess area in the lamina. The presence of irregular nuclear shape including wrinkling\/folds in the lamina was quantified with the Elliptical Fourier Coefficient (EFC) ratio. Posterior probability analysis related EFC ratio to tumor grade to assess the clinical value of the excess area found in the nuclear lamina. This revealed cancer-type dependent trends between EFC ratio and tumor grade.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Observations of wrinkling\/folds in the nuclear lamina in healthy and cancerous tissue are consistent with the liquid drop model of nuclear deformation. Quantification of nuclear lamina wrinkling with the EFC ratio, along with other nuclear shape parameters, can be a powerful approach for computer-based, explainable, clinical grading. Our findings reveal a fundamental principle of nuclear deformation in cancer tissues and suggest a new approach for improving the accuracy in cancer grading.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-09 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Mechanobiology,Nucleus,Pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Polyacrylamide hydrogels were fabricated and conjugated with collagen type I to create the ECM with different stiffness. MDA-MB-231 cells were continuously cultured on the hydrogels of the same corresponding stiffness. Growth rate was determined at certain time points by harvesting and counting the cells. Abundance of clonal MDA-MB-231 cells labeled with heritable DNA barcodes underwent the same selection was identified with sequencing of DNA barcode tags. Cellular phenotypes were characterized through immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. 3D migration of the cancer cells was examined using Boyden chamber assay. Cellular contractility was measured through traction force microscopy. Whole genome transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing were performed for transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis. Sustained culture of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells overall three months on soft ECM resulted in an increased proliferation rate and beta1 integrin-dependent spreading area of the cells. Such changes did not occur in clonal cells with low genetic variation and did not occur in ancestral cells on stiff substrates. Barcode analysis revealed two distinct surviving populations post-genetic selection, with one demonstrating robust proliferation on both soft and stiff ECM, and the other exhibiting preferential adaptation to the soft matrix. The soft-selected populations exhibited nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulator yes-associated protein and less wrinkled nuclei compared with ancestral populations when both populations were grown on soft ECM. Aggressive migration was observed in the soft-selected populations, indicating a more malignant selected phenotype. The soft-selected cells showed increased RhoA activity and contractile tension on a soft substrate compared to the ancestral cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed systematic differences between ancestral, stiff-selected, and soft-selected populations corresponding to enriched biological processes related to cell adhesion and ECM organization. Significant differences in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility were observed in soft selected populations which were correlated with changes in RNA expression. ECM stiffness exerts selection pressure on genetically variable cancer cell populations, selecting specific genetic variants in a cell population optimally adapted for that stiffness. Selected variants on soft ECM tend to be highly migratory, proliferative and generate high traction even on soft ECM. Our results highlight the importance of ECM stiffness-driven evolution in cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-09 Physical sciences in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Heterogeneity,Clonal evolution,Integrins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-C.

It has been widely hypothesized that diversity in clinical outcomes is driven by variability in tumor biology at scales ranging from inter-patient to inter-cellular. Indeed, the advent of technologies describing the tumor microenvironment (TME) at cellular resolution has demonstrated that TME organization is heterogeneous with respect to intra-tumor spatial location, body tumor location (primary vs metastatic), patient, and tumor type. However, the organizing principles that govern TME heterogeneity remain unclear. Without such organizing principles, it remains an arduous task to link descriptions of tumor biology heterogeneity to clinical outcomes in a mechanistically explainable manner. Through the application of network statistical inference models to spatial transcriptomic data, we have identified that nested spatial units (NSUs) are a core organizing principle of the TME. We find that NSUs are widely conserved across 96 patient biopsies of 14 distinct tumor types and 3 body locations (primary, abdominal metastases, brain metastases). Moreover, NSUs represent a transferrable organizing blueprint that allows for the spatial location of individual spots (5-50 cells) in a tumor biopsy to be predicted by the NSUs of a secondary, unrelated biopsy (Pearson correlation of spot-spot distance: 0.04 - 0.71, median 0.25). By using NSUs as the organizing unit of comparison, we identify variation in gene expression, biological pathways, and multicellular structures occurring across tumors in a distance-dependent manner. In summary, NSUs provide a foundation for the comparative analysis of tumor spatial biology and a path by which spatial biology can be mechanistically linked to patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Tumor microenvironment,Systems biology,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

To circumvent these challenges, we have utilized transcriptome-based systems biology approaches that identify targetable Master Regulator proteins (MRs) critical to maintaining the cancer cell state. OncoTarget analysis generates a rank order list of targetable MRs while OncoTreat analysis uses cognate cell lines matched to patient tumors to identify drugs that invert the MR signature. We used OncoTarget and OncoTreat analyses to identify existing drugs which could be repurposed to target MRs active in Ewing sarcoma.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A gene regulatory interactome was developed from 122 pediatric sarcoma samples to enable identification of MR targets using OncoTarget. To enable OncoTreat analysis, 2 cognate cell lines were subjected to high-throughput drug perturbational screens.

Ex vivo drug screens using PDX-derived cells were performed as a complementary assay to validate predictions. In vivo validation was performed in Ewing sarcoma PDXs.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The MR architecture of 3 Ewing sarcoma PDX models was evaluated using OncoTarget. OncoTreat analysis identified 43 drugs predicted to be active in at least 1 Ewing sarcoma PDX while OncoTarget analysis identified 20 MR targets predicted in at least 1 Ewing sarcoma PDX. DOT1L and AURKB were predicted targets across multiple Ewing sarcoma PDXs. Ex vivo screening of dissociated cells from 2 Ewing sarcoma PDXs was performed to select the most potent agents for in vivo validation. Three OncoTreat (clarithromycin, tivozanib and obataclax) and two OncoTarget (DOT1L targeted with EPZ-5676 and AURKB targeted with baracertib) predicted drugs were evaluated in a STAG2 mutant Ewing sarcoma PDX and all demonstrated significant abrogation of tumor growth including complete regression in baracertib-treated animals (p&#60;0.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These systems biology approaches can identify non-oncogene encoded vulnerabilities in Ewing sarcoma and hold the potential for expanding the number of therapeutic options for tumors driven by untargetable oncoproteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Systems biology,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.
