[{"Abstract":"Background:<b> <\/b> Since 2006 three studies, involving 289,089 adolescents, demonstrated a significant association (1.67(0.79-3.55),1.7(1.03-2.70),2.37(1.19-4.73)) between pubertal acne and poor outcome prostate cancer(PC) 30+ years later. This suggested <i>Cutibacterium acnes<\/i>, amicroaerophylic bacterium, might be contributing to PC bacterial dysbiosis analogous to the role of <i>H. pylori<\/i> in stomach cancer and explain why circumcision reduces PC risk. Six years ago, using MALDI-TOF, we demonstrated that the presence of seven obligate anaerobe species in addition to <i>C. acnes<\/i> were increased in PC and linked to increased PSA. This presentation studies stored samples from the PROVENT chemoprevention randomised PC active surveillance phase 2 trial analysed using 16S rDNA sequencing, and comparing obligate anaerobe frequency with those detected by culture and MALDI-TOF identification and their influence on PSA expression.<br \/>Methods:<b> <\/b> 89 urines of PROVENT trial patients were studied using 16S rDNA sequencing and followed for 24 months. In addition, 39 previously reported MALDI-TOF screened cohort patients (21 PCs and 18 BPHs) followed for 43 months. The frequency of 7 obligate bacterial genera (Actinobaculum, Finegoldia, Prevotella, Peptoniphilus, Peptostreptococcus &#38; Viellonella) was studied.<br \/>Results: Twenty six of 89 (29%) PROVENT urine samples had a majority of bacteria detected as obligate anaerobes (mean=68%), while it was 12 of the 39 (31%) in PC tested in MALDI-TOF. In the combined series, those patients (n=38) with obligate anaerobes had mean PSA of 9.59 ug\/L, while those without obligate anaerobes had a mean PSA of 6.29 ug\/L (n=90), (t=-2.925, p = 0.0058). In the MALDI-TOF series, statistically increased urological intervention rate was associated with the presence of anaerobes (p=0.045, Fisher&#8217;s exact test)<b>. <\/b><br \/>Discussion:<b> <\/b> These findings suggest that obligate anaerobe bacterial dysbiosis could be contributing to raised PSA through prostate cell damage, and possibly participating in the chronic inflammation and hypervascular changes that are seen in precancerous lesions. Checkpoint inhibitors have shown little benefit in prostate cancer. Recent reports from animal model studies of BCG resistance have suggested a short course combination of anti PDLI and anti NKG2a could break immune tolerance associated with expression of HLA-E and this approach could be of use to break tolerance to bacterial dysbiosis in the future. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Prostate cancer,Innate immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Simultaneously, emerging studies underscore the gut microbiota's crucial role in modulating immunity across diverse human diseases. Our investigation focuses on gut microbiome modulation, specifically using oral Vancomycin, a locally acting antibiotic. This approach enhances the direct and abscopal antitumor effects of RT, evident across multiple cancer models. Findings demonstrate Vancomycin significantly increases CD8+ T cell infiltration, targeting TAAs in primary and abscopal tumors, leading to elevated IFN-&#946; and IFN-&#947; expression in tumor-derived lymph nodes (TDLNs). Vancomycin's remarkable influence on RT effectiveness directly traces back to its impact on the gut microbiome composition, including a shift from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria, enrichment of Vancomycin-resistant strains, reduced bacterial diversity, and decreased SCFA concentrations.. Building on these compelling outcomes, we initiated a randomized pilot study involving stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing stereotactic body RT (SBRT). Patients were randomized to receive Vancomycin versus placebo, administered at 125 mg four times daily, commencing one week before SBRT and continuing during and after treatment for five total weeks. In an interim analysis, despite a small sample size, significant improvements in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were observed in those receiving the combination therapy. Additional investigations have reaffirmed our earlier findings in mice, emphasizing the depletion of specific bacterial populations, the rise in Vancomycin-resistant strains, and substantial reductions in SCFA concentrations in stool samples. Pathway analysis further underscores the impact of oral Vancomycin on gene expression related to the cross-presentation of TAAs. Together, these findings from both murine and human studies robustly affirm the concept that modulating the gut microbiome with Vancomycin can augment the ability of RT to trigger an anti-cancer immune response. We posit that this pioneering strategy is not only cost-effective but also holds the promise of substantially enhancing patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Microbiome,Radiation therapy,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Despite its success, persistent challenges like disease relapse and CAR-mediated toxicities remain. A comprehensive multicenter study involving 228 individuals revealed a significant association between antibiotic administration, particularly piperacillin\/tazobactam, meropenem, and imipenem\/cilastatin (P-I-M), targeting anaerobes within four weeks preceding CART-19 therapy, and adverse outcomes, including worsened survival and increased neurotoxicity. Intriguingly, another antibiotic, Cefepime, also used for neutropenic fever, displayed a positive trend when compared with P-I-M. This highlights the intricate relationship between the modulation of the intestinal microbiome and outcomes in CART-19 therapy for B cell malignancies. Building on these critical observations, our study delved into the impact of vancomycin-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T immunotherapy. Utilizing preclinical models of CD19+ A20 lymphoma and CD19+ B16 melanoma, we discovered that mice receiving vancomycin alongside CART-19 therapy exhibited enhanced tumor control and increased cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) compared to those receiving CART-19 alone. This effect was further validated through fecal microbiota transplants from healthy human donors to pre-conditioned mice, replicating the favorable findings. Importantly, our study extends to clinical correlates, as B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated with CART-19 and oral vancomycin displayed elevated CART-19 peak expansion compared to unexposed patients. These compelling results underscore the profound influence of the gut microbiota on CAR T cell therapy and suggest that vancomycin-induced gut microbiota modulation may emerge as a potent strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes across various tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Antigen presentation,CAR T cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, numerous factors influence patient response following ICI treatment. Beyond genetic factors, mutations, and levels of immune cell infiltration, several studies highlight the correlation between the gut microbiome and treatment response rates. Furthermore, specific bacterial compositions have been observed to shift during therapeutic interventions. Notably, studies have demonstrated that patients who used antibiotics before and during ICI treatment exhibited lower progression-free survival and overall survival, serving as evidence for this association. Our previous investigations elucidated the impact of distinct tumor microbial burdens on modulating immune activation. Consequently, our hypothesis posits the substantive involvement of the interplay between tumor microbial burden and the immune system response to ICI treatment.<br \/>We evaluated the presence of intra-tumoral microbes within Colorectal cancers (CRC) by examining TCGA data. Patients with elevated microbial levels demonstrated heightened immune activity and better survival rates. Using cybersport analysis, we validated increased mast cell infiltration in CRC patients with abundant microbes. Quantification involved assessing bacterial burden through 16s rRNA via FISH staining and mast cell counts using tryptase via IHC staining. Reducing bacterial load in MC38 cancer model, achieved by locally administering antibiotics, led to a diminished immune response when PD-1 was introduced to these mice. Cross-referencing TCGA data, we identified upregulated genes in CRC patients with high microbial burden and downregulated genes in mice receiving local antibiotics after MC38 cell implantation. The common genes were associated with immune responses, suggesting a strong correlation between bacterial burden and immune activity in CRCs. In conclusion, the high burden of bacteria in CRC improves immune response to ICI and increases the infiltration of mast cells, which all contribute to better survival rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor,Microbiome,Immunotherapy,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, it remains unknown how microbiome facilitates the host-immune cell crosstalk and promote tumorigenesis. Our recent study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) show that intratumor fungal microbiome facilitate the release of a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule IL-33 from cancer cells. The secreted IL33 from cancer cells in turns recruits ILC2 and T<sub>H<\/sub>2 cells which promotes PDAC tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of fungal mediated IL-33 release from PDAC cells remains unknown. Our follow up studies using high throughput integrated proteomic profiling and immunoprecipitation revealed a group of exocyst complex proteins interacting with IL-33 in the presence of fungus. The exocyst complex consists of eight sub-unit proteins that tethers the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and implicated in cellular exocytosis. We found EXOC6B a component of exocyst complex, modulates IL-33 release via exocytosis pathway from the PDAC cells. Genetic depletion of EXOC6B resulted in shunted IL-33 release and significantly abrogated PDAC tumor progression. Mechanistically, we found that mycobiome activates a non-canonical TLR2-CARD9 pathway, thereby driving IL-33 nucleocytoplasmic transport and exocytosis. This study identifies a unique mechanism of EXOC6B mediated release of IL-33 that expands our knowledge on how host-mycobiome interaction shapes PDAC tumor microenvironment by intricate molecular mechanism. Our study identifies EXOC6B as a new therapeutics target involved in the mycobiome driven IL-33 secretion in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Tumor microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This is largely due to patients having progressed to an advanced stage of disease by the time of diagnosis. Thus, better understanding the pathogenesis of early LUAD is paramount for the identification of key targets and development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for clinical management of the disease. <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations are the most common oncogenic driver alteration in human LUAD. Previously, we have found that <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant LUAD patients whose tumors harbor high expression of Mucin 5 AC (MUC5AC), a main airway secretory mucin, have significantly lower survival and poor prognosis. Mucins are membrane-bound and secreted hydrophilic proteins essential in clearance of allergens, pathogens, and debris in the lung airway. However, overproduction of mucins, such as MUC5AC, plays roles in the pathogenesis of airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Given the known effect of mucin polymers on bacterial growth and the immune microenvironment in the context of other airway inflammatory diseases, in this study, our objective is to better understand the MUC5AC-to-microbiome relationship using a lung epithelial specific mouse model of KRAS-mutant LUAD (CC-LR) and test the combinatorial effects of genetic deletion of MUC5AC (CC-LR\/Muc5ac<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) and the pan-microbiome depletion on tumor progression, the lung immune contexture, and microbiome (lung and gut). Thus far, we found that genetic deletion of MUC5AC or pan-microbiome depletion significantly decreases the tumor burden (66% vs 50%, respectively). Additionally, both groups show to have a significantly decreased percentage of tumor-specific Ki67+ cells, a cell proliferation marker, and ERG+ cells, an angiogenesis marker, in comparison to the CC-LR controls. The combination of the lack of MUC5AC with pan-microbiome depletion has also shown to reduce tumor development that needs further investigation. These findings highlight the need to better understand the mechanistic interaction between mucins and the lung\/gut microbiome in the context of KRAS-mutant lung cancer which we are currently exploring. It also suggests that their relationship could be a key target for modulation, potentially leading to the development of a minimally invasive alternative preventive and\/or treatment modality against <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Microbiome,Immunomodulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Further, enrichment of commensal microbes can promote immunostimulatory effects, immune based anti-tumor responses, and increased cytotoxic T cell abundance within the TME. Conversely, the presence of gut microbes known to cause inflammatory states in gut tissues may be correlated to negative immunotherapy outcomes or toxicities. To this end, we aimed to evaluate the impact of microbiome manipulation on gut microbe diversity, systemic immunity, local TME, and PSCA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in our established syngeneic prostate cancer mouse model.<br \/>Methods: In an immune competent mouse model of PSCA+ prostate cancer developed in our lab, we sequentially modified the gut microbiome using antibiotic clearance followed by distinct human derived fecal matter transfers (CPI-FMT, HD-FMT, or No-FMT). Simultaneously, we treated microbiome modified tumor bearing mice with PSCA-targeting CAR T cells and measured differences in anti-tumor efficacy and survival. To provide mechanistic insight, we performed longitudinal whole genome sequencing (WGS) of fecal matter microbes and RNA sequencing on spleen and tissues following FMT administration.<br \/>Results: In our model, a unique checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treated patient derived human FMT (CPI-FMT) improved PSCA-CAR anti-tumor responses relative to healthy donor (HD-FMT) or No-FMT treatment controls. CPI-FMT administration also significantly improved overall survival in CAR T cell and non-targeting T cell control treated mice. Temporal analysis of microbes present in the gut following CPI-FMT and HD-FMT treatment show CPI-FMT treated mice exhibit favorable maintenance of gut microbe species richness and significant increase in microbiota diversity. We identify CPI-FMT provides an enrichment of specific microbes associated with preservation of gut homeostasis and improved immune response. RNA sequencing analysis on tumor tissues show differential transcription of immune related pathways following FMT which may influence immune and CAR T cell function.<br \/>Conclusions: We show that our mouse prostate cancer model is sensitive microbiome modulation and can significantly impact PSCA-CAR T cell directed anti-tumor responses. Temporal WGS analysis of gut fecal matter reveal enrichment suggest specific species abundances which may promote gut homeostasis over dysbiosis or inflammatory states and may account for improved CAR T cell response. We aim to further develop this model to interrogate candidate targeted microbiome modifiers which may impact mechanisms which promote CAR T cell and immune function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Microbiome,Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Although Immunotherapies revolutionized cancer therapy, the majority of CRC patients, particularly with metastatic disease, do not respond to the treatments. This necessitates a better mechanistic understanding of the tumor-immune cell interactions in the context of CRC. Microbiome influences multiple biological aspects of the host including immune responses against cancers. Here, we show that the gut microbiome influences cancer MHC-I and -II expression levels and restricts tumor progression and metastasis, resulting in longer survival in 3 different CRC models and two different mouse strains. We found that the anti-tumor effects are dependent on T cells and B cells. Interestingly, depletion of B cell negated anti-metastatic effects of gut microbiome. Mechanistically, MHC-II expression in cancer cells mediates the anti-tumor effects of the microbiome. MHC-II upregulation on human CRC organoids enhances cancer-immune cell interactions and associated apoptosis, demonstrating an anti-tumor role and significance of MHC-II in human CRC. Thus, gut microbes that enhance MHC-II antigen presentation promotes anti-tumor immunity and may be utilized to enhance efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Microbiome,MHC II,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In our effort to harness the potential of beneficial gut microbiota, we identified specific bacterial species that are less abundant in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. Oral supplementation of these bacteria causes an effective anti-tumor activity in various cancer models through specific activation of cytotoxic T-cells. Based on these results, we aimed to identify the mechanism of action of this bacterial treatment. In vivo studies were performed in C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mice. MC-38, CT-26, B16, LLC1.1 and 4T1 cells were used for the heterotopic tumor injections. Immunophenotyping was performed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Metagenomics analysis and whole genome sequence were performed to identify the bacterial strains. Metabolomics analyses were conducted to analyze bacterial supernatant and serum compositions of mice and patients. Since we found that the bacterial treatment led to a systemic anti-tumor effect, we analyzed serum of the mice that received the bacteria and found that a specific metabolite was highly upregulated compared to untreated mice. Analysis of the medium supernatant from cultures of the bacterial strains led to the discovery that metabolite identified in the serum is being produced by our bacteria. Applying this bacterial metabolite alone in the mouse cancer models led to a similar immune activation and anti-tumor effect as the supplementation with our bacterial strains. Furthermore, we identified the receptor that is targeted by this molecule through experiments with known agonists and antagonists for the target. The anti-tumor effect of the bacteria as well as the bacterial metabolite was blocked through the application of a receptor antagonist, proving that activation of this receptor is the mechanism that drives the enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Activation of the receptor, which is mainly expressed on macrophages led to enhanced IL-12 production and recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells into the tumor. Together, we have fully characterized the mechanism of action of our bacterial treatment, including the secreted active metabolite, the target receptor, and the activated immune cells. We are developing a live biotherapeutic product for the treatment of cancer based on oral administration of lyophilized bacteria. The known mechanism of action of our bacteria helps us to optimize the efficacy of our product, define the right dosage and understand possible side effects. Additionally, it enables us to improve patient selection and prediction of treatment response. Since our product is based on commensal bacteria that are commonly present in healthy individuals, we expect a very good safety and tolerability profile. Therefore, our therapy aims to significantly improve the efficacy of cancer treatment as well as the quality of life of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immunomodulation,Colorectal cancer,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

The dynamic structure, composition, and function of gut microbiota can be influenced by numerous factors, among which nutritional profile act as most crucial determinant. Microbial consortia inhabiting the gut have been implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of various cancers and are known to influence cancer immunosurveillance and response to immunotherapy. Despite these known associations, the underlying mechanisms by which dietary interventions such as those rich in fiber (high-fiber diet) regulate gut-immune axis in prevention of lung cancer are poorly defined. Here, we employed a human-relevant mouse model in which knockout of G-protein coupled receptor 5A (<i>Gprc5a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) and exposure to tobacco lead to development of preneoplasia and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Mice were randomly grouped based on dietary treatment: no fiber (control), 10% cellulose, 10% pectin-inulin following weaning (early life) or after transplant of MDA-F471 NNK-induced LUAD cells (dietary intervention). Tumor growth and volumes were most significantly reduced in mice fed a high-fiber pectin-inulin diet. Notably, anti-tumor effects of the high-fiber diet were observed in both early life and later dietary intervention settings. 16S rRNA-Seq analysis of fecal pellets revealed significant differences in gut alpha as well as beta diversity, the latter indicating clear separation of community structure between fiber-deprived versus high-fiber diet groups. Evidently, gut microbiota of pectin-inulin fed mice displayed significantly elevated relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides sartorii<\/i>, <i>Bacteroides caecimuris<\/i>, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila <\/i>and<i> Bifidobacterium pseudolongum,<\/i> taxa that have been reported to be strongly associated with favorable responses to immunotherapy. High-fiber fed mice also showed significantly reduced fractions of tumor-promoting genera such as <i>Odoribacter<\/i> and <i>Alistipes<\/i>.<i> <\/i>These effects were accompanied by widespread changes in the tumor immune microenvironment between fiber-rich and fiber-poor groups. Pectin-inulin fed mice displayed enhanced antitumor immune responses evident by remarkably increased fractions of B lineage cells, cDC1s and M1-likemacrophages and, conversely, reduced levels of activated cDC2s, M2 macrophages and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our findings inform on novel mechanisms by which dietary fiber robustly impacts gut consortia and immune milieu in the inhibition of LUAD. Our findings also suggest that the incorporation of dietary fiber in cancer treatment (e.g., immunotherapy) could improve outcomes for patients with LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Gut microbiota,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiota influences irAE development, however the microbe-immune crosstalk underpinning this remains cryptic.<br \/>Methods: Paired pre- &#38; post-treatment (baseline\/week 6) stool samples from 129 Australian and Dutch melanoma patients treated on trial with neo-adjuvant combination anti-PD1\/anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy were analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Matched PBMCs at both timepoints were analyzed using mass cytometry (n=71).<br \/>Results: ICI immunotherapy resulted in changes in the relative abundance of specific bacterial groups in the faecal microbiota, however the microbial community as a whole remained relatively stable. In particular enhanced oralization of the gut microbiome was observed with treatment, including a significant increase in the relative abundance of oral <i>Streptococcus<\/i> species in the gut (P=0.0004). These changes were particularly evident in patients whose microbial communities were <i>Bacteroidaceae <\/i>(Ba)-dominated at baseline, and those who developed severe (grade 3+) irAEs. Indeed, Ba-dominated microbiomes were linked with comparatively higher rates of severe irAEs compared to patients with <i>Ruminococcaceae <\/i>(Ru)<i>-<\/i>dominated gut microbiomes (P= 0.0440). Furthermore, Ba patients developed severe irAEs earlier during treatment, prior to week 6 (P=0.0016). A significant reduction in transitional B cells (CD24+ CD38hi CD27-) (P&#60;0.0001) and an increase in activated B cells subsets (CD27- CD38- CD24- populations) (P=0.0022) were observed between baseline and week 6 across all patients who developed or went on to develop severe irAEs. Most notably, Ba patients who developed early, severe irAEs specifically had significantly higher frequencies of overall circulating B cells (P=0.0018) and lower frequencies of ICOS+ Tregs at week 6 post treatment (P=0.0005), which was not observed in Ru-dominated irAE patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Higher risk of early, severe irAEs were associated with <i>Bacteroidaceae<\/i>-dominated gut microbiomes, reduced microbial community stability, and increases in activated circulating B cells during treatment. We postulate that differing baseline microbial community assemblages are associated with altered pre-established intestinal homeostasis influencing the likelihood of irAE development. Together, the data highlights a potential relationship between B cells, the gut microbiota and irAE development which may point to early steps in the induction of irAEs during ICI immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The interplay between bile acids and immune cell differentiation, particularly of macrophages and T-cells, is a crucial aspect of the CRC microenvironment. Given the high-animal-fat diets' influence on the microbiome&#8217;s production of hydrophobic secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), this study investigates the potential immunomodulatory effects of their lower concentrations and their isomers in possibly fostering M2-like macrophage expansion.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Clinical samples were obtained during colonoscopies with no tumor findings at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago.

To explore the immunological effects of secondary bile acids, the macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line, alongside peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from C57BL\/6J mice, were treated with LCA and LCA isomers. Following the bile acid treatment, LPS (100 ng\/mL) or IL-4 (40 ng\/ml) was added to elicit pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory states, respectively.

Ex vivo treatments with isoalloLCA and IsoLCA led to notable changes in the M2 macrophage differentiation and shifts in PGE2 production upon exposure to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory stimuli, suggesting a nuanced alteration in the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This study highlights a significant ethnic variation in bile acid profiles, with a potential impact on immune modulation and CRC risk. The reduced presence of certain bile acid isomers in African American subjects may influence the risk of CRC through altered macrophage differentiation and function. These findings emphasize the need for personalized dietary and therapeutic strategies to modulate the bile acid metabolome, potentially reducing CRC disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Inflammation,Bile acid,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

It has been reported that <i>Fusobacteria nucleatum<\/i> (<i>F. nucleatum<\/i>) is one of the most famous bacteria associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). It has been reported that the abundance of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> is associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival (CSS), however it remains unclear for association with <i>F. nulceatum<\/i> and relapse-free survival (RFS). If <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> has a significant involvement in tumor progression of colorectal cancer, the abundance of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> should be associated with not only CSS but also RFS in colorectal cancer. In this study, we measured the bacterial mass of F. nucleatum in tumor tissue of CRC patients in Stage II-III to explore the differences in prognosis. <b>Methods<\/b>: We included patients with CRC in stage II-III who underwent surgical treatment at Nippon Medical School Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020 except patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and had multiple cancers. We measured the absolute of<i> F. nucleatum <\/i>copy number of the DNA exacted tumor tissues using droplet digital PCR. <b>Results<\/b>: 253 patients with CRC were included. 128 patients had pathological stage II and 125 patients had pathological stage III. Among 253 patients, 104 patients had right-sided CRC, 89 patients had left-sided, and 60 patients had rectal cancer. <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> was detected in 166 patients (65.6%), and the median of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> copy number was 1.08 (range; 0.00 -2791.3). <i>F. nucleatum <\/i>copy number was more abundant in right-sided CRC than in left-sided and rectal cancer (p= 0.02, p=0.01). There was no significant difference between stage II CRC and stage III. We categorized patients into two groups based on the median cut point of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> copy number: the <i>F. nucleatum-high<\/i> group and the<i> F. nucleatum<\/i>-low group for comparison with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Patients with high abundance of <i>F. nucleatum <\/i>exhibited T4 of tumor depth (p=0.03), right-sided CRC (p=0.01), longer tumor circumference (p &#60;0.001), longer tumor length (p &#60;0.001), and no lymph node metastasis (p=0.024). There was no significant difference in relapse-free survival between the <i>F. nucleatum<\/i>-high group and <i>F. nucleatum<\/i>-low group among whole patients (p=0.53). Analyzing divided tumor location, in right-sided CRC high abundance of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> was significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival than low abundance (p=0.02), while in left-sided and rectal cancer there was no significant difference (p=0.61). <b>Conclusion<\/b>: <i>F. nucleatum <\/i>was more abundant in right-sided CRC and associated with relapse-free survival only in right-sided CRC. <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> may make a greater impact on right-sided CRC than on left-sided and rectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Microbiome,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

In this study, our objective was to analyze the fecal microbiota of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with locally advanced disease undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (IO-CT).<br \/>Methods and patients: Baseline stool samples were collected from 86 resectable stage IIIA\/B NSCLC patients enrolled in the NADIM II clinical trial (NCT03838159). The patients were randomly assigned to receive either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen), and the samples were analyzed using the Ion AmpliSeq Microbiome Health Research assay (ThermoFisher). The NGS analysis utilized the AmpliSeq Microbiome Health w1.3 workflow. Alpha diversity was assessed using the Simpson and Chao1 Index.<br \/>Results: Among the 86 collected stool samples, 77 were deemed valid for analysis. <i>Bacteroides<\/i> were the most common genus with a relative percentage (RP) of 18.9% &#177; 14.8 followed by <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i> (13.4% &#177; 7.8). The presence of bacteria from the genera <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i> was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) [HR = 0.4 (0.16-0.98), and HR = 0.08 (0.01-0.72), respectively] and overall survival (OS) [HR = 0.19 (0.06-0.62)], and HR = 0.04 [0.01-0.43], respectively), in the experimental arm. The detection of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii<\/i> (validated by qPCR) was associated with improved PFS [HR = 0.17 (0.04-0.76)] and OS [HR = 0.05 (0.01-0.29)] in the experimental. On the other hand, detection of bacteria from the genera <i>Synergistes<\/i>, <i>Lactobacillus<\/i>, and <i>Anaerotruncus<\/i> was associated to higher risk of disease progression [HR = 9.9 (1.2-85), HR = 3.7 (1.5-9.1), and HR = 12 (1.4-110)] and death [HR = 51 (3.2-820), HR = 6.7 (2-23), and HR = 25 (2.3-280)] in this set of patients.In the entire cohort, patients whose samples were in the highest tertile of alpha diversity, had significantly prolonged PFS compared to those with intermediate or low diversity [HR = 0.39 (0.16-0.94)]. Finally, 25 colitis adverse events (CAE) occurred in 18 patients, including two Grade 3 (2.3%) and four Grade 2 (4.6%) events. A higher RP of <i>Bacteroides<\/i> were found in patients who did not suffer colitis events (P = 0.016), whereas higher RP of <i>Coriobacterium<\/i> were detected in patients who suffered CAE (P = 0.023).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that composition of the gut microbiome may play a crucial role in the effectiveness of neoadjuvant IO-CT in NSCLC patients. Specifically, the presence of <i>F. prausnitzii<\/i> may enhance the antitumor activity of these treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immunotherapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Earlier studies from our laboratory identified 11 bacterial strains that were sufficient to inhibit melanoma development by inducing anti-tumor immunity in germ-free mice. Of these, three were predominant at the time of tumor collection. We thus set out to address whether fewer bacterial strains may be sufficient for melanoma growth inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that the administration of one bacterial strain, <i>B. rodentium<\/i>, was sufficient to attenuate melanoma growth in gnotobiotic mice. In all cases, gnotobiotic mice were also administered the altered Schadler flora (ASF), a mixture of 8 bacterial strains that are provided to establish minimal flora in these mice. RNAseq-based gene expression studies identified enrichment of immune-related genes, suggesting enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Metabolomic analysis identified reduced levels of tryptophane and isoleucine, which were implicated in control of immune system function.

Clinical proofs of concept were obtained in pilot studies using healthy or ICI-responder donor-derived fecal matter transplants to modulate the gut microbiome of non-responding cancer patients and improve their response to ICI. These results support the development of Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies<sup>TM<\/sup> (MET) replicating at large industrial scale the effects of ICI-responders gut microbiome. MaaT Pharma, a clinical-stage biotech, has developed a unique, ground-breaking, patented co-culture process (MET-C). MaaT034, the first-in-class co-cultured microbiome product, has been selected for optimizing intestinal homeostasis and to activate immune functions alone and in combination with an ICI treatment.<br \/>Method: We combined metagenomic analysis, metabolite quantification by LC-MRM\/MS, Caco-2\/THP-1 leaky gut model, PBMC assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to assess the impact of MaaT034 on gut homeostasis and immune activation.<br \/>Results: Metagenomic analysis demonstrates that MaaT034 replicates the richness and diversity of native-based microbiome ecosystems. Metabolite quantification also revealed that MaaT034 microbes secrete anti-inflammatory metabolites such as short chain fatty acids and indoles, as well as metabolites associated with ICI response such as secondary biliary acids. Using a Caco-2\/THP-1 leaky gut model, we then demonstrate that MaaT034 conditioned medium was able to restore the integrity of a THP-1-induced damaged gut barrier. This was associated with and a reduction of inflammatory signals. We further performed a human PBMC assay to evaluate the impact of MaaT034 on immune cell activation. We observed the secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines associated with myeloid cell activation in response to MaaT034 conditioned medium. Notably, anti-CD3 mediated T-cells activation was further increased in response to MaaT034 conditioned medium as evidenced by increased IFN&#947; release associated with increased Granzyme B and CD25. Finally, MLR was performed to determine the immunomodulatory potential of MaaT034 through the interaction between T-cells and monocytes-derived dendritic cells (moDC). Interestingly, MaaT034 conditioned medium improved moDC maturation as well as moDC-induced T-cell activation. MaaT034 conditioned medium further increased anti-PD-1 mediated T-cell activation, as evidenced by IFN&#947; release.<br \/>Conclusion: Altogether, these results highlight the potential of MaaT034 to produce metabolites involved in the restoration of gut barrier integrity and stimulation of immune cell response to ICI therapy, with potential benefit for solid tumors treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immune checkpoint blockade,Combination therapy,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

In this study, we investigate the function of MAITs in the tumor microenvironment of neoadjuvant anti-PD1 treated lung cancer patients (NCT02259621)). Paired single cell RNA\/TCR sequencing analysis revealed an oligoclonal expansion of MAITs comprising of canonical TRAV1-2+ and non-canonical MAITs TRAV1-2-. TCR capture from canonical MAIT clonotypes confirmed their <i>in vitro<\/i> recognition of 5-OP-RU, bacteria derived riboflavin derivative as well as MR1 dependent recognition of live bacteria present in the tumor. However, the nature of antigens recognized by non-canonical MAITs remains poorly understood. On mining transcriptional profiles of MAITs, we observed that canonical MAITs were characterized by high clonal amplification whereas the non-canonical clonotypes expressed a strong activation\/exhaustion gene signature. This suggests that both these MAIT populations recognize different types of antigens, differentially activate, and respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the non-canonical MAITs being highly dysfunctional. Using bacterial 16S RNA amplicon and metagenomics sequencing, we seek to identify microbial and metabolomics signatures associated with MAIT activation and response to ICB. We identified MAITs to express a cytotoxic signature making them a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Our findings will provide further insights into the nature of ligands recognized by MAITs and the mechanisms associated with MR1 dependent recognition and tumor killing. Investigating the role of unconventional T-cells in response to ICB has the potential to reveal new tumor-associated antigens which could open avenues into innovative combination immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising antitumor treatment that selectively induces oncolytic cell death in tumor cells. We have previously developed OBP-702, a telomerase-specific oncolytic adenovirus armed with the p53 tumor suppressor gene, highlighting potent antitumor effects across different cancer types. To explore the potential of gut microbial metabolites, particularly butyrate, in augmenting the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We assessed the synergistic antitumor effects of butyrate and OBP-702 in cytotoxic assay using two human (HCT116, SW48) and two murine (CT26, MC38) colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro, and the in vivo antitumor effects in subcutaneous tumor models using HCT116 and CT26. We explored underlying mechanisms of the synergistic effects, focusing on the influences of butylate on viral infectivity via Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) and integrins, and antitumor immunity via tumor MHC-I expression and CD8-positive T cells.<br \/>Results: Butyrate and OBP-702 showed potent synergistic effects in all four cell lines in vitro, and the combination suppressed tumor growth significantly in HCT116 and CT26 subcutaneous tumors compared to each monotherapy. These synergistic effects were produced by butyrate increasing the potential of OBP-702 by enhancing viral infection efficiency via upregulating expressions of CAR and integrins on tumor cells. Butyrate also increased MHC-I expression on tumor cells by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to increased CXCL10 expression, which led to activation of antitumor immunity through recruitment of CD8-positive T cells in tumor tissues. The synergistic effects of butyrate and OBP-702 were proved in an orthotopic colorectal tumor model with liver metastases using CT26 cells expressing luciferase, in which this combination not only reduced tumor growth, but also improved survival by activating antitumor immunity via CD8-positive T cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Butyrate and OBP-702 showed synergistic antitumor effects via activation of systemic antitumor immunity in addition to direct effects of butyrate on viral cytotoxic potential, which provides valuable insights into the development of innovative cancer treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Microbiome,Orthotopic models,Antitumor effect,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Fecal microbiome transplants (FMT) have validated the importance of the gut microbiome in enhancing response and overcoming resistance to immunotherapy. However, donor selection remains a key challenge for FMT. Heterogenous responses using Healthy Donors (HD) and ICB Complete Responders (CR) as FMT donors suggest donor characteristics alone do not determine response. Here, we posit that donor-recipient relationships are critical in determining clinical responses to FMT.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We studied a cohort of ICB-refractory, metastatic melanoma patients treated with combined FMT and ICB (10 recipients, 2 donors). Patient gut microbiomes were profiled using whole metagenomic sequencing (WMS) of longitudinal stool collections (baseline, day 7, day 31, and day 65 post-FMT). Immune infiltration of on-treatment tumor and colon biopsies was quantified with immunohistochemistry. mTraCX, an Earth Mover&#8217;s Distance-based algorithm, was used to evaluate taxonomic engraftment between donors and recipients.

Taxonomic engraftment (mTraCX) correlated positively with functional engraftment (Bray-Curtis distance) (r=0.89, p&#60;0.0001).

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy by offering survival benefit in many solid malignancies, however, it is still not effective in pancreatic cancer. Host factors are crucial modulators of responses to immunotherapy. The roles of gut microbiome in modulating the immune system and determining cancer outcomes have been well established. Eating patterns can alter the gut microbiota and metabolic output, both of which affect anti-tumor immune responses. Intermittent fasting (IF), a form of dietary restriction which is characterized by limited feeding with unlimited calorie consumption during a certain time window. IF has been shown to affect gut microbiota composition, modulate immunity, and metabolic processes. Despite the well-known beneficial role of fasting in pancreatic conditions, including pancreatitis and diabetes, its effect in the treatment of pancreatic cancer has not been explored. Our study found that IF reverses immunotherapy resistance in PDAC. IF can reshape gut microbiota composition and reprogram the metabolism of host. We found that IF improves anti-tumor immunity through modulating gut microbiota. Depletion of gut microbiota can abrogate the beneficial effect of IF on anti-tumor response, while fecal microbiota transplantation from mice exposed to IF can sensitize the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, metabolic profiling and transcriptomic sequencing, our findings elucidate the mechanism of IF-remodeled gut bacteria influencing metabolic molecules which drive immune cells activation. Our study suggests that IF-based interventions have potential utility for the prevention and treatment of PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,Microbiome,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Emerging evidence strongly supports a causal role for specific pro-carcinogenic driver bacteria within the colonic microbiota. Invasive bacterial biofilms may initiate or accelerate CRC through epithelium-autonomous or inflammation-dependent mechanisms. To better understand host-microbe interactions during colonic tumorigenesis, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and immunofluorescence to define the molecular spatial organization of colonic tissue from germ-free <i>Apc<sup>Min<\/sup><\/i><sup>\/+<\/sup> mice colonized with bacteria from human biofilm-associated CRC. In absorptive colonocytes, differential gene expression analysis showed the gastric metaplasia-associated glycoprotein <i>Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1 (DMBT1)<\/i> is highly upregulated by <i>C. difficile<\/i>. Surprisingly, our spatial transcriptomic analysis showed <i>DMBT1<\/i> was dramatically downregulated in dysplastic foci compared with normal-appearing tissue. We show that DMBT1 protein is downregulated in 100% of dysplastic foci across 3 different mouse models of colonic tumorigenesis: <i>C. difficile<\/i>-associated tumorigenesis in <i>Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup><\/i>, azoxymethane\/dextran sodium sulfate, and <i>Lrig1<sup>CreER\/+<\/sup>;Apc<sup>fl\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice (n = 57 foci from 11 mice). Immunofluorescent staining of DMBT1 is markedly downregulated compared with normal adjacent crypts. Using scRNA-seq data and tissue microscopy in human CRC, we confirmed the same pattern of downregulated DMBT1 expression in dysplastic crypts compared with normal-appearing crypts. We present data from a human mucosal biofilm-associated colonic tumorigenesis murine model at single-cell resolution to reveal interesting cell type-specific transitions and generalizable mechanisms of tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that DMBT1 is a component of the gut epithelial response to pathogens and a critical regulator of proliferation and differentiation during post-injury restitution. We are now functionally testing how the loss of DMBT1 impacts tumorigenesis using human organoids. Ultimately, these studies aim to reveal novel biomarkers and\/or targets for therapeutic intervention in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumorigenesis,Colorectal,Microbiome,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Preclinical models demonstrate enhanced antitumor responses with RT combined with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade but give limited insight into the determinants of success for such combination therapies (CT). The gut microbiome, pivotal in conditioning local and peripheral immunity, influences PD-1-based immunotherapy efficacy in various cancers. Immune profiling indicates heightened systemic and antitumor immunity in responders with a favorable gut microbiome, enriched in <i>Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium<\/i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i>. Oral gavage of immunogenic bacteria further enhances combined RT and anti-PD-L1 therapy. <u>We thus aim to 1) elucidate the role of patients&#8217; microbiome in shaping anti-tumor immune responses to CT, and 2) use its composition as a predictive factor for CT success.<\/u><br \/>METHODS: We performed shotgun metagenomics on microbial DNA from fecal materials of MIBC RT responders (R, n=26) and non-responders (NR, n=11). Fecal homogenates from donors were gavaged into germ-free (GF) mice. Three weeks post-gavage, MB49 tumor cells were subcutaneously delivered to mice, randomized into four groups: control, anti-PD-L1, RT, and RT + anti-PD-L1. Tumors were harvested seven days post-treatment for single-cell RNA-seq and TCR sequencing (10X Genomics), while stool samples were collected weekly for 16S sequencing.<br \/>RESULTS: Significant gut microbial disparities were observed between R and NR MIBC patients, with particular enrichment in known promoters of anti-PD-L1 response, such as <i>Phocaeicola dorei<\/i> in R. Transplantation of R microbiome into GF mice resulted in significant increases in predicted survival, tumor growth delay, and counts of effector CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration in the RT+PD-L1 arm. Conversely, NR microbiome transplantation correlated with increased neutrophil and T<sub>reg <\/sub>infiltration, abrogating the survival tumor growth delay benefits of the combination arm. Spatial tissue analyses revealed higher neutrophil densities around CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in all NR arms. Single-cell RNA-seq of tumor-infiltrating immune cells unveiled skewed CD4 and CD8 polarization between R and NR <i>in vivo<\/i> batches.<br \/>SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first study to use FMT as a modulator of response in the context of radiation therapy combinations in MIBC. Our results highlight that the gut microbiome alone may condition a favorable immune terrain for combinatorial therapies involving radiation. This offers strong predictive value for personalized therapeutic approaches in selecting patients who will benefit the most from bladder-sparing therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Microbiome,Immunotherapy,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

There is growing evidence indicating that the oral bacteria might translocate to the intestine, potentially causing disruptions in the balance of gut microbes. Our study delves into the complex interplay between oral pathogens, gut microbiota, and colon carcinogenesis in AA patients. Methods: 16S rRNA sequencing of tumor and non-tumor tissues, utilized qPCR for detection of oral bacteria <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum<\/i> (Fn) and <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis<\/i> (Pg) relative abundance, performed cytokine profiling via multiplex ELISA, and employed NAPPA for antibody response assessment. Results: Colon tumor tissues had lower microbial diversity, notably in right-sided tumors, with distinct biofilm-associated bacteria. Novel discoveries emerged from differential abundance testing, revealing <i>Prevotella intermedia <\/i>and<i> Treponema socranski to be <\/i>associated with early cancer stage<i> <\/i>and left-sided location<i>, <\/i>and<i> Fusobacterium necrophorum<\/i> with advanced cancer stage and right-sided location. qPCR demonstrated Fn and Pg elevation in right-sided tumors and late cancer stages. Both were detected in 45% of tumors versus 37% in non-tumor tissues and 19.15% of tumors and 25.53% in non-tumor tissues, respectively. Fn-positive groups exhibited distinct microbial signatures, with altered bacterial abundances and dysbiosis, including increased CRC-associated bacteria <i>Faecalibacterium and Helicobacter<\/i>, increased oral pathogen abundance (<i>Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Treponema<\/i>), and reduced beneficial bacteria.<i><\/i> Serological analysis highlighted elevated levels of IL-2, IL-10, IFN-&#947;, and RANK in advanced cancer stages and increased CRP levels in right-sided tumors. By NAPPA analysis, 30 bacterial proteins (anti-IgG) showed a seroprevalence of more than 15% in the samples, with those being the most seroprevalent anti-HP131 and anti-HP-1564 (68% and 61% of all samples) of <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i>, and anti-msnK (64%) of <i>Streptococcus gallolyticus<\/i>. Conclusions: Our study emphasized the reduced diversity in tumor tissues, particularly in right-sided tumors in AA colon cancer. Fn presence in colonic tumors correlated with CRC-associated bacteria and oral pathogen aggregation, suggesting its potential role in cancer pathogenesis. Combining the analysis of cytokines and pathogenic bacteria antibodies may serve as broader serological biomarkers for disease severity and location. These findings advance our comprehension of microbiota-cancer interactions, directing personalized diagnostics and treatments in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colon cancer,Immune response,Disparities ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Data gathered from older children or the parents\/guardian of young children.<br \/>Results: A profile involving each participant&#8217; diet, physical activity, and sociodemographic characteristics through self- reporting questionnaire is obtained.<br \/>Discussion: Gut microbiota can regulate many functions of the tumor-bearing meta-organism, typically through immunomodulation. Known microbial mechanisms can alter non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic components of the gut epithelial barrier, modulate lymphoid organ activities, and regulate immune tone of the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>Conclusion: Understanding information about microbiome and its role in causing diseases as well as each participant&#8217; diet, physical activity and other sociodemographic characteristics help to raise participants&#8217; awareness about the importance of taking care of their gut health.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,probiotics,Pediatric cancers,prebiotics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This is associated with improved overall survival and potentially better response to immunotherapy. Yet the reason behind enriched Asian immune profiles is unclear. This study investigated microbes found in Malaysian breast tumors in association with immune profiles. We used an existing dataset of RNA-seq data from fresh frozen breast tumor tissue (n=978). Sequencing reads were trimmed and filtered to remove human reads. Non-human reads were mapped to Kraken2 and relative abundance was estimated using Bracken. Microbiome analysis was conducted on R following Microbiome OMA guidebook. The top five genera found in the Malaysian Breast Cancer (MyBrCa) cohort were <i>Pseudomonas, Siphoviridae,<\/i> <i>Bacillus, Escherichia and Klebsiella<\/i>. Alpha diversity of basal subtype microbiota was significantly higher than Her2 subtype (Shannon index, p=0.027) whilst the other subtypes were more homogenous. MyBrCa patients with low immune scores were significantly different from high immune scores while controlling for age, stage, grade, ethnicity and PAM50 subtype (PERMANOVA, F-statistic = 1.656, p=0.05). Differential abundance analysis revealed <i>Sulfidibacter<\/i> and <i>Priestia<\/i> to be significantly different in abundance between high vs low IFNg groups (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60; 0.05) using ALDEx2, ANCOM-BC2 and ZicoSeq and LinDA algorithms. <i>Sulfidibacter<\/i> was significantly different between high vs low immune group for Bindea combined immune score and ESTIMATE score groups (FDR-adjusted p-value &#60;0.05). An independent breast cancer cohort (n=419) was used as validation where <i>Sulfidibacter<\/i> and <i>Priestia<\/i> were also significantly different in abundance for immune high vs low groups. Machine learning using Random Forest model predicted immune group with an AUC of 0.79 (CI = 0.74, 0.83; p-value &#60; 0.01). The top five most important features contributing to the random forest model were<i> Sulfidibacter, Prestia, Cutibacterium, Acinetobacter<\/i> and <i>Rhizobium<\/i>. This study is the largest to date that characterize the tumor microbiota of an Asian cohort of breast cancers, where <i>Sulfidibacter<\/i> and <i>Priestia<\/i>, both relatively new and uncharacterized bacteria, were differentially abundant among patients with high vs low immune scores.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Microbiome,Tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.-F.

The biology of MM is poorly understood. We sought to prospectively, uniformly, and comprehensively profile a cohort of MM patients to determine the interplay of molecular variation, germline predisposition, immunity, gut, mucosal and tumor microbiome and modifiable risk factors on ICI response and resistance in advanced MM.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Patients (pts) with MM treated with standard-of-care ICI as any treatment line presenting to MD Anderson are being prospectively enrolled for longitudinal collection for molecular, microbiome, and lifestyle factor profiling. Planned analyses include: whole genome sequencing of normal and tumor tissue, RNA sequencing, and T cell receptor sequencing from fresh tumor samples; germline sequencing and genotype analyses; NanoString Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens; whole genome shotgun, microbiome profiling and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S) of fecal specimens and affected mucosal and tumor sites (swabs); participant lifestyle and patient reported outcomes (PROs) assessments. Fresh tissue is collected and used to develop PDX models and cell lines.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> 98 pts have been enrolled to date; 83 (85%) Caucasians, 8 (8%) Hispanic, 4 (4%) Asians. 67 (68%) females. Median age at MM diagnosis is 64 years (range 32-91 years). MM primary sites include 24 (24%) naso-oral, 29 (30%) urogenital, 26 (27%) anorectal, 7 (7%) conjunctival and 12 (12%) other. Clinical somatic mutation testing was performed in 76 (76%) pts and common mutations were <i>KIT<\/i> (n = 12, 16%), <i>NRAS<\/i> (n = 8, 11%) and <i>BRAF<\/i> V600 or non-V600 (n = 9, 12%). At data cut-off (November 2023), 18 (18%) pts deceased. Median follow-up from first diagnosis to last visit\/death was 16 months (range 1-178 months). Sample collections at data cut-off include: blood samples (n = 95; 219 samples); fecal specimens (n = 50; 97 samples); mucosal swabs (tumor\/tumor adjacent\/oral cavity; n = 38; 101 samples); fresh frozen tumor\/normal (n = 38; 55 samples), fresh tumor\/normal (n = 28; 36 samples) and FFPE tumor (n = 21; 37 samples) tissue. PROs and dietary assessments have been collected from 47 pts. Fresh tissue for PDX model and cell line development has been collected from 11 pts.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> This is an ongoing prospective study that is expected to drive insights into the tumor\/microenvironment\/host interactions and factors regulating immunogenicity to predict response and resistance to ICIs in a rare and understudied melanoma subtype. Interrogation of the role of the gut microbiome and its modifiable determinants will lead to the investigation of new therapeutic strategies to modulate the microbiome to improve treatment outcomes in MM.
