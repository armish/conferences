[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> OKN-007 is a novel nitrone anti-cancer agent. OKN-007 plus Temozolomide (TMZ) increased survival in glioma-bearing mice compared to TMZ alone. Furthermore, OKN-007 increased TMZ sensitivity in both TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant cell lines. Following a phase I study in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM), we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04388475) of OKN-007 combined with TMZ to examine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of OKN-007 combined with TMZ. Here, we report the safety and efficacy findings of this ongoing trial.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a multi-center, open label phase 2 clinical trial in first or second rGBM WHO Grade (Gr) IV. Adult patients with rGBM previously treated with standard radiation and chemotherapy (Stupp regimen) were eligible. Any second-line therapy was acceptable, excluding bevacizumab. Patients were treated with OKN-007, administered intravenously, at 60 mg\/kg, three times weekly for 12 weeks, then twice weekly for 12 weeks, then once weekly until progression. TMZ was administered orally, at a dose of 150 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (Cycle 1) or 200 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (subsequent cycles). An initial 3-patient safety lead-In cohort established the safety of the OKN-007 and TMZ combination in this patient population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Additionally, a comparative analysis of PFS and OS for a matched external control rGBM population treated with lomustine in other formal randomized clinical trials was performed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 57 patients were enrolled at study completion. Of 57 patients enrolled, there were no adverse events (AEs) deemed as a dose-limiting toxicity in the safety Lead-In cohort with 3 patients. Median age was 56 years (range, 29-82), and 41 patients were treated with one line of prior anti-cancer therapy and 15 were treated with two prior lines. Eighteen patients experienced 46 SAEs and of these 9 (Gr3 nausea, Gr2 vomiting, Gr3 fatigue, Gr2 infusion related reaction, Gr3 acute liver injury, Gr3 generalized weakening upper and lower extremities, Gr3 bilirubin increase, Gr3 AST and ALT increase) were deemed to be possibly related to administration of OKN-007. For 56 patients receiving the combination of OKN-007 and TMZ, median PFS was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6-3.6) months vs. 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.9) months in control patients. Median OS was 9.7 (95% CI 7.6-12.5) months vs. 7.2 (95% CI, 6.8-7.8) months (Cox hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68, <i>p<\/i> = 0.034). 6-month PFS rate was 23.6% (95% CI, 13.5-35.4) vs. 13.0% (95% CI, 10.0-16.4) and 12-month OS rate was 38.1% (95% CI, 25.1-50.9) vs. 26.3% (95% CI, 22.0-30.8), respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data indicate that the combination therapy of OKN-007 and TMZ appears safe and, compared to standard lomustine therapy, may prolong OS in rGBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Recurrence,Temozolomide,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Brain biopsies are an invasive approach and liquid biopsies (LB) are therefore being investigated as a potential tool for detecting these molecular alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ctDNA.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The BrainStorm program (NCT04109131) is an international, prospective, interventional study aiming to build a large clinico-pathological database to investigate the development of CNS metastases: (A) before the diagnosis; (B) at diagnosis; and (C) after the diagnosis of CNS metastases. Molecular landscape of CSFctDNA was analyzed and explored as a surrogate for CNS tumor tissue DNA using large next-generation sequencing panels in tumor tissue and tumor-informed targeted gene panels in LB (<i>OncoDEEP<\/i>&#174; \/<i>OncoFOLLOW<\/i>&#174;) for patients (pts) included in Part (B).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: As of October 2023, CSF was available for 30 out of 67 pts included in Part (B) of the study and analyses were performed for 12 matched extra-CNS tumor, plasma and CSF samples. The 12 cases were derived from pts with breast cancer (BC) (luminal n=6; triple negative (TN) n=2; HER2-positive n=4) and among them 4 pts were diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastases (LM). CSFctDNA was detectable in 7 out of the 12 CSF samples (58%) and in 3 out of 4 pts with LM (75%). In pts with detectable CSFctDNA, detection rate for known pathogenic molecular alterations was 80% (Table 1). No safety concerns from lumbar puncture were identified.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The use of CSFctDNA as a surrogate for tumor tissue DNA in CNS metastases appears to be a feasible and safe approach. Clinically actionable alterations have been identified in CSFctDNA of pts with BC.

However, &#62; 40% PM patients (pts) are intolerant of OFS. For these pts, TAM is the only FDA approved option. In the neoadjuvant endocrine setting, pts with endocrine sensitive disease (ESD) (Ki-67 &#8804; 10% at 4 weeks) have 5yr dDFS &#62; 97%; however, only 45% of TAM pts vs &#62;75% with AI+OFS achieve 4 wk ESD (Nitz JCO 2022). (Z)-endoxifen (ENDX) is a potent anti-estrogen superior to TAM and AI in xenograft models and with antitumor activity in endocrine-resistant postmenopausal pts. ENDX additionally targets protein kinase C beta 1 (PKC&#946;1) at concentrations &#62;500 ng\/mL, resulting in AKT inhibition and apoptosis (Jayaraman npj Breast Cancer 2023). We hypothesize that ENDX dual targeting of ER&#945; and PKC&#946;1 will obviate the need for OFS and be non-inferior to AI plus OFS for PM pts with ER+\/HER2- BC.<br \/>Methods: EVANGELINE (NCT05607004) is an ongoing phase 2 multicenter neoadjuvant study with pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in assessing ENDX in PM women with ER+\/HER2- BC. The primary objective for the PK run-in is to identify a dose (40 or 80 mg\/day) resulting in ENDX steady state concentrations (Css) of 500-1000 ng\/mL (to target both ER&#945; and PKC&#946;1) without significant toxicity. Following PK run-in, the randomized phase II goal is to assess whether the ESD rate with ENDX is non-inferior to exemestane plus goserelin. Women with ESD at wk4 continue treatment for 24 weeks followed by surgery. Here we report the results from the 40 mg\/day PK run-in.<br \/>Results: Seven PM women (6 White, 1 Asian) aged 28-51 (median 46) received ENDX 40 mg\/day. Pt characteristics on study were: ER &#62; 90% (all pts), median Ki-67 = 13 (range 4-33%), cTstage (cT2: 6 pts, cT3: 1 pt), and tumor grade (G1: 1 pt, G2: 6 pts). The median ENDX 28 day Css (ng\/mL) was 263.6 (range 180.3-376.6). One pt discontinued due to wk4 Ki-67 remaining &#62; 10%. The remaining 6 had ESD, with either wk4 Ki-67 remaining &#8804; 10% (3 pts) or decreasing to &#8804; 10% (3 pts) and after 24 wks underwent surgery with surgical Ki-67 &#8804; 3% (range 0-3%). MRI central review (wk12 and wk24) demonstrated target lesion decreases in all pts with 1 CR, 1 PR and 4 SD (RECIST). Treatment related toxicities included grade 3 headache (n=1), grade 2 amenorrhea (n=1), and grade 2 hot flashes (n=1). The median (range) baseline estrone (n=5) was 54 pg\/mL (19&#8209;114) with median (range) fold increase from baseline of 9.0 (1.3-23.2) at wk4 and 4.7 (0.4 - 25.9) at wk24. The median baseline estradiol level (n=5) was 29 pg\/mL (19-209) with median fold increases from baseline of 17.9 (0.4-57.0) at wk4 and 8.1 (0.04 - 56.6) at wk24. Additional surgical and blood biomarker data will be presented at the meeting.<br \/>Conclusions: ENDX (40 mg\/day) exhibits promising antitumor activity for PM ER+\/HER2- BC but with ENDX Css below target.

Adverse events were classified according to their severity and relationship to treatment regimen.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> All pts were heavily pretreated (median 6 prior lines, range 3 - 13). Median age was 62 (41-83). 14 pts had HR+\/HER2-, 5 TNBC, and 2 HR+\/HER2+ MBC. The remaining pts were HR-\/HER2low or HR-\/HER2+. Prior ADCs included: 4 ado-trastuzumab emtansine, 14 trastuzumab deruxtecan, 13 sacituzumab govitecan; 8 pts received &#62; 1 ADC. 7 pts had also received &#8805; 1 prior CPI line. To date, pts received a median 3 cycles of Bria-IMT&#8482; + CPI (2-7). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a median OS of 42 weeks with survival of 69% at 6 months. The subset experienced a median PFS of 74 days with 40% of pts demonstrating a Bria-IMT PFS (PFS2) similar to or &#62; their prior line PFS (PFS1). 39% of pts experienced a PFS2 &#8805; their most recent line of ADC PFS. The disease control rate was 40% among evaluable pts. 43% of pts had a reduction in cancer-associated macrophage-like cell (CAML) levels; median reduction was 36% (22-98%) after 1 cycle. There were no toxicity-related treatment discontinuations. 43% (10\/23) reported grade 3 or 4 AEs, independent of study drug causality. No interstitial lung disease (ILD) reported. AEs included injection site reaction (39%), fatigue (26%), and nausea\/vomiting (43%), mostly mild to moderate. One case of elevated lipase was the most clinically significant grade 4 AE.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The retrospective analysis of the Bria-IMT&#8482; regimen in ADC refractory MBC patients suggests a potential treatment option for this patient population. The absence of serious AEs, notably ILD, and no toxicity-related treatment discontinuations, underscores the regimen's favorable safety profile. Future studies are warranted to confirm these results and explore the potential of Bria-IMT&#8482; in broader clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immuno-oncology,trastuzumab,sacituzumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Chaitali Nangia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carmen Calfa<sup>2<\/sup>, Blaise Bayer<sup>3<\/sup>, Mingjin Chang<sup>3<\/sup>, William Williams<sup>3<\/sup>, Giuseppe Del Priore<sup>3<\/sup>, Charles Wiseman<sup>3<\/sup>, Saranya Chumsri<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hoag Hospital, Newport Beach, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>BriaCell Therapeutics Corp., Philadelphia, PA,<sup>4<\/sup>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f81e7dda-7278-47ec-9ff9-53a3f955d9c3","ControlNumber":"10411","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate the association between GEP signatures and clinical outcomes in patients (pts) treated with pembro in KEYNOTE-629.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>Pts with histologically confirmed LA or R\/M cSCC, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, ECOG PS 0 or 1 received pembro 200 mg IV Q3W &#8804;35 cycles. Association between TcellinfGEP by RNAseq with clinical response (objective response rate [ORR], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]) to pembro, and association between a set of additional consensus signatures with clinical response to pembro adjusted for TcellinfGEP were evaluated. Significance of GEP signatures was prespecified at 0.05 for 1-sided <i>P<\/i> values from logistic (ORR) and Cox proportional hazard regression (PFS, OS) adjusted for ECOG PS.

The role of ICI in peri-operative OC is debated, and large clinical studies are ongoing. Patients&#8217; response to immunochemotherapy is highly variable and it is unclear what underlies this heterogeneity. To address this challenge, 38 advanced and 35 operable OC patients were enrolled to receive ICI in the LUD2015-005 trial (NCT02735239).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We investigated the clinical and biological effects of adding the anti-PD-L1 ICI durvalumab to peri-operative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in a phase II multicentre study (LUD2015-005 trial). Operable OC patients received ICI for four weeks, followed by combination treatment with ICI + chemotherapy (oxaliplatin and capecitabine or fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT)), or ICI + CRT (CROSS regimen). Patients could also receive ICI for up to 6 months after surgery. Tissue samples were collected at baseline, after four weeks ICI-only, and on the day of surgery. Further to assessing synergy of ICI with standard peri-operative treatment for OC, our trial design enables an in-depth analysis of molecular features of response, and to dissect the impact of ICI alone on the tumor microenvironment. Single cell and bulk transcriptomic data were generated and used to perform RNA deconvolution to estimate tumor cell composition.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The treatment was well-tolerated and two-year survival was 80% and 73.3% with ICI + chemotherapy and ICI + CRT, respectively. Survival was superior to that of propensity score matched patients receiving standard of care (p = 0.047). Tumor cell composition analysis revealed that neither total T-cell numbers nor a specific T-cell functional phenotype was associated with outcome, but high tumor monocyte content (TMC) at baseline was highly predictive of overall survival (p = 0.003). Moreover, a 13-gene core monocyte gene signature was sufficient to predict overall survival (p = 0.022) and major pathological response (mPR, Mandard 1-2, p = 0.009). Patients with mPR at resection showed enrichment of interferon and IL15 signalling at the four-week ICI-only timepoint (p &#60; 0.001). Single cell trajectory interference combined with immune response enrichment analysis also show that high interferon and IL15 signalling drive monocytes to differentiate into M1 macrophages and dendritic cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Similar to our previous finding in immunochemotherapy treated advanced OC patients (Carroll et al. Cancer Cell 2023), TMC is a highly predictive biomarker of long-term survival for operable OC patients treated with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, highlighting the importance of tumor monocytes and their differentiation potential in OC patients&#8217; response to ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Monocyte,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Hannah  S.

Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with SOR may enhance effector T-cell function and lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with HCC. We tested this hypothesis in an open-label, multicenter study of SOR and PEM in patients with advanced HCC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts with advanced or metastatic HCC, CP Class A, ECOG PS of 0\/1 were included. One prior therapy was allowed. Pts were treated with SOR alone for 4 weeks (lead-in) at a stable dose (minimum 200 BID), followed by SOR plus PEM 200mg IV q3 weeks. The phase Ib part included the first 6 pts who completed the SOR lead-in and began SOR+PEM. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Disease assessment was performed q6 weeks using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). The study used an exact one-stage design. With 27 evaluable pts, the study had 80% power to detect an ORR &#8805;20% with SOR\/PEM vs. 5% with SOR alone (a=0.05). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at baseline and on-treatment for correlative analyses (flow cytometry).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the 37 total pts enrolled, 27 were evaluable (9 female). Median age was 68 years. Forty-four percent of the pts had viral hepatitis. Four pts were pre-treated with atezolizumab\/bevacizumab (n=3) or tivozanib\/durvalumab (n=1). The ORR was 33% (95% CI: 18 - 52%) p= 0.08. Best response was PR in 9 patients (33%), 12 patients SD (44%), and 6 (22%) had PD. One patient had a near CR. Median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.8 (95% CI: 3.4 - 16.3) and 28.5 (95% CI: 15.2 - 57.7) months respectively. Fifty-two percent of patients had a decrease in AFP &#62;50%. One atezolizumab\/bevacizumab pretreated pt with progressive disease as best response had a near-complete response to SOR+PEM. The most common grade &#8805;3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in the safety population (n=37) were hypertension (16%), immune-related AEs (11%), fatigue (8%) and diarrhea (8%). CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells increased by 5.5% (-35.6 - 36.9%; p=0.035) and T<sub>regs<\/sub> decreased by 14.73% (-378.6 - 61%, p=0.049) from baseline to C1D1. The increase in activated T<sub>regs<\/sub> prior to PEM initiation was associated with worse OS (HR: 1.8, p=0.03) while a higher Teff\/Treg at C1D1 (prior to PEM initiation) was associated with improved PFS (HR: 0.4, p=0.036). An increase in the percentage of T<sub>regs<\/sub> between baseline and C4D1 was associated with worse PFS (HR: 2; p=0.03).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>SOR+PEM is a safe and active treatment for pts with advanced HCC. The results of our study confirm the favorable immunomodulatory effects of SOR and support further exploration of this regimen for patients with advanced HCC.

Clinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as HCC treatment typically exclude patients with chronic active hepatitis B (serum hepatitis B virus [HBV] viral load &#62; 2000 IU\/mL) or require the HBV viral load to be below a certain level using anti-HBV medications. In the phase 3 HIMALAYA study, the STRIDE regimen was superior to sorafenib and durvalumab was noninferior to sorafenib in overall survival benefits. This study explored the safety of concurrent administration of STRIDE or durvalumab with anti-HBV mediations for patients with chronic, active hepatitis B infection.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> We enrolled patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A liver function reserve, and chronic active hepatitis B not under anti-HBV treatment. Initially, only patients na&#239;ve to ICIs were eligible, and patients received durvalumab 1500mg iv every 4 weeks until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicities, or the maximum treatment duration of 2 years. After the positive results of the HIMALAYA study, we added tremelimumab 300mg iv on D1 following the STRIDE regimen and allowed enrollment of patients who had received prior programmed cell death-1 blockade therapy. Patients initiated entecavir as HBV treatment within 7 days of starting ICI therapy.

Patients without progressive disease (PD) and radical resection received anlotinib and metronomic capecitabine (500 mg, PO, BID, days 1-21, q3w) maintenance until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1.

HER-Vaxx is a B cell peptide-based anti-HER2 vaccine (IMU-131) comprising trastuzumab&#8217;s binding site. Here, we present the results of the randomized open-label, multicenter phase 2 HERIZON trial (NCT02795988), which compared HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone. The study aimed to evaluate clinical (primary endpoint) and antibody (secondary endpoint) responses in patients with HER2-overexpressing gastric\/gastro-esophageal junction (GC) cancer na&#239;ve to anti HER2 therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone (n=17) or HER-Vaxx (50&#181;g, recommended phase 2 dose) plus chemotherapy (n=19). In the HER-Vaxx group, patients received the vaccine at days 0, 14, 35, and 77, then every 63 days until disease progression. Chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin plus capecitabine and was started at day 0, repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. The clinical responses were assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria. FACS analysis of PBMCs for immunophenotyping was carried out, as well as in vitro phosphorylation inhibition assays of HER2 and the signaling pathway kinases Akt and MAPK, and mediation of ADCC to characterize the vaccine-induced IgG antibodies.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A 42% survival benefit for patients treated with HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy [median overall survival: 13.9 months (7.5, 14.3)] compared to chemotherapy alone [mOS: 8.3 months (6.0, 9.6)] was shown, which translated into an OS HR of 0.580 (80% 2-sided CI: 0.362, 0.927). A highly significant HER2-specific IgG and IgG1 antibody response at all time points, particularly after 3 or more doses of HER-Vaxx were induced (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). The HER-Vaxx antibody response correlated well with mediating ADCC (IgG, <i>P<\/i>=0.003; IgG1, <i>P<\/i>=0.05) and the anti-tumor effect (IgG, <i>P<\/i>=0.001; IgG1, <i>P<\/i>=0.016). Moreover, the HER-Vaxx-induced IgG antibodies exhibited binding to the gastric cancer cell line N87, with capacity to inhibit HER2 signaling pathway kinases Akt and MAPK phosphorylation. It also demonstrated decreased levels of Foxp3+ Tregs (<i>P<\/i>=0.0013).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The previously shown safety profile of HER-Vaxx, along with the improved clinical and antibody responses in HER2-overexpressing GC patients shown here, validate the proof of concept for a first-in-class B-cell immunotherapy based on HER2 B-cell peptides.

While patients with microsatellite instable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy with targeted therapies remains the only therapeutic option for microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. The single arm, phase IB\/II MEDITREME trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of durvalumab plus tremelimumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in first line, in 57 patients with RAS-mutant unresectable mCRC. Safety was the primary objective of phase IB; no safety issue was observed. The phase II primary objective of efficacy in terms of 3-month PFS in MSS patients was met, with 3-month PFS of 90.7% [95% CI: 79.2-96%]. For secondary objectives, response rate was 64.5%, median PFS was 8.2 months [95% CI: 5.9-8.6] and overall survival was not reached in MSS patients. We observed higher tumor mutational burden and lower genomic instability in responders. Integrated transcriptomic analysis underlined that high immune signature, and low epithelio-mesenchymal transition were associated with better outcome. Immunomonitoring showed induction of neoantigen and NY-ESO1 and TERT blood tumor specific T cell response, associated with better PFS.

Triptolide induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by different pathways, including caspase-dependent apoptotic death and caspase -independent autophagic death. It inhibits the activity of the TFIIH general transcription factor complex and modulates the transcriptional landscape of both the stroma and cancer cell compartments. In the epithelial tumour compartment, triptolide down-regulates key transcription factors such as c-MYC. Preclinical investigations indicate significant activity against super enhancer targets. In the phase I clinical trial of Minnelide&#8482; activity in highly refractory metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was observed. Hence, we undertook this study in patients with chemotherapy refractory metastatic PDAC. Our aims were to determine clinical anticancer effects, and to define effects of the drug on super enhancer expression and downstream effects.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Eligibility criteria included stage IV PDAC progressing on standard chemotherapy, Karnofsky performance status &#8805; 70%, and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. Planned sample size was up to 35 patients with interim analysis after the first 18 evaluable patients, aiming for at least a 20% difference in DCR (10% v 30%). Minnelide&#8482; 0.67 mg\/m2 was administered intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1-21, followed by a 7-day rest period in a 28-day cycle. Exploratory objectives included: analyses of paired tumour biopsies for changes in immune cell infiltration, stromal activation, chromatin accessibility, proteomics and metabolism.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>17 patients were treated. There were no RECIST responses or stable disease. However, evidence of activity was observed in 4 patients. This activity included progression after 117 days treatment in 1 patient and reductions in CT tumour size or FDG-PET uptake and\/or significant decreases in circulating CA19.9 levels in 3 others. Minnelide was generally well tolerated. Treatment related toxicities <u>&#62;<\/u> 3 were: neutropenia 4 patients and cerebellar ataxia 1 patient.Exploratory analyses included ATAC-Seq on paired biopsies where gene ontology analyses showed downregulation of genes negatively regulating cell cycle and upregulation of genes controlling cell cycle checkpoints.

FAK plays a key role in tumour growth, particularly in immunosuppression, cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and contributes to multiple mechanisms underlying fibrosis. In the Phase 1 study (healthy volunteers) narmafotinib was safe and well tolerated across single ascending dose (15 to 125 mg) and multiple ascending doses for 7 days (25 to 100 mg), with PK\/PD data demonstrating wide tissue distribution and target engagement.<br \/>Methods: ACCENT trial (NCT05355298) is a Phase 1b\/2a, open label study of the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of narmafotinib<b> <\/b>in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) standard of care as first-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The trial is a single-arm open label study conducted in two stages. In Part A, patients were enrolled in a 3+3 design to determine the narmafotinib recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), with narmafotinib<b> <\/b>dose-escalation (100, 200 and 400 mg). Part B is a Simon&#8217;s two stage design, with the primary objectives of assessing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination using RECIST v1.1 (centrally by independent reviewers). Narmafotinib<b> <\/b>plasma PK samples were collected on Days -8, -7, 1, 3, 8, and 10 of Run-In\/Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability were assessed according to incidence and severity of adverse events. Imaging was conducted every 2 months.<br \/>Results: Preliminary analysis across all doses (14 patients) showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated and showed promising signs of efficacy. At first on study imaging (Day 56), 86% of patients had stable disease and 12% had a partial response (PR). Subsequent RECIST assessments conducted locally at sites showed PR in 47% of patients. A single DLT was reported: uncontrolled grade 3 nausea (400 mg cohort). Fatigue, grade 3 or below was related to narmafotinib occurred in more than one participant. All patients who completed their first 28-day cycle of treatment elected to stay on narmafotinib, with 7 patients receiving narmafotinib in combination with chemotherapy for 5 months or more. The PK for narmafotinib is dose-proportional across the dose range tested, and the half-life supports once a day dosing. The chemotherapy regimen used in this study did not impact narmafotinib PK.<br \/>Conclusions: Based on this promising Phase 1b data, 400 mg of narmafotinib has been selected for RP2D and the trial will proceed through Simon&#8217;s Two Stage design and enrol up to 50 patients as part of the Phase 2 expansion cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Kinase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-A.

Secondary end points included ORR in CNS HB and pNET; duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to surgery (TTS) in RCC, CNS HB, and pNET; and safety.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of April 3, 2023, 36 of 61 pts (59%) were continuing treatment. Median follow-up was 49.9 mo (range, 48.2-58.1). Efficacy data are shown in the table. In the 4 years preceding belzutifan treatment, 46 pts (75%) underwent a total of 86 VHL-related tumor reduction procedures (surgery or radiation therapy). Since starting belzutifan, 16 pts (26%) underwent 18 tumor reduction procedures (RCC, n = 13; CNS HB, n = 3; retinal HB, n = 2). Safety profile remained unchanged with long-term follow-up.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>With a median follow-up of more than 4 years, belzutifan continues to demonstrate clinically meaningful ORR and durable responses in VHL-associated RCC, CNS HBs, and pNET. Fewer tumor reduction procedures were observed after pts started belzutifan treatment. These results support belzutifan as a standard of care for this pt population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,Renal cell carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

This Phase 2a study (NCT04564027) assessed ceralasertib monotherapy in previously treated pts with<i> <\/i>ATM-altered tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Adult pts had ASTs excluding NSCLC (Cohort [Co] A; data cutoff [DCO] Dec 21 2022) or mCRPC (Co B; DCO Apr 28 2023) and germline\/somatic ATM pathogenic\/likely pathogenic variants (PVs) by local assessment. ATM alterations were centrally confirmed by FMI F1CDx in tumor and\/or FMI F1 liquid CDx in circulating tumor DNA, and\/or by ATM protein deficiency by immunohistochemistry (cutoff &#8804;5%). Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) in Co A and composite response rate (CRR) in Co B. Safety was a secondary endpoint.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The initial starting dose of 240 mg BID PO ceralasertib on Days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle was reduced to 160 mg BID due to hematologic toxicity. Results are reported for 30 pts in Co A and 15 pts in Co B with a starting dose of 160 mg BID. In Co A, the 28 pts with centrally confirmed ATM alterations (93.3% [28\/30] with ATM PV and 36.7% [11\/30] ATM-deficient) had an ORR of 7.1% (80% CI: 1.9, 17.9): 1 complete response in breast cancer (ongoing at 12 mos) and 1 partial response in endometrial cancer (ongoing at 9 mos), both ATM-deficient. In Co B, the 13 pts with centrally confirmed ATM alterations (73.3% [11\/15] with ATM PV and 46.7% [7\/15] ATM-deficient) had a CRR of 7.7% (80% CI: 0.8, 26.8): 1 pt with conversion of circulating tumor cell count from unfavorable to favorable (ongoing at 3 mos) with unknown ATM expression. The safety profile was manageable (Table). Steady-state ceralasertib plasma concentrations exceeded the IC90 for ~23 hrs\/day.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Responses to ceralasertib monotherapy were limited in ATM-altered tumors, despite reaching target plasma levels.

Retrospective studies of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac PSMA-RLT (radioligand therapy), have shown promise in pts with mCRPC, where activity correlates with disease characteristics and prior therapies. FPI-2265 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-I&#38;T) consists of a small-molecule PSMA-targeting ligand coupled with a <sup>225<\/sup>Ac radionuclide. Here we present the initial results from TATCIST, an ongoing, open-label, single-arm study (NCT05219500<u>)<\/u> to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FPI-2265 in pts with mCRPC that was initiated as an investigator-sponsored study then converted into an industry-sponsored trial with more stringent eligibility criteria.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Eligible pts are required to have progressive mCRPC with PSMA-positive PET. Prior radioligand therapy is permitted. Pts with skeletal metastases presenting as a superscan were excluded upon protocol amendment and excluded from this analysis. Four doses of FPI-2265 at 100 kBq\/kg (&#177;10%) are administered at 8-week intervals; de-escalation in cycle 2 and beyond is allowed. Proportion of pts with PSA &#8804;50%, maximum %PSA decrease, and safety and tolerability of FPI-2265 were assessed.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>At the time of the data cut (30Jan2024) 30 pts have received &#8805;1 dose FPI-2265, with 25 pts having &#8805;12 weeks follow up. For this analysis, 21 pts were evaluable for safety and 20 pts were evaluable for PSA response: 4 pts with superscan were excluded and 1 pt was excluded due to uninterpretable PSA data. In general, pts were heavily pretreated in terms of prior lines of therapy. Most pts (17\/21 [81%]) had received a prior taxane, including 8 pts who received &#8805;2 lines of taxanes. Eight pts received prior <sup>177<\/sup>Lu PSMA-RLT (Lu). PSA50 was achieved in 10\/20 pts (50%); In a subset of pts with the baseline PSMA SUV<sub>mean<\/sub> &#62;6 (n=13 overall; post-Lu, n=6), PSA50 was achieved in 9 pts (69%). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included dry mouth (18\/21 [86%]), fatigue (10\/21 [48%]) dry eye (6\/21 [28%]), and anemia (6\/21 [28%]). All were Grade 1-2 in severity, expect anemia Grade 3 which was observed in (5\/21 [24%]). Other Grade 3 TRAEs included decreased platelet count (3\/21 [14%]). No Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported. Dry mouth was primarily Grade 1 (13\/21 [62%]) with only 5 patients (24%) experiencing Grade 2 dry mouth; there were no related discontinuations.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>Preliminary efficacy and safety data as of 30Jan24 suggest that FPI-2265 is active in heavily pretreated pts with progressive mCRPC, including pts who received prior Lu therapy. Higher PSMA SUV<sub>mean<\/sub> was associated with improved PSA responses, Safety and tolerability were consistent with other published studies of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-RLTs. These initial results support further investigation of FPI-2265 and a new phase 2\/3 trial will begin enrolling soon.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted alpha therapy,Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

Quantitative analyses of pre-treatment PSMA PET may allow for better patient selection and prediction of toxicities. Analyses of sequential PET images may also provide insights that may be associated with longer term outcomes. Our previous analysis of 13 patients demonstrated association of PSMA PET signal with overall survival (OS) and PSA responses, as well as trends with adverse events (Nauseef GU ASCO 2022). Here we present long-term follow up data and expanded imaging correlatives from our completed phase I\/II study.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>Entry criteria: progressive mCRPC after at least one prior potent AR pathway inhibitor and prior chemotherapy (excepting men ineligible for or refusing of chemotherapy) with allowance for prior radionuclides (incl. Ra223 and PSMA-TRTs). Treatment was fractionated-dose (D1 and D15) 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4-22.2 GBq). TRAQinform IQ (AIQ Solutions) was used to identify, track, and quantify regions of interest suspicious of cancer (lesion-ROI) on PSMA PET\/CT images and quantify uptake in normal organs outside of lesion-ROI. Measurements included SUVmean across all lesion-ROI, volume of lesion-ROI, and SUVtotal (sum of SUV in all lesion-ROI), as well as changes after treatment, including in PSMA-expressing healthy tissues. Associations with survival were tested via Cox proportional hazard models in univariate analyses and associations with adverse events (AEs) and PSA responses were via assessed via Wilcoxon rank sum tests.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>32 pts (of 50 total in the study between 1\/2017-2\/2021) had pre- and post-treatment imaging suitable TRAQinform IQ analysis and associated survival analyses. Baseline characteristics were similar to the entire study cohort. PSA response of 50% was observed in 21\/32 (66%) of which 16 were confirmed. No imaging variable predicted PSA30 or PSA50, although an association was observed in pretreatment SUVmean and lesion-ROI volume reduction. No imaging variable was significantly associated with OS (e.g., pretx SUVmean HR 0.9, p=0.10, pretx Volume HR 1.00, p=0.052). Pretx SUVmean was associated with mPFS (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74, 0.98, p=0.023). Among select AEs, anemia was associated with non-lesion-ROI skeleton SUVtotal in pre- (p=0.027) and post-tx (p=0.007). Higher pre-treatment salivary gland uptake (SUVmean) was associated with more xerostomia (p=0.11). Fatigue was associated with a variety of variables including salivary SUVs (mean, max, and total) and post-tx bowel SUVmax (p=0.030).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>Pre-treatment and pre- to post-treatment 68Ga-PSMA11-PET data analyzed may be associated with outcome. While a strength of this study is the prospective nature of patient enrollment and fixed imaging timepoints, our associations are limited by small sample size.

The FLX475-02 trial (NCT03674567) is a phase 1\/2 study of FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced cancer. Early encouraging data on the biologic effects, safety and antitumor activity of FLX475 have previously been presented. We now present the results from the Phase 2 cohort of combination therapy in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI-experienced).<br \/>METHODS: Subjects with CPI-experienced, recurrent or metastatic (R\/M) HNSCC received FLX475 100 mg orally once daily with pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q3 weeks). The primary study objectives were safety and tolerability, and antitumor activity. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Additional efficacy endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS). Safety was evaluated as per CTCAE v4.03. Data cutoff was 11DEC2023.<br \/>RESULTS: For the 32 subjects with HNSCC evaluable for response, median follow-up was 14.8 months (range 2.2-40.1) and median lines of prior therapy were 3 (1-6). Median age of subjects was 59 yrs; 94% were male and 75% were Caucasian. Primary tumor location was oropharynx in 56%. As previously reported, the only adverse event clearly determined to be treatment related to FLX475 to date has been asymptomatic and reversible QT prolongation (managed by dose reduction). Among the subjects evaluable for response regardless of HPV or PD-L1 status (n=32), confirmed partial response (cPR) was observed in 5 subjects (ORR: 15.6%, 95% CI 6-32%). Among the subgroup of subjects whose tumors were HPV positive (n=18), 8 (44%) experienced reduction from baseline in target lesion measurements and cPR was observed in 4 (ORR: 22.2%, 95% CI 9-46%). Among the subgroup of subjects whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (combined positive score [CPS] &#8805;1%) (n=22), cPR was observed in 4 (ORR: 18.2%, 95% CI 7-39%). At data cutoff, the HPV-positive subgroup median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI 2-10.3) and 3 subjects were still on treatment.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: FLX475, an oral CCR4 antagonist, has previously demonstrated clear monotherapy activity in EBV+ extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma and promising combination activity with pembrolizumab in EBV+ gastric cancer and CPI-na&#239;ve non-small cell lung cancer. In this completed Phase 2 cohort of subjects with CPI-experienced R\/M HNSCC, FLX475 in combination with pembrolizumab was shown to be well tolerated and has demonstrated encouraging clinical activity particularly in those with HPV-positive tumors, supporting the continued development of this combination therapy for CPI-experienced HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,CCR4,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

This trial was divided into two parts: phase Ib (dose escalation study), patients received LBL-007 at 200 mg or 400 mg plus toripalimab at 240 mg (both administered i.v. Q3W), and phase II (dose expansion), patients received LBL-007 at 400 mg and toripalimab at 240 mg (both administered i.v. Q3W). The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability; the secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy (per RECIST 1.1).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>By December 1, 2023, 80 patients were enrolled in phase Ib (10 patients) and phase II (70 patients). Of these, 30 (37.5%) were NPC patients, and 50 (62.5%) had other tumors. The median follow-up was 18.1 months (95% CI: 11.1, NE). No DLTs were observed in phase Ib. Seventy-three patients out of 80 (91.3%) experienced TEAEs of all grades, with 19 (23.8%) having grade &#8805;3 TEAEs. The most common any grade TEAEs (&#8805;15%) were anaemia (40.0%), hypoalbuminaemia (18.8%), weight decreased (18.8%), hyponatremia (17.5%), proteinuria (17.5%), asthenia (17.5%), lymphocyte count decreased (16.3%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (16.3%), hypertriglyceridaemia (15.0%), and rash (15.0%). Treatment interruption and permanent discontinuation due to TEAEs occurred in 6 (7.5%) patients each. Sixteen patients (20.0%) experienced SAEs. Four patients experienced TEAEs leading to death, all events are related to underlying disease or disease progression, none of which were related to LBL-007 or toripalimab. Out of 75 efficacy evaluable patients, ORR and DCR were 13.3% (10\/75) and 48.0% (36\/75), respectively. In 29 efficacy evaluable NPC patients, ORR and DCR were 20.7% (6\/29), and 62.1% (18\/29), respectively.
