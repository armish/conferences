[{"Abstract":"Aberrant DNA methylation changes are one of the earliest signatures of cancer development. Methylation profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma has emerged as a promising approach for early cancer detection (ECD). However, the set of methylation targets that can successfully distinguish cancer through liquid biopsy will vary depending on cancer type and subtype. Here, we explored a methylation target enrichment workflow and developed a methylation-based classification model to distinguish between patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and healthy individuals. First, CRC-specific CpG targets were identified by comparing the methylation landscape of CRC and normal samples (tissue and blood) available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. This analysis resulted in &#62;800 CRC-specific CpG targets for initial evaluation. To develop and test the classification model, CRC patients and healthy individuals with plasma samples were included. A machine learning model was used to evaluate the highest performing CpG targets that effectively discriminated between CRC patients with detected ctDNA (&#8220;CRC ctDNA-positive&#8221;) and healthy individuals. Correlation between methylation levels of the high performing CpG targets and the variant allele frequency (VAF) among CRC ctDNA-positive patients was calculated. In total, 86 patients were included in this proof of concept study (mean age, 62 &#177;12 years; male, 55%). 50 CRC ctDNA-positive patients (24% stage I, 40% stage II, 24% stage III, and 12% stage IV) and 36 healthy normals were included in the analysis. We investigated this cohort to identify the highest performing CpG targets among the &#62;800 potential CpG targets that provided effective discrimination between CRC patients and healthy individuals. Using the highest performing CpG targets, observed methylation level was correlated with VAF of single nucleotide variants detected by ctDNA testing (R<sup>2<\/sup>: 0.8). In summary, we developed a cost-effective methylation target enrichment workflow and utilized machine-learning algorithms to demonstrate the potential use of ctDNA methylation markers in early detection. Additional studies are needed to confirm that these and other markers can accurately distinguish between patients with CRC and healthy individuals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Colorectal cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-Y.

EWSR1-FLI1 fusions are found in Ewing sarcoma, while EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB are characteristic of clear cell sarcoma among others. Liquid biopsies involve obtaining tumor-derived materials through minimally invasive methods such as blood or other body fluid collection. Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an attractive method to identify gene fusions and monitor tumor recurrence and minimal residual disease (MRD). However, the structural complexity of oncogenic rearrangements poses challenges for the detection using plasma assays. We present a novel assay to monitor fusion positive tumor DNA in a busy oncology clinic.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>Methods and Patients: <\/b>Patients with EWSR1 fusion positive sarcomas are identified through clinical RNA-based sequencing. Tumor DNA isolated from biopsy or surgical samples is sequenced to map the intronic breakpoint and customized primers spanning the breakpoint are designed for each patient. The breakpoint is subsequently confirmed through PCR. The product length of ~100bp accounts for the small shedding size of tumor cfDNA. A quantitative TaqMan assay is designed to confirm EWSR1 fusions. The limit of detection is determined by a dilution series of tumor DNA. cfDNA is extracted from blood samples of the patients at multiple timepoints, the tumor burden is quantified by TaqMan Assay and subsequently correlated with clinical findings from imaging studies such as tumor progression or remission.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We consented 10 patients with EWSR1 fusion positive tumors to participate in this study. Plasma samples were collected for 8, resulting in 26 total timepoints. Breakpoints were identified in 9 patients and confirmed with PCR on original tumor DNA. TaqMan assays were designed for 5 patients and showed correlation between the tumor burden detected in EWSR1-ATF1 copies in cfDNA extracted from patient blood and the therapeutic response to treatment found through imaging studies. One patient was followed over the period of 9 months, and a total of 5 plasma timepoints were collected. The patient started with a low number of EWSR1-ATF1 copies of &#60;1ng\/ul, while on a Iurbinectedin\/irinotecan therapy and showed a mixed response in the CT scan. After withdrawing from that therapy and starting other therapy regimens, the EWSR1-ATF1 copies increase to 8ng\/ul, correlating with tumor progression observed in CT scans.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our results suggest that ESWR1 fusions in sarcomas can serve as biomarkers to measure tumor burden. Our approach using an individually tailored cfDNA TaqMan assay could provide a valuable monitoring tool to inform clinicians about tumor progression or MRD. With these proof-of-principle findings we can now determine clinical validity and utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Liquid biopsies,cfDNA,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, only a very small fraction of patients have the opportunity for genome-guided therapies. Somatic mutations from cancer specimens are unique to individual patients and hold utility as individual tumor markers in blood. We have developed an original circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring system, called OTS (Off-The-Shelf)-Assay, at Iwate Medical University Hospital, Yahaba, Japan.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Between April 2022 and October 2023, 79 patients who received the OTS-Assay were enrolled in the present analysis. The OTS-Assay includes three steps: (a) OTS-Scan (somatic mutation identification by either tissue or blood), (b) OTS-Select (somatic mutation selection), and (c) OTS-Monitor (periodical somatic mutation quantification as ctDNA). For the OTS-Select, we established an originally developed &#62;90 stepwise selection algorithm. One of the determinants is the availability of appropriate digital PCR (dPCR) probes for individual patients. Here, we search the probes for individual patients from the dPCR probe library, OTS-1000ex, which consists of &#62;1000 probes against frequently reported human somatic mutations (Quantdetect, Tokyo, Japan).<br \/>Results: All 79 patients were subject to the analysis. The cancer stage of all the patients was advanced. More than 10 tumor types were enrolled, including esophagus (n=42), colorectal (n=12), breast (n=7), lung (n=4), pancreas (n=3), hematological (n=3), and others (n=8). Fifty patients received OTS-Scan, and 29 patients had received a CGP test before the OTS-Assay (i.e., OTS-Scan was not needed). Seventy-five patients received OTS-Select, meaning that four patients had somatic mutations that were designated for ctDNA monitoring. All 79 patients received at least one OTS-monitor. The number of OTS-Monitors received ranged from 1 to 11 during the 19-month period, and the average interval was 3.0 months. The average pretreatment variant allele frequency (VAF) was 4.96% and the majority of the follow-up VAF was less than 1%. More than 90% of the patients had at least one clinical validity defined by: (a) early relapse prediction, (b) treatment efficacy evaluation, or (c) no relapse corroboration.<br \/>Conclusion: The OTS-Assay system provides stable longitudinal ctDNA monitoring at the range of less than 1% of VAF using the originally developed dPCR probe library. The sensitivity and affordability of the OTS-Assay system allows frequent monitoring, which leads to obtaining important clinical information in the context of advanced cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The 5-year survival rate for BTC is very low 7 to 20% and only 20% of BTC patients could undergo curative-intent surgery. BTC diagnosis based on biopsy and cytology are low in sensitivity that prompted the necessity to identify alternative biopsy. Liquid biopsy, specifically circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is known for the accessibility and low invasiveness received great interest for their potential uses in various clinical applications for patients with insufficient tumor tissue, including mutation profiling, treatment monitoring, and cancer detection. However, the panel available in the market up-to-date focused mainly targeted, actionable alterations and thus not suitable for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. In this study, we aimed to develop a customized ctDNA panel for MRD monitoring in BTC. In this study, 124 BTC patients undergone curative resections were enrolled at Hokkaido University and Sapporo Medical University from May 2019 to April 22. All enrolled patients have BTC diagnosis confirmed by pathological diagnosis after surgery, and without other malignant tumors. Genomic profiles of FFPE tissue were conducted using Ampliseq CCP. 13 patients were excluded for high fragmentation. Referring to the genomic profiles of 111 patients in our study and 1924 patients in TCGA established a customized panel using Ion Ampliseq HD technology. The Ampliseq HD panel claims to detect variants at 0.1% LOD for ctDNA detection. It also integrates molecular barcodes to reduce NGS-related errors. The designed panel was 258 Amplicons and 20 genes including eleven therapeutically targetable genes. Clinical characteristics of ctDNA detection were also assessed. Results:The panel validation: concordance of the mutation allele frequency (MAF) between the NGS standard control and Ampliseq HD panel showed a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96. Also, concordance of MAF Ampliseq CCP and Ampliseq HD panel on FFPE tumor profiling showed R2 of 0.78. When assessing 70% of BTC patients were covered to have at least one tumor-derived Ampliseq HD panel. When assessing using plasma cell-free DNA, 55% of BTC patients were detected to have at least one tumor-derived ctDNA. Distribution of detected altered top4 genes using Ampliseq HD panels shows TP53 35%, KRAS 10%, SMAD4 5%, ARID1A 2.5%. Clinical characteristics may affected the concordance of plasma and FFPE tumor tissue; stage (P=0.035), size of tumors (P=0.0088), subtype (P=0.013), LN metastasis (P=0.11). Conclusions: A highly sensitive ctDNA customized panel for BTC was established. We also found that clinical characteristics of the BTC affects the detection of ctDNA from blood liquid biopsy.

However, its utility may be limited in the early postoperative period by surgical trauma causing an increase in total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) due to tissue destruction, inflammation, and wound healing. No studies have identified the optimal timing of postoperative sample collection in pediatric patients undergoing resection of high-risk neuroblastoma. The purpose of this study is to assess the postoperative dynamics of cfDNA following neuroblastoma resection to determine optimal timing for ctDNA investigations.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>An institutional database of banked cell-free DNA samples was retrospectively queried for patients with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma who had blood samples collected prior to resection and postoperative samples collected within 2 months of the operation. Plasma was collected from whole blood samples. cfDNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAGEN QIAsymphony SP system, and samples were quantified using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer Automated CE System with the High Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Seventeen patients were identified undergoing 18 total operations and 37 total blood draws yielding cfDNA. There were 12 male and 5 female patients. Median age at operation was 5.5 years (range 1.4y to 20.5y). Two patients were INRG stage L2, and 15 patients were stage M. Operative indications were primary tumor resection in 10 patients and resection of recurrence\/progression in 8 patients. Three postoperative samples were drawn within 10 days of the operation, and 16 samples were collected between postoperative weeks 4 and 6. There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.029) in cfDNA yield between each timepoint sampled: preoperative (median 6ng\/mL, range 2-30ng\/mL), 0-10 days postop (median 34ng\/mL, range 15 - 85 ng\/mL), and 4-6 weeks postop (median 6ng\/mL, range 2 - 17ng\/mL). Pairing the pre- and post-operative samples for each patient, those drawn within 10 days had a median increased yield of 180% (range +67% to +652%) while the samples collected at 4-6 weeks had a median decreased yield of 23% (range -55% to +491%; p = 0.047). Of note, there were three outliers in the 4-6 week group who had increases in cfDNA yield of &#62;200%. On further review of these charts, each patient was being treated for obstructive uropathy at the time the postoperative sample was collected.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Plasma cfDNA yield increases in the early postoperative period before dropping by postoperative week 6. Tumor resection may be associated with an overall decrease in total cfDNA. Postoperative renal pathology may cause a persistent elevation in cfDNA. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of ctDNA in the management of patients with neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,cfDNA,Liquid biopsies,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Joshua  N.

For instance, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is more prevalent in children (less than 15 years), while Multiple Myeloma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma are commonly identified in older population (65 or older). Each hematological cancer subtype has distinct mutation and expression profiles, necessitating the coverage of various variant types, including point mutations, gene copy number variations (CNVs), and translocations. In this study, we extend the PredicineHEME panel to encompass long-range translocation and CNV detections.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>The extension of the original PredicineHEME panel involves three key modifications. First, a genome-wide SNP backbone was incorporated to enhance the sensitive detection of both gene and chromosomal-level CNVs and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). Second, additional coverage of translocation breakpoint regions was added, considering the panel's application in liquid biopsy samples. Coverage included the most frequently found translocations in major hematological cancers. Third, the driver gene list was supplemented to include genes and mutations treated as active therapeutic targets in clinical studies. Analytical validation was conducted using contrived reference materials, cell lines with known biomarker status, and healthy and clinical samples with known mutations or translocation status.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The expanded panel underwent balanced testing with healthy normal saliva gDNA samples to ensure even capture of targeted genomic regions. Assay testing followed CLIA\/CAP guidelines on analytical validation materials. The Limit of Detection for SNV\/INDEL and known translocation breakpoint reached as low as 0.3%. Our assay detected over 90% of covered and reported translocation breakpoints in the validation materials. Chromosome arm level CNVs reported in the validation materials were detected with 100% sensitivity and specificity.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>The expansion of the PredicineHEME panel underwent analytical validation, meeting design expectations. With this extension, the assay can effectively detect driver mutations (SNVs\/INDELs), CNVs at gene and chromosomal levels, and targeted large translocations in major hematological cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translocation,Copy number variation,Liquid biopsies,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Here, we evaluate on-treatment tumor molecular dynamics using ctDNA-based pWGS and pWES in pts with metastatic NSCLC that responded to pembrolizumab (pembro) monotherapy and later experienced PD in KEYNOTE-598 (NCT03302234).<br \/>Methods: In KEYNOTE-598, pts had metastatic NSCLC (PD-L1 tumor proportion score &#8805;50%) and received first-line pembro &#177; ipilimumab for &#8804;35 cycles. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated and sequenced from plasma samples at baseline (BL), during on-treatment response (cycle 5 [C5]), and at PD (discontinuation [D]) from pts with objective response to pembro monotherapy and subsequent PD. ctDNA burden (tumor fraction [TF]) was estimated using low-pass pWGS by quantifying tumor content in cfDNA as a function of aneuploidy. All samples with TF &#62;1.5% underwent high-depth pWES. ctDNA burden was estimated from pWES data using maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF). Correlation between TF and MSAF was evaluated using the Spearman coefficient (<i>r<\/i>). Variant allele frequency (VAF) and normalized VAF (nVAF) were used to determine variant clonality.<br \/>Results: In total, 23 pts with initial response to pembro and subsequent PD had plasma samples available from BL, C5, and D. Samples from 22 pts had TF &#62;1.5% by pWGS and underwent pWES. MSAF by pWES was correlated with TF by pWGS at BL (<i>r <\/i>= 0.68), C5 (0.80), and D (0.59). ctDNA TFs at BL and D (mean = 8.1% and 4.9%, respectively) were higher than C5 (2.0%). In a pooled variant-level analysis (nVAF &#62;0.25) of samples from pts with high TF (&#8805;2.5%) at both BL and D (n = 10), 786 (46%) of variants were present at BL and D, 391 (23%) were present at BL only, and 540 (32%) were present at D only. Variants shared between BL and D had higher clonality (mean nVAF = 0.46) than BL-only (0.38) or D-only variants (0.4). In general, shared variants had similar nVAFs at BL and D but in some pts nVAFs increased at D, suggesting evolution of tumor subclones during treatment. <i>TP53<\/i> was mutated in 9 of 10 pts with high TF and was shared at BL and D in 6 pts (mean nVAF = 0.49), present at BL only in 1 pt (0.11) and at D only in 2 pts (0.43). <i>KRAS G12V <\/i>and<i> Q61H<\/i> hotspot mutations were observed in 2 pts at D-only and may be related to immune editing.<br \/>Conclusions: Comprehensive pWES is feasible with sufficient ctDNA burden (TF &#8805;2.5%). ctDNA dynamics demonstrated molecular profiles characteristic of recurrence with high TF at BL and D and were consistent with radiographic determination of response\/progression. Tumor variants at BL and D generally had a common clonal trunk with clones disappearing or appearing de novo. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Liquid biopsies,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Minita Shah<\/b><sup><\/sup>, EJ Dettman<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Albright<sup><\/sup>, Cai Chen<sup><\/sup>, Julie Kobie<sup><\/sup>, Vinay Varadan<sup><\/sup>, Ayman Samkari<sup><\/sup>, Carol Peña<sup><\/sup>, Razvan Cristescu<sup><\/sup>, Z Alexander Cao<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9a0edd6c-1256-45cb-9b86-4878ea53a4bd","ControlNumber":"3701","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) kills the majority of luminal-like cells, which are AR-positive and express Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). However, a subset of surviving AR-positive cells develop resistance to treatments while AR-negative cells of the neuroendocrine (NE) or stem-like phenotypes emerge through selection. We reported on the clinical relevance of cell-subtype genes in whole blood RNA of advanced PCa patients. Here, we studied an expanded panel of genes to include drug targets and therapeutic resistance as predictive biomarkers to stratify patients at diagnosis and at the advanced stage of disease.Genes were chosen based on literature review, results of clinical trials in PCa, and PCa transcriptomic data. Technical validation of TaqMan RT-qPCR assays was carried out for each gene, including rigorous testing of reproducibility. Whole blood RNA was extracted from 26 healthy controls with no prostatic disease, 16 patients prior to prostatectomy, and 43 blood samples from 28 metastatic cases. Gene overexpression was defined as the 99.5% confidence interval of expression in controls. Clinical data were retrieved from patients&#8217; charts.A panel of 64 genes was built, showing overexpression in advanced PCa but low or no expression in normal blood (including whole blood, white and red blood cell populations and platelets). Testing in control blood showed no correlation with age. The proportions of patients&#8217; white blood cells did not correlate with gene expression in their blood. Overall, up to 44\/64 genes were overexpressed in at least one patient sample. Patients with prostatic intraductal carcinoma at prostatectomy showed more circulating genes, including more NE and stemness genes, and more PCa cell subtypes represented. Intermediate and high-risk patients showed more circulating NE genes. In metastatic patients, signatures of luminal, NE, stemness, and resistance to AR inhibitors or taxanes were associated with progression. PCa-specific luminal genes were associated with shorter overall survival. Treatment resistance genes correlated with lines of treatment and current taxanes. Two targetable NE genes were overexpressed in distinct categories of patients, suggesting that they may benefit from more specific treatments.In conclusion, phenotypic and functional differences in circulating gene patterns of PCa patients correlate with pathological features, treatments, progression. They may be clinically meaningful to stratify patients and predict therapeutic response. Circulating genes encoding drug targets may justify clinical trials to offer personalized treatments and impact on lethal PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Liquid biopsies,Resistance,Neuroendocrine differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Seta Derderian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Edouard Jarry<sup>2<\/sup>, Arynne Santos<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohanachary Amaravadi<sup>1<\/sup>, Quentin Vesval<sup>3<\/sup>, Lucie Hamel<sup>1<\/sup>, Raphael Sanchez-Salas<sup>4<\/sup>, Alexis Rompré-Brodeur<sup>4<\/sup>, Wassim Kassouf<sup>4<\/sup>, Raghu Rajan<sup>5<\/sup>, Marie Duclos<sup>6<\/sup>, Fadi Brimo<sup>7<\/sup>, Armen Aprikian<sup>4<\/sup>, Simone Chevalier<sup>8<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Uro-oncology Research Group, Cancer Research Program, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Urology, Centre Hospitalier Régional et Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Urology, Centre Hospitalier Régional et Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Deparments of Oncology and Surgery, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>5<\/sup>Deparment of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>6<\/sup>Deparment of Radiation Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>7<\/sup>Deparment of Pathology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>8<\/sup>Deparments of Oncology, Surgery, and Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c41ec3fe-0729-4e34-97df-4efe4e2e54b5","ControlNumber":"7760","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Cancer epigenomes are marked by a high degree of intra- and inter-tumor epigenetic variation, indicative of the high level of epigenetic instability. However, the nature of the regions with high epigenetic instability and its utility as biomarker has not been explored. Here we developed a novel methodology and metric to measure the degree of epigenetic perturbation, termed the Epigenetic Instability Index (EII), for multiple cancer screening through cfDNA. Our novel methodology provides a sample specific score of epigenetic perturbation in relation to the expected normal state as opposed to only looking at CpG sites that change between samples. Through machine learning, we have elucidated 269 CpG-island regions which sufficiently capture the epigenetic instability in cancers. We have built classifier models using the EII metrics of these 269 regions and demonstrate that they can efficiently identify breast and lung cancer cases from cfDNA methylation data. Particularly, the models can differentiate even Stage IA of NSCLC with ~75% sensitivity at 95% specificity and early-stage breast cancer at ~68% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The EII metrics perform significantly better than metrics that measure absolute DNA methylation levels. Our studies highlight the potential of measuring epigenetic instability from cfDNA in any given sample in addition to traditional methods of methylation measurement for non-invasive screenings via liquid biopsies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Cell-free DNA,Machine learning,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-J.

Though radiation brachytherapy is often employed for UM treatment, half of UM patients develop systemic metastases. In large tumors with macular involvement, the disease and its treatment can lead to blindness. Clinically, UM prognosis is estimated by tumor size, location, American Joint Cancer Commission (AJCC) staging, and histologic findings. Prognostic UM biomarkers have been established but lesions &#60;2 mm in height, particularly near the fovea, are difficult to biopsy, and thus physicians often do not perform biopsies on such tumors. Therefore, the use of aqueous humor (AH) as a liquid biopsy is a promising methodology. The purpose of the study was to quantify analytes in AH samples collected at diagnosis and post-brachytherapy from UM eyes with varying tumor sizes and AJCC Stages to analyze correlations between analyte (dsDNA, microDNA, and protein) concentrations and tumor features.<br \/>Methods: This case series study included 119 UM AH samples from 66 UM eyes and 16 control AH samples collected from age-matched non-UM glaucoma (GLC) eyes analyzed for unprocessed analytes using Qubit fluorescence assays.<br \/>Results: Most UM AH samples contained quantifiable analyte concentrations (dsDNA: 94.1%, miRNA: 88.0%, protein: 95.2%) and at higher concentrations than GLC controls (dsDNA, P=0.008; miRNA, P&#60;0.0001; protein, P=0.007). In samples taken at diagnosis, concentrations were higher at more advanced AJCC stages; comparing most advanced Stage III (n=8) to least advanced Stage I (n=24), median dsDNA was 4 times greater (P&#60;0.0001), protein was 3 times greater (P&#60;0.0001), and miRNA was 2 times greater (P=0.001). Analytes were quantifiable in &#62;70% of pre-brachytherapy samples from eyes with tumors &#60;2 mm tall (n=17). Height was positively associated with analyte concentrations at diagnosis (dsDNA: R=0.43, P=0.0007; miRNA: R=0.35, P=0.01; protein: R=0.39, P=0.005). In paired samples (n=53), all analyte concentrations were significantly higher post-therapy compared to diagnosis pre-therapy (Ps&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Although AH analytes were also quantifiable in smaller, less advanced tumors, AH samples from eyes with larger, more advanced tumors had higher analyte concentrations. The detection of prognostic biomarkers in AH may allow for early UM recognition and guide personalized treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Liquid biopsies,Molecular profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The fragment coverage pattern of cfDNA across the genome is known to reflect the distinct chromatin status of originating cells. While extensive research has focused on fragments derived from cancer, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), for inference about cancer biology, cfDNA fragments from healthy cells have received little attention. Our study explores the potential of cfDNA to decipher the relative abundance of distinct blood cell types, particularly immune system cell types.<br \/>We collected a cohort of 273 bladder (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 45 healthy controls for plasma whole genome sequencing and assessed the fragment coverage profile at transcription start sites (TSS) of protein coding genes. A significant negative correlation was observed between TSS coverage and whole blood gene expression (Spearman&#8217;s rho = -0.65). Furthermore, TSS coverage revealed a bimodal distribution, characterized by modes corresponding to high and low gene expression levels in blood cells. This may suggest the cfDNA coverage profile as a binary expression status classifier to distinguish between expressed and unexpressed genes in blood cells. We further evaluated TSS with differential coverage between age groups of healthy individuals and relapse status of cancer patients. Notably, out of the TSS that significantly differentiated middle-aged (aged 40-65) from older individuals (aged 65+), 31 were also able to distinguish relapse from non-relapse patients. Among these TSS were CD36, SLAMF7, TABBP and PDCD1, known to be involved in immune related pathways. Finally, we evaluated coverage at cell-type specific TSS and found dendritic cells (P-value: CRC = 8e-06, BC = 5.1e-3), monocytes (CRC = 1.6e-04, BC = 2.5e-3), and NK cells (CRC = 8.5e-04, BC = 0.026) to exhibit a significant increase in coverage in the cancer cohorts compared to healthy controls. Conversely, T-cells showed a decrease in coverage (CRC = 0.041, BC = 0.062).<br \/>In conclusion, cfDNA coverage profile may identify TSS with differential coverage between patient groups and characterize a shift in blood cell type composition as a response to cancer. Future work may show if fragment coverage quantifies the relative contribution of cfDNA from distinct immune cell types. We anticipate our analysis to illuminate the utility of plasma cfDNA as a biomarker for cancer patient&#8217;s immune competency, enabling improved patient stratification for treatment, leveraging their distinct immune capabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

This requires the development of new sample collection capabilities and workflows to ensure that the necessary biomarkers can be measured. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has become an increasingly important biomarker for cancer detection and genetics, and monitoring patients during treatment. Typical measurements of ctDNA involve venous draws of <u>&#62;<\/u>10mls of whole blood that require patients to be in clinic. Here, we test the feasibility of using a new collection device, Tasso+, to collect capillary blood for ctDNA analysis using the Guardant360 panel. A pilot of whole blood microsamples (&#60; 1 mL) with a cfDNA yield of 0.7-1.4 ng\/ml spiked to 0.5% MAF with Seraseq ctDNA reference material. This resulted in detection of ~20% of the total expected variants across variant classes showing the feasibility of using the G360 panel to detect low volume\/low MAF samples. Initial testing of Tasso+ collected samples revealed a 5-10x increase in high MW gDNA compared to traditional venipuncture. SPRI bead-based size selection was used in the extraction protocol to remove &#62;95% of the high MW DNA, resulting in a 35% loss of target cfDNA fraction. Traditional venipuncture samples and Tasso+ samples were collected from 5 cancer patients and run using the G360 platform. Microsamples detected 75% of the variants across all variant classes found in venipuncture samples. Tasso+ lost sensitivity of variants when the MAF was &#60;0.5%. To expand usage of Tasso+ to at-home collection of blood for ctDNA analysis, we sought to determine if lyophilization of the Streck DNA BCT RUO tube reagent could still provide stability to samples and a potential framework for at-home collections. Venipuncture and Tasso+ samples were collected from control patients, pooled and spiked with Seraseq cfDNA reference material. Samples were aliquoted into standard liquid Streck tubes or tubes with lyophilized reagent at the concentration per manufacturer&#8217;s directions and evaluated for stability over time. The Tasso+ samples with a target MAF between 0.5%-2.0% detected ~26% of all variants compared to the standard samples with a similar MAF. Lyophilization of the Streck reagent had minimal effect (&#60;20% reduction in variants detected) on the reagent&#8217;s performance as there were approximately an equal number of total variants detected when comparing liquid and lyophilized samples for both the standard tubes and Tasso+ samples. Overall, these results provide support and a framework for using a home-based patient-centric sampling approach for monitoring ctDNA from cancer patients in clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,patient-centric,microsample,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) circulating cell-free (ccf) DNA may act as a unique marker for the prognosis of high-risk HPV-related cancers. However, detection of circulating markers for cervical cancer (CC) requires extremely sensitive techniques that can measure circulating human papillomavirus DNA. Here, we used the sensitive droplet digital PCR (dd PCR) based approach for the detection and quantification of circulating human papillomavirus DNA in plasma from patients diagnosed with cervical cancer at baseline and subsequent follow up with intention of validating its utility as a prognostic marker in CC.<br \/>Method: Blood sera form 34 Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer (Stage 1-1V) at AIIMS Delhi was collected at baseline and after 3 months of the treatment. 10 healthy controls were also recruited in the study after due approval from AIIMS IEC. Plasma samples were stored at -80&#176;C. ccf DNA was isolated from 1 ml of plasma and further processed to detect the presence of circulating high risk Human papilloma virus (HPV) i.e., HPV-16 and HPV18 cf DNA using dd PCR.<br \/>Result: The median cf DNA concentration was 9.3 ng\/uL (range 3-26.6) for all patients while median cf DNA concentration was 7.2 ng\/uL (Range 3-57.3) for healthy controls (n=10). Furthermore, the levels of cfDNA decreases post 3 months of treatment with average concentration of 8.07 ng\/uL (Range 4.6-19.3). We further processed our samples for dd PCR based screening to detect low copy no HPV cf DNA and ddPCR detection yielded a positive rate of 51% (18\/35) for circulating HPV18 DNA while a positivity of 88.5% (31\/35) was seen for the circulating HPV16 DNA in the sera of CC patients. By comparing HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes, we observed detection of circulating HPV 16 DNA more frequently than circulating HPV18 DNA in CC patients coming at our center. Furthermore, we found that copies of circulating viral DNA (HPV18 and HPV16) decreased post induction therapy in CC patients indicating progression ability of thid marker.<br \/>Conclusion: In the current studies we provide evidence that cell free DNA concentration in CC patient can predict tumor burden and detection of low copy no of<br \/>circulating HPV DNA could be a promising indicator for prognosis in cervical cancer patients and can predict recurrence of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Liquid biopsies,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Cervical cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

At present, clinical response is determined by computed tomography (CT) imaging-based assessment of changes in tumor size. However, this monitoring approach is constrained by limited sensitivity in detecting lymph node and peritoneal metastases, as well as inter-reader variability. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is indicative of the amount of neoplastic cells and may have added clinical value to CT imaging for assessment of treatment response and guidance in treatment decision making in mCRC patients. We recently developed a tumor mutation-independent ctDNA test that utilizes low-coverage whole genome sequencing to analyze the plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentome to measure the ctDNA tumor fraction: the DELFI-tumor fraction (DELFI-TF) score.<br \/>Aim: The DOLPHIN study aims to investigate whether the DELFI-TF ctDNA assay can provide a sensitive, affordable and broadly applicable ctDNA test to monitor treatment response of mCRC patients.<br \/>Methods: The prospective, observational, multi-center DOLPHIN study is a substudy of the Prospective Dutch ColoRectal Cancer cohort (PLCRC). Clinical data, images and blood samples from 400 patients receiving systemic therapy in 8-10 Dutch hospitals will be collected. Blood samples will be drawn longitudinally in conjunction with regularly scheduled CT imaging. Plasma cfDNA will be analyzed for tumor-specific fragmentation patterns using the DELFI-TF score. Droplet digital PCR ctDNA-testing of RAS\/RAF hotspot mutations will be performed as reference, when feasible. Primary endpoint is the association between ctDNA changes and clinical response. Secondary endpoints are the association between ctDNA changes and radiological response according to RECIST and to serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at various time points during systemic treatment, lead time of ctDNA-testing compared to CT imaging to detect progressive disease, and the prognostic value of longitudinal ctDNA-testing.<br \/>Results: Since the inclusion of the first patient in March 2023, 117 patients have been included in the DOLPHIN study (November 2023). Seven hospitals throughout the Netherlands are currently open for patient inclusion and more sites have been approached to participate.<br \/>Discussion: The DOLPHIN study will assess the added clinical value of longitudinal ctDNA-testing in treatment response monitoring of mCRC patients and whether imaging can be complemented and\/or partly replaced by ctDNA-testing. The results of this study may lead to novel strategies for monitoring treatment response and to ctDNA-guided treatment decision making in mCRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,mCRC,Treatment response monitoring,Fragmentomics ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

For patients with pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL), analysis of DNA from cyst fluid has shown promise in determining the risk of malignant transformation. However, obtaining cyst fluid requires an invasive procedure. We recently developed an approach for blood-based cancer detection by analyzing fragmentation characteristics in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). In this study, we evaluate the performance of this method in differentiating between patients with malignant and benign pancreatic lesions. We collected plasma samples from 81 patients at the time of endoscopic evaluation or surgical resection of a PCL. We simultaneously obtained plasma samples from 209 PDAC patients and 56 healthy individuals. Using plasma cfDNA whole genome sequencing data from patients with PDAC and healthy individuals, we trained and cross-validated an ensemble machine learning model based on 10 genomic features capturing plasma cfDNA fragmentation patterns. This model was applied to sequencing data from patients with PCL for independent evaluation of diagnostic performance. In training and cross-validation, the model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.90 for differentiating PDAC samples from healthy individuals. Of the 81 PCL patients, ten patients (12.3%) were found to have a malignant PCL, with either high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma. The trained model showed an AUROC of 0.78 for differentiating malignant from benign lesions, achieving 50% sensitivity and 62.5% positive predictive value at 95% specificity. Our results are a novel demonstration that a peripheral blood test based on plasma cfDNA analysis can enable differentiation between malignant and benign pancreatic lesions. This approach may improve risk-stratification and clinical decision-making regarding the necessity for surgical resection. Larger studies and clinical trials to validate these results and evaluate their impact on outcomes are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer detection,Cell-free DNA,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Tumor-informed MRD assays typically utilize formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue, which is available in limited quantities for some patients, for example, following core needle biopsy (CNB), after neoadjuvant treatment or when patients need multiple tests from the same tumor sample. To determine the lower limit of tissue input, we evaluated our MRD assay performance across a range of extracted tumor volumes.<br \/>Methods: Resected tumors and CNBs were sectioned, H&#38;E stained, and macro-dissected. Tumor gDNA was extracted, quantified, prepared into libraries and sequenced. Sequenced libraries were aligned and evaluated for depth of coverage, variation of coverage, and duplication rate. Somatic calling was performed on matched tumor and normal samples. Up to 1000 target sites were selected for high-depth targeted sequencing of the tumor and normal gDNA for confirmation of somatic variant calls. The positive predictive value (PPV) was computed as the percent of putative somatic variant sites that were present in the tumor capture library and absent in the normal capture library.<br \/>Results: Extracted tumor volumes varied by almost two orders of magnitude, from 0.06mm<sup>3<\/sup> (equivalent to needle core or fine needle aspirate biopsies) to 5mm<sup>3<\/sup> (achievable with resected tumor). gDNA amount varied linearly (3.6ng to 1549ng) with tumor tissue input, indicating the low tissue to paraffin ratio did not have an adverse effect on yield. Tumor gDNA inputs into library prep ranged from 2.5ng to 100ng. DNA amounts above 100ng into library prep had no discernable benefit. Below 10 ng, depth of coverage and the coefficient of variation in coverage indicated poor-quality libraries. Samples with ~10 ng of gDNA input into library prep showed depth of coverage comparable to higher inputs and saturated the achievable library complexity. Additionally, PPV of somatic calling was consistent across the range of gDNA inputs from 10-100 ng, demonstrating equivalent assay performance.<br \/>Conclusion: Tumor-informed MRD assays have immense potential for increasingly sensitive treatment response and recurrence monitoring that can inform better treatment decisions. FFPE tumor tissue is a critical input into MRD assays but is a limited resource. This study supports a minimum DNA input of 10 nanograms for a single attempt at extraction, corresponding to a tissue volume of 0.2mm<sup>3<\/sup> or a single 10&#181;m slide with a 20mm<sup>2<\/sup> area, representing one of the lowest tissue input requirements for an MRD assay. Low FFPE tissue requirements expand the patient population that benefit from MRD testing by utilizing samples that have low tumor content, are post-neoadjuvant therapy or do not meet the tumor volume requirements of competing MRD offerings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Mutation detection,Somatic mutations,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Patients with <i>ESR1m<\/i> acquired on AI may retain treatment response if switched to selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) like fulvestrant. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis can detect the emergence of <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations and simultaneously determine molecular response to therapy through changes in quantitative ctDNA tumor fraction (ctDNA TF). We used real-world data (RWD) to study the combined effect of<i> <\/i>acquired <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation status and ctDNA TF dynamics on overall survival in ER+ HER2- mBC.<br \/>Methods: Tempus xF Monitor is a ctDNA assay that measures quantitative molecular changes in ctDNA TF by utilizing diverse genomic events, dynamically weighting somatic variant allele frequencies and copy number variants, while using germline information to inform these estimates and providing single nucleotide variant (SNV) results on 105 genes including <i>ESR1<\/i>. Non-responders (NR) were characterized as &#60; 50% reduction in ctDNA TF while responders (MR) experienced &#8805; 50% reduction in ctDNA TF. We selected a cohort from the deidentified Tempus multimodal database of 101 HR+ HER- mBC patients with a baseline xF test up to one year prior to or 3 months post AI therapy start. Real-world overall survival (rwOS) was defined as the interval from AI start to death, censored on the last known physician follow-up. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to evaluate the relationship between <i>ESR1m<\/i> and MR\/NR status with rwOS.<br \/>Results: In our evaluable cohort, (n=101), median age 59, <i>ESR1m<\/i> was detected in 29.7% (n=30) patients. <i>ESR1m <\/i>patients had shorter rwOS compared to <i>ESR1<\/i> WT patients (median <i>ESR1m<\/i> rwOS 63.8 months, median rwOS not reached for <i>ESR1<\/i> WT; p=0.013, HR=3.45 [1.9-9.2]). Across the cohort, regardless of <i>ESR1<\/i> status, 23.8% (24\/101) of patients were characterized as &#916;ctDNA TF MR, 60.4% (61\/101) as NR and 15.8% (16\/101) of patients with ctDNA TF values below the limit of blank (b-LOB). Within the NR group, 35.5% (22\/61) were also <i>ESR1m<\/i>, while only 20.8% (5\/24) and 18.8% (3\/16) <i>ESR1m<\/i> patients were in the MR and b-LOB group, respectively. Patients with combined <i>ESR1m<\/i> + NR &#916;ctDNA TF (n=22) experienced shorter rwOS (p=0.015) compared to MR &#916;ctDNA TF patients with WT <i>ESR1<\/i> (p=0.024, HR=6.61 [1.3-34.2])<i>.<\/i><br \/>Conclusions: xF Monitor is a ctDNA assay that tracks changes in quantitative ctDNA TF and simultaneously monitors for the emergence of <i>ESR1m<\/i>, providing a diagnostic that identifies resistance to AI therapy and enables early switch to therapies that could improve outcomes in a patient population with poor prognosis. A larger prospective clinical study is needed to validate these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating cell-free DNA,Estrogen receptor,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Since urine offers a truly non-invasive sampling method, it is a particularly interesting specimen. Evidence suggests that urine cell-free DNA (ucfDNA) harbors information about renal and bladder cancer. However, not much is known about ucfDNA in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Therefore, we aimed to test the feasibility of a hybrid capture based NGS approach with and without preanalytical stabilization of urine samples.<br \/>Methods: Urine samples were collected from 20 patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC), aliquoted and stored unstabilized or stabilized (urine collection\/stabilization solution under development at PreAnalytiX (QIAGEN\/BD company) and Streck urine Preserve) at room temperature. Urine cfDNA was isolated at the day of donation and after 3 days. Matched blood samples were additionally collected in PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX). cfDNA from blood and urine was isolated using the QIAsymphony platform (QIAGEN). cfDNA samples were analyzed using the AVENIO ctDNA Analysis Kit (Roche), a hybrid-capture based approach enriching for 17 clinically relevant genes.<br \/>Results: While all stabilized ucfDNA yielded high quality libraries, library preparation failed in 66.7% of unstabilized urine samples, demonstrating that without stabilization ucfDNA rapidly degrades after urine donation. In native samples, in which sequencing data could be obtained, sequencing depth was significantly decreased compared to stabilized samples. For stabilized samples, sequence analysis revealed full concordance between urine and plasma for putative germline variants. However, when using less than 50ng of input material of ucfDNA, a low signal-to-noise ratio with a high number of false positive low level variants was observed. We therefore adjusted the limit of detection for ucfDNA to 0.5%, at which CRC-related mutations were detected in ucfDNA in one patient. Although these variants, were not observed in plasma cfDNA, they could be detected in all stabilized urine samples, which hints to true variants.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that a hybrid-capture based analysis approach is feasible for ucfDNA form CRC patients and that urine may provide complementary information about a patient's tumor that may be missed in plasma. Yet, due to degradation and lower concentrations, immediate stabilization of urine after donation is required. Moreover, the limit of detection needs to be adjusted if low amounts of input DNA is available only.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Liquid biopsies,Molecular profiling,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Earlier detection of breast cancer through screening has improved survival. Liquid biopsies have the potential to complement existing screening methods by enabling earlier detection and differentiating invasive cancer (IBC) from ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). We previously demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for early detection of IBC by using a blood-based liquid biopsy platform to analyze a novel category of cancer-associated small RNAs, termed orphan RNAs (oncRNAs). Here, we developed a test that could not only detect the presence of cancer, but also classify the invasiveness of breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) small RNA profiles to discover a library of 20,538 oncRNAs that were significantly enriched among 1,103 breast tumors compared to 349 controls from normal tissues spanning multiple tissue sites, limited to female samples. The diagnostic performance of these oncRNAs was assessed in an independent cohort of serum samples from 708 women, including 380 breast cancer patients (221 IBC and 159 DCIS; mean age: 58.0 &#177; 13.4 years) and 328 age-matched controls (mean age: 58.4 &#177; 13.7 years). We sequenced the small RNA content from 1 ml of serum from these patients at an average depth of 21.6 million 50-bp single-end reads. We detected 19,736 (96%) of the breast cancer-specific oncRNA library within at least one sample in this cohort. We then trained a multi-class generative AI model using 5-fold cross-validation to predict IBC, DCIS, and absence of breast cancer (IBC or DCIS).<br \/>Results: Our oncRNA-based generative AI model achieved an overall AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97) for prediction of breast cancer versus cancer-free controls. At 90% specificity, overall model sensitivity is 90.0% (86.5%-92.8%). For DCIS and stage I IBC, the model has a sensitivity of 88.1% (82.0%-92.7%) and 90.4% (81.9%-95.8%) respectively, both at 90% specificity. In the second step, restricting to samples flagged as cancer, we observed an overall AUC of 0.9 (0.87-0.93) and sensitivity of 62.4% (55.3%-69.1%) at 90% specificity for discriminating against invasive breast cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: We have demonstrated the potential utility of oncRNAs as the foundation for a liquid biopsy platform for sensitive and accurate early detection of breast cancer. Our liquid biopsy assay has the potential to complement standard of care by not only detecting breast cancer but also differentiating IBC from DCIS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,RNA,DCIS,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Mehran Karimzadeh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Taylor  B.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical players in cancer biology. Recognizing neutrophils as influential contributors to tumor biology, our study aimed to explore neutrophil-specific lncRNAs and evaluate their prognostic significance in UC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In the GSE24890 dataset, 46 lncRNAs were identified with elevated expression in neutrophils compared to other immune cells, thus designating them as neutrophil-specific lncRNAs. To establish a tailored prognostic model, the TCGA BLCA dataset served as the internal training set. Candidate lncRNAs underwent filtration and selection through univariate Cox regression analysis, followed by the construction of a risk score employing LASSO and multivariate Cox regression algorithms. We used IMVigor210 dataset as external validation for this lncRNA model.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Ten lncRNAs exhibiting correlation with overall survival (OS) were initially identified through univariate Cox regression. Following LASSO regression and subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis, a refined set of 9 lncRNAs was selected to construct the risk model, represented by the formula: Risk score = (-0.096 &#215; FAM13A-AS1 expression level) + (0.157 &#215; FAM27C expression level) + (-0.294 &#215; HCG27 expression level) + (-0.037 &#215; HOTAIRM1 expression level) + (-0.137 &#215; LINC-PINT expression level) + (-0.279 &#215; LINC00612 expression level) + (-0.058 &#215; LINC00967 expression level) + (0.187 &#215; LINC01018 expression level) + (-0.288 &#215; LINC01138 expression level). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the BLCA cohort revealed that patients in the high-risk group experienced significantly worse OS compared to those in the low-risk group (p &#60; 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.66, 0.67, and 0.66, respectively. In the multivariate Cox regression model, the risk score remained an independent prognostic factor (p &#60; 0.001; HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.91-3.30). The validity of the risk score was further confirmed in the IMVigor210 dataset, demonstrating discriminative predictive ability for OS between high- and low-risk groups (p = 0.027).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This study underscores the interplay between neutrophils and lncRNAs in UC.

This study aims to delineate the impact of these markers on overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in order to aid in clinical risk stratification.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis on patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, treated at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland (January 2018 - February 2022). Clinical data, including diagnosis, treatment, and blood markers, were extracted from electronic records. The analysis incorporated the computation of median values for each blood marker, followed by survival analysis and determination of Cox proportional hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval.<br \/>Results: Our cohort included 43 patients, 53% women, 44% men, median age 73 years (IQR 14.75) with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Most patients (56%) had advanced distant disease and 25% of these did not receive any oncological therapy. At least one cycle of chemotherapy was administered in 85% of patients. NLR&#60;4 was reported in 63% of cases, normal albumin levels in 72%, normal LDH levels in 79%, and normal CRP levels in 47%. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, there was a significant higher risk for death with metastatic disease (HR 6.216 CI 2.00-19.28, p=0.002), age &#8805;75 (HR 4.88, CI 1.65-14.39, p=0.004) and CRP&#62;10 (HR 3.38, CI 1.18-9.66, p=0.023) and lower risk with addition of chemotherapy (HR 0.076, CI 0.02-0.29, p&#60;0.001). NLR, LDH and albumin levels did not significantly correlate with higher HR for death. At a median follow-up period of 8.5 months (IQR 14), the median overall survival was 9 months (IQR 14.5) with a worsening prognostic for increased CRP (p=0.00027), NLR&#62;4 (p=0.051), albumin &#60;35g\/l (p=0.0024), LDH &#62;250 U\/l (p=0.037). Better survival rates were seen in patients receiving chemotherapy 75% vs 20 for those without chemotherapy (p&#60;0.0001) and in those with local disease 80% vs 60% for metastatic disease p=0.034). Age &#8805;75 years carried a significant poorer prognostic (p=0.0017), while gender was not relevant. However, due to small sample size, age adjusted survival was not carried out and age was considered not relevant for the survival analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: Beyond the expected factors like stage of disease and therapy, an increased CRP appears to carry significant correlation with hazard ratio for death among patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In our cohort, abnormal CRP, NLR, albumin and LDH levels demonstrated significant association with shorter survival period, underscoring the potential utility of these biomarkers in prognostic stratification and their incorporation into routine oncological assessments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biomarkers,Inflammation,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Over 90% of these regions, termed transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are expressed in at least one human tissue. Although extensively studied in the context of cancer since their discovery, the prognostic significance of T-UCRs in a pan-cancer context has not been explored. For this, TCGA data extracted from the TANRIC platform was utilized, differential expression and survival analysis was performed on different tumor types. Our analysis revealed that approximately 300 UCRs were expressed in the majority of the 20 tumor tissues. Additionally, it was noted that all examined tumor tissues expressed a higher number of UCRs compared to their non-tumor counterparts. Through t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis, UCR expression patterns could distinguish primary tumor origins and types. Regarding the prognostic value, we identified 100 (20,8%) T-UCRs associated with disease-specific survival (DSS) and 102 (21.2%) T-UCRs associated with progression-free interval (PFI). Those T-UCRs are particularly important in the survival outcomes of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and low-grade gliomas (LGC). In addition, we verified that uc.44, uc.48, uc.135, uc.144, uc.153, uc.217, uc.255, uc.256, uc.344, uc.357, uc.390, uc.427 and uc.436 were associated with survival of more than one tumor. Particularly, uc.135 high expression was associated with poor prognosis in Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma (KIRP) and LGC, and good prognosis in KIRC. Uc.135 are mapped on MECOM gene, coding an oncoprotein acting as transcriptional regulator and involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that analysis of T-UCRs expression have the potential to be used as predictive biomarkers and can help in studying the mechanisms and specific roles of the highlighted T-UCRs in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Survival,Long noncoding RNA,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Ana Carolina Rodrigues<sup>1<\/sup>, Douglas Adamoski<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniela  F.

HPV-positive patients with LINE-1 methylation &#60;55% showed an almost 5-fold higher risk of death than hypermethylated once, with an overall survival as poor as HPV-negative patients. Somatic <i>TP53<\/i> mutations are a common feature in HPV-negative OPSCC, whereas their presence has been reported in only a small subset of HPV-related OPSCC. At present, little is known about the correlation between LINE-1 methylation and p53 expression status and\/or <i>TP53<\/i> mutation in OPSCC. <b>Methods<\/b>. Since 2019, an ongoing prospective study has been enrolling patients with OPSCC in nine cancer centers in Northern Italy. HPV16 E6 DNA was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). LINE-1 methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific qPCR. p53 expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining. <i>TP53<\/i> exon mutations were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing. <b>Results<\/b>. Up to date, 134 OPSCC patients have been enrolled, including cancer of the tonsil (n=74; 55.2%), base of tongue (n=47; 35.1%), and other subsites (n=13; 9.7%). HPV16 DNA was found in 54.3% of cases: 65.7% in base of tongue, 57.1% in tonsil, and 16.7% in other subsites (p&#60;0.001). LINE-1 methylation was higher in HPV16-positive patients (median: 55.8%, interquartile rage [IQR]: 42.5-68.5) than HPV16-negative ones (median: 40.7; IQR: 23.9-59.1; p=0.003). Nevertheless, the median LINE-1 methylation was lower (50.7%) among HPV-16 OPSCC patients who relapsed than those who did not (56.0%), thus confirming the findings previously reported. However, data from the present investigation are presently not mature to purse the study aims (median follow-up: 12.3 months). The correlation between LINE-1 hypomethylation and p53 expression has also been evaluated in OPSCC patients. p53 expression was categorized into three groups (0%, 1-49%, and &#8805;50%) based on the overall intensity of nuclear staining of the tumor cells. p53 was considered null, overexpressed, or wild type when its nuclear staining was 0 %, &#8805;50%, or ranged between 1% and 49%, respectively. Of note, the highest level of LINE-1 methylation was observed in OPSCC tissues with nuclear p53 staining between 1% and 49% (57.8%), whereas OPSCC patients with p53 expression &#8805;50% showed a decline of LINE-1 methylation levels (40.6; p=0.026). Interestingly, LINE-1 methylation was lower in OPSCC patients harboring <i>TP53<\/i> mutations in both HPV16-negative (24.8%) and HPV16-positive (24.0%) OPSCC patients, even if statistical significance was reached only in the HPV-negative group (p=0.015). <b>Conclusion<\/b>. Preliminary results confirm the potential of LINE-1 methylation to identify HPV16-positive patients with poor prognosis.

However, current fixed panel methods suffer from low sensitivity, whereas personalized panels face challenges as long yield time and require patient tissue samples. Our objective was to develop an accurate and efficient method for detecting circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) in post-surgery lung cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 39 lung cancer patients (14 relapse, 25 non-relapse) with 63 post-surgical plasma samples. The mutational profiles of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were obtained using SHIELDINGTM ULTRA Panel by Geneseeq, covering hotspots in 2365 cancer-associated genes. A comprehensive error suppressing algorithm, which combines intra-run sampling adaptive noise control, cfDNA fragment profiling, normal pool, and white blood cell background, was utilized to eliminate the background artifacts. The plasma ctDNA status were identified under both tumor-informed and tumor-na&#239;ve scenarios.<br \/>Results: Our method yielded results on par with personalized panels, achieving a sensitivity of 85.7% at the specificity of 92.0%, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.0% in longitudinal analysis. The ctDNA positive patients had a 21-fold increased risk (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 20.7, p = 9.2 &#215;10^(-5)) compared to the ctDNA negative patients. Remarkably, the landmark analysis using 39 samples (&#60;= 7 days post-surgical) showed a 57.1% sensitivity at 100.0% specificity. Patients with a landmark (&#60;= 7 days post-surgical) ctDNA positive status showed an increased risk of 16.2 times (HR = 16.2, p = 3.5 &#215;10^(-6)). Furthermore, we found that our approach could maintain its level of performance under tumor-na&#239;ve scenario, showing HRs of 12.7 (p = 1.3 &#215;10^(-4)) for longitudinal ctDNA positive patients and 12.3 (p = 3.7 &#215;10^(-5)) for landmark ctDNA positive patients. The ctDNA status determined by the tumor-informed and tumor-na&#239;ve approaches showed a substantial agreement, yielding a concordance of 90.5% (Cohen&#8217;s Kappa = 0.738).<br \/>Conclusion: Herein, we report a comprehensive error suppressing approach for removing background artifacts by fixed MRD panel, allowing an enhanced MRD detection in post-surgical lung cancer patients. Our approach, which accurately identified ctDNA status at a cost-effective rate, outperformed other fixed panels while showing comparable performance with personalized panels. Furthermore, our method can be utilized under tumor na&#239;ve scenarios when personalized panels are unfeasible in the absence of tumor information. Finally, the faster turnout time of fixed panel makes our approach more suitable for clinical landmark MRD detection than a personalized panel.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Liquid biopsies,Minimal Residual Disease,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Here, we aimed to introduce an adaptive noise cancellation approach for efficient Minimal Residuals Disease (MRD) detection in colorectal cancer patients employing a fixed panel under both tumor-informed and tumor-na&#239;ve situations.<br \/>Methods: 108 plasma samples were collected from 52 colorectal cancer patients (11 relapse, 41 non-relapse) at various post-surgical timepoints. Comprehensive mutational profiling of plasma samples was conducted using a fixed MRD panel (SHIELDINGTM ULTRA) that encompasses hotspots in 2365 cancer-related genes. Background errors were removed by an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm relying on DNA fragment profiling, normal pool, and white blood cell background and intra-run plasma sampling. Variants were called both with (tumor-informed) and without (tumor-na&#239;ve) the present of tumor tissue.<br \/>Results: Our longitudinal analysis of 108 plasma samples yielded 90.9% sensitivity, 97.6% specificity and 97.6% negative predictive value in the tumor-informed scenario. The ctDNA positive patients exhibited significantly higher risk than those with negative ctDNA status (Hazard Ratio = 87.2, p = 3.5&#215;10^(-5)). For landmark analysis, 33 plasma samples (&#8804;7 days post-operation) were assessed, yielding a remarkable performance of 66.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Our approach showed robustness under tumor-na&#239;ve scenario, illustrating 90.9% sensitivity, 92.7% specificity and 97.4% NPV for the longitudinal analysis. This corresponded to an increased risk of 49 times in the ctDNA positive patients (HR = 49.0, p = 2.2&#215;10^(-4)). Notably, the results of tumor-na&#239;ve samples closely aligned with those of tumor-informed samples, showing a concordance of 92.6% and substantial agreement (Cohen&#8217;s Kappa = 0.691).<br \/>Conclusion: Our method stands as an ultra-sensitive tool for identifying colorectal patients at high risk of recurrence. By employing an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm, our fixed panel approach demonstrates superiority over existing fixed panels in accuracy and proves to be a cost-effective alternative to personalized panels. Significantly, it extends potential clinical utilization towards tumor-na&#239;ve patients, which is not feasible for personalized panels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Liquid biopsies,Minimal residual disease,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.
