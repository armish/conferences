[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests are being established as a novel approach to screen for multiple cancer types with one test. A blood-based MCED test using cell-free DNA targeted methylation patterns to detect a shared cancer signal and predict a cancer signal origin (CSO) has demonstrated feasibility. An initial return of results study (PATHFINDER; NCT04241796) reported performance of a refined version of the MCED test, including a 43.1% positive predictive value (PPV), 98.5% negative predictive value (NPV), 99.5% specificity, and 88.0% CSO accuracy. To build on this work, the PATHFINDER 2 study (NCT05155605) will evaluate safety and performance of the MCED test in larger, more diverse populations.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>PATHFINDER 2 is a prospective, multicenter, interventional study. Participants &#8805;50 years of age will be enrolled, with specific targets to improve diversity (age, sex, race\/ethnicity) and few exclusions due to comorbid conditions. Exclusion criteria include current clinical suspicion of cancer or recent cancer\/treatment (within 3 years). Participants will undergo blood draw for MCED testing, followed by return of results (cancer signal detection and CSO) to the investigator and diagnostic evaluations if a cancer signal is detected. A confirmatory PET-CT scan will be performed when CSO-directed workups do not result in a cancer diagnosis. Participants will be followed for approximately 3 years. Primary endpoints include 1) MCED test safety in terms of diagnostic testing triggered by a positive result (number\/type of procedures and adverse events) and 2) test performance (PPV, NPV, specificity, sensitivity, CSO accuracy, cancer detection rate and number needed to screen). Secondary endpoints include participant reported outcomes (eg, anxiety), utilization of guideline-recommended cancer screening, and cancer detection rate of confirmatory PET-CT, amongst others.<br \/>The study plans to enroll approximately 35,000 participants across North America. Sites were selected based on geographic location, catchment area demographics, and practice setting (academic vs non-academic). Enrollment targets for age, sex and race\/ethnicity (White [non-Hispanic] 72%; Hispanic or Latino 11%; African American or Black 11%; Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 6%; American Indian\/Alaska Native 1%) were derived from US Census data. Strategies to promote diverse recruitment include translation of participant-facing documents across multiple languages, participant and healthcare provider educational material, and site-led community outreach campaigns.<br \/>MCED testing is an emerging, potentially paradigm-changing strategy in cancer screening, and PATHFINDER 2 is designed to characterize the safety, performance, and clinical implementation of the MCED test as a screening tool in a broad and representative population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-13 Recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved populations in clinical prevention trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

For this study, we explored colorectal cancer screening rates among DDBHH survey respondents in comparison to rates found in the hearing population.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Using the National Cancer Institute Health Information National Trends Survey in ASL (Kushalnagar et al., 2015), we surveyed participants 18+ years old using the Center for Deaf Health Equity at Gallaudet University&#8217;s database of over 2,500 DDBHH participants from all over the USA, including Hawaii and Puerto Rico. We used the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines&#8217; age cutoffs to assess adherence to colorectal cancer screenings.<br \/>Results: Survey response rate within three weeks of mail out in July 2023 was 12%. A total of 405 DDBHH adult participants answered screening questions for colorectal cancer in ASL and English. Overall, 43.7% self-reported screening adherence for age-eligible (45-75 years) colorectal cancer screening; 54.7% reported never having a colorectal cancer screening. Similarly-aged hearing adults reported 58.7% adherence in the English version of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).<br \/>Discussion: With the 43.7% adherence rate, the DDBHH community is lagging behind colorectal cancer screenings compared to the general population of hearing adults. Estimating the colorectal cancer screening rates among the DBHH community and understanding the reasons for these existing disparities is important to achieve screening adherence of 68.3%, the target set by the Healthy People 2030. Such research will aid the Center for Deaf Health Equity to actively work with the community to improve strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Early detection,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

Most remote Alaska Native communities are not connected to the road system, which severely limits access to screening colonoscopy. As part of a clinical trial, Alaska Native patients were offered either colonoscopy or the at-home multi-target stool DNA test (mt-sDNA; Cologuard&#174;). Patients had never been offered mt-sDNA before and it was unknown what they would think about the new test option. Both tests were provided at no cost to patients.<br \/>Methods: From April 2022 to July 2023, 194 patients who chose mt-sDNA for screening received a follow-up phone survey asking whether they were aware that they could have had colonoscopy instead, their reasons for choosing mt-sDNA, and the factors influencing their choice of mt-sDNA over colonoscopy. Patients answered the survey before receiving results of their mt-sDNA test in order to capture initial screening test preferences.<br \/>Results: A total of 115 (59%) Alaska Native patients participated in the survey; 56% men and 44% women. About 70% were ages 45 to 60 years while the remaining 30% were 61 to 75 years old. The majority (80%) were aware that they had the option to undergo colonoscopy for CRC screening instead of mt-sDNA. Key themes for mt-sDNA preference included not having to travel, less time commitment, and greater convenience. Many patients expressed financial concerns arising from the costs of air travel and accommodation required to access screening colonoscopy even though the procedure itself was covered. Additionally, patients highlighted existing obligations such as childcare and work responsibilities which made the use of mt-sDNA at home more appealing. Many respondents also shared negative perceptions of colonoscopy procedure including fear, embarrassment, and discomfort as reasons why they preferred mt-sDNA instead.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the multifaceted factors influencing the preference for at-home mt-sDNA CRC screening among Alaska Native individuals. Challenges such as limited access to medical facilities, financial burdens, and personal commitments have significant bearing on the screening decision-making process. Moreover, the emotional aspect of fear and discomfort associated with colonoscopy plays a role in shaping these preferences. CRC screening programs need to be aware of patient needs and preferences when deciding which screening methods to offer to increase screening rates and result in improved colorectal health outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Screening,Cancer detection,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Recently, various groups have developed methods that detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the plasma to measure minimal or molecular residual disease (MRD). Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are a hallmark of cancers, and robust signals can be detected by sensitive ctDNA assays. Here, we present a methylation-based approach for longitudinal monitoring of tumor burden that is tumor-naive, i.e., with no reliance on prior characterization of tumor molecular characteristics. We assess the effectiveness of our approach in a cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients receiving chemotherapy with or without additional targeted agents.<br \/>Longitudinal blood samples were collected from patients (n = 57) while on therapy, which averaged 4.9 months, for a total of 239 sample collection time points (median per patient = 5). Based on RECIST status, 16 patients were classified as complete responders (CR) at the end of treatment.<br \/>We generated plasma cell free DNA-derived libraries for methylation sequencing targeting regions relevant to CRC. Next, we computed a disease burden score for each sample and related these scores to clinical response (CR vs. non-CR). We trained a classifier on an independent cohort of CRC and healthy donor plasma cfDNA samples, and used this classifier to check for residual disease at the end of treatment for each of our 57 patients. The classifier detected residual disease in only 3\/16 CRs (19%) but 35\/41 non-CRs (85%).<br \/>Two of the non-CR patients were initially assessed as CRs at earlier time points. In both cases, our method successfully detected residual disease at or prior to the CR assessment and consistently showed residual disease in all follow up samples. This suggests improved sensitivity relative to RECIST and highlights the potential of using noninvasive blood tests for continuous monitoring of CRC patients receiving therapy.*Authors contributed equally to the work","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-04 Cancer surveillance and screening studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Minimal residual disease,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Alison D.

Prior to implementing a hospital-based lung cancer screening referral program, this study assesses the association between hospitalization and completion of lung cancer screening.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective cohort study of evaluated completion of at least one LDCT from 2014-2021 using electronic health record data using hospitalization as the primary exposure.

Univariate analysis and logistic regression models evaluated the association of hospitalization and completion of LDCT. The secondary outcome was completion of any CT of the chest.<br \/>Results: Of the 1,935 current smokers identified, 47% had at least one hospitalization, and 21% completed a LDCT during the study period. While a higher proportion of patients with a hospitalization had a LDCT (24%) compared to patients without a hospitalization (18%, p&#60;0.001), there was no association between hospitalization and completion of a LDCT after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates (95%CI 0.680 - 1.149).

Many interventions are being developed to address the low rates of lung cancer screening (LCS), including interventions that address the additional barriers faced by historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations as well as low-income and rural populations. However, the impact of Medicaid expansion on the types of interventions developed in non-expansion states and the efficacy of those interventions is not well understood.<br \/>Methods: A research librarian conducted searches in MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Results were screened and evaluated for eligibility by three reviewers in Covidence. Data was extracted from included studies after full-text review and analyzed using both a thematic analysis and a descriptive numerical summary of studies. The chosen framework was based on scoping review guidelines by Levac et al. and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR).<br \/>Results: Of 4696 studies found through the initial search, 53 met inclusion criteria. This includes 34 studies in Medicaid expansion states (M) and 17 studies in non-Medicaid expansion states (NM). Two additional studies compared interventions implemented in a Medicaid expansion state to a similar intervention implemented in a non-expansion state. Studies in both groups were primarily focused on addressing disparities by race and ethnicity (M=74%; NM=65%), with fewer studies focusing on rurality (M=9%; NM=12%), income (M=9%; NM=0%), or multiple disparities (M=9%; NM=24%). In non-expansion states, the most common interventions were patient navigation (29%) and community outreach (24%). While in Medicaid expansion states, the most common interventions were EHR algorithms (24%) and decision aids (21%). The intervention setting for both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states were most commonly in a hospital\/health system (M=53%; NM=47%) or community setting (M=24%; NM=47%). Interventions in both groups typically showed some improvement in uptake of LCS, though the degree of impact was variable between studies.<br \/>Conclusion: Due to continued barriers to access posed by inadequate insurance coverage, there is a critical need for interventions to reduce disparities in lung cancer mortality in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Interventions focused on patient navigation and community outreach have been effective in multiple settings in these states and could fill that gap.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Screening,Disparities,Utilization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Prior studies demonstrated that the incidence of second primary lung cancer (SPLC) among LC survivors is 4-6 times that of initial primary lung cancer (IPLC) in the general population. However, the incidence of SPLC and surveillance strategies using computed tomography (CT) have not been examined in long-term LC survivors with over 5-year survival. We aim to estimate SPLC incidence among long-term survivors and the effectiveness of annual surveillance CT exams.<br \/>Methods: We used data from SEER-Medicare with a cohort of 1,232,338 LC patients from the SEER cancer registry followed till death or last follow-up, who were also enrolled in Medicare in 1999-2020. The study cohort included 12,948 patients who were long-term survivors (&#8805; 5-year survival from IPLC) by age 65, received curative therapy for IPLC, and were continuously enrolled in Medicare 1 year prior to 5 years after IPLC diagnosis. The primary outcome was the 10-year cumulative SPLC incidence accounting for competing risk of death in the full study cohort and by receipt of surveillance CTs post-5-year survival, defined using detailed billing and LC-related ICD codes. To qualify as surveillance CTs, two annual CTs 9-18 months apart is required. Cox regression was used as exploratory analysis to examine the association between LC-specific survival (LC as cause of death) and the receipt of two CTs post-5-year survival as a binary variable, adjusting for SPLC diagnosis, age, sex, marital status, race, IPLC stage, income, education, and poverty.<br \/>Results: Of 12,948 long-term LC survivors, 46% (n=6,015) were male, 90% (n=11,476) had early-stage disease, 77% (n=9,945) had undergone surgery for initial curative treatment, and 3.8% (n = 486) received two surveillance CTs initiated within 18 months post-5-year survival. The 10-year cumulative incidence of SPLC was 5.06% [95% CI: 5.00-5.12%] in the SEER cohort but was substantially higher among long-term LC survivors at 13.6% [13.0-14.2%]. Those who received two annual surveillance CTs after 5-year survival had a significantly higher 10-year SPLC incidence (23.3% [19.4 - 27.2%]) than those who received one or no CT (13.2% [12.6 - 13.8%]). The adjusted hazard ratio of the association between LC-specific survival and receipt of two CTs was 0.67 [0.59-0.80, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001].<br \/>Conclusions: The high cumulative risk of SPLC among long-term LC survivors warrants tailored surveillance strategies. Our exploratory analysis showed a high SPLC detection rate among those who received two annual surveillance CTs vs. those who did not, with significantly higher LC-specific survival in the former. Future work will include extensive analysis accounting for time-varying exposure of multiple surveillance CTs using rigorous causal inference methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Prevention of second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Lung cancer,Survival,Cancer risk,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Chloe  C.

These delays are often influenced by diagnostic complexities, logistical hurdles, and patient-related factors. However, the association between treatment delays and survival outcomes has yet to be extensively investigated using data from a large national cohort. This study aims to fill this research gap and provide unique insights into the relationship between treatment delays and lung cancer survival by utilizing data from a substantial national cohort.<br \/>Methods: The study population consisted of 3,723 lung cancer patients participating in the NCI PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) Regression analyses examined the time between cancer diagnosis and treatment initiation using several measures including intervals from tumor doubling\/stage progression time models by Spratt et al. (1964) and Detterbeck et al. (2008). Analyses controlled for patient and clinical characteristics including age, sex, race\/ethnicity, smoking status, histopathologic type, cancer stage, and treatment modality. Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, STATA, and IBM SPSS software.<br \/>Results: PH Regression analyses demonstrated a clear association between longer time intervals from diagnosis to treatment initiation and increased risk of mortality. Patients with time intervals exceeding 20 days exhibited a hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 1.21 (p &#60; 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1158-1.3176). The Spratt tumor progression model, considering intervals exceeding 88 days, revealed a HR of 1.22 (p = 0.03, 95% CI 1.0146-1.4885). On the other hand, the Detterbeck model, which considered intervals exceeding 118 days, did not show a statistically significant association with increased mortality risk. Furthermore, PH analysis identified cigarette smoking status, marital status, and tumor grade as significant predictors of mortality risk.<br \/>Conclusions: Data from a large national cohort study indicate that delays in lung cancer treatment initiation have detrimental impacts on survival. Treatment initiation shortly after diagnosis had the most significant differential impact on mortality risk. Timely initiation of treatment is of utmost importance and should be prioritized in lung cancer care. By addressing factors contributing to treatment delays, it is likely possible to improve the survival rates of patients with lung cancer.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Cancer,Diagnosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Early diagnosis offers curative or treatable options, yet many cases are detected at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. In high-incidence East Asian countries with established screening programs, endoscopic screening demonstrates stage shift towards early GC diagnosis and reduced GC-related mortality. Analyses of these programs have reported benefit of endoscopic screening up to 36 months prior to diagnosis. This study explores the impact of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in this timeframe on GC stage at diagnosis and survival in an older US population.<br \/>Methods: The SEER-Medicare database was queried from 2000 to 2017 for patients 68 years of age or older with histologically confirmed GC with continuous Medicare enrollment for at least 36 months prior to GC diagnosis. We excluded patients with prior cancer history and those diagnosed by autopsy or death certificate. Medicare claims files were searched for EGD claims 6-36 months prior to GC diagnosis. We excluded claims in the 6 months prior to diagnosis to avoid capturing potential diagnostic EGD. We defined the exposed group as patients with an EGD claim 6-36 months prior to GC diagnosis (Prior EGD) and the unexposed group as patients with no EGD claim in this period (No Prior EGD). Propensity score analysis balanced baseline differences for patients with and without Prior EGD using covariates sex, age and year of diagnosis, race and ethnicity, rural\/urban, comorbidity, SES, and marital status. The primary outcome was in situ\/local-stage GC (early) at diagnosis compared to regional\/distant-stage (advanced). Secondary outcomes were 5-year overall and GC-specific survival. The adjusted odds of having in situ\/local-stage GC diagnosis compared to regional\/distant-stage was estimated using logistic regression, and survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/>Results: In 10,572 patients with GC (57.5% male, mean age 78.8 years), 16.4% had Prior EGD (n=1,736). Patients with Prior EGD had a significantly higher proportion of GC diagnosed in local stage compared to patients with No Prior EGD (45.7% vs. 30.2%, p &#60; 0.001). After controlling for confounders, Prior EGD group had two-fold increased odds of GC diagnosis at early-stage compared with No Prior EGD (OR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.88-2.10). Compared with No Prior EGD, Prior EGD was associated with higher overall survival (5-year survival 32.1% vs. 22.7%, p&#60;0.001) and GC-specific survival (5-year survival 46.0% vs. 31.1%, p&#60;0.001), both driven by early-stage disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that EGD up to 36 months prior to the diagnosis of GC is associated with earlier stage at diagnosis and improved overall and GC-specific survival. This study of an older population suggests that endoscopic screening may be beneficial even in a low-incidence country such as the US and warrants further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Screening,Gastric cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

To reduce mortality, screening by mammography in females is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, successfully reducing mortality by 15 - 32% in women aged 40 - 69 years. This is partially due to the high compliance rate (60 - 80%) among the candidate population. Mammography increases early-stage disease detection, which is correlated with better outcomes. While mammography has been largely successful, this screening method has limitations. Overall, mammography has false-negative and false-positive rates estimated at 12 - 20% and 7 - 12%, respectively. Consequently, annual mammograms result in 50 - 60% of women having a false-positive result within a 10-year span. Additionally, high breast density, found in approximately 50% of females over the age of 40, increases susceptibility to false positive and negative results. For this reason, in 2023 the FDA required that dense breast tissue status, an independent risk factor for cancer, be disclosed to mammogram recipients. The subsequent diagnostic pathway for women with dense breast tissue is not well defined for the care provider. Alternative imaging options have performance issues or are less accessible. Here we describe a liquid biopsy test to complement mammography in women with dense breast tissue to help resolve ambiguity in results. Blood from early- and late-stage breast cancer patients was prospectively collected in Streck cfDNA BCT Devices (n=100) or retrospectively acquired (n=100); and blood from presumed normal samples was collected (n=200). cfDNA was extracted and converted into libraries for low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS). Sequenced reads were analyzed to generate fragment end-motif and size (FEMS) and fragment coverage dataframes for classification using Genece Health&#8217;s proprietary analysis pipeline and machine-learning (ML) algorithm. 150 breast cancer samples distributed across stages and 150 presumed normal samples were selected to create a training cohort. Performance was tested using a 5-fold cross validation strategy. The best performance was observed using a convolution neural network (CNN) ML model with &#62;80% sensitivity when specificity was set at 85%. The remaining 50 breast cancer samples and 50 presumed normal samples were used as an external test set. The performance in this cohort was comparable to the training cohort, with both specificity and sensitivity &#62;80%. Genece presents an early proof of concept breast cancer screening liquid biopsy assay that uses LP-WGS fragmentomics and ML to detect cancer from a single blood sample. Continuing development with additional cohorts and optimization will yield even greater performance. The Genece liquid biopsy test has the potential to be paired with mammography, especially in women with dense breast tissue, to improve screening sensitivity, specificity, and overall outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Breast density,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

There is also evidence for increases in late-stage breast cancer diagnoses. Our objectives were to determine: 1) the COVID-19-affected period on mammogram screening, 2) the proportion of pandemic-associated missed or delayed mammogram screening visits overall and by race\/ethnicity and age group, and 3) evidence for pandemic-associated shifts in diagnosis stage.<br \/>Methods: Screening mammogram encounter data between 1-1-2019 and 12-31-2022 were extracted from EPIC for females &#8805; 40 years old for the screening analysis. We used Bayesian state space models to describe weekly screening mammogram counts, modeling an interruption that phased in and out from 3-1-2020 to 9-1-2020. We used the posterior predictive distribution to simulate differences between a predicted, uninterrupted process and the observed screening mammogram counts. Breast cancer diagnoses at &#8805; 21 years from the tumor registry between 12-1-2018 and 11-30-2021 were included in the stage analysis. We used logistic regression models to estimate late-stage diagnosis odds comparing matched three-month periods during the pandemic to before the pandemic.<br \/>Results: A total of 319,492 encounters among 146,644 women were included. Model-estimated screening mammograms dropped by 98.8% (95% CI 95.1 to 100) between 3-15-2020 and 5-24-2020, returning to pre-pandemic levels or higher after this period. Drops in screening mammogram encounters did not vary significantly by race\/ethnicity or age group (p &#62; .75). Among 4,669 breast cancer diagnoses, we found no significant differences in the odds of late-stage diagnoses for any period vs. the same period before the pandemic (Table).<br \/>Conclusions: These data suggest a short-term pandemic effect on screening mammograms. Evidence for increases in late-stage diagnoses is limited.

The primary goal was to determine the feasibility of a future randomized trial of BrM screening versus symptom-directed imaging in this patient population. Key inclusion criteria were age &#8805;18; TN MBC diagnosed &#8804;12 weeks prior to study entry or HER2+ MBC with no restrictions regarding time of diagnosis; no symptoms of BrM or known asymptomatic BrM; ECOG &#8805; 1 and no MRI contraindications.

Despite these startling statistics, there is a notable dearth of research on this topic within medical literature. Our medical student-led pilot study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by evaluating the uptake of cancer screenings and identifying the barriers faced by the unhoused in Southwest Michigan. Our objective was to enhance the understanding of cancer care disparities and identify factors that hinder access to cancer screenings for this marginalized group. Utilizing questionnaires distributed in homeless shelters, we collected data on the prevalence and impediments to screenings for hepatitis C virus (HCV), and lung, breast, colon, and cervical cancers in a local community.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> The study encompassed 143 participants, revealing that women reported a shorter median duration of homelessness (5 months) than men (18 months). The primary barriers to cancer screening were access to services and lack of awareness, rather than insurance coverage. Gender disparities were evident in HCV screening, with an overall rate of 55%; however, willingness to screen was higher among women (83%) compared to men (49%). Colon cancer screening showed no significant gender disparity, standing at 45% uptake. The prevalence of smoking was high at 78%, yet a higher proportion of men were amenable to lung cancer screening. Interestingly, Pap smear uptake surpassed national averages, while mammogram rates were below expected at 40%.<br \/><u>Discussion &#38; Conclusion:<\/u> While the discrepancies between genders may not be immediately apparent, our data shows that developing targeted interventions and tailoring the delivery of adequate cancer screenings to the unhoused require consideration of gender as a key factor. Women&#8217;s perceived barriers differ slightly from men&#8217;s, and generally-speaking, they undergo more cancer screenings per year compared with men. The reluctance among male participants to engage in HCV screening has been observed in other studies as well and as our study demonstrates, it may be related to informational barriers. Although preliminary, our findings shed light on the critical health care issues faced by the unhoused and serves as a steppingstone towards improving our understanding on their challenges in hopes of improving their health outcomes. Comprehensive research is imperative to unravel the complex causes of these gender-based discrepancies. In the interim, the implementation of a navigator social worker system could prove beneficial in facilitating the unhoused with the logistics of screening processes, overcoming transportation hurdles, and reinforcing the importance of ongoing health management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer detection,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Talal Al-Assil<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Kalina<sup>1<\/sup>, Madison Laird<sup>1<\/sup>, Nataly Dawood<sup>1<\/sup>, Raven Riordan<sup>1<\/sup>, Neya Suresh Kumar<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Olivier<sup>1<\/sup>, Cheryl Dickson<sup>2<\/sup>, Gitonga Munene<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd4d5487-6d96-45c1-9000-7f8cdc50c264","ControlNumber":"980","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Although significant progress has been made to improve PRAD prognosis, existing studies indicated that Black American men have disproportionately high incidence and mortality rate in prostate cancer compared with non-Hispanic White American men. With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) being increasingly applied to PRAD research and clinical decision-making, PRAD data disparities would introduce bias to AI\/ML models and further enhance negative impacts on healthcare towards underrepresented groups. Transfer learning has shown potential to reduce racial disparities in PRAD. However, its performance may be deteriorated due to: (1) its model requires large-scale training samples which are difficult to obtain in clinical settings, and (2) it only uses single-omics data without integrating multi-omics information. To address these concerns, we propose to develop a multi-modal transfer learning model to integrate multi-omics data for reducing health disparities. Specifically, we first investigated two multi-modal ensemble methods, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) based patient-pairwise similarity, and variational autoencoder (VAE) to integrate different types of omics data. Then, we leveraged a transfer learning model based on domain adaptation to pre-train the model on the majority group (White Americans) and fine-tune the model using the minority group (Black Americans). To further address the imbalanced data among ethnic groups, we explored implementing a data augmentation method, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to increase the size of minority group data. We evaluated our model on multi-omics data (mRNA, miRNA and methylation) of PRAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Results suggested that our proposed approach achieved better performance of reducing health disparities for Black Americans compared with the mixture model and the independent model as well as the conventional transfer learning model in predicting progression-free interval (PFI) prognosis for PRAD patients. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that SMOTE alleviated the data imbalanced problem and improved the performance of the prognosis classification for ethnic minority groups. In summary, our results demonstrated that our proposed multi-modal transfer learning approach could effectively reduce the performance gap between majority and minority groups in PRAD prognosis, thereby mitigating health disparities. We expect that our proposed multi-model transfer learning framework can be customized and extensible to reduce health disparities in other types of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Cancer disparities,Prostate cancer,Transfer learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

We previously developed a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for PCa comprised of 290 common genetic variants (PHS290). When accounting for family history and ancestry (self-reported or genetically determined), PHS290 remained a powerful independent predictor of age at PCa diagnosis, metastatic PCa diagnosis, and PCa death. Additional variants associated with PCa susceptibility or benign elevation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have since been published. Here, we evaluate their impact on lifetime risk predictions for metastatic and fatal PCa and develop an updated polygenic score. This score will inform the design of the Prostate Cancer, Genetic Risk, and Equitable Screening Study (ProGRESS, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05926102), a nationwide randomized controlled trial evaluating precision PCa screening in the VA healthcare system.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We utilized a machine learning approach to update the PHS. Over 450 variants associated with PCa, aggressive PCa, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or benign PSA elevation were evaluated for inclusion. First, we identified pairs of variants with highly correlated genotype (defined as R<sup>2<\/sup> &#62; 0.95) and utilized univariable Cox proportional hazards models (using age at diagnosis of PCa) to exclude one variant from each pair. We then evaluated all remaining candidate variants for inclusion in a new PHS using a LASSO-regularized Cox proportional hazards model. We combined the new PHS with clinical predictors (ancestry and family history) to create a comprehensive, quantitative polygenic score in a diverse, population-based cohort of n=590,750 (Million Veteran Program). Both self-reported and genetic ancestry (based on 2,309 ancestry informative markers) were assessed. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) to compare men with high versus low polygenic score and evaluated absolute predictions of any, metastatic, and fatal PCa.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The updated polygenic score included 356 variants, as well as family history and genetic ancestry. When comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of the population for polygenic score, the HRs for any PCa, metastatic PCa, and fatal PCa were 5.6, 5.8, and 5.2 respectively. These HRs are all greater than those achieved with PHS290, which yielded 5.2, 4.9, and 4.4 respectively. Risk stratification improved within each ancestry group, including within the &#62;100,000 participants of African ancestry&#8212;a group known to have elevated risk of fatal PCa.

In sub-Saharan Africa, HCC is the second most common cancer in men and the sixth in women. African patients present with HCC at a young age and at advanced stage of disease. Improved surveillance can increase early HCC detection. The GALAD score has good sensitivity in the diagnosis of HCC in Asia, Europe and North America, however, it has not been validated in an African cohort. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the GALAD score in the diagnosis of HCC in Ghanaian patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Clinical data from patients with cirrhosis (n=93) or HCC (n=78) from out-patient hepatology clinics at 3 teaching hospitals in Ghana were abstracted, and serum samples analyzed. A logistic regression model predicting HCC status based on GALAD score was constructed to obtain the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for GALAD. The area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval was calculated and used to assess the performance of the GALAD score in surveillance for HCC.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The median AFP (5010.2 vs. 3.4), L3% (28.3 vs. 0.3) and DCP (507.6 vs. 0.2) levels were all significantly higher among HCC cases than the controls (p&#60;0.0001). The median GALAD score was also higher among HCC patients (8.0 vs. -4.1, p&#60;0.0001). The AUC of the GALAD score in the diagnosis of HCC was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 - 0.92). At a cut-off value of -0.37, the GALAD score had a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.86. In a re-fit of the logistic regression model, the most significant factors in the GALAD model in our cohort were AFP-L3% and log(DCP).

Past studies indicate heterogeneity within the Asian American population, yet few have examined differences in screening uptake and related factors among Asian ethnic subgroups in NYC. Further, cancer screening knowledge and cancer fatalism have been found to impact cancer screening uptake, and effects vary by race, ethnicity, immigration status, and cancer type.<br \/>Objective: Our study aimed to examine differences in cancer screening uptake, knowledge, and fatalism among Chinese, Korean, and South Asian NYC adults and to examine the effects of cancer screening knowledge and cancer fatalism on cancer screening uptake.<br \/>Methods: We used data from NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center&#8217;s Cancer Community Health Resources and Needs Assessment survey. The survey was developed and distributed in 10 languages in collaboration with 23 community partners. Data were collected from NYC adults with recruitment strategies focused on immigrant and non-English language preference communities from Oct. 2021 - Dec. 2022. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression analyses were used to examine differences in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake; breast and CRC screening knowledge; and cancer fatalism between Chinese, Korean, and South Asian (Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Asian Indian, and Nepali) adults; and to examine the effects of breast and CRC screening knowledge on breast and CRC screening uptake and cancer fatalism on breast, cervical, and CRC screening uptake (n=1,045). Analyses were restricted by age and sex using United States (U.S.) Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.<br \/>Results: The sample was 60.0% female with a mean age of 45.7 years; 83.1% of participants were born outside of the U.S., 49.9% of participants were Chinese, 22.8% were Korean, and 27.3% were South Asian. Korean women had 0.52 (95%CI: 0.31, 0.88) times lower odds of Pap test uptake than Chinese women; South Asian adults had 0.44 (95%CI: 0.24, 0.80) times lower odds of CRC screening uptake than Chinese adults. Korean adults had 1.68 (95%CI: 1.17, 2.41) times higher odds of knowing the correct age to begin having mammograms compared to Chinese adults; South Asian adults had 0.66 (95%CI: 0.46, 0.94) times lower odds of knowing the correct age to begin CRC screening compared to Chinese adults. Korean adults had a 0.39 (95%CI: 0.25, 0.63) and 0.22 (95%CI: 0.13, 0.37) times lower odds of some and high cancer fatalism, respectively, compared to Chinese adults. No associations were found between cancer screening knowledge or cancer fatalism and cancer screening uptake.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study adds to the current literature on the diversity of cancer needs, beliefs, and behaviors among Asian Americans. The findings indicate the need for ethnic-specific cultural tailoring for future cancer screening interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Race,Breast cancer,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

In the effort to prevent HPV-related cancers, the 9-valent HPV vaccine emerged as a crucial intervention, targeting HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; the previous 4-valent (types 6,11,16,18) and 2-valent (types 16, 18). This study involved 213 women aged 21-50 attending gynecology and colonoscopy clinics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The study assessed anal HPV prevalence and analyzed vaccination status-related differences. Anal swabs were collected for HPV testing using the ATILA AmpFire, targeting 17 HPV types. This method identified 15 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) and two low-risk HPV types (6 and 11). Prevalence of any HPV, HR-HPV, and LR-HPV, and of specific HPV types were calculated by overall and vaccination status. Differences were assessed for statistical significance (p&#60;0.05) using Fisher's exact or Pearson &#967;2 test. The mean age of women was 36.0 &#177; 5.9 years. Overall, 19.7% (n=44) had received the HPV vaccine; among them, 52.2% (n=23) had received the 4-valent vaccine, 2.3% had received the 2-valent vaccine, 2.3% had received the 9-valent vaccine, and 43.2% were uncertain about their specific HPV vaccine type. The prevalence of anal HPV infection was 68.5% for any HPV, 61.5% for HR-HPV, and 15.0% for LR-HPV. The most prevalent HR-HPV types were HPV 56 (13.2%), HPV 68 (11.7%), and HPV 66 (11.2%). There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of any HPV, HR-HPV, and LR-HPV between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. The most common HR-HPV type among vaccinated were HPV 66 (20.5%), HPV 31 (18.2%), HPV 56 (15.9%), while the most common among unvaccinated women were HPV 56 (12.4%), HPV 68 (12.4%), and HPV 16 (12.4%). Additionally, when evaluating as a grouped variable, the HPV genotypes covered by the 4-valent, unvaccinated women had a significantly higher prevalence of these types as compared to those vaccinated (28.9% vs. 13.6%, respectively, p-value =.03). The unvaccinated women showed a lower prevalence for HPV types covered by the 9-valent vaccine compared to the vaccinated cohort (43.2% vs. 45.5%). However, this difference was not statistically significant. We found a high prevalence of anal HPV among these women, with lower prevalence of 4-valent and 2-valent HPV types among vaccinated women, evidencing the pivotal role of HPV vaccination. Future research should assess the 9-valent vaccine's long-term effectiveness against more HPV types.

HPV vaccination is an important primary prevention strategy for reducing the burden of HPV-associated cancers. In South Florida (population over 6 million), the percentage of adolescents aged 13-15 years who completed the recommended HPV vaccine series is 54%, which lags significantly behind the Healthy People 2030 target of 80%. In addition, vaccination disparities exist in South Florida by races\/ethnicities and sexes, with non-Hispanic black males having the lowest rate at 27%. To address HPV cancer disparities, we performed a geospatial analysis on the incidence of HPV-associated cancers by sex and races\/ethnicity to identify communities in South Florida with high incidence of HPV-associated cancer to target interventions that may improve HPV-vaccine uptake via community outreach and engagement.<br \/>Methods: The average annual (2010-2019) incidence of HPV-associated cancers in women (cervical, oropharyngeal, vulva, vaginal, and anal) and men (oropharyngeal, penile, and anal) were calculated for Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) at the census tract level across South Florida using data from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), the state incident cancer registry. Geospatial hot spot analyses were used to identify clusters of census tracts with high HPV cancer incidence by sex and race\/ethnicity. Socioeconomic and cervical screening data of the hot spots were analyzed to identify other neighborhood risk conditions that may be associated with high HPV cancer risk.<br \/>Results: For Hispanics and NHBs in South Florida, census tract hot spots for male and female HPV cancers appear to overlap in low-income neighborhoods; however, hot spots for NHW males are mostly in medium to higher income areas and do not overlap with hot spots observed for NHW females, likely given that NHW females generally report higher cervical screening rates.<br \/>Conclusion: There is a positive association between male and female HPV cancer incidence in Hispanic and NHB communities of South Florida, justifying the need for increased HPV vaccination and screening programs in these neighborhoods. While increasing cervical screening rate in the hot spot neighborhoods is urgent for cervical cancer control, increasing gender-neutral HPV vaccination uptake in these communities will not only reduce the incidences of male HPV cancers but also help to accelerate cervical cancer elimination by reducing HPV infection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

It poses high risks of renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas among others. VHL can be clinically diagnosed based on the Danish, international, or Dutch guidelines, or through molecular diagnosis by identifying a pathogenic variant in the VHL gene. There is now an FDA-approved HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that is effective for the treatment of VHL-related manifestations, and the identification of eligible patients is paramount to receive this benefit. In addition, the screening recommendations for VHL are extensive and result in significant burden on patients. We suspect that VHL is under-diagnosed in the clinical setting, and we further hypothesize that this burden may contribute to care gaps and disparities in access to VHL-related care.<br \/>Methods: This is a single-institution, retrospective study conducted at the University of Illinois Health and Hospitals System (UIH). We assessed the prevalence of patients with VHL-related tumors by examining ICD diagnosis codes from 2010 to 2023. Additionally, we analyzed the subset of these patients who underwent germ-line genetic testing. Furthermore, we examined our cohort of VHL patients more closely to explore the burden of VHL-related care. We examined the time to germ-line genetic and cascade testing from first clinical touchpoint at UIH, as well as the total number of clinical departments accessed at UIH.<b> <\/b>Demographics, clinical characteristics, germ-line genetic testing results, and information on clinical visits were also collected from those with a molecular or clinical diagnosis of VHL.<br \/>Results: We found 9,875 patients with at least one VHL-associated tumor. Among them, 1,379 had two or more VHL-associated tumors, with &#60;2% undergoing germline genetic testing. We identified 10 individuals diagnosed with VHL. Of the ten patients, 30% were black, 30% were white, and 40% self-identified as other. Age of onset for VHL-related screening ranged from 10 to 37 years. All patients diagnosed with VHL underwent germ-line genetic testing, with 60% opting for cascade testing of at-risk family members. Patient care was fragmented, with on average, each VHL patient seeking care from five different UIC clinical departments (range 1-11) and receiving care from multiple separate institutions (range 1-4).<b> <\/b><br \/>Conclusion: Our data revealed that most patients with VHL-associated tumors did not receive genetic testing, demonstrating a potential missed opportunity for early diagnosis and interventions to improve outcomes for VHL-related disease. Furthermore, our data highlights the clinical burden of VHL, and supports the potential impact of a coordinated care program for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Early detection,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

This leads to the accumulation of these substrates primarily in the bone marrow (BM), liver, and spleen. Notably, individuals with GD face an increased risk of plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) by approximately nine-fold. We present two compelling cases of the regression of smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) following GD treatment, substantiated by biochemical evidence of lipid-reactive clonal paraproteins (PP) in both patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Peripheral blood samples were obtained with IRB approval from patients with concurrent SMM and GD at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Utilizing C-18 beads coupled with gly-sphingosine-coated liposomes and Sphingosine-1 phosphate bead liposome-based pulldown, we established the binding of glycolipids to serum PP.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In a 66-year-old male, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia revealed compound heterozygous N370S\/V394L mutations and reduced &#946;-glucosidase activity, confirming Type 1 GD. Laboratory findings included substantial pancytopenia (WBC 2.5 k\/&#181;L, Hgb 12.1 g\/dL, platelet 44 k\/&#181;L) and myeloma markers (M spike 1.58 g\/dL, monoclonal IgA &#955;). A BM biopsy indicated 30% &#955;-restricted plasma cells. PET-CT showed hepatosplenomegaly without FDG avid lytic lesions, consistent with SMM. Imiglucerase enzyme therapy improved GD biomarkers, decreased hepatosplenomegaly, and blood count improvement (WBC 4.7 k\/&#181;L, Hgb 13.6 g\/dL, platelet 66 k\/&#181;L). Notably, myeloma burden significantly reduced (M-spike 0.94 g\/dL, IgA 1373 g\/dL and free lambda 26.1 mg\/L). Similarly, a 41-year-old female with mild fatigue, Hgb levels of 10.9 g\/dL, a platelet count of 169 k\/&#181;L, M spike of 0.9 g\/dL, IgG &#954;appa on immunofixation, and IgG levels at 1730 mg\/dL, indicating SMM. GBA analysis showed homozygous N370S mutation and reduced beta-glucosidase activity consistent with Type 1 GD. Substrate reduction therapy with eliglustat alleviated fatigue, reduced GD biomarkers, normalized cytopenias, and gradually decreased myeloma markers. Laboratory results indicated an M spike of 0.5 g\/dL, IgG levels at 1295 mg\/dL, and free kappa at 31.3 mg\/L. To explore the interaction between clonal immunoglobulins (Ig) and lyso-lipids, we utilized Gly-sphingolipids (see methods) and demonstrated a robust interaction with IgA (patient 1) and IgG (patient 2) paraprotein by western blotting.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our experimental findings confirm specific clonal Ig binding in SMM and GD patients and demonstrate potent and timely benefits from addressing GD in managing SMM patients.

Here, we present a case of a jejunal leiomyosarcoma in a young adult.<br \/>Case Presentation: A 23-year-old Caucasian male with GERD presented with five months of abdominal pain, intermittent nausea with non-bloody emesis, and a 20-pound weight loss. Presenting vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed conjunctival pallor with epigastric tenderness to palpation. Serology demonstrated iron deficiency anemia, hemoccult positive stool, negative CEA, CA19-9, and AFP tumor markers. HIV antigen antibody and EBV-PCR were non-reactive. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed markedly thickened heterogenous jejunal loop in the left hemiabdomen with associated mesenteric adenopathy and small volume pelvic ascites. EGD with push enteroscopy revealed a single, malignant appearing and ulcerated mass in the proximal jejunum. PET-CT showed a hypermetabolic, multilobulated, ill-defined mass involving multiple loops of jejunum. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with resection of a proximal jejunal mass (10x8 x7 cm), mesenteric lymphadenectomy, and a jejunojejunostomy creation. Pathology demonstrated leiomyosarcoma (pT2aN0MoG3), and he was initiated on cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.<br \/>Discussion: Primary small intestinal malignancies are rare malignancies with an incidence of less than 5% of all GI malignancies. 56 cases of GI leiomyosarcoma in adults were identified between 2000-2012 with a peak incidence between 55-59 years of age (Aggarrwal 2012). Leiomyosarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas arising from bones, tendons, blood vessels, or muscles with a spectrum of disease ranging from low-grade cutaneous lesions to aggressive lesions of internal organs with significant potential for metastasis (Pipe 2002). Diagnosis is based on immunohistochemical positivity for SMA, desmin, and h-caldesmon, and negativity for CD117, CD34, and DOG1.1, notably lacking <i>KIT <\/i>and <i>PDGFRA <\/i>mutations (Aggarwal 2012). Treatment involves surgical resection and a cost benefit analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy with (Reynolds, 2014). This case of a 23 year old, without significant risk factors, diagnosed with a jejunal leiomyosarcoma presents as one of the youngest cases ever to be reported and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the cancer in a broader range of the adult population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: other,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
