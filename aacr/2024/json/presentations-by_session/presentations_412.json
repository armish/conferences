The Prospective Evaluation of Self-Testing to Increase Screening (PRESTIS) Trial is the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the U.S. to evaluate the effectiveness of mailed at-home self-sampling for HPV testing in a safety net health system setting. Safety net systems provide care to medically underserved individuals at elevated cervical cancer risk. We hypothesized that patients who were mailed a self-sampling kit would have greater screening participation compared with those receiving usual care; and that patient navigation, a patient-centered intervention to address barriers to care, would further increase participation.<br \/>Methods: PRESTIS is a three-arm pragmatic RCT of n=2,270 patients in a U.S. safety net health system who are under-screened for cervical cancer (i.e., no Pap in 3.5 years or Pap\/HPV co-test in 5.5 years). Eligible participants were identified through the electronic health record (EHR) and randomized to arms: 1) telephone recall to provider-performed screening (usual care); 2) telephone recall + mailed self-sampling kit for HPV testing; or 3) telephone recall + mailed self-sampling kit + telephone-based patient navigation. Self-sampled swabs were tested for high-risk (HR)-HPV. HR-HPV+ patients were navigated to clinical follow-up. The primary outcome, incidence of screening participation, was ascertained by EHR review at 6 months post-randomization and defined as return of a completed kit or attendance for provider-performed screening.<br \/>Results: Participants were enrolled 02\/2020-08\/2023. Primary outcomes have been ascertained for n=2,115 participants. Participants were predominantly Hispanic\/Latina (68.6%); 53.4% indicated Spanish as primary language; and 60.3% were uninsured. Mean age was 47.9 years (SD: 10.4 years); median time since last screening test was 9.5 years (range: 1.6-21.7 years). In intent-to-treat analyses, screening participation was 15.3% (95% CI 13.0% - 17.9%) in Arm 1; 44.0% (40.4% - 47.6%) in Arm 2; and 51.4% (47.7% - 55.0%) in Arm 3. Relative incidence of screening in Arms 2 and 3 versus Arm 1 was 2.90 (2.42 - 3.47) and 3.36 (2.82 - 4.01), respectively. Relative incidence of screening in Arm 3 versus Arm 2 was 1.16 (1.04 - 1.29).<br \/>Conclusion: Compared with usual care, mailed at-home self-sampling increased screening participation among an under-screened population by almost three-fold when used alone and over 3.3-fold when combined with telephone-based patient navigation. After FDA approval, self-sampling for HR-HPV testing has the potential to dramatically increase participation in cervical cancer screening in underserved populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-22 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Jane R.

EHR data to define sociodemographic and clinical factors were linked to population-based state cancer registries for data on incident HCC (ICD-03 site\/histology C22.0\/8170-8175) through 2017. We extracted, harmonized and developed schemas to characterize multiple response race and ethnicity data across systems. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine disparities in HCC risk across racial and ethnic groups, comparing observations across categorization schema.<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: The cohort included 4,248,553 adults; 2,916 had incident HCC. A race and ethnicity schema that prioritized small populations and disaggregation of heterogenous groups defined 16 categories and was used to analyze pooled data from Kaiser Permanente Hawai&#8217;i and Sutter Health. With this schema, we observed variation in HCC risk across ethnic groups that are typically aggregated into larger ethno-racial categories (e.g., Asian American). Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White males, Vietnamese American males had greater risk of HCC (hazard ratio (HR): 7.42; 95% CI: 4.25, 12.96) as did American Indian\/Alaska Native, Black, Chinese American, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander males; Asian Indian, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean American males did not. Among females, every group except American Indian\/Alaska Native, Asian Indian American, and Pacific Islander females had greater risk of HCC than the NH White group. Due to less granular data from San Francisco Health Network during our study period, we developed a second, grouped schema aggregating categories from the detailed schema; it resulted in seven race and ethnicity categories and was used to analyze pooled data from all three healthcare systems. Compared to the categorization of race and ethnicity used by the US Census, which also has seven categories, we observed different patterns in HCC risk disparities for the smallest groups (i.e., American Indian\/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian).<br \/><u>Conclusions<\/u>: Analysis of a large EHR-based cohort linked to cancer registry data using a race and ethnicity characterization schema that prioritizes small populations yields valuable knowledge on disparities in HCC risk. Thus, to advance research on health disparities using EHR data, researchers must critically assess racial and ethnic categories typically available from healthcare system data repositories. We offer recommendations to operationalize EHR data on race and ethnicity to facilitate its meaningful use in research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Epidemiology,Cancer risk,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Yet little research has investigated the prevalence and correlates of <i>Hp<\/i> and <i>cagA<\/i> infection in Navajo people. We assessed the prevalence and correlates of <i>Hp<\/i> infection and <i>cagA<\/i>-gene carriage in adult tribal members residing in the Navajo Nation.<br \/><b>Methods and Material.<\/b> We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study in the Navajo Nation in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited using online and offline platforms, including social media, a study website, newspaper advertisements, flyers, word of mouth, and community outreach. Stool samples collected from participants were analyzed with droplet digital PCR for <i>Hp<\/i> 16S and <i>cagA<\/i> virulence genes. Demographic characteristics, health, and dietary factors were collected from self-administered health and food questionnaires sent via mail.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> Of 99 participants, half (49.5%) were 18-44 years old and 73.7% were female. About sixty percent (57.7%, 95% CI: 47.6-67.3) of participants were infected with <i>Hp<\/i>, twice the US population prevalence (27%). Among <i>Hp<\/i>-infected participants, 76.7% (95% CI: 64.0-86.6) were <i>cagA<\/i>-gene positive, four times the <i>cagA<\/i> gene prevalence in White people (19%). Controlling for age and sex, monthly use of Navajo herbal medicines was positively associated with <i>Hp<\/i> infection (OR=3.73, 95% CI: 1.05-17.87).

The purpose of this study is to develop an LGBTQ+ culturally tailored tobacco prevention curriculum within the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, to help prevent LGBTQ+ students from starting or escalating the use of any tobacco product.<br \/>Methods: A community-based participatory research (CBPR) was established between the Cedars-Sinai Cancer Research Center for Health Equity, facilitated by Community Outreach and Engagement, in collaboration with The Wall Las Memorias and the Stanford REACH Lab to conduct basic formative focus groups in the LGBTQ+ community. Seventy-six participants were recruited, and 9 focus groups were conducted (33 participants among LGBTQ+ youth; 19 community advocates and educators; and 24 parents\/caregivers\/guardians). A thematic analysis was conducted to identify lesson topics and subject matter content to be included in the curriculum and the best strategies to deliver the lesson to LGBTQ+ youth.<br \/>Results: Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including an overall theme noting a desire for more safe spaces and peer support to discuss tobacco, vaping, and marijuana use among LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ youth noted tobacco, vaping, and marijuana were very accessible through friends and social groups in the school setting. They also expressed that tobacco, vaping, and marijuana use were associated with pressures to fit in, an increasing &#8216;normalization&#8217; of marijuana use, and social media channels that glorify vaping and tobacco use. LGBTQ+ youth also expressed that they do not see tobacco prevention messaging relevant to themselves or their peers nor through their preferred information channels. Parents, educators, and community advocates expressed that they would like to be offered opportunities for education and direct involvement in LGBTQ+ research. With this information, the REACH Lab is developing the LGBTQ+ curriculum.<br \/>Conclusions This CBPR approach builds upon the existing validated set of curricula contained in the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, which is theory-driven and has reached over 3 million middle and high school students. Once completed, the LGBTQ+ Focused Tobacco Prevention Curriculum will be added to the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit and will be the first informed\/validated tobacco prevention program for LGBTQ+ youth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Prevention,LGBTQ+,Cancer disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Despite advancements in care, ongoing racial disparities stress the need to uncover underlying causes. This study seeks to evaluate the interplay of race, social determinants of health, and treatment facility on overall survival (OS) of PDAC patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In this retrospective cohort study, we identified PDAC patients from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2019, using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data. Patients not receiving treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) or who were missing race were excluded. We performed a multivariable cox proportional hazards regression to explore the race and all-cause mortality relationship, stratified by facility type and income status. Patients were divided into income quartiles (SES) with the lowest SES represented by median zip code level income &#8804;$40,227, while highest SES indicated income levels &#8805;$63,333. Treating facility type included community or academic hospital. A two-sided P-value &#60;0.05 was considered significant.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The total cohort included 210,520 patients. The average age of the cohort was 66.4 (SD:10.7) years and most patients were white (80%, N=168,467), male (52.2%, N=109,844), treated at academic facility type (65.5%, N=136,623), and the highest SES was the largest (38.4%, N=71,205). In unadjusted analysis, Black patients had lower OS than Whites (HR: 1.05 (95% CI: 1.04-1.07, p&#60;0.001)). As SES increases there was a corresponding decrease in hazards (p&#60;0.001). In the multivariable subgroup analysis, survival were not significant for Black and White patients in highest SES at academic facilities (p=0.8). Of note, highest SES Black patients in community hospitals had worse survival than highest SES White patients (HR: 1.08 (95% CI:1.01-1.16, p=0.03)). However, lowest SES Blacks treated at academic facilities had superior survival compared to lowest SES Whites (HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.96, p&#60;0.001)).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Survival differences among Black individuals were linked to SES and facility type. Highest SES was not protective for Black patients treated at community hospitals compared to their White counterparts, indicating additional factors driving outcomes. These findings highlight the intricate influence of race, SES, and perhaps biology on survival outcomes. Addressing these complexities through targeted research and intervention is crucial for reducing health disparities and fostering a more equitable healthcare landscape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Databases,Cancer risk,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (BRCA) are present in 2-3% of all breast cancer (BC), and 15% of all ovarian cancer (OC) cases. BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (PV) represent 25-28% of BC and 40% of OC patients with a positive familial history. BRCAs are the most studied genes for the prevalence, family history, preventive surgeries, and target treatment options in both BC and OC. There are other genes, important in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment options of the patients: TP53, PALB2, CHEK2, among others. This study aims to identify the prevalence of non- BRCA genes related to the development of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome in patients of Northeast Mexico.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b>: <\/b>This is a multicenter study that recruited patients from two reference oncology centers in Nuevo Leon, Mexico: the CECIL (The CUCC Early Cancer Detection Clinic) Hereditary Cancer Registry and Hereditary Cancer Program from Tec Salud. From March of 2016 to March of 2023, a total of 872 patients meeting NCCN criteria were evaluated by Medical Geneticists from both centers and were tested with NGS multigene cancer panels.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><b>: <\/b>A total of 665 (76.26%) patients with a clinical diagnosis of HBOC (Hereditary Breast Hereditary Cancer Syndrome) were included. We found 310 (46.6%) patients had at least one variant, 180 (58%) with at least one pathogenic variant, and 130 (41%) with a VUS (a variant of uncertain significance). BRCA1 was found in 79 (43.8%) and BRCA2 in 32 (17.7%) of all PV. Non-BRCA PV were found in 69 (38.3%) patients: 4 ATM, 2 BLM, 3 BRIP1, 22 CHEK2, 4 CDKN2A, 5 MUTYH, 10 PALB2, 4 RAD51C, 2 SDHA, 2 TP53, 2 WRN, CDH1, CDK4, DICER, MSH3, NBN, PTEN, RAD50, USH2A one of each. Is remarkable that 19 of the 22 patients with CHEK2 and 5 of the 10 patients with PALB2 had the recurrent PV c.707T&#62;C and c.2167_2168del, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b><b>: <\/b>Non-BRCA PV in Northern Mexico corresponds to one-third of the BC and OC cases, including HRD (homologous recombination deficiency) genes. HDR patient carriers are potential targets of iPARP therapies.

Our published data have shown that the distribution of specific HPV16\/35 sublineages and genetic variants differ around the world and confer greater risk of cervical precancer\/cancer in the populations where the virus is thought to have originated and coevolved. More studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between race\/ethnicity, HR-HPV genetic variation, and precancer\/cancer risk.<br \/>Objective: To evaluate HPV45 and HPV52 genetic variation, and how it relates to a woman&#8217;s race\/ethnicity and cervical precancer\/cancer risk, using HPV whole-genome sequencing of 774 HPV45+ and 719 HPV52+ women in the NCI-Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) HPV Persistence and Progression cohort; and compared to HPV16\/35.<br \/>Methods: We viral genome sequenced 557 HPV45+ and 345 HPV52+ controls (women with benign infections [&#8804;CIN1]), and 94 HPV45+ and 227 HPV52+ precancer\/cancer cases (CIN3+). We evaluated HPV45 and HPV52 prevalence for each type by a woman&#8217;s self-reported race\/ethnicity, and compared them to HPV16 and HPV35 using existing comparable NCI-KPNC data. To assess associations between HPV45 and HPV52 genetic variation (viral sublineages and SNPs) and infection outcome, we used Fisher&#8217;s Exact Tests and logistic regression to estimate the OR and 95% CI.<br \/>Results: For HPV45, we determined that sublineages have varying histology-specific precancer\/cancer risk (ORs ranged from 2-14), and that the sublineage distribution significantly varied by race\/ethnicity (p &#60; 0.001). By race, the HPV45 A2 sublineage was most prevalent in Asian\/PI women and was associated with the highest risk of CIN3+ in these women compared to other races\/ethnicities (OR=5.7, 95% CI=1.5-29.4), while the B2 sublineage was associated with increased risk of CIN3+ in Black women only (OR=6.1, 95% CI=1.2-33.6). The prevalence of each HR-HPV type (HPV16\/35\/45\/52) significantly varied by race\/ethnicity (p &#60; 0.001). For each type, White was the most reported race\/ethnicity; however, Black women were a greater proportion of the HPV35+ cases compared to other types (15% vs 8-10%), and Asian\/PIs were a greater proportion of HPV52+ cases (26% vs 10-13%). HPV52 genome analyses are still underway; we will present the complete study results (i.e., sublineage risk by race) at AACR.<br \/>Conclusions: We conducted the largest studies of HPV45 and HPV52 genome variation to date. We demonstrate that specific HPV45 sublineages vary by race and are associated with an increased risk of precancer\/cancer for specific races\/ethnicities, and that HPV52 infection has a greater prevalence in Asian\/PI women compared to other racial groups. Our data suggest that certain HR-HPV types and specific sublineages of these types are more common in specific racial\/ethnic groups and potentially linked to differing risks by race.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Viral genetics,Race\/ethnicity risk associations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Aimee  J.
