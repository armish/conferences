Yet, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the aggressiveness of metastases remain largely unknown. We used experimental metastasis mouse models and samples from patients with breast cancer to study metastases aggressiveness. We discovered that the aggressiveness of cancer cells in lung metastases was driven by an alternative translational program that was regulated by metabolite signaling. Strikingly, the identified molecular mechanism could be disrupted by repurposing a clinical approved inhibitor, which resulted in reduced metastasis formation in mouse models. Thus, this research highlights that dissecting and targeting cancer cell aggressiveness may provide therapeutic options against metastasis formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Metabolism,Breast cancer,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah-Maria Fendt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Moreover, cancer systemically promotes multi-organ dysfunction beyond those associated with PMN induction. We demonstrate that tumor-secreted factors, including chemokines and extracellular vesicles and particles, reach and impact distant organs leading to various complications, such as liver metabolic dysfunction by generating a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-like liver niche or thrombosis through the formation of a pro-thrombotic lung niche. For instance, lung metastatic cancers, such as osteosarcoma and melanoma, form PMNs in the lung while dysregulating liver metabolism, whereas liver metastatic cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, form PMNs in the liver while promoting pro-thrombotic niches in the lung. Thus, to successfully treat cancer patients, we must address the systemic effects of metastatic disease. Therapies for metastatic disease prevention and treatment must target multiple organs and processes, including but not limited to PMN formation, metabolic dysfunction, and thrombosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-10 Premetastatic niche,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Extracellular vesicles,Premetastatic niche,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David C.
