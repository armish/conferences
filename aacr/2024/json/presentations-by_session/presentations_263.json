[{"Abstract":"<i>Background<\/i>: Eradiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been shown to reduce risk of liver cancer among HCV patients; however, there has been spare data on the effect of antiviral treatment on the risk of extrahepatic cancers. Using data from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS), we investigated whether antiviral therapy impacts the risk of extrahepatic cancers among patients with HCV.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: 17,485 HCV patients were included in the study, and they were followed until incidence of cancer including lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), breast cancer or prostate cancer, death, or last follow-up. An extended landmark modeling approach was considered, which included time-varying covariates and propensity score justification for treatment selection bias and used generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a link function as multinominal distribution for a discrete time-to-event data. Death was considered a competing risk.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: Compared to untreated patients, patients with HCV treatment had significantly lower risk of lung cancer for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI, 0.30-0.72) and for interferon-based treatment (IFN) (HR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.20-0.50). The risk of NHL was only reduced among patients receiving DAA treatment. There were no significant associations between HCV treatment and risks of breast and prostate cancer.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: Both DAA and IFN antiviral treatment independently reduce the risk of lung cancer, while the protective association with NHL was limited among HCV patients with DAA treatment. Our findings support the importance of timely initiation antiviral therapy in chronic HCV-infected patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver,Hepatitis C virus,extrahepatic cancer,HCV antiviral treatment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Prevalence of guideline concordant care for mHSPC patients in the US and its changes over time are not well characterized.<br \/>Methods: The International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer (IRONMAN) is a prospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Therapies are captured by site personnel and by directly capturing data from treating physicians via physician questionnaires (PQ). We included all US patients with mHSPC enrolled from 2018 to January 1, 2023 with a completed PQ at enrollment. We examined patient characteristics, first-line treatments for mHSPC, and guideline concordance of first-line treatments. Guideline concordance was defined as a treatment regimen listed in the first National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines version for the year prior to treatment. Patients enrolled in clinical trials were excluded from analysis of treatment guideline concordance.<br \/>Results: Among the 636 US participants with mHSPC, physicians completed PQs for 458 participants (72%). Participants had a median age of 68 years (interquartile range 62 - 75). Three hundred eight (78%) were White, 72 (18%) were Black, 13 (3%) were other races\/ethnicities: 65 did not report race. First-line treatment for mHSPC based on the PQ was most commonly ADT + ARPI (59%) followed by ADT + docetaxel (17%), ADT monotherapy (14%), ADT + first-generation antiandrogen (3%), ADT + ARPI + docetaxel (3%), and other treatments (5%). Overall, 384 (86%) participants received first-line treatment that was guideline concordant at the time of treatment. Treatment guideline concordance was highest in 2018 (99%) when ADT monotherapy was considered as guideline concordant but then decreased to 80% in 2019 and remained largely stable from 2019 to 2022 (85%). Overall, rates of guideline concordance were similar when stratified by race (88% for White patients vs 85% for Black patients), age (90% for patients &#60;65 years old vs 85% for patients &#8805;65 years old), and treatment at a Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) (87% at CCC vs 86% at non-CCC).<br \/>Conclusion: Among patients with mHSPC treated in the US at 38 cancer centers, proportions of guideline concordant first-line treatment were high and remained stable over time, despite changes in approved therapies. Future efforts to understand reasons for treatment decisions will be important to better understand the relatively uncommon situations in which guidelines and actually received treatments differ for patients with mHSPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Incidence rates of PC are higher and cancer is diagnosed at a younger age in Black compared to White men. The most frequently utilized primary treatment options are radical prostatectomy (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy) or radiotherapy. Despite the success of primary treatments for localized PC, many patients (pts) will eventually develop biochemical recurrence (BCR), defined as rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Pts with BCR are at a higher risk of developing distant metastases and ultimately dying from PC. This targeted literature review aimed to assess the real-world (RW) relationship between race\/ethnicity and BCR, and further identify any differences in oncologic outcomes (risk of metastases, PC-specific mortality, and overall survival).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A targeted literature search was performed using Embase, PubMed, and the past 2 years of American Society of Clinical Oncology conference proceedings. Selected studies were limited to English-language articles focusing on BCR and race or ethnicity among US populations, published between 1\/2010 and 7\/2023.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Ten studies were selected after title and abstract review. Most studies had a White pt majority (83%-92%). Six studies reported no differences in BCR or oncologic outcomes when pts were stratified by race\/ethnicity. Four studies reported a higher BCR risk for Black pts with low-risk PC after radical prostatectomy, but not for pts with high-risk PC. PSA and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were found to be strong predictors of oncologic outcomes.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The FDA draft guidance on diversity plans recommends that clinical trials enroll an adequate number of participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. This requires an understanding of the diversity of the population that will eventually use the treatment and of which race\/ethnicity differences in outcomes should be expected and investigated. Based on this targeted review among pts with localized PC, most RW studies had a White pt majority, and the race distribution in these studies aligned with published census and epidemiology data. In addition, findings suggest that race\/ethnicity differences were not pronounced among high-risk PC pts in the US when given equal access to care or treatment, and that oncologic outcomes and BCR risk were similar across Black, White, and Hispanic pt populations. Conversely, PSA and PSADT may be stronger prognostic markers for BCR and oncologic outcomes. Future clinical trials are needed to support these RW findings and should aim to actively enroll racial\/ethnic minorities to identify potential differences in efficacy and safety, and to help advance the evidence base for pt PC management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Recurrence,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Although, several single-arm and some non-comparative randomized clinical trials have now tested the use of diverse dual anti-HER2 therapies in mCRC, no summative analysis have been performed.

Patients with RAS-mutant tumors within each trial were excluded due to known limited benefit of dual HER2 inhibition in this subset. Inverse variance method with random-effects model was used for meta-analysis to determine the overall effect of the therapy on overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAE).<br \/><b><u>Results: <\/u><\/b>Systematic review identified 9 study cohorts which were utilized in the meta-analysis, encompassing a total of 279 patients with mCRC who received Trastuzumab (T) in combination with either Pertuzumab (P), Tucatinib (Tu), Pyrotinib (Py), or Lapatinib (L). Collectively, dual HER2 inhibition showed an ORR of 35.1% (95% CI: 29.4-41.0%), a DCR of 68.3% (95% CI: 62.5-73.9%), and a PFS of 5.2 months (95% CI: 4.4-6.0 months).

Crizotinib and entrectinib received US approval for ROS1+ aNSCLC in March 2016 and August 2019, respectively. Few studies have addressed temporal trends in first-line (1L) utilization since these drugs&#8217; approval. This study describes treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in pts with ROS1+ aNSCLC in the US.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study used the nationwide Flatiron Health (FH) electronic health record-derived de-identified database and included adult pts with ROS1+ aNSCLC who received 1L (index) therapy between March 2015 and December 2022. Pts were followed until March 31, 2023, and had &#8805; 3 months of follow-up post-index date. Treatment-related (sequence, time to treatment discontinuation [TTD], time to next treatment [TTNT]) and clinical (real-world progression-free survival [rwPFS], overall survival [OS]) outcomes of 1L therapy were assessed using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier methods.<br \/>Results: In the FH database, 87,784 pts had aNSCLC, and 242 were ROS1+. The median age was 65 years; most were female (64%), White (67%), non-squamous (91%) and had a history of smoking (52%), with most pts having ECOG performance status 0 (31%) or 1 (35%). 19% had brain metastases prior to or up to 30 days post-index. Median follow-up time was 14.2 months. In 1L treatment, only 59% received ROS1-sensitive TKI monotherapy (i.e. crizotinib, entrectinib, ceritinib), with 97 (40%) and 40 (17%) treated with crizotinib and entrectinib monotherapy, respectively. Median TTD and TTNT for 1L was 6.4 (95% CI: 5.0, 7.6) and 7.6 (95% CI: 6.5, 9.4) months, respectively. Among 1L crizotinib pts, 51% had 2L treatments and 57% of those initiated another ROS1-sensitive TKI (16% entrectinib). Among 1L entrectinib pts, 43% had 2L therapy; of these, 82% initiated another ROS1-sensitive TKI. Median rwPFS was 7.5 (95% CI: 6.2, 9.3) months (1L crizotinib, 8.6 [95% CI: 5.3, 13.0] months; 1L entrectinib, 8.0 [95% CI: 5.3, 13.6] months). Median OS was 29.0 (95% CI: 19.4, 35.9) months (1L crizotinib, 31 [95% CI: 19.4, not estimable [NE]] months; 1L entrectinib, NE). Patients initiated ROS1-sensitive TKIs (crizotinib, entrectinib or ceritinib) in 1L across each year of the study (2015: 67%, 2016: 58%, 2017: 51%, 2018: 47%, 2019: 63%, 2020: 81%, 2021: 52%, 2022: 68%). Overall, 5% received checkpoint-inhibitor (CPI) only, 17% chemotherapy alone, and 7% a chemotherapy\/CPI combination.<br \/>Conclusion: Compared to relevant clinical trials, ROS1+ aNSCLC pts in this real-world study were older, had greater smoking exposure, and worse overall survival. Only 59% of pts initiated 1L ROS1-sensitive TKI monotherapy. These results highlight potential disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC and opportunities for improving clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ROS1,Cancer,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Currently, it isn&#8217;t clear if Hispanics (HI) have a survival difference compared to Non-Hispanics (NH).(PMID 31029647, PMID 25315847). This National Cancer Database (NCDB) analysis aims to clarify how sociodemographic factors affect presentation and survival in HI vs NH patients with MCL.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Data were analyzed on MCL patients in the United States reported to the NCDB 2004-2019. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared between ethnic groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching was performed.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 32515 of MCL patients, 1729 were HI, and 29309 NH. Male gender and identification as white predominated for both. HI were diagnosed at a younger median age of 65 years (y) vs 68 y for NH, p&#60;0.001. Most patients were diagnosed between years 2016-2019. Stage IV predominated for HI and NH, p&#60;0.001. As to Charlson-Deyo Score &#8805;2, HI had 6% vs NH 8%. Government sponsored was the most prevalent primary payer, HI (54%) and NH (60%). HI had a higher percentage of unknown\/uninsured, 13% vs 4% for NH, p&#60;0.001. In relation to census median income (2008-2012), the most prevalent bracket for HI and for NH was &#62;$63,000, 29% and 37% respectively. When analyzing median income of less than $38,000, HI were 22% vs 13% for NH, p&#60;0.001. For median distance in miles (mi) between the patient&#8217;s residence and the hospital that reported the case (Great circle distance), HI lived at a median of 8.2mi, vs NH at median of 11.3mi. Most patients were treated at Academic\/Research programs, 50% for HI and 39% for NH, p&#60;0.001. On survival analysis, the survival probability at 2, 5 and 10 for HI was 74%, 57%, 44%, vs for NH was 72%, 54%, 36%, respectively. The median survival (MS) was 7.0 years for HI, vs 5.8 years for NH, with a statically significant difference in OS favoring HI, p=0.00015. On multivariate analysis, not insured status was independently associated with worse OS (HR 1.29, CI 1.08-1.55, p=0,01). The propensity matched analysis showed significant MS difference between HI vs NH (5.8 y vs. 5.6 y).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In this analysis, MCL is a malignancy that presents at advanced stages, affecting mainly the elderly white males. HI compared to NH have a statically significant benefit in OS, which might be driven by a younger population with less comorbidities. Despite HI having limited access to insurance and lower income; sociodemographic differences don&#8217;t seem to be barriers for HI to access care at academic centers. Newer studies should focus on understanding what genetic and intrinsic disease factors cause HI to have an earlier presentation and a survival advantage over NH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Hispanic,Cancer risk,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Despite this, cure is usually elusive and most patients experience multiple relapses within their lifetime. Previous studies have identified risk factors associated with worse outcomes, but little is known about the role of primary disease site in FL. We sought to investigate the outcomes of patients with extranodal early-stage FL compared to nodal disease using a large national cancer database.<br \/>Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) public database was used to identify and extract data for patients with FL. Early-stage disease was defined as stage I or II by the Ann Arbor staging system. Most patients in the database were diagnosed after 2000 so this was used as the diagnosis year cutoff and also to reflect the impact of recent management strategies on outcomes. Patients were divided into two groups based on their primary disease site. These two groups were nodal (includes spleen) and extranodal. Treatment effect (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) was analyzed when available. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models were used for adjusted survival analyses.<br \/>Results: A total of 13,400 patients with FL of all histologic grades diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 were identified in the SEER database. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (2-100). A majority of patients were Caucasian (81%), had stage I disease (62%), and belonged to the nodal FL group (79%). Median overall survival (OS) for patients with nodal FL was 181 months [95% CI (175-187)]. Median OS for extranodal FL was 189 months [95% CI (179-195)]. Extranodal FL was associated with better OS compared to the nodal group [HR=0.89, 95% CI (0.84-0.96); p-value =0.00012] even after adjusting for age and race [HR=0.84 , 95% CI (0.79-0.90); p-value &#60;0.0001].<br \/>Conclusions: In this analysis of a large national cancer database, early-stage FL presenting as extranodal disease can be seen in about 20% of patients and is associated with slightly better outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Although new treatments have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, less is known about their effect on outcomes in routine clinical practice. We examined outcomes for patients with newly-diagnosed AML (ND-AML) using real world data (RWD).<br \/>Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted using the COTA real-world (rw) database, a de-identified source of longitudinal electronic health record data pertaining to the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of patients with cancer. Adult patients with ND-AML, diagnosed January 1, 2013 to March 20, 2023 were included. First-line treatment regimens were grouped into therapeutic categories and outcomes were summarized. The index date was defined as date of initiation of first-line therapy.<br \/>Results: Among 2516 patients with ND-AML included (Table), the most common regimens used were intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine (IC w\/ara-C), hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (HMA+ven), and HMA alone. Complete response rate was highest in patients treated with IC w\/ara-C or investigational regimen(s). Median overall survival (OS) was 16 mo overall, with highest median OS seen in patients treated with IC w\/ara-C and investigational regimen(s). Median OS for patients treated with HMA+ven was 13.5 mo. Thirty-day mortality was lowest in patients treated with IC w\/ara-C, CPX-351 (liposomal daunorubicin + cytarabine), and HMA+ven.<br \/>Conclusions: Results suggest that IC w\/ara-C remains the standard of care for most patients with ND-AML and this regimen has a higher CR rate and median OS. Variation of patient demographics and clinical characteristics across treatment groups did not permit cross-treatment comparisons, though future analyses evaluating these subgroups may provide further insight into effectiveness and safety of AML regimens in routine care for populations underrepresented in clinical trials.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{E479CB0C-433F-46F4-AD2A-F6ED02A87D27}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">rwCR rate<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median rwOS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30-day mortality<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Months (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% (95% CI)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Overall<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2516<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45.3 (43.2, 47.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.0 (14.9, 17.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.9 (5.0, 6.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">IC w\/ara-C<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1171<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">60.6 (57.8, 63.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36.4 (31.0, 46.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6 (0.9, 2.3)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HMA+ ven<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">300<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.7 (28.3, 39.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.5 (11.4, 15.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (1.1, 4.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Decitabine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">242<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.8 (8.9, 17.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.4 (6.7, 9.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.4 (6.5, 14.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Azacitidine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">206<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.8 (4.5, 12.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.2 (5.3, 9.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.7 (6.4, 14.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Investigational<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">206<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61.6 (54.6, 68.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.3 (15.2, 27.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.4 (0.9, 5.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lower dose cytarabine<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.9 (5.7, 23.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.7 (5.4, 16.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.9 (5.4, 23.4)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CPX-351 based<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">55.7 (42.4, 68.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.3 (7.3, 15.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No treatment<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">188<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.9 (1.5, 2.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30 (22.7, 36.6)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Outcome,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of chemotherapy use in female patients with high risk ODX scores (&#62;25).<br \/>Results: 8017 patients were eligible for ODX testing; of which 5,136 received testing (64%) and 576 patients (7%) had high risk ODX. ODX testing increased over the years (45% of eligible patients in 2015; 79% of eligible patients in 2021). Testing was frequent in larger lesions (74%), poorly differentiated tumors (73%), and younger patients (83% in patients &#60;40 years at diagnosis; 12% in patients &#62; 80 years). Chemotherapy was frequently administered in younger patient, and for larger, poorly differentiated tumors. For patients who possessed a high risk ODX score, chemotherapy administration differed by age. In comparison with the 90% of high risk patients &#60;45 years who received chemotherapy, 58% of patients 60+ years at diagnosis with high risk ODX received chemotherapy. Comorbidity index and chemotherapy administration was not statistically significant (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: Oncologists frequently use ODX testing to guide chemotherapy management. Despite high risk ODX scores, older patients received less chemotherapy compared to their younger counterparts. Further investigation is needed to determine how age impacts clinician decision making and clinical outcomes following ODX testing.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{CA4ED41B-6C07-4AB5-AA9B-CCF88F410EA6}\"><caption>Table 1.

Specifically, uveal melanoma diagnosis and outcomes in the emergency department (ED) has not been characterized.<br \/>Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample was queried from the last quarter of 2015 to 2019 to identify patients with a primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Multivariable logistic regression, with patient- and hospital-level characteristics as covariates, was used to identify factors associated with increased risk of inpatient admission.<br \/>Results: From the last quarter of 2015 to 2019, there were 1,274 ED encounters with a primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Most patients were less than 11 years old (43.4%), male (51.1%), or a Medicaid beneficiary (37.8%), and most belonged to a family in the lowest income quartile (32.0%). The median age of these patients was 35 years (IQR: 2-64). Most patients presented to hospitals in the South (53.9%), with a Trauma Level I designation (51.4%), and most to a metropolitan teaching hospital (89.1%). The most common ED outcomes were same-day discharge (61.6%) and admission to the inpatient setting (31.2%). Patients presenting to Trauma Level I hospitals were most likely to be admitted (odds ratio [OR]=2.21; p=0.031). The factors that were most significantly associated with decreased odds of inpatient admission were: patients who were not charged for services (often due to charity) (OR=0.13; p=0.040), Medicaid beneficiaries (OR=0.27; p=0.031), and private insurance beneficiaries (OR=0.34; p=0.047). Among the admitted patients, patients can be discharged to home with self-care (76.2%) or with home-health care (14.9%) or can be transferred to an intermediate-care facility (8.1%). The mean hospital length of stay was 5.7&#177;0.6 days. In-hospital mortality rate for admitted patients was very low (0.8%).<br \/>Conclusion: Uveal melanoma patient outcomes are closely related to insurance status, indicating socioeconomic factors as a modulator of patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Data on NC are limited mostly to case reports and case series.<br \/>Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched for original articles describing confirmed NC patients. A quantitative individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) analyzing overall survival and risk factors for progression was performed for all NC patients with a clear age at diagnosis. Relevant patient characteristics and clinical parameters were compared in a multivariate Cox regression model.<br \/>Findings: Out of 4,701 studies screened, 175 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. 117 (66.9%) were case reports. 284 patients were included in the IPD-MA. 139 (48.9%) patients were male, 145 (51.1%) underwent surgery, 156 (54.9%) received radiotherapy, and 173 (60.9%) developed metastasis. The mean age at diagnosis was 35.82&#177;18.33 and the median OS was 9 months. 77 (27.1%) patients received platinum-based agents, 39 (13.7%) received taxanes, and 15 (5.3%) received BET inhibitors as part of their first-line regiment. Age at diagnosis, gender, and the aforementioned drugs did not significantly influence OS. Presence of metastasis was an independent predictor of poor survival, while radiotherapy and surgery were significantly associated with better survival (table 1).<br \/>Interpretation: NC is associated with poor survival. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be more effective treatment strategies, while medical modalities may not play a major role in the treatment of NC.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C6063913-144C-42E7-8EDE-997D998E947F}\"><caption>Predictors of overall survival in NUT carcinoma patients.<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Parameter<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Hazard ratio<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">95% confidence interval<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age at diagnosis<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.99<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.99-1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BET inhibitors<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.61<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.28-1.15<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Platinum-based agents<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.73<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.47-1.13<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Taxanes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.78-2.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Surgery<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.41<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.29-0.58<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Female gender<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.12<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.83-1.51<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Metastasis<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.76<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.26-2.49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Radiotherapy<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.36-0.67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic factors,NUT carcinoma,Systematic review,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy (RT) combined with VEGFR-TKIs (such as fruquintinib) and PD-(L) 1 inhibitors in mCRC, and explore optimal sequence of RT with the systemic regimen.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study enrolled eligible patients with MSS\/pMMR mCRC who had received RT in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs (Fruquintinib or Regorafenib) and immunotherapy (IT) between April 2018 and September 2023. Data on treatment response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events were collected.<br \/>Results: A total of 42 pts were analyzed. For Fru + IT + RT (n = 33) and Reg + IT + RT (n = 9), ORR were 21.2% (7\/33) and 11.1% (1\/9); DCR were 81.8% (27\/33) and 88.9% (8\/9), respectively. Median PFS were 6.4 mo and 5.0 mo (P=0.856) while median OS were 17.2 mo and 7.2 mo (P=0.578), respectively. In-depth analysis of Fru + IT + RT treated population, the PFS and OS of 3<sup>rd<\/sup>-line treatment were superior to later (&#8805; 4<sup>th<\/sup>) -line treatment (median: 6.7 vs 4.2 mo, P=0.02) and (median: 17.5 vs 8.9 mo, P=0.27), seemingly. Additionally, RT before initiation of Fru + IT demonstrated superior PFS compared to simultaneous\/sequential RT with Fru + IT (median 7.1 vs 6.1 vs. 3.2 mo, p&#60;0.001). Simultaneously, pts with interval time &#8804;1 month, received numerically benefit compared to interval time &#62;1 month between RT and FRU+IT (mPFS: 6.2 vs. 3.8 mo, P=0.16; mOS: not reached vs. 7.65 mo, P=0.08). Further subgroup analysis revealed that men, age &#8804;56 years, ECOG PS score of 1, primary focal resection, recurrent metastatic disease, liver\/pulmonary metastases, and metastatic involvement of organs &#8805;2, were more favorably treated with Fru for prolonged OS. Intriguingly, the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>-line treatment of Fru exhibited a tendency to prolong OS compared to Reg. Cox multivariate regression analysis suggested that the cycle of Fru\/Reg combined with PD-1 inhibitor treatment was a common independent influencing factor for PFS and OS. Safety was consistent with previous reports, and the incidence of AE appeared to be lower in Fru + IT + RT than in Reg + IT + RT.<br \/>Conclusion: In pts receiving RT of localized lesions, the addition of Fru combined with PD-1 inhibitor could prolong the pts' OS more than Reg plus PD-1 inhibitor. And radiotherapy sequential Fru + IT (interval time &#8804;1 mo) treatment is expected to be the optimal strategy for MSS\/pMMR mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,VEGFR-TKIs,Immunotherapy,treatment schedule,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Many patients either respond poorly or relapse on AIs. A comprehensive view of the underlying genomic landscape of such patients may aid in a better understanding of the resistance mechanisms and the development of new targeted therapies. This study leveraged a real-world clinico-genomic dataset of BC patients to identify key biomarkers and the corresponding high frequency mutations in this relapse\/refractory patient population.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study used ConcertAI&#8217;s Genome360<sup>TM<\/sup> BC dataset (N=3223). A cohort of HR<sup>+<\/sup>\/HER2<sup>-<\/sup> mBC patients who were either refractory to or relapsed on AIs (N=863) were included. To identify key resistance genes\/pathways, only genomic data (from NGS tests) from a biopsy performed after tumor progression on AIs was considered. Prevalence analysis was done only based on known pathogenic\/likely pathogenic variants. Pathway analysis of identified biomarkers with the mechanism of action of AIs was performed to identify and validate key resistance pathways. Further, signatures of unique protein alteration were identified within the biomarkers of interest.<br \/>Results: The median age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 54 years. Adenocarcinoma and Lobular\/Ductal carcinoma were the two most prevalent histologies. 51% of patients in this cohort were treated with AIs in the first line. Table 1 lists the 20 most frequently altered genes observed in this cohort. Genes with a potential role in AI resistance based on pathway analysis are indicated. The most common mutations in selected biomarkers are also provided. These biomarkers were observed at a much lower frequency in patients who responded well to AIs.<br \/>Conclusion: This study provides insights into the genetic basis of resistance to AIs in mBC patients, opening up possibilities for development of new treatments to overcome resistance.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

Among 205 patients who experienced recurrence in the placebo arm, 89.8% of patients received subsequential treatment and 79.0% of patients in the placebo arm received EGFR-TKI after recurrence.<br \/>Methods: This study included patients with completely resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC who confirmed to pathologic stage II-IIIA between November 2015 and February 2019 at Samsung Medical Center (SMC data). They did not receive adjuvant EGFR-TKI. To compare overall survival between the SMC data and the ADAURA study, the individual patient data (IPD) approach was applied. We assessed the overall survival of individual patient data from real-world experience in comparison to the ADAURA study.<br \/>Results: A total of 547 patients were included in this study, with 51.0% at stage IB, 23.8% at stage II, and 25.2% at stage IIIA. The median follow-up duration was 71.4 months (range 1-92). At the time of data lock, 241 patients experienced recurrence in the SMC data. Among them, 230 patients (95.4%) received subsequent treatment, and 214 patients (88.8%) received EGFR-TKI after recurrence. In the stage IB and II, there was no difference of overall survival between the SMC data (reference) and the osimertinib arm of the ADAURA study (HR=0.83, 95% CI, 0.36-1.90, p=0.66 in stage IB; HR=1.08, 95% CI, 0.58-2.03, p=0.81 in stage II). However, in the stage IIIA, the 5-year survival rate was 68% in the SMC data and 85% in the osimertinib arm of the ADAURA study (HR=0.42, 95% CI, 0.24-0.73, p&#60;0.01). In the stage IB-IIIA, the 5-year survival rate was 85% in the SMC data (reference), 78% (HR=1.68, 95% CI, 1.25-2.25, p&#60;0.01) in the placebo arm of the ADAURA study, and 88% (HR=0.81, 95% CI, 0.56-1.16, p=0.24) in the osimertinib arm of the ADAURA study. In the stage II-IIIA, the 5-year survival rate was 77% in the SMC data (reference), 73% (HR=1.29, 95% CI, 0.92-1.82, p=0.14) in the placebo arm of the ADAURA study, and 85% (HR=0.62, 95% CI, 0.41-0.93, p= 0.02) in the osimertinib arm of the ADAURA study.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, the majority of patients received EGFR-TKIs after recurrence. The 5-year overall survival in the real-world data demonstrated superiority over the placebo arm of the ADAURA study. In stage IB and II disease, there was no significant difference between the SMC data and the osimertinib arm of the ADAURA study.

Cox proportional hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of demographic and clinicopathologic factors on overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: A total of 115 patients with confirmed FOLBCL were identified. The median age was 74, with a peak incidence between 72 and 82 years. There was a male preponderance with M:F of 2. The pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities were involved in 75%, 34, and 27%. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 1 month. Patients presented with constitutional symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly in 13% and 1%, respectively&#8212;no patients presented with lymph node and bone marrow involvement. The median OS of the whole group was 16 months. Patients younger than 70 had better median OS than 70 and older (24 vs. 10 months, p=0.008). The presence of any malignant peritoneal effusion was associated with worse OS when compared to effusion limited to the thoracic cavity (7 vs. 24 months, p=0.005). LDH<u>&#62;<\/u>500 was also associated with worse OS (p=0.02). Sex, the presence of fluid overload-causing conditions, and serum IL2R levels did not seem to impact OS. MYC re-arrangement had numerically worse OS when present but did not reach statistical significance. Chemotherapy demonstrated superior OS compared to no treatment (24 vs. 7 months, p=0.009). Patients who attained CR as their best response had a superior median OS (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: This study presents updated clinicopathologic data from a pooled cohort of patients with FOLBCL. It identifies the age, the primary location of cavitary disease, LDH, active therapy, and quality of response to treatment as key determinants of OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Prognostic factors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

However, due to the rarity of the disease, which needs to be better understood, varied treatment approaches have been implemented, and no optimal data or guidelines for managing PBL are available. Therefore, we conducted this study to develop a provisional PBL prognostic score (PBLPS) for this rare disease.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We used our constructed PBL database, which contains retrospective data on 300 cases.
