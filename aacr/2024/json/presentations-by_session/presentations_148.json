Our work demonstrated that stemness glycoproteins on breast cancer stem cells, such as CD44, CD81, and ICAM1 drive CTC aggregation in metastatic breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To determine the glycosylation patterns in CTCs and its association with clinical outcomes, we established multiple CTC analysis approaches including CellSearch, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry using patient blood and tissue sections collected at the pre-treatment baseline and after-therapy timepoints. We found that chemotherapy-evasive CTC clusters are relatively quiescent with a specific loss of terminal sugar residues &#945;2,6-sialic acids in glycoproteins. CTCs showed dynamic hypo-sialylation in the blood with loss of the sialyl-transferase ST6GAL1, promoting CTC cluster formation with cellular quiescence (proliferative dormancy) and evading chemotherapy in breast cancer. Seeded tumor cells regained ST6GAL1 to enable metastatic colonization. Many adhesion proteins and stemness drivers as glycoprotein substrates of ST6GAL1 drive CTC clustering and metastatic seeding. Neutralizing antibodies against these clustering drivers inhibit CTC cluster formation and improve therapy response, thereby blocking lung metastasis in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Cancer stem cells,Therapy resistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiping Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Improved BC patient survival has led to metastatic relapse manifesting in an older patient population. This population carries somatic mosaicism in many organs including bone marrow. Age-specific somatic mutations (e.g., DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in CH, which is associated with increased inflammatory myeloid cells and risk of leukemia and intriguingly with BC-specific mortality. In this presentation I will discuss new data from a team effort to test the hypothesis that CH myeloid cells could shape target organs niches that harbor dormant DCCs to be pro-metastatic. This hypothesis has been explored in clinical trials data where the presence of CH in ER+ and HER2+ metastatic BC patient cohorts (MSK-IMPACT) was associated with the response to first line CDK4\/6i\/endocrine therapy or taxol\/herceptin\/pertuzumab, respectively. We also tested whether CH can accelerate dormant DCC awakening in a murine model of CH carrying mutations in DNMT3A (KO or point mutation) and HER2+ mammary cancer. We propose our work may provide unprecedented insights into how a traceable age-related-mosaicism in the bone marrow (CH) may shape distant organs to be drive metastatic relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Dormancy,Metastasis,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julio A.

Aguirre-Ghiso, PhD is the Rose Falkenstein Chair in Cancer Research, Professor of Cell Biology and Founding Director of the Cancer Dormancy & Tumor Microenvironment Institute at the Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (MECC) in New York City, where he also co-directs the Gruss-Lipper Biophotonics Center and the Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program at the MECC. Dr. Aguirre-Ghiso received his PhD from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1997 and was a Charles H. Revson post-doctoral Fellow at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) until 2003. He became an Assistant Professor at SUNY-Albany the same year and since 2008 he was at ISMMS where he grew through the ranks becoming Professor in 2014 and Endowed Mount Sinai Chair of Cancer Biology in 2020. His research team led a paradigm shift, revealing novel cancer biology that diverges from the notion that cancer is perpetually proliferating. His team discovered that reciprocal crosstalk between disseminated tumor cells and the microenvironment regulates the inter-conversion between dormancy and metastasis initiation. His lab also provided a mechanistic understanding of the process of early dissemination and how it contributes to dormancy and metastatic progression and how adaptive pathways allow cancer cells to persist while quiescent. His work has been published in renowned journals and has been highly cited. He has served and actively advises different scientific and industry entities and scientific journals such as the NIH study sections where he was elected as a permanent member, the Pershing Square Sohn Research Alliance, Cancer Cell and the Metastasis Research Society among others. In 2019 he founded a new company, HiberCell and has enabled clinical approaches that seek to kill dormant cancer cells and\/or induce cancer cell dormancy. He served as President Elect and then President of the Metastasis Research Society from 2018-2022 and has served at several leadership levels at AACR and other organizations.","PresenterDisplayName":"Julio Aguirre-Ghiso, PhD","PresenterKey":"9ca979fb-4e35-44b2-a53e-98034b2a6b7d","PresenterPhoto":"https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/assocphotos\/101\/9ca979fb-4e35-44b2-a53e-98034b2a6b7d.profile.jpg","SearchResultActions":null,"SearchResultBody":"SY34-02.
