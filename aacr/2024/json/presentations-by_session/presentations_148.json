Our work demonstrated that stemness glycoproteins on breast cancer stem cells, such as CD44, CD81, and ICAM1 drive CTC aggregation in metastatic breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To determine the glycosylation patterns in CTCs and its association with clinical outcomes, we established multiple CTC analysis approaches including CellSearch, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry using patient blood and tissue sections collected at the pre-treatment baseline and after-therapy timepoints. We found that chemotherapy-evasive CTC clusters are relatively quiescent with a specific loss of terminal sugar residues &#945;2,6-sialic acids in glycoproteins. CTCs showed dynamic hypo-sialylation in the blood with loss of the sialyl-transferase ST6GAL1, promoting CTC cluster formation with cellular quiescence (proliferative dormancy) and evading chemotherapy in breast cancer. Seeded tumor cells regained ST6GAL1 to enable metastatic colonization. Many adhesion proteins and stemness drivers as glycoprotein substrates of ST6GAL1 drive CTC clustering and metastatic seeding. Neutralizing antibodies against these clustering drivers inhibit CTC cluster formation and improve therapy response, thereby blocking lung metastasis in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Cancer stem cells,Therapy resistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huiping Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Improved BC patient survival has led to metastatic relapse manifesting in an older patient population. This population carries somatic mosaicism in many organs including bone marrow. Age-specific somatic mutations (e.g., DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in CH, which is associated with increased inflammatory myeloid cells and risk of leukemia and intriguingly with BC-specific mortality. In this presentation I will discuss new data from a team effort to test the hypothesis that CH myeloid cells could shape target organs niches that harbor dormant DCCs to be pro-metastatic. This hypothesis has been explored in clinical trials data where the presence of CH in ER+ and HER2+ metastatic BC patient cohorts (MSK-IMPACT) was associated with the response to first line CDK4\/6i\/endocrine therapy or taxol\/herceptin\/pertuzumab, respectively. We also tested whether CH can accelerate dormant DCC awakening in a murine model of CH carrying mutations in DNMT3A (KO or point mutation) and HER2+ mammary cancer. We propose our work may provide unprecedented insights into how a traceable age-related-mosaicism in the bone marrow (CH) may shape distant organs to be drive metastatic relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Dormancy,Metastasis,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julio A.
