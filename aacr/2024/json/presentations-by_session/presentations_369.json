[{"Abstract":"Background:<b> <\/b>Cancer is caused by somatic DNA alterations, such as single nucleotide variants, somatic copy number alterations and structural variants (SVs). PRKN is among the genes most frequently affected by SVs in colorectal cancer (CRC), with 37% of primary cancers and 56% of metastatic lesions having focal deletions in PRKN. PRKN encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which regulates the biological activity and degradation of substrates via post-translational modifications. The genomic location of PRKN is within a common fragile site. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the high frequency of SVs in PRKN are passenger events due to genomic instability or driver events of CRC pathogenesis.<br \/>Aim: Our study aims to investigate the impact of SVs on the functionality of Parkin in CRC pathogenesis.<br \/>Methods: We used publicly available DNA deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) and tumor-matched RNA sequencing data (n=394) to estimate the impact of SVs in PRKN on tumor biology. For this, the transcriptome-wide p-value distribution generated by differential expression analysis was used as a measure of biological impact. The HCT116-MLH1-repaired cell line and patient-derived adenoma organoids were genetically modified using CRISPR\/Cas9 to mimic the SVs observed in patient material and analyze their impact. RNA-sequencing, whole proteome and ubiquitin remnant-specific proteomics were used to assess the effect of SVs on gene function and identify altered biological processes.<br \/>Results: Analysis of WGS and RNA sequencing of patient material showed that SVs in PRKN have a large impact on CRC biology, comparable to the impact of mutations in TP53 (impact score 0.379 vs 0.332). The most pronounced effects are seen in the ubiquitin-like, RING0 and RING1 domains. These domains are important for recognition and\/or binding to ubiquitin, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and substrates. In the HCT116-MLH1-repaired CRC cell line, hemizygous introduction of an SV in PRKN had minimal effects on genome-wide gene expression. In contrast, homozygous deletion altered the expression of nearly 2000 genes. Analyses of ubiquitin motif remnants showed differential ubiquitination of proteins involved in DNA repair following the introduction of an SV in PRKN in the CRC cell line. These proteins include TOP2A (Log<sub>2<\/sub> fold change (L<sub>2<\/sub>FC) = -3.69, P = 5.71<sup>-5<\/sup>), RAD18 (L<sub>2<\/sub>FC = -4.55, P = 1.35<sup>-4<\/sup>) and Spartan (SPRTN; L<sub>2<\/sub>FC = -2.57, P = 7.43<sup>-4<\/sup>).<br \/>Conclusion: SVs in <i>PRKN<\/i> have a high impact on tumor biology and result in aberrant gene expression and post-translational modifications of proteins related to DNA repair. Further research will expand to the patient-derived adenoma organoids and focus on understanding if these recurrent somatic alterations contribute to genomic instability and the development of CRC pathogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,DNA repair,Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Epidemiology studies on primary PCa cohorts in Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (PHS and HPFS) have shown that high levels of whole-genome aneuploidy, featured by imbalanced chromosome numbers, correlate with lethal progression in PCa. However, details of the mechanisms of how aneuploidy drives PCa aggressiveness are still unclear. Here, we used the case of chromosome 8q (chr 8q, the long arm of chr 8) gain to study aneuploidy-associated prostatic malignancies. Chr 8q gains are the most frequent gain events that occur in approximately 23% of PCa cases. By using the PHS and HPFS cohorts, we modeled the increased expression of each gene located on chr 8q, for predicting the risks for lethal progression, and obtained each corresponding gene&#8217;s odds ratio (OR). By ranking the ORs, we revealed that a cholesterol biosynthesis gene, squalene monooxygenase (<i>SQLE)<\/i>, is one of the top associators with lethal progression, amongst all chr 8q genes. SQLE plays a pivotal role in cholesterol synthesis. Previous lymphoma studies have shown that loss of SQLE contributes to cholesterol auxotrophy, and squalene build-up protects against oxidative cell death. In our experimental study, we have used normal and cancerous <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i>-driven organoid models and found that over-expression of SQLE promotes formation of invasive structures and proliferation in cancer organoids. Interestingly, overexpression of SQLE decreased the protein levels of TMPRSS2-ERG, which appeared to be independent of androgen receptor levels. We also utilized the TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP cell line, which harbors gains of <i>SQLE<\/i> gene copies. We found that knocking down SQLE expression significantly upregulated ERG protein levels. Our recent study has shown that ERG (or other ETS) positive prostate cancers have a strong correlation with downregulation of fatty acid metabolism signature. We speculate that gain of SQLE can drive aggressiveness of prostate cancer by modulating lipid metabolism for growth and migration. Inhibition of SQLE could translate to better clinical outcomes regarding prostate cancer lethality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Aneuploidy,Lipid metabolism,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

In B-cell lymphoma, a number of chromosomal translocations are directed by the off-target activity of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; a B-cell specific apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptode-like (APOBEC) family enzyme). However, in solid tumors, no such enzymes capable of directing chromosomal translocations have been identified. Given recent findings on APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in solid cancers, APOBECs may be involved in the formation of chromosomal translocations in solid tumors, like AID does in B cells.

We correlated patterns of translocations induced by A3s with several other cellular features including transcription, DNA accessibility, DNA replication timing, and mutational signatures. We validated the contribution of A3 to the generation of oncogenic translocations in lung cancer.<br \/>Results: Ectopic expression of A3s significantly increased chromosomal translocations in mouse fibroblasts and human epithelial cells. A3s and AID preferentially induced translocations in different parts of the genome, but some of the translocation hotspots were shared among them. Hierarchical clustering of hotspots showed that A3-mediated translocations were distinguished from AID-mediated translocations. Notably, the junction distribution of breakpoint clusters showed three distinct translocation patterns based on the locations of breakpoint clusters: (1) AID-preferred; (2) A3-preferred; and (3) AID\/A3-mixed. AID-mediated translocations were heavily enriched near the transcription start site, whereas A3-mediated translocations were dispersed across the gene body and transcription end site. Furthermore, DNA replication timing and genomic architectures were linked to the formation of A3-mediated chromosomal translocations in solid cancer. Finally, A3 contributed to the formation of oncogenic rearrangements in lung cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: A3 enzymes induced chromosomal translocations with distinct patterns compared to AID and facilitated chromosomal translocation formation in solid cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Translocation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-C.

L1 is a retrotransposon that copies itself through RNA and integrates into new genomic loci. Although L1 sequences comprise approximately 17% of the human genome, only 100-150 L1 loci have retained the ability to retrotranspose. These full-length, retrotransposition-competent L1s are typically repressed in human somatic cells, but there is evidence of their significant reactivation in human cancers. Therefore, L1 overexpression is a hallmark of many human cancers, particularly in highly malignant tumor types such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, head-and-neck, colon, prostate, and liver cancers.<br \/>Results: In many cancers, chromosomal translocations are fundamental pathogenetic events initiated by the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition events have been implicated in chromosomal rearrangements associated with most human cancers, the frequency and mechanisms by which L1 is involved in these rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations, remain poorly characterized. By combining high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) and two sequencing techniques to detect L1 insertion sites (PolyA-seq and CELTICS-seq), we demonstrated that the presence of an active human L1 retrotransposition significantly increases the frequency of chromosomal translocations. By identifying L1-dependent translocation hotspots in HEK293T cells we highlight the requirement for the L1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and the crucial role of pre-existing DNA DSBs in promoting L1-mediated chromosomal translocations. L1-dependent translocation hotspots showed a marked preference for transcription end sites (TES) of active genes, early replication timing regions, and accessible chromatin regions. Therefore, while cancer genome analysis provides a static view of chromosomal rearrangements based on canonical L1 integrations, our functional studies reveal an unanticipated predominance of chromosomal translocations facilitated by non-canonical L1 retrotransposition via RNA-templated repair of existing DSBs, largely expanding our knowledge on the mechanism by which L1 retrotransposition induces genomic instability in human cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Cancer genomics,DNA repair,Fusion genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Translocation detection by karyotyping of an individual&#8217;s metaphase chromosomes remains challenging for detection of balanced rearrangements, which have no gain or loss of genetic material. Rearrangement detection using whole-genome sequencing is a viable alternative, but it relies on breakpoint-spanning reads and requires high sequencing depth (30-60x) with long reads to achieve high sensitivity, especially in repetitive regions of the genome[2]. Here, we describe a workflow for translocation detection at low sequencing depth with Oxford Nanopore&#8217;s long read chromatin conformation capture technique, Pore-C[3]. Importantly, for translocation calling, Pore-C does not rely on breakpoint-spanning reads but rather the high intrachromosomal interaction frequency of genomic regions around the breakpoint, thus largely lowering sequencing depth requirements and reducing mapping issues in low complexity regions. We prepared, barcoded, and sequenced Pore-C libraries of 3 cancer cell lines including lung cancer (A549), Acute Monocytic Leukemia (THP-1), melanoma (COLO 829) and its matching normal (COLO 829 BL) on a single Q20+ MinION flow cell (FLO-MIN114). Genome-wide contact maps of low-pass data (&#60;1.5 Gbps per sample) were compared against higher depth (&#62;30 Gbps per sample) Hi-C maps [4], revealing that low-pass Pore-C successfully captured large-scale genomic rearrangement. For example, chromosomal pairs chr8-chr11 and chr15-chr19 in A549, chr9-chr11 and chr1-chr20 in THP1, and chr7-chr15 in Colo829 were detected at &#60;0.5X depth of sequencing coverage. These translocation events were further validated by breakpoint analysis using adaptive sampling, where targeted regions were previously confirmed by independent studies[4],[5]. Low-pass Pore-C detects translocations in an unbiased manner and does not require prior knowledge of the translocation structure. Combined with its simple sample-preparation workflow and the capability to provide genome-wide copy-number information in a single experiment, it can serve as a cost-effective and comprehensive tool for cancer genomic studies.

Hallmarks of WGD include widespread loss-of-heterozygosity as well as associations with tumor proliferation and specific oncogenic driver events such as loss of function TP53 mutations. It has been proposed that presence of WGD could be a poor prognostic biomarker, leading to interest in profiling this genomic landmark in large retrospective cohorts to inform future clinical studies.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Samples that were run through the GuardantOMNI high content genomic profiling assay using cfDNA extracted from blood were analyzed. Only samples originating from individuals with primary breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer were considered due to limited sample size in other indications. We deployed a likelihood-based copy-number variant caller, which jointly selects tumor purity and ploidy while fitting normalized coverage and germline variant allele frequencies across genome-wide data. Only samples where we predicted to have greater than 10% tumor fraction from copy number variant (CNV) profiles were considered for statistical analysis. The presence of whole genome duplication was assessed by counting the median major chromosomal copy number. Presence of SNV\/InDels were annotated, assessed for pathogenicity, and filtered to those with a pathogenic allele frequency greater than 10%.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> A total of 14,076 samples were analyzed, with 5362 passing the 10% observed tumor fraction cutoff. WGD was annotated in 2195 (41%) samples with varying rates across sub-cohorts (31%, 36%, and 54% of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, respectively). Mutation in TP53 was associated with a large increase in rate of WGD (odds ratio 6.9, 95% CI 6.1-7.8) which is consistent but higher in magnitude to similar studies in tissue samples. Amplification of CCNE1 and homozygous deletion of genes including WRN and RB1 were also associated with WGD, independent of TP53 mutation status and overall rates of aneuploidy.<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> WGD was detected in 41% of samples with greater than 10% tumor fraction in cell-free DNA across three cancer types. While this represents a substantial percentage of advanced cancers, more research needs to be done regarding the impact of these events on clinical outcomes and treatment response. Additionally, co-occurrence of these events with other advanced cancer biomarkers such as microsatellite instability or homologous recombination deficiency was not reported. Given the high rates of these events, future retrospective studies are warranted to correlate presence of WGD with patient outcomes and response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number variation,Aneuploidy,Liquid biopsies,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Among the various subtypes, basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is highly diverse, low differentiated, most aggressive form with poor prognosis. Co-translational R-loops are created by combining G-rich RNA with complementary C-rich DNA (RNA: DNA hybrid), which creates a three-stranded nucleic acid structure. R-loops are often associated with genome instability and aggressiveness of cancers. However, their role in the diversity of BLBC remains controversial and poorly understood. This study aims to characterize RNA: DNA hybrid variations in BLBC from a cellular, genetic, and biochemical perspective.<br \/>Methods: This study investigates the variation of RNA: DNA hybrid formation in stable BLBC cells. We utilize a panel of stable basal-like cell lines (MDAMB231, MDAMB436, SUM149PT) and proliferative non-cancer cells (MCF10A). They represent different genetic and cell lineages in BLBC development which allows us to study R-loop distribution in different basal lineage cells . Luminal breast cancer cells (MCF7) were used in comparative analysis. To detect RNA: DNA hybrids, we optimized Immunofluorescence (IF) specificity using RNase III and H enzymes. Predictions from Quantitative Model of R-loop Forming Sequences (QmRLFS) identify RLFS in specific gene regulatory regions. This design allows us to define R-loop position and boundaries, and optimize primers for the DRIP-qPCR which quantifies RNA: DNA hybrid enrichment in transcription regulatory sites for several breast cancer-associated genes such as BRCA1, TP53, PTEN, and AURKA. The expression of these genes was detected using RTqPCR.<br \/>Results: Our IF and computational image analyses demonstrated that RNA: DNA hybrids are present not only luminal cells (as found by others), but also in the studied BLBC cells. The non-cancer proliferative cells (MCF10A) show low RNA: DNA hybrid signals bolstering our experimental technique. Variation of the RNA: DNA hybrid signals were distinct in various BLBC cells which was supported by the DRIP-qPCR and RTqPCR findings. The R-loop formation data variations was referred to the cell line contexts and the studied genes responsible for tumor suppression, DNA damage\/repair signaling and impair apoptosis in breast cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study suggests that RNA: DNA hybrids are formed and distributed heterogeneously in the genomes and gene regions of stable BLBC cell lines, while in basal proliferative (non-cancer) cells hybrid signals are weak. A subset of the RNA: DNA hybrids might be particularly significant at certain gene loci contributing to tumor progression, indicating their significance in BLBC pathogenesis. This study provides insights into the cellular and molecular basis of the BLBC heterogeneity and implicates the RNA:DNA hybrid as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic markers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Genomic instability,Therapeutic target,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

TC-NER, as its name suggests, is specifically dedicated to rectifying lesions that obstruct the progression of RNA polymerase during active transcription . This process is imperative for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, as lesions encountered by the transcription machinery can lead to stalling, erroneous transcription, and ultimately, deleterious cellular outcomes. At the heart of the TC-NER pathway lies ERCC6, a helicase orchestrating the repair of DNA lesions within transcribed regions of the genome. ERCC6 (AKA CS-B) plays a pivotal role in detecting and coordinating the repair of transcription-blocking lesions and has been implicated in a plethora of cellular processes underscoring its multifaceted nature and its broader impact on genome stability and cellular health, as exemplified by the severity of syndromes in individuals with loss-of-function mutations. In the US, compared to Caucasians (CC), AA are at higher risk for developing PCa and have more aggressive disease that is refractory to treatment, to some extent explained by genetic differences in some cases attributed to alterations of their &#8220;Repairome&#8221;. GWAS revealed that, unlike CC, 89% of AA-PCa have at least one mutation in NER pathway genes. A defect in ERCC6 activity, either through reduced expression or mutation (e.g., M1097V found frequently in AA) may result in impaired TC-NER. This may be compounded by aging or obesity-related oxidative stress, resulting in progressive accumulation of damaged bases (e.g., 8-OG) and consequent (cancer-propensity) mutations, the correction of which involves BER or NER. This was investigated in part with PCa cell lines engineered via CRISPR-SDM to carry that particular genomic mutation, by studying their sensitivity to UV and the efficiency of removal of CPDs in vivo. In addition, we have begun investigation of its function in the variants (engineered and naturally found in PCa. Lines) in vitro, after IP from cells, by studying its intrinsic ATPase activity. We have also identified the kinase NEK1 as an important novel interactor and regulator of ERCC6. We previously identified NEK1 as being an early regulator of the adaptive response of PCa cells to ADT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,TC-NER,DNA repair enzymes,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

CMS classification based on gene expression profiles has been shown to differentiate patients into clinically relevant sub-groups. However, deep multi-omics characterization of the CMS classes based on high quality patient data is lacking. Through the integration of multi-omics data, we aim to enhance our understanding of CRC&#8217;s molecular heterogeneity and thereby facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.<br \/>We performed a multi-omics analysis of CRC patients to identify potential new features of CMS groups. 890 fresh-frozen, surgically resected CRC tumor and adjacent normal samples were used to analyze whole genome and RNA sequencing data. DNA and RNA was prepared using Qiagen AllPrep Universal and KAPA Hyper Prep kit (DNA), as well as TruSeq Stranded Total mRNA kits and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 system. We identified CMS subtypes based on RNA-Seq data and performed all statistical analyses using R.<br \/>Our analysis revealed distinct molecular characteristics across the four CMS subtypes, including unique driver mutations, signaling cascades, and immune cell infiltration profiles. The poor prognosis associated with CMS4 patients was corroborated by our clinical data. Notably, we observed high global chromosomal instability (CIN) profiles for both CMS2 and CMS4 and identified recurrent global aneuploidy patterns within these subtypes that link alterations of known cancer genes to these large-scale structural events. We found higher levels of CIN in CMS2 compared to CMS4, which appears to be predominantly driven by numerical, rather than structural CIN. Specifically, in CMS2, SMAD2\/4 is commonly impacted by deletion on chromosome arm 18q, while PLCG1 is more influenced by amplifications on 20q respectively, suggesting potential values as CRC CMS biomarkers.<br \/>In conclusion, our integrative multi-omics analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of CRC molecular subtypes, which can inform personalized treatment strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of considering not only specific driver mutations but also large-scale structural rearrangements in the context of CMS subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Multiomics,Chromosomal instability,biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Despite recent insights regarding mechanisms mediating stemness, heterogeneity, and metastatic potential, these advances have yet to be fully translated to effective regimens for the treatment of SCLC. Previously, we identified Additional Sex Combs Like-3 (ASXL3) as a novel mediator of pluripotency in human respiratory epithelia and potential therapeutic target in SCLC. ASXL3 is one of three members of the ASXL family, whereas the functions of ASXL1 and ASXL2 as components of the PR-DUB complex have been extensively studied, the functions and significance of ASXL3 during malignant transformation remain elusive. To further investigate the relevance of ASXL3 activation in SCLC, we initially studied ASXL3 expression levels in various SCLC subtypes by qRT-PCR, digital RT-PCR, RNA-seq, and western blotting analysis. These studies demonstrated that ASCL (A) and ASCL and NeuroD1 (A+N) subtypes of SCLC cells contain thousand-folds more ASXL3 (ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup>) than Pou2f3 (P) and YAP1 (Y) SCLC subtypes (ASXL3<sup>low<\/sup>). ASXL3 levels were elevated when cancer cells were cultured under stemness-enriched conditions. Under normal culture conditions, ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells showed higher intrinsic DNA damage, evidenced by a high percentage of &#947;-H2AX positive cells compared to ASXL3<sup>low <\/sup>SCLC cells. Additionally, ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells displayed 38% &#947;-H2AX positive metaphase cells, and 42% of abnormal chromosome segregations during mitosis, including lagging chromosomes, DNA bridges, and unequal chromosome segregation indicative of profound genome instability. One reason for this extensive genomic instability is that ATM pathway activation in response to DNA replication stress is impaired in ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells. Following exposures to 1mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 4, 8, and 24 hours, ATM autophosphorylation levels in ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells were much lower than in ASXL3<sup>low<\/sup> SCLC cells. This insufficiency significantly affected the activation of downstream cascade targets including CHK2, KAP-1 and EZH2. Consistent with these findings, ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells showed reduced sensitivities to ATM inhibitors. However, ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> SCLC cells exhibited higher activity of PLK1 and were more sensitive to hydroxyurea. Importantly, low dose HU reduced the IC50 values of the PLK1 inhibitors, BI2536 or NMS-P937 by 80-100-fold in ASXL3<sup>high<\/sup> but not ASXL3<sup>low<\/sup> SCLC cells, suggesting a strong synergy between these two drugs in ASXL3<sup>high <\/sup>SCLC cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that ASXL3 functions to protect cells from lethality induced by genomic instability through monitoring ATM activation.<b><i> <\/i><\/b>Experiments are underway using SCLC PDX models to demonstrate the efficacy of this combined treatment in-vivo as a prelude to possible evaluation of this drug combination in SCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Lung cancer: small cell,Epigenetics,ATM,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

We previously demonstrated that small-molecule inhibitors targeting Centromere-associated Protein-E (CENP-E) profoundly accumulated CIN in cancer cells, leading to activation of cGAS-STING and its related innate immune pathways. In this study, aiming to deeply understand molecular mechanisms of CENP-E inhibitor (CENP-Ei)-induced CIN and innate immune activation, we conducted large-scale chemical screening with ~1,400 kinase inhibitors in CENP-Ei-treated reporter cells for NF-&#954;B and IRF. We also experimentally validated the effects of hit compounds on CENP-Ei-induced innate immune activation.<br \/>Material and Methods: GSK923295 and Cmpd-A were used as CENP-E inhibitors. HeLa, A549, A549 dual reporter cells were treated with the CENP-Ei at the indicated concentrations, subjected to immunofluorescent, transcriptome, FACS, reporter activity, or gene expression analyses. High-throughput screening (HTS) with ~1,400 kinase library was conducted in A549 dual reporter cells in combinational treatment with GSK923295. Combination effects of the representative hit compounds were confirmed in matrix-combination studies with the CENP-Ei.<br \/>Results: Treatment with the CENP-Ei, Cmpd-A and GSK923295, induced CIN (e.g., multinucleation) in both A549 and A549 dual reporter cells, which elevated NFkB and IRF reporter activities as well as gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in innate immune pathways. Transcriptome analyses also confirmed that gene ontologies (GO) for innate immune response, such as cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, were significantly enriched in CENP-Ei-treated CIN cells. Next, we conducted HTS of IRF-reporter activity with ~1,400 kinase library in combination with GSK923295 in A549 dual reporter cells. The HTS revealed that a series of inhibitors targeting PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways intensively suppressed CENP-Ei-induced IRF activation, which occupied ~40% of hit compounds. The matrix-combination studies confirmed that sapanisertib (TORC1\/2 inhibitor) significantly attenuated CENP-Ei-induced IRF activity.<br \/>Conclusions: CENP-Ei-induced CIN potently activates innate immune response pathways in cancer cells, in which PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway appears to be involved.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of MSI-H tumors, there is still a large proportion of patients with MSI-H tumors who fail to respond to these therapies. Recently, two independent genome-wide loss of function screens have identified Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) as the top dependency for MSI-H cancer cell viability. WRN plays important roles in DNA repair and in the maintenance of genome integrity.

Understanding the broad implications of aneuploidy at molecular, cellular, and physiological levels is crucial for effectively targeting aneuploid cancer cells. Aneuploidy often results in specific stress responses within cells, which must adapt to for survival and growth. Exploring these adaptive mechanisms to aneuploidy open avenues for targeted cancer therapies. Here, we induced aneuploidy in non-transformed RPE1-hTERT cells, generating multiple stable clones each exhibiting varying degrees of chromosomal imbalances. Employing a comprehensive genomic profiling strategy, we analyzed six isogenic clones using whole-exome and RNA sequencing. We uncovered a complex landscape, where each degree of aneuploidy brought its own set of changes and challenges. Additionally, we explored their cellular dependency landscapes, performing genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screenings along with extensive drug screens. As previously reported, we observed and confirmed increased DNA damage and p53 pathway activation in the aneuploid cells. We also found that the aneuploid clones triggered the DNA damage response (DDR), leading to an increased resistance to further DNA damage. Interestingly, we observed that aneuploid cells showed increased activity in the RAF\/MEK\/ERK pathway. Moreover, these cells demonstrated a heightened sensitivity to a range of clinically significant drugs that target this pathway, in particular in response to both genetic and chemical inhibition of CRAF. The activity of CRAF was found to be functionally connected to the resistance against DNA damage induction, and the inhibition of CRAF making aneuploid cells more susceptible to chemotherapies that induce DNA damage. Next, we observed increased of RNA synthesis and degradation in the aneuploid cells, along with heightened activity in both the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and the microRNA-mediated mRNA silencing processes. As a result, aneuploid cells displayed increased sensitivity to the perturbation of several key components of RNA degradation pathways. Furthermore, the dependencies of aneuploid cells on RAF\/MEK\/ERK activity and on intact RNA degradation were confirmed through examining a broad range of human cancer cell lines, emphasizing their significance in human cancer. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive resource of karyotypically stable cells representing a range of aneuploidy states, and they reveal previously unidentified weaknesses in aneuploid cells that may be crucial for therapeutic developments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aneuploidy,DNA damage,High throughput screening,CRAF pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Not properly repaired DNA damage can lead to cell senescence, apoptosis or tumor development. DDR (DNA Damage Repair) is a collection of bioprocesses which cells utilize in order to identify and correct the DNA damage of the genome. The usage of various compounds for targeting DNA damage responses as well as attenuating DNA repair is also an approach for cancer therapy that has been widely studied in recent years. Despite the success of drug discovery of DDR related inhibitor, drug resistance has become an emerging issue of the field. Here we have constructed multiple cancer cell lines which are either DDR gene, such as XRCC1 and FANCD2, knock-out or resistant to certain DDR inhibitors. Together with the corresponding parental cell lines, we have generated a DDR cell panel which covers 11 different cancer types. We have first validated those DDR inhibitor sensitive or resistant cell lines with functional cell proliferation assays. Additionally, RNAseq has been performed for all constructed resistant cell lines. In combination with a thorough bioinformatic analysis using our in-house generated algorithms, we can provide the genetic background information of the resistant cell lines and top features that potentially contribute to the resistance mechanism. The representative data in this study has shown that LINC02709, BDKRB1, and PRKCQ are the top featured genes in A375 Vemurafenib resistant cell. Meanwhile, cell cycle, ECM-receptor interaction, and DNA replication are the most enriched KEGG terms. Lastly, we have validated this cell panel against multiple inhibitors targeting different DDR vital proteins such as ATM, PARP, POLQ etc. The result has shown that our unique DDR cell panel is capable of providing fast and comprehensive evaluation of DDR related inhibitors, thus facilitate faster and more efficient discovery of DDR inhibitors in the cancer therapy field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Cancer cell,Resistance,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Cong Huang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqing Li<sup><\/sup>, Zhengtai Li<sup><\/sup>, Yan Tan<sup><\/sup>, Huawei Pan<sup><\/sup>, Lizhen Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Kejun Mao<sup><\/sup>, Yanyan Qin<sup><\/sup>, Zhida An<sup><\/sup>, Wanxiao Song<sup><\/sup>, Yifan Li<sup><\/sup>, Shuyu Jin<sup><\/sup>, <b>Tiejun Bing<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ICE Bioscience, Inc., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd89a069-41d4-4f74-a723-4c3ce53545fa","ControlNumber":"6046","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Our previous study shows that keratin fusion mutation promotes tumor aggressiveness via enhancing cancer stemness in oral squamous cell carcinoma. It implies proper functions of keratins play a critical role in maintain cell integrity and fate determination. In the present study, keratin fusion mutation functions as a driver to promote genomic instability via centrosome overduplication and trigger the formation of polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC). Interestingly, genes involved in DNA damage repair were found upregulated in keratin fusion expressing cells, an important feature for mitotic slippage during cancer progression. In addition, PACCs caused by keratin fusion render cancer cells insensitive to cisplatin treatment, which coupled with lower levels of &#947;H2AX induction and higher survival rates. Transcriptome analyses revealed enhanced activity for Regulation_of_Actin_Cytoskeleton in the PACCs, leading to increased actin filament network and higher invasiveness. In summary, keratin fusion mutation promote cancer aggressiveness through genomic instability-mediated PACC formation and cytoskeleton remodeling, which lead to enhanced drug resistance and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytoskeleton,Genomic instability,Malignant progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-H.

DSB repair pathway deficiency, often observed in cancer cells, results in translocations and genetic mutations that contribute to genomic instability. The generation of DNA DSBs is the primary mechanism of numerous chemo- and radio-therapeutic strategies used to treat various cancers. Modulating DSB repair pathways can have a profound impact on the clinical efficacy of DNA damaging therapies. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is composed of a DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Ku80-Ku70 heterodimer, acts as the molecular sensor for DSB and plays a prime role in DSB repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). DNA-PK inhibitors become an attractive therapeutic target for cancer in combination with DSB-inducing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There are at least 6-7 DNA-PK inhibitors in the preclinical and clinical stages which exhibit potential as treatment for various cancers. However, we have taken a unique and innovative approach to inhibiting DNA-PK via blocking the Ku70\/80 heterodimer interaction with DNA, an essential step in DNA-PK activation and phosphorylation activity. Exploiting this unique mechanism of kinase activation, we have expanded our structure-activity relationships of pyrrolone derivatives. Modified synthetic schemes have been developed to allow a series of modifications to the X80 core structure. We have prepared furan, thiophene and pyrrole derivatives that enabled the identification of pharmacophores that impact in vitro potency and cellular off-target toxicity. Towards addressing cellular uptake and bioavailability, we identified substituted oxindole derivatives as potent Ku and DNA-PK inhibitors. These oxindole derivatives exhibited a better cellular uptake while retaining potent Ku inhibitory activity. Our data demonstrate that the cellular effects observed are a function of Ku inhibition and that this novel class of DNA-PK inhibitors can be further developed as anti-cancer therapeutics that can be used as an adjuvant to, or concomitant with radiotherapy and other cancer therapies that induce DNA damage.&#8232;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA double-strand break,,DNA damage response,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"D.

These findings define the seminal events in the ALT DNA damage response, linking aberrant lagging strand DNA replication with a BLM directed HDR mechanism that sustains telomere length in a subset of human cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,DNA damage response,Alternative lengthening of telomeres,Telomeres,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Yet, most CGR detected in osteosarcoma remain unexplained, hinting at the possibility of undiscovered mechanisms that might lead to novel therapeutic strategies. To elucidate the mechanisms underpinning cancer genome complexity in osteosarcomas and the downstream consequences of CGR during tumor evolution, we uniformly processed exiting osteosarcoma WGS data sets and performed high-depth (&#62;120x) multi-regional short- and long-read WGS for hundreds of osteosarcomas. We found that whole genome doubling and diverse types of CGR are frequent clonal events in most osteosarcomas. Through the integration of multi-regional WGS data, we discovered that in tumors with whole-genome doubling, cancer genome evolution and oncogene amplification are the consequence of multi-generational CGR triggered by whole-genome doubling and involving multiple mechanisms, especially chromothripsis and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. By contrast, in tumors without whole-genome doubling, biallelic inactivation of TP53 and oncogene amplification frequently occur as part of a cascade of genomic instability initiated by a single double-strand break upstream of the TP53 locus. This process results in clonal diversification and rapid tumor growth suggestive of punctuated evolution. In addition, we found that subclonal CGRs are also frequent events. Indeed, clonal expansions triggered by the acquisition of subclonal CGR often colonize distant tumor regions, suggesting that CGR act as subclonal driver events. Finally, we show that some recurrent genomic alterations are prognostic of poor survival, which we validate in independent cohorts.<br \/>In sum, using WGS data, we have elucidated the mechanisms underpinning the complexity and evolution of osteosarcoma genomes. Our results indicate that diverse types of CGR, such as chromothripsis, are triggered by whole genome doubling and occur throughout tumor evolution, which primes the cancer genome for ongoing genomic instability, rapid karyotype evolution and clonal diversification. These results have implications for our understanding of the molecular basis of intra-tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in osteosarcomas and other cancers driven by genomic instability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Chromosomal instability,Genomics,Genetic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

To address these challenges, we have developed SYX1097, a selective and potent oral Pol&#952; inhibitor as a single agent or in combination with PARPi for treating tumors with BRCA mutations. Both Pol&#952; and PARP1 play key roles in microhomology-mediated end joining for DNA double-strand repair and in single-strand DNA gap filling during DNA replication.<br \/>Using in vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal models, we show that SYX1097 alone or combined with PARPi without obvious side effects. SYX1097 dramatically inhibited proliferation in BRCA -\/- isogenic cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>&#60;20 nM, while only had very weak effect on their parental cells (&#62;10000nM). SYX1097 also enhanced tumor cell sensitivity to Olaparib 5 to 15 times. SYX1097 <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacious started at 50mg\/kg mono-therapy, and generate &#62;50% tumor regression at 5mg\/kg when combined with Olaparib. In a 20-day repeated dosing study, SYX1097 200mg\/kg BID was fully tolerated by mice. When considering additive hematological toxicity, comparing with &#8220;ATRi + PARPi&#8221;, &#8220;SYX1097 + PARPi&#8221; manifested deep and durable tumor regression without significant body weight loss or reticulocytes decrease. Moreover, SYX1097 is found synthetic lethal with defect of genes <b>not<\/b> involved in homologous recombination repair and able to suppress tumors with specific gene defect in vivo, which indicated SYX1097 can be used as single agent guided by specific biomarker.<b><\/b>SYX1097 has a clean safety profile tested with Safety-Screen 44<sup>TM<\/sup> Panel, and is well tolerated in mice, rats and dogs. It possesses remarkable pharmacokinetic properties in various species, with no hematological toxicity observed during the preclinical toxicity studies. SYX1097 is advancing towards IND filing in 2024.Collectively, SYX1097 is a promising small molecule that may be utilized as a single agent or in combination with PARPi for cancer treatment not only limited by HR deficiency.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA polymerase,PARP inhibitors,DNA repair inhibition,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.
