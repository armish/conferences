[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) for which median survival remains 14-18 months despite aggressive standard of care. Early clinical studies of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination for the adjuvant treatment of GBM previously suggested mild to moderate clinical benefit, but results were both inconsistent and inconclusive. Homologous antigenic loading is an ex vivo technique that leverages p38MAPK and mTORC1 signaling cascades to initiate powerful cDC1-like skewing in monocyte-derived DC, leading to downstream induction of CD161<sup>int<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytolytic memory effectors. Here we report ongoing results of a completed phase I clinical trial with minimal exclusion criteria in which dendritic cell vaccines were prepared through homologous antigenic loading and administered to newly-diagnosed patients bilaterally in the vicinity of the deep cervical lymph nodes, assisted by ultrasound sonography. Patients were additionally adjuvanted with six weeks of concurrent type I interferon. Four dose levels from 3.5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> to 3.6 x 10<sup>7<\/sup> total vaccine cells were tested, none of which resulted in AEs &#62; grade 2 attributable to the investigational regimen. Immunohistochemistry of tumors derived from early post-vaccination second resections displayed enhanced CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell infiltration and pathologic findings consistent with residual rather than relapsed GBM in 2\/3 patients. Radiologic pseudoprogression was also routinely observed among patients of all cohorts. Analysis of post-vaccination circulating PBMC indicated expansion of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> central memory T-cell compartments (p&#60;0.05 for each by student&#8217;s two-tailed t-test) as well as expansion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD127<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells (p&#60;0.05 by student&#8217;s two tailed t-test) in 4\/4 patients analyzed. With an average of 10.9 months follow-up, median survival of this largely MGMT promoter unmethylated cohort was not yet reached and was statistically greater (p&#60;0.05 by log-rank[Mantle-Cox]) than that of matched historical controls. At the time of submission, 13\/15 trial patients remained alive with ECOG &#60;\/= 2. The results suggest that modern dendritic cell vaccines are safe, potentially efficacious, and can be effectively integrated within existing standards of care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Cancer vaccine,Dendritic cells,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

BLZ945 is a small molecule, highly selective, orally bioavailable, potent kinase inhibitor of CSF-1R that has shown the ability to reduce the recruitment of TAMs in animal models and promote infiltration of effector T cells into the tumor in preclinical models. Given the potential effects of BLZ945 on effector T-cell activity, a combination of BLZ945 with the programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor spartalizumab was investigated in 1) a dose escalation phase I clinical trial with advanced solid tumor patients; and 2) an expansion phase II clinical trial in adult patients with relapsed\/refractory glioblastoma (GBM) after standard of care and other lines of therapy (NCT02829723). The percentages of non-classical and intermediate monocytes in the PBMC fraction were decreased after treatment at multiple doses and schedules of treatment tested in the escalation phase. Screening and on-treatment paired tumor biopsy samples from the escalation phase were analyzed by RNA sequencing. Downregulated genes have been noted as macrophage-specific genes, suggesting that treatment with BLZ945 is downregulating macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. There appeared to be a trend for a reduction in TAM gene signatures and increase in T-cell inflammation signatures upon treatment with single-agent BLZ945 or BLZ945 + spartalizumab. RNA-sequencing analysis from archival surgical resection GBM samples from the expansion phase, revealed a potential correlation between PDGFRA gene expression and best percent change in tumor size. This suggests that non-mesenchymal GBM, for which PDGFRA is part of the defining signature, are more sensitive to the treatment. DNA-sequencing of these archival samples also revealed mutations in p53 in the tumors with partial responses but no mutations in EGFR or TERT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Macrophages,Biomarkers,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Carlos Rodrigo Gil Del Alcazar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Virginia Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chia-chi Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Marta Gil-Martin<sup>3<\/sup>, Liqiong Fan<sup>1<\/sup>, Fang Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, David Quinn<sup>1<\/sup>, Jincheng Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Cornelia Quadt<sup>4<\/sup>, Jennifer Mataraza<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Novartis Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Catalan Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Novartis Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5fadef58-74b1-4944-9e48-538ce0d717b4","ControlNumber":"9540","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

The targeting antibody, huMNC2, only recognizes the conformational epitope created when MUC1 is cleaved by specific tumor-associated enzymes that are correlated with poor prognosis. huMNC2 does not bind to full-length MUC1, which is expressed on all normal epithelial cells. huMNC2-scFv was incorporated into huMNC2-CAR44, comprising a CD8 hinge and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory domain and wild-type CD3z. huMNC2-scFv was also incorporated into huMNC2-CAR22 wherein the hinge, transmembrane and co-stimulatory portions were derived from CD28 and CD3z bears the 1XX mutations to increase in vivo persistence. Inclusion criteria require that the patient&#8217;s tumor is at least 30% MUC1* positive and that patient has progressed through 2 or 3 prior therapies, while in the metastatic setting. Patients receive standard Cy\/Flu lymphodepletion approximately 3-days before CAR T treatment, administered at 1 of 4 dose levels ranging from 3.3X10^5 up to 1.0X10^7 CAR+ T cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>To date, 8 patients have been treated with huMNC2-CAR44. No patients experienced neuro toxicities. No off-target toxicities were observed. 3 patients experienced CRS Grade 1-3. In 6 of the 8 patients, side effects were non-existent or minimal. However, one patient experienced a Grade 5 SAE that was deemed to be possibly related to the treatment. Best responses include Partial Responses and Stable Disease at a low CAR-T dose. Greatest efficacy was observed for patients whose biopsy showed H Scores &#62;120. Patients are currently being enrolled for treatment with huMNC2-CAR22, where the 1XX mutations are expected to increase in vivo persistence, durability of response and reduced incidence of CRS.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These data support a conclusion that the MUC1* antibody, huMNC2, is safe and could have high therapeutic value as a CAR T treatment for solid tumors with moderate to high antigen density. As the huMNC2-CAR22 (1XX) trial proceeds, we will assess if patient responses mirror our animal results that show that the 1XX mutations confer increased persistence, reduced exhaustion and the ability to kill tumors with low antigen density.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,MUC1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In preclinical studies, GQ1005 demonstrated comparable antitumor activity compared to Enhertu in multiple tumor cell line xenograft models with no noticeable toxicity, indicating higher therapeutic index. GLP toxicity studies demonstrated that GQ1005 was well tolerated, with the highest non-severe toxic dose determined to be 60mg\/kg. This report presents the preliminary findings of an ongoing phase I study, which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of GQ1005 in patients with advanced solid tumors expressing HER2 or harboring HER2 mutations.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: GQ1005 was administrated intravenously every 3 weeks. An accelerated titration design was employed for the initial 2mg\/kg dose, followed by Bayesian Optimal Interval Design for subsequent dose levels of 4, 6, 7.2, and 8.4 mg\/kg. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and to determine the MTD or RP2D.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: As of Oct. 13<sup>th<\/sup>, 2023, 46 (30 in dose-escalation and 16 in dose-expansion phase) subjects with HER2-expressing\/mutated advanced solid tumors, predominantly in breast cancer (18), and lung cancer (18) , were enrolled into the study. Patients received a median of 3 (range, 1-11) prior lines of treatment, and 86.4% of pts previously received anti-HER2 therapies before. During dose escalation, No DLT was observed in all doses, MTD was not reached up to 8.4 mg\/kg. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 44 (95.7%) subjects. The most common TRAEs were grade 1 or 2, including nausea (52.2%), vomiting (39.2%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (39.1%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (23.9%), anemia (23.9%), anorexia (21.7%), fatigue (19.6%), leukopenia (15.2%), infusion-related reactions (15.2%) , decreased lymphocyte count (15.2%) and dizziness (15.2%). Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs only occurred in 4 subjects (8.7%), including anemia, decreased lymphocyte count and &#947;-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased. Interstitial lung disease was observed in 6 pts received highest dose level and most of them have recovered. No drug-related deaths. The pharmacokinetics analysis showed the concentration of GQ1005 and TAb generally peaked rapidly and declined in a roughly biphasic manner. Among 38 evaluable subjects, 1 pt achieved complete response, 18 cases achieved confirmed partial response, and 11 had stable disease, the objective response rate was 50% (19\/38), the disease control rate was 78.9% (30\/38) , and the 6-month PFS rate was 43.0% in all patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> GQ1005 demonstrated a promising antitumor activity in HER2-expressing\/mutated advanced solid tumors patients previously heavily treated, and showed a good tolerance and manageable safety profile.

Here we report data from the combination part of the study.<br \/>METHODS: Eligible patients (pts) with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors were enrolled into escalating dose cohorts of 200-1800 mg NGM707 combined with 200 mg pembrolizumab, administered Q3W iv. Assessment of safety and tolerability and recommended expansion doses for NGM707 in combination with pembrolizumab were the primary objectives of the study. Secondary and exploratory objectives included assessment of pharmacokinetics\/receptor occupancy (RO), immunogenicity, biomarkers, and preliminary antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1.<br \/>RESULTS: As of 06 Nov 2023, 46 pts have been enrolled in the combination escalation at dose levels up to 1800 mg; 5 pts crossed over from monotherapy. Median age 58.5 yrs [28-81]; ECOG PS 0 (19.6%), 1 (80.4%). Pts had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range 1-6) and all pts had metastatic disease. Overall, 20\/45 pts had prior exposure to anti-PD1\/anti-PD-L1. Treatment-related adverse events (any grade\/grade &#8805;3) occurred in 41.3%\/4.4% of pts. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (17.4%), diarrhea (6.5%), myalgia (4.3%), arthralgia (4.3%), and nausea (4.3%). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the maximum administered dose was 1800 mg NGM707 in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab. Peripheral immune cells showed dose-dependent RO, with doses &#8805; 200 mg maintaining ILT2 and ILT4 RO for the entire dosing interval. PK of NGM707 was typical for monoclonal antibodies, with a half-life of 12.8 days. Gene expression changes associated with myeloid cell and T cell activation were observed in tumor biopsies post-treatment. Of 37 response-evaluable pts, best overall responses to date are PR (confirmed) in 4 pts, SD in 12 pts, representing a DCR of ~43%. Nine pts had reduced target lesion (TL) size with a maximum reduction of 100%. Out of the 4 patients who had PR, 3 patients were pre-treated with anti-PD1\/anti-PD-L1. Two subjects with MSS CRC achieved confirmed PR, one of them with TL reduction that allowed subsequent surgical resection of all gross residual disease and confirmed pathological CR with no active tumor cells and ctDNA below detection.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS<b>:<\/b> NGM707 in combination with pembrolizumab appears to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels. In this advanced and metastatic solid tumor cohort, early efficacy signals have been observed. Preliminary evidence of myeloid cell reprogramming was observed in paired tumor biopsies.

AZD8853 is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes GDF15. This Phase 1\/2a, open-label study assessed AZD8853 monotherapy in previously treated advanced\/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC) (NCT05397171).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Eligible pts were &#8805;18 years old with &#8805;1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG PS 0\/1. AZD8853 was given IV Q3W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. The primary objective was safety including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD [free serum GDF15]). Exploratory objectives included peripheral immune PD.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> During dose escalation,<b> <\/b>16 pts (15 MSS-CRC, 1 UC) received AZD8853 (300 mg, n=3; 1000 mg, n=6; 3000 mg, n=7). By June 6, 2023, all pts discontinued treatment and the study. Thirteen pts (81.3%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; Table); the most common were diarrhea (31.3%), abdominal pain (31.3%) and decreased appetite (25%). Eight pts (50%) had Grade &#8805;3 TEAEs and 6 (37.5%) had serious TEAEs; none treatment-related. There were no DLTs. No pts had responses by RECIST; 5 (31.3%) had stable disease and 11 (68.8%) had disease progression as best response. AZD8853 PK was linear with a half-life of 5-10 days, supporting Q3W dosing. GDF15 suppression was transient. There was no evidence of ctDNA clearance or a dose-dependent change in peripheral immune cells including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, DCs and MDSCs.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>AZD8853 was well tolerated.

RXC004 is a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of protein-serine O-palmitoyltransferase (PORCN), which is required for the post-translational modification and activation of Wnt ligands. RXC004 has potential for efficacy in upstream Wnt pathway activated tumours: ~5% pancreatic cancer and ~8% microsatellite stable colorectal (CRC) cancer with RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions, and tumors with high Wnt ligand expression.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b><br \/>In this Phase I study of RXC004 (NCT03447470), Module 1 investigated continuous monotherapy dosing, Module 2 investigated combination with nivolumab 480mg s.c. Q4W and Module 3 investigated intermittent monotherapy dosing (2 weeks on 1 week off). Patients received denosumab 120 mg s.c Q4W to prevent loss of bone mineral density (BMD), a known effect of Wnt inhibition. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were PK and RECIST response. PD markers included on-treatment changes in: Wnt pathway and fibrosis biomarkers in paired skin biopsies; circulating immune subsets by flow cytometry; cytokine changes by Luminex, and changes in circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels by ddPCR.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> In Module 1, 25 patients (pts) with unselected advanced solid tumors (AST) received RXC004 between 0.5mg and 10mg QD. The RP2D was 2mg QD; at this dose the most common AEs were fatigue, diarrhoea, dysgeusia and decreased appetite; no grade 4\/5 AEs or bone fragility events were reported whilst 1 pt had a RXC004-related grade 3 AE, 3 pts (50%) had a dose interruption and 1 had a dose reduction. The median T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>of RXC004 was 14.5h. 5 pts with upstream Wnt pathway activated tumors had stable disease (SD), in 1 case for 26 weeks with sustained reduction in ctDNA and no BMD loss. In Module 2, 14 patients with unselected AST received RXC004 at 1mg QD or 1.5mg QD with nivolumab. The AE profile was similar to Module 1. The RP2D was 1.5mg QD; at this dose 3 pts had a RXC004-related grade 3 AE, 6 pts (75%) had a dose interruption and 3 had a dose reduction, and 4 pts had SD. PK was similar to Module 1. In Module 3, 7 patients with upstream Wnt-activated AST received RXC004 2mg QD, 2 weeks on, 1 week off. The AE profile was similar to Modules 1 and 2. There were no RXC004-related Grade 3 AEs, 2 pts (29%) had a dose interruption and there were no dose reductions. PK and PD analyses confirmed time off target. 2 pts had SD; 1 pt with RSPO fusion small intestinal adenocarcinoma remained on treatment for 36 weeks, with sustained reduction in ctDNA and no BMD loss.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> In patients with AST, RXC004 was safe and tolerated at doses up to 2mg QD as monotherapy and 1.5mg QD in combination with nivolumab, demonstrating differential disease control in upstream Wnt pathway activated tumours. Denosumab prevented loss of BMD. Intermittent RXC004 dosing was well tolerated with no detrimental impact on efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt pathway,Small molecule drugs,Phase I,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Natalie Cook<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Blagden<sup>2<\/sup>, Juanita Lopez<sup>3<\/sup>, Debashis Sarker<sup>4<\/sup>, Alastair Greystoke<sup>5<\/sup>, Noor MD Haris<sup>5<\/sup>, Farasat Kazmi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kaiser Anam<sup>4<\/sup>, Ana Ortego Franco<sup>1<\/sup>, Rille Pihlak<sup>1<\/sup>, Louise Goodwin<sup>6<\/sup>, David Wilson<sup>6<\/sup>, Caroline Phillips<sup>6<\/sup>, Jane Robertson<sup>6<\/sup>, Helen Timmis<sup>6<\/sup>, Craig Tilston<sup>6<\/sup>, <b>Simon A.

HFS is caused by 5-FU catabolites while myelosuppression is caused by 5-FU anabolites. NGC-Cap combines ethynyl-uracil (PCS6422), an irreversible inhibitor of the DPD catabolism enzyme, and Cape.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The Phase 1b trial is a 3+3 design with up to 5 ascending Cape doses from 75 mg qd to 300 mg bid. Cape is given 7 days on\/7 days off every 14 days with a single dose of PCS6422 given 16-24 hours before the start of every cycle. The 5-FU AUC(0-9 hrs), Cmax, and T1\/2 were calculated on Day 1 when DPD inhibition is at its maximum. New cohorts are opened following a review of the safety data by a cohort review committee after the second cycle. Blood samples are obtained for PK analysis of PCS6422, Cape, and Cape metabolites (e.g., 5-FU, FBAL). All patients have cancer refractory or intolerant to existing available therapies. Radiological tumor response evaluation (RECIST 1.1) is performed every 8 weeks.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 18 patients were enrolled in the first 4 dose levels of Cape in NGC-Cap. The 5-FU AUC (geometric mean, CV%) for the 150 and 225 mg bid NGC-Cap cohorts were 3,802 (23%) and 6,311 (37%) ng-hr\/ml, respectively. These AUCs were approximately 5-10 times the AUC(0-inf) of 698 (33%) previously reported for a larger dose of approximately 2,250 mg of monotherapy Cape (Mono-Cape) (Reigner 1998). Similarly, the 5-FU Cmaxs (geometric mean, CV%) for these 2 cohorts were greater at 694 (22%) and 1,056 (28%) ng\/ml than the Cmax of Mono-Cape at 310 (50%). The 5-FU T1\/2 (arithmetic mean, CV%) of 3.54 (18%) and 5.72 (51%) hrs for these two NGC-Cap cohorts were also much longer than the 0.84 (25%) hrs for Mono-Cape. Although 150 and 225 bid NGC-Cap cohorts produced greater Cmax and AUC levels than Mono-Cape, the side effect profile from anabolites for the 150 cohort was better than Mono-Cape while the profile for the 225 cohort was similar to Mono-Cape. The extremely low FBAL catabolite formation and exposure (AUC of &#60; 250 vs 31,400 for Mono-Cape) across all NGC-Cap doses also resulted in only 1 patient having Grade 1 HFS.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The Phase 1b trial has already revealed some of the potential benefits of NGC-Cap over Mono-Cap. 1.NGC-Cap can provide a greater 5-FU exposure based on AUC and Cmax with a better or similar side effect profile.2.Side effects from the 5-FU catabolites are minimal and less severe for NGC-Cap.3.Side effects from 5-FU anabolites are dependent on 5-FU exposure with less exposure leading to fewer side effects that may also be less severe.4.NGC-Cap is to be further evaluated in a Phase 2 trial with the expectation that NGC-Cap will provide a better efficacy and safety profile than Cape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"5-Fluorouracil,Breast cancer,Capecitabine,Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

These can form higher-order G-quadruplex arrangements under the influence of an appropriate and selective small molecule compound. The resulting ligand-G-quadruplex complex may be resistant to polymerase read-through and thus results in transcriptional down-regulation of target genes.<br \/>QN-302, based on a tetra-substituted naphthalene diimide chemotype, is a potent and selective G-quadruplex-binding compound that has been designed and initially developed at University College London. It displays single-digit cell growth inhibition in a panel of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. RNA-seq analysis shows that it is a pan-quadruplex agent, down-regulating the expression of multiple G-quadruplex-promoter cancer genes and pathways in PDAC. It also shows <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity in several animal models for PDAC, with low toxicity observed at therapeutic doses. QN-302 was licensed to Qualigen Therapeutics Inc in January 2022. It was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA in December 2022 for PDAC. This was followed by extensive regulatory toxicological and pharmacological studies together with successful scale-up synthesis, purification and formulation. QN-302 was granted IND clearance in August 2023 by the FDA for phase 1 clinical trials in advanced or metastatic solid tumors.<br \/>This Phase 1a clinical trial is being conducted in two USA cancer centers (START Midwest, Grand Rapids, MI and Honor Health, Scottsdale, AZ) using a protocol based on 28-day once-weekly dose escalation and evaluation of three potential biomarkers, two of which have been suggested by transcriptomic analysis as being indicative of G-quadruplex-induced drug response and accompanying decrease of anti-tumor activity.<br \/>So far 1 Cohort (3 patients) has been dosed at the lowest dose of 1.62 mg of QN-302 as part of this Phase 1a clinical trial. Patient #1, a male patient of metastatic pancreatic cancer, is currently in Cycle 4 of therapy showing Stable Disease and no AEs or SAEs reported. Patient #2, a female patient of metastatic colorectal cancer, completed Cycle 2 after which she showed progression upon CT Scan before entering Cycle 3 and was taken off study. Patient #3, a male patient of metastatic PDAC, is currently ending Cycle 2, about to enter Cycle 3, showing Stable Disease upon CT scan. All patients dosed showed no AEs, SAEs or side effects. They were also clinically observed to have improved QOL compared to prior SOC while on therapy with QN-302,<br \/>This presentation will outline this unique approach and summarize safety, tolerability, PK\/PD data and any early clinical data as described above including preliminary biomarker data now that clinical evaluation has commenced. The advantages and challenges of QN-302 will also be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Phase I,Colorectal,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Tariq Arshad<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Neidle<sup>2<\/sup>, Sreenivasa Chandana<sup>3<\/sup>, Erkut Borazanci<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Qualigen Therapeutics, San Ramon, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>University College of London, London, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>START MidWest, Grand Rapids, MI,<sup>4<\/sup>Honor Health, Scottsdale, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"055d754e-3c24-44d6-adec-f034524a34c1","ControlNumber":"10700","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

PTM-101 is a novel biodegradable film containing paclitaxel and is designed to continuously release high concentrations of paclitaxel precisely to the site of a pancreatic tumor over one month.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>This first in human study was conducted at one center in Australia to assess the safety, toxicity, and surgical feasibility of a single administration of PTM-101 containing 100 mg of paclitaxel. PTM-101 was sutured directly onto the pancreatic surface overlying the tumor by a surgical oncologist using standard laparoscopic equipment during a disease-staging assessment. Approximately 3 weeks after PTM-101 placement, all participants began standard of care therapy which included mFOLFIRINOX. This study enrolled 3 subjects that had treatment na&#239;ve, borderline resectable or locally advanced, pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects were monitored closely for local and systemic toxicities, as well as for preliminary signals of efficacy. An independent central imaging lab reviewed CT scans to determine changes in tumor volume.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>PTM-101 was successfully implanted over the tumor site in all three subjects. In all cases, there were no adverse events reported during the procedure. Overall, PTM-101 was well tolerated with a total of five Grade 1 adverse events judged at least possibly related to the procedure or the mFOLFIRINOX. No serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths occurred. Paclitaxel was undetectable in the circulation at all time points. Subjects were followed for 6 months. Best overall response rate according to RECIST was stable disease (2 subjects) and partial response (1 subject). An independent analysis showed that all tumors had a reduction in size in the anterior\/posterior diameter, which was consistent with unidirectional paclitaxel release from PTM-101. Two of the 3 subjects had a &#62;30% tumor volume reduction, importantly, with the initial decrease in tumor size detected prior to mFOLFIRINOX.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>PTM-101 was readily implanted during diagnostic laparoscopy and was well tolerated with no SAEs or deaths reported during 6 months of follow up. This study demonstrated that a PTM-101 implant was surgically feasible, safe, resulted in no systemic paclitaxel exposure, and caused a tumor size reduction in all 3 subjects. Additional studies may demonstrate the potential for PTM-101 to be a first-line adjunct prior to neoadjuvant therapy in treatment na&#239;ve, borderline resectable or locally advanced, pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Paclitaxel,Targeted drug delivery,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Charles Pilgrim<sup>1<\/sup>, Marty Smith<sup>2<\/sup>, Ee-Jun Ban<sup>2<\/sup>, Samantha Ellis<sup>2<\/sup>, John Zalcberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Markman<sup>2<\/sup>, Margaret Lashof-Sullivan<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Laura Indolfi<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia,<sup>2<\/sup>The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia,<sup>3<\/sup>PanTher Therapeutics, Austin, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3c1853fa-71e8-4a21-b3ce-94f7718ee6bb","ControlNumber":"9505","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Kirsten rat sarcoma driver mutations (mKRAS) are prevalent in CRC (52%) and PDAC (93%), making them attractive targets for immunotherapy where therapeutic options are otherwise limited. ELI-002 2P immunotherapy enhances lymph node delivery and immune responses using Amphiphile (Amph) modification of vaccine components. 84% of patients (21\/25) induced mKRAS-specific T-cells post-vaccination as assessed by direct ex vivo Fluorospot and\/or ICS assays with an average 58-fold increase from baseline. A balanced CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell response was observed in 59% of patients. Reductions in ctDNA or serum tumor biomarker antigen from baseline were observed in 84% of patients (21\/25) and 24% (6\/25) had complete biomarker clearance. The induction of strong mKRAS T cell responses correlated with reductions in tumor biomarker response\/clearance and relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><b><\/b> ELI-002-001 is a first-in-human Phase 1 trial (NCT04853017) of ELI-002 2P cancer vaccine as adjuvant treatment for patients with high relapse-risk mKRAS<sup>+<\/sup> PDAC and CRC. ELI-002 2P consists of 2 Amph-modified mKRAS peptide antigens, Amph-G12D and Amph-G12R (Amph-Peptides 2P), and an Amph-modified immune-stimulatory oligonucleotide adjuvant (Amph-CpG-7909). 25 patients received ELI-002 2P at 1.4 mg of Amph-Peptides 2P and Amph-CpG-7909 at 5 dose levels; 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg.

Their immunogenicity is dependent on the chosen adjuvant and target organ exposure (lymphoid organs). To improve peptide immunogenicity, we have developed a technology enabling cross-linking of endogenous, pre-existing circulating antibodies (Abs) by employing a three-dimensional chemistry design. Multiple identical tetanus toxin-derived B cell epitopes (MTTEs) are conjugated to synthetically made antigenic tumor peptides intended to induce T cell responses. Here we report the first clinical safety assessment of the vaccine platform in the trial TENDU101 (NCT04701021). The cancer vaccine candidate (TENDU) was designed to include longer synthetic peptides harboring prostate cancer derived epitopes (CD4 and CD8) from PAP and PSMA. The study was a 3+3 design and doses were 40, 400 and 960 microgram in patients with documented recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy. A tetanus toxoid (TTd) containing vaccine boost was followed by TENDU vaccination via subcutaneous injection in the abdomen (4 doses in total with a 2 week interval) in n=9 patients (gr 1, 2, 3.1). For group 3.2 (n=3) TENDU vaccination was administrated in the same arm as the TTd vaccination. Primary objective was safety and secondary objective assessment of immune responses and preliminary anti-tumor responses. A total of 52 adverse events (AEs) were reported, most mild and deemed unrelated to vaccination. Six treatment-related AEs were reported of which 50% were mild transient injection site reactions in a single patient (gr 3.1), and three events of increases in lipase levels in two patients (gr 2). No serious AEs was reported. T cell responses pre\/post TENDU were assessed in a total of six patients of which five patients displayed increased response against vaccine-related CD8 and CD4 epitopes (ELISpot). The three patients with the greatest increase in T cell responses were found to display the highest anti-MTTE IgG responses. A trend towards decrease in circulating tumor cells from screening to the end of treatment visit was observed in the patients with the highest levels of anti-MTTE IgGs post TENDU vaccination. There were no trends for decrease in PSA and\/or PAP at the end of treatment and follow-up measurements were affected by initiation of radiation and short-term androgen deprivation. The administration of TTd and TENDU to the same anatomical location although spaced in time appeared to negatively influence immune responses to TTd and TENDU. In conclusion, the novel synthetic peptide conjugate vaccine conjugate was found safe with no serious AEs reported and a positive correlation between anti-MTTE and T cell responses was noted in patients when TENDU was administrated in the abdomen.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,Prostate cancer,Vaccines,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"W.

There are no approved targeted therapies for metastatic OGC. Several agents with different targets, such as pembrolizumab, nirogacestat, orteronel, and STM 434, are being evaluated but to date have not shown clinical benefit. Most OGC carry a C134W mutation in the <i>FOXL2<\/i> gene, which manifests its protumor effects via the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#946; signaling pathway. Livmoniplimab (livmo) is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the TGF-&#946;1-glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant protein complex, blocking the release of active TGF-&#946;1. Livmo has been assessed with or without budigalimab (budi), an anti-PD-1 mAb, in the dose escalation (ESC) part of a first-in-human study in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors, including OGC. Herein, we report results of 4 pts with OGC enrolled into the combination ESC part of this phase 1 study (NCT03821935).<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>Pts &#8805;18 years with ECOG PS 0-1 were enrolled in ESC, including pts with metastatic OGC refractory to\/not eligible for standard therapies. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and pts received the maximum administered dose of 1500 mg livmo (Q2W IV) + 500 mg budi (Q4W IV). Safety and overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 were assessed.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>As of 28 Sep 2023, 57 pts were enrolled in ESC, including 4 with metastatic OGC aged 50-63 years who received 3-7 prior lines of systemic therapy. In total, 98% (n=56) pts in ESC experienced TEAEs, most commonly fatigue (42%), nausea (37%), and anemia (37%). One pt with OGC was enrolled in the study with metastatic target lesions in the lung, liver, and peritoneum at screening. She had received 7 prior lines of therapy including doxorubicin, bevacizumab, anastrozole, tamoxifen, and carboplatin + paclitaxel. Upon treatment with livmo + budi, she had a deep partial response (-92% from baseline) and a complete response in the target liver lesion. The pt stayed in response for ~2.5 years before death due to an event unrelated to study drugs. Furthermore, 2 other pts with metastatic OGC had a partial response (ORR=75%) and none of the 4 pts with OGC experienced disease progression (disease control rate=100%).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Livmo + budi had promising antitumor efficacy and a tolerable safety profile in pts with metastatic OGC, a rare TGF-&#946; signaling-dependent tumor. All enrolled pts with OGC showed tumor shrinkage and 1 pt had durable and near-complete response. Since single-agent pembrolizumab exhibited an ORR of 0% in pts with OGC (How et al. <i>Invest New Drugs<\/i>, 2021;39:829-835), we conclude that OGC is a proof-of-mechanism indication for livmo and that targeting TGF-&#946; may represent an effective strategy for treating pts with OGC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advanced cancer,Antibody,Antitumor activity,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

CTX-712 is a potent oral CDC2-like kinase (CLK) inhibitor affecting RNA splicing, CTX-712 demonstrated potent inhibition of proliferation in human tumor cell lines and elicited robust anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. This study aimed to evaluate CTX-712&#8217;s maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK)\/pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles, and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This study consisted of a dose escalation cohort (A) and three dose expansion cohorts (C, D and E) for solid tumors. The dose escalation cohort (A) was initiated with accelerated titration and then switched to a 3+3 design (10, 20, 40, 70, 105, 140 and 175 mg twice a week [TW]). The dosing regimens for dose expansion cohorts were 105 mg TW (C), 70 mg TW (D), and 105 mg once a week (QW) (E).<br \/>Results: As of November 20, 2023, a total of 46 patients with solid tumors were enrolled in the dose escalation cohort (16 patients) and dose expansion cohorts (30 patients total). In the dose escalation cohort, CTX-712 was administered at a dose of 10\/20\/40\/70 mg TW (n=1 each), 105\/175 mg TW (n=3 each) and 140 mg TW (n=6). DLTs were observed in 2 patients (140 mg TW [platelet count decreased, hypokalemia], 175 mg TW [dehydration]) and MTD was determined to be 140 mg TW. Among the safety analysis population (n=46), median treatment duration was 77 days (Range 1-413+ days); 1 patient is ongoing, and 45 patients discontinued. The common any-grade related adverse events (AEs) (&#8805;30%) were nausea (93.5%), vomiting (65.2%), diarrhea (54.3%), decreased appetite (45.7%) and blood creatinine increase (32.6%). The most common related Grade 3 or higher AE was platelet count decrease (6.5%). Among all the patients (n=46), partial responses were observed in 4 (8.7%) patients (40 (n=1)\/70 (n=2)\/105 (n=1) mg TW cohorts), who were all patients with ovarian cancer; the median treatment duration of ovarian cancer (n=14) was 84 days (Range 1-413+ days). In PK analysis, a dose-dependent increase in systemic exposure of CTX-712 was observed. PD response was assessed in RNA extracted from peripheral blood cells. Dose-dependent increases of exon skipping in two marker RNAs (S6K and THAP9-AS1) demonstrated mRNA splicing modification induced by CTX-712.<br \/>Conclusions: CTX-712 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in patients with solid tumors.

The drug causes growth inhibition and regression in various preclinical models, including <i>ARID1A<\/i><i> <\/i>mutated ovarian and endometrial xenograft and cholangiocarcinoma PDX models.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>M<\/b><b>ethod<\/b><b>s <\/b>We describe results of the dose-defining dose escalation cohort and the toxicity-pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic evaluation in a first-in-human phase I trial of NXP800. Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian modified continual reassessment method that targeted a dose-limiting toxicity DLT probability (DLTp) closest to 30% but &#60;33%. Toxicity was assessed using NCI.CTC.V5. Detailed sampling of blood for pharmacokinetic analysis and blood for mRNA and protein analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was conducted on C1D-3 to -7 (run in prior to continuous dosing) and C2D1. Two schedules (once per day [QD] and twice per day [BID] and a dose range of 50 to 150 mg\/day were evaluated.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Eighteen patients were treated: at baseline, the median age was 65 years (range 42-77), 9 (50%) were female and 14\/18 (78%) had an ECOG score of 1. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (more than 20% of patients) were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, AST increase and thrombocytopenia. All these side effects were grade 1-2 except grade 3 nausea and grade 3 diarrhea reported in one patient each and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 2 patients. The MTD for the QD schedule was 100 mg (DLTp=26%), no doses in the BID schedule had estimated DLTp of &#60;33%. The average Cmax at 50 mg and 75 mg OD was 190 nM and 384 nM during the run-in and 495 nM and 656 nM in cycle 2 reached by 3 hours. ATF4 protein in PBMCs was elevated in 57% and 80% of patients during run in and Cycle 2 respectively, 6 hours after 50 mg and 75 mg treatment. The mRNA biomarkers in blood most consistently elevated included ATF4 transcriptional targets <i>NUPR1<\/i>, <i>ULBP1<\/i> and <i>TRIB3<\/i> at 2 - 24 hours after 50 mg and 75 mg treatment. Further, mRNA levels for these biomarkers were elevated in post-treatment biopsy samples in one of the two patients tested. It is envisaged that NXP800 will need to be dosed continuously and although the protocol defined MTD at 28 days at 100 mg QD, it was decided to take a dose of range of 50 mg and 75 mg OD which caused biomarker modulation, forward for further evaluation.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>A tolerable dose\/schedule of continuous dosing of NXP800 has been established with biomarker modulation in blood.

DPV-001 is a novel microvesicle vaccine that contains &#62;300 proteins for genes commonly overexpressed by cancer and is enriched for short-lived proteins (SLiPs), and defective ribosomal products (DRiPs), including non-canonical peptides, representing potential shared non-mutated alternative cancer neoantigens (dark matter). Preclinical studies identified increased therapeutic efficacy when this vaccine strategy was combined with anti-PD-1 and anti-GITR, leading to this clinical trial for patients with advanced or metastatic HNSCC.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Methods:<\/b> Following safety run-in, eligible pts were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive DPV-001 +\/- GITR agonist mAb (INCAGN-1949; q2wks). All received sequenced PD-1 mAb (retifanlimab; q4wks) starting D15. Safety was evaluated as the primary endpoint and efficacy was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Tumor biopsies were taken pre-treatment, Wk 2 and 8, and assessed by CITE-seq, scRNA-seq, BCR-seq, and TCR-seq. Multiplex immunofluoresence was performed on biopsies. Blood samples were taken pre-treatment and at multiple timepoints and analyzed by flow cytometry and seromics.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>18 pts received backbone therapy of DPV-001 + sequenced PD-1; of these, 9 pts also received GITR starting D1 (Arm 2). <b> <\/b>G3 irAE's included: hypothyroidism &#38; mucositis (Arm 1, same pt); pneumonitis and adrenal insufficiency (Arm 2, separate pts). No G4 toxicity was observed. Combining both arms, the response rate (RR) for PD-1 na&#239;ve pts was 55% (5\/9), and 33% (3\/9) for PD-1 experienced pts. Two CR's have been observed in Arm 2. Durability of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) will be reported at the meeting. DPV-001 induced increased Ki67+ CD4 EM (p&#60;0.042) by D15, prior to first dose of PD-1. Addition of GITR at D1 further increased Ki67+ CD4 (p=0.008) &#38; CD8 EM cells (P=0.0006) by D15. Activated or proliferating CD4 and CD8 EM were significantly increased in both arms by D30 (p&#60;0.025). Across above specified analyses, pts receiving GITR had the greatest increase. Evaluable pts had significantly (all p&#60;0.032) increased numbers of TIL expressing IFN-&#947; and\/or GZMB, LAG-3, and TIM3 in on-treatment biopsies. TCR, BCR, and seromic analyses, as well as studies to identify targets of anti-cancer immunity, are ongoing.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This 18 pt trial of DPV-001 and sequenced PD-1 +\/- GITR shows a promising RR and evidence of increased activation and expansion of effector T cells in PBL and tumor. Upregulation of LAG-3 and TIM3 by T cells that infiltrate the tumor and have increased in number, provide a rationale for including inhibitors for both in this treatment strategy. Current efforts include evaluating whether immune responses target shared non-canonical alternative neoantigens, or Dark Matter, contained in DPV-001, and whether synchronized antibody and cellular response is evidenced.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> Incyte, Providence Portland Medical Foundation, Steve and Cindy Harder,<br \/><b>Trial Registry:<\/b> NCT04470024, <b>Ethics Approval: <\/b> PSJH IRB# 2020000480","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,GITR,PD-1,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Rom S.

Objective Response Rates (ORR) in 240 mg, 360 mg and 480 mg cohorts were 100%, 92.3% and 92.3%, respectively. By November 20, 2023, 71.1% (27\/38) patients have ongoing responses. No new safety signal was identified. The incidence of Grade &#8805;3 adverse events (AEs) was 76.3% with no fatal AEs. The incidence of investigator-determined immune-related AEs was 36.8% with 1 (2.6%) Grade &#8805;3.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Toripalimab SC formulation showed similar safety and clinical efficacy with toripalimab IV formulation when combined with GP in patients with RM-NPC. The exposure of toripalimab 360 mg Q3W SC was comparable to that of 240 mg Q3W IV.

Antagonism of ILT4 may induce a proinflammatory state and stimulate antitumor T-cell response, especially with PD-(L)1 blockade. In the dose escalation phase of a first-in-human phase 1 study (NCT03564691), the anti-ILT4 IgG4 monoclonal antibody, MK-4830, in combination with pembrolizumab (pembro) was well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in advanced solid tumors. Here, we present safety, efficacy, and biomarker analyses for MK-4830 + pembro from the multi-cohort expansion phase of patients (pts) with previously untreated advanced HNSCC or NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts aged &#8805;18 y with previously untreated advanced HNSCC and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) &#8805;1 (cohort D) or NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status (cohorts E and F) were enrolled. Pts in all cohorts received either MK-4830 800 mg (cohorts D and E) or 1600 mg (cohort F) + pembro 200 mg Q3W for &#8804;35 cycles. Primary end points were safety and ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Exploratory end points included DOR and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and evaluating possible biomarkers of response to MK-4830 + pembro.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> At data cut-off (September 27, 2023), 35, 47, and 11 pts were enrolled and received treatment in cohorts D, E, and F, respectively. Median study follow-up was 34.4 mo (range, 26.5-42.4) in cohort D, 35.9 mo (22.4-39.8) in cohort E, and 38.7 mo (37.6-39.6) in cohort F. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 33 pts (94%) in cohort D, 43 pts (91%) in cohort E, and 10 pts (91%) in cohort F. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 20 pts (57%) in cohort D, 26 pts (55%) in cohort E, and 6 pts (55%) in cohort F; grade 3-5 TRAEs occurred in 5 pts (14%), 4 pts (9%), and 1 pt (9%), respectively. One pt in cohort E and 1 pt in cohort F died due to a TRAE (pneumonitis and pneumonia, respectively). ORR was 24% (95% CI, 11-41) in cohort D, 30% (17-45) in cohort E, and 27% (6-61) in cohort F. Median DOR was 16.4 mo (range, 2.2+ to 24.4+) in cohort D, 14.8 mo (4.2+ to 32.9+) in cohort E, and 8.4 mo (3.0-21.5) in cohort F. Median PFS was 5.2 mo (95% CI, 2.0-8.0) in cohort D, 4.3 mo (1.8-8.1) in cohort E, and 3.3 (1.2-7.6) in cohort F. In cohort D, T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not enrich for response to MK-4830 + pembro. In cohorts E and F, PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and Tcell<sub>inf<\/sub>GEP trended higher in pts with response to MK-4830 + pembro than pts with no response; TMB did not trend with response.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In pts with advanced HNSCC or NSCLC, first-line MK-4830 + pembro had a manageable AE profile with modest antitumor activity. Consistent with what was previously observed for pembro alone, a trend was observed between PD-L1 TPS and response to MK-4830 + pembro in pts with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Pembrolizumab,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

CTX-712 is a first-in-class, orally available, highly potent, and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDC2-like kinase (CLK), a key regulator of RNA splicing. Preclinical data show that CTX-712 demonstrated anti-proliferative activity in in-vitro and in-vivo models derived from hematologic malignancies. A phase I study of CTX-712 was conducted to evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of CTX-712 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).<br \/>Methods: The objectives of this cohort were to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)\/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles, and preliminary efficacy of CTX-712 in patients with hematologic malignancies. A 3+3 design was used in two dose levels (70 mg and 105 mg twice a week (TW)) based on the safety data from the previous dose escalation cohort in patients with solid tumors.<br \/>Results: As of data cutoff on November 20, 2023, a total of 14 patients (12 AML and 2 MDS) were enrolled in 70 mg TW (n=8) and 105 mg TW dose levels (n=6). DLT of Grade 4 pneumonia was observed in 1 of 3 DLT-evaluable patients in the 105 mg TW group. In the 70 mg TW group, no DLT was observed in 6 DLT-evaluable patients. Among the safety analysis population (n=14), median treatment duration was 76 days (Range 15-974 days). At data cutoff, treatment was ongoing in 1 patient and discontinued in 13 patients. The common any-grade adverse events (AEs) (&#8805;30%) were diarrhea (57.1%) and nausea (42.9%). The most common Grade 3 or higher AE were white blood cell count decreased and tumor lysis syndrome (14.3%). In AML patients (n=12), complete remission (CR) was observed in 3 patients (25.0%), and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was observed in 1 patient (8.3%). The median time to remission was 67 days (Range 29-113 days), and the median duration of response was 281 days (Range 56-924 days). In MDS patients (n=2), CR was observed in 1 patient (50.0%). PK\/PD profiles of the hematologic malignancies dose escalation cohort were comparable with those of the solid tumor cohort at the same dosage.<br \/>Conclusions: CTX-712 demonstrated a manageable and tolerable safety profile and showed anti-tumor efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies. Currently, a Phase I\/II Study of CTX-712 in relapsed\/refractory AML and higher risk MDS is ongoing using a new tablet formulation in the United States.<br \/>Clinical trial information: jRCT2080224127","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,RNA Splicing Mutations,Small molecule inhibitor,Myelodysplastic syndromes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

PIM kinases are promising cancer therapeutic targets for pharmacological inhibition. NB004 (aka GDC-0570) is a novel, potent, selective, orally available small molecule pan-PIM inhibitor, which exhibits antiproliferative activity as a single agent in a variety of preclinical models and can augment the activity of standard of care or targeted therapies, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human solid tumors, NB004 demonstrates both single agent and combination activity with agents targeting the RTK\/RAS\/MAPK pathways, including synergistic effects with KRAS inhibitors (KRASis). Remarkably, in NSCLC PDX models with acquired resistance to KRASis, strong combination efficacy was observed between NB004 and sotorasib, resulting in complete tumor regression. Based on the promising preclinical data, NB004 is currently being assessed in an open-label, first-in-human phase I clinical trial as monotherapy or combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability and to recommend the phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives include PK characterization and preliminary antitumor activity evaluation. In the phase I monotherapy dose escalation part, NB004 was administered daily in 5 dose levels, ranging from 75mg to 600mg, following a standard 3+3 design. As of December 22, 2023, a total of 18 patients were treated. Of the 13 patients (72.2%) who reported any treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), 12 (66.7%) had Grade 1 or 2 TRAEs, 1 patient (5.6%) experienced Grade 3 neutrophil count decrease and white blood cell count decrease. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) was reported, and PK exposure is in general dose proportional. These results warrant further evaluation of this drug in combination with other therapeutic agents. The combination part of the trial is currently open for enrollment (NCT05036291).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,PIM,KRAS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Siqing Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel E.

The confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 49.0% and 89.8% respectively. Objective responses were observed in patients received 400mg QD or above. In patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC who received more than or equal to 400mg daily dose, the confirmed ORR and DCR were 51.2% (21\/41) and 95.1% (39\/41), respectively. Of the same subpopulation, the median duration of response was not reached (5.4, NA). Meanwhile, the median progression-free-survival (PFS) was 11.3 month (6.1, NA), with the 6-months PFS rate 75% and the 9-months PFS rate 63.6%. Responses were also observed in patients with colon cancer and pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: HS-10370 was well tolerated and showed inspiring antitumor activities in KRAS G12C mutated advanced solid tumors, especially in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,KRAS,KRAS G12C inhibitor,targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaorong Dong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangjiao Meng<sup>2<\/sup>, Yan Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yan Wang<sup>4<\/sup>, Jianhua Chen<sup>5<\/sup>, Liang Han<sup>6<\/sup>, Qiming Wang<sup>7<\/sup>, Zhong Lin<sup>8<\/sup>, Hongying Wei<sup>9<\/sup>, Siheng Lin<sup>10<\/sup>, Chuan Li<sup>11<\/sup>, Qiong Wu<sup>9<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, JiNan, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, jinan, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Harbin Medical University Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Hunan Cancer Hospital\/Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Central South University, Changsha, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Oncology Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, China,<sup>7<\/sup>Henan Cancer Hospital Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, zhengzhou, China,<sup>8<\/sup>The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Oncology Medicine, Hansoh Pharma Group CO.,LTD, Shanghai, China,<sup>10<\/sup>Department of Oncology Medicine, Hansoh Pharma Group CO.,LTD, Shanghai, China, Shanghai, China,<sup>11<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology , Hansoh Pharma Group CO.,LTD, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"12e9f65d-ad16-432b-afbf-260b744ab4cc","ControlNumber":"10336","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02211755) to assess the safety of the B and C combination in patients (pts) with solid tumors and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and to determine the effect of the combination on biomarkers of cell death and DDR. Due to limited MDS pt accrual, this cohort was terminated early, and MDS pt data are not included here.Objectives: The primary objective was to assess safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of B and C in pts with solid tumors and MDS. Secondary objectives were to assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effects using validated assays for cell death and DDR in tumor biopsy tissue and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).Design: The dose escalation followed a 3+3 design, enrolling at least 1 pt from each group (solid tumor and MDS) per dose level until hematologic dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. Adverse events (AEs) were graded using CTCAE v4.0. Ten planned dose levels (DL) included C ranging from 1 to 10 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on D2-5 of cycle 1 and D1-5 from cycle 2 on and B from 0.8 to 1.5 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> on D1 and D4 of 21-day cycles. Response was assessed by RECIST 1.1 every 2 cycles. Biopsies were performed on the expansion cohort pre-dose, 2-4 hours after C on C1D1, and C2D4; CTCs were collected pre-dose, C1D2, day 1 of subsequent cycles, and at progression.Results: We enrolled 25 pts with advanced solid tumors (15 male, 10 female). Median age was 62 years (range 30-81). DLT occurred in 4 pts (at DL3 [1 pt], DL5 [2], and DL4 [1]) and included Grade 4 neutropenia (3), Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (3), and Grade 3 anemia (1). There were no Grade 5 AEs. DL4 (B 1.3 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> D1 and 4, C 1.5 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> D1-5, 21-day cycles) was the MTD. Twenty-one pts were evaluable for response; the best response was stable disease (SD) for 10 pts (47.6%). Median duration of response for pts achieving SD was 3.5 months (range 2-7). Of note, 3 out of the 10 colorectal cancer (CRC) pts had SD &#62; 4 months. Four pts with CRC have been enrolled in an expansion cohort for biomarker evaluation; induction of pyroptosis has been measured in a limited number of paired biopsies collected to date. Conclusions: Despite preclinical evidence of synergy, the human equivalent of the efficacious preclinical combination dose could not be achieved clinically, which may account for the lack of antitumor response. Prolonged SD was observed in 3 pts with CRC. PD analyses, including of CTCs and additional cell death biomarkers, are ongoing.
