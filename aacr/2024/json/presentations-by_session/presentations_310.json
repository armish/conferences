CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor) regulates the proliferation, differentiation and polarization of cells of myeloid lineages, e.g. monocytes\/macrophages. CSF1R expression is aberrantly upregulated in many AML, leading to a hypothesis that CSF1R is a putative leukemogenic driver in a subset of AML and thus could be a potential target for treating AML. Previous studies demonstrated that Narazaciclib (HX301 or ON123300), an investigational kinase inhibitor (TKi), exhibited high potency activity against CSF1R (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.285 nM) and inhibition of macrophage proliferation and AML tumor growth both <i>in vitro\/in vivo<\/i>, implicating its potential use as an AML therapeutic<sup>1<\/sup> (An et al., 2023 AACR Annual Meeting). In addition, narazaciclib has recently completed the dose escalation phase 1 study in advanced solid tumors. However, the therapeutic window of narazaciclib as a CSF1Ri for treating AML remains to be determined. The present study attempted to utilize both preclinical PK and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy models to predict the effective clinical dose of narazaciclib for guiding the future AML clinical trials.<br \/>Methods: A single dose of narazaciclib at various of dose levels was orally administrated in NOD\/Scid mice, and plasma samples were collected at designated timepoints. The concentrations of narazaciclib in plasma were analyzed by LC-MS. In a Ba\/F3-ETV6-CSF1R <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft tumor model in Nod\/Scid mice, narazaciclib at various dose levels was orally administrated daily. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly.<br \/>Results: The mouse PK study showed that narazaciclib displayed overall similar absorption pattern as seen in unpublished human clinical data. Narazaciclib was absorbed rapidly after oral dosing with a mean T<sub>max<\/sub> ranging from 1 to 2 hours in mouse. However, narazaciclib was cleared faster in mouse, with a mean T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>ranging from 1.9 to 2.8 hours, than in human. In addition, the exposures of narazaciclib, as measured by C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC in plasma, increased in a relatively dose-proportional manner, as seen in human patients. In the Ba\/F3-ETV6-CSF1R xenograft model where the tumor cell growth is solely dependent on the CSF1R kinase activity, narazaciclib at 10 mg\/kg did not induce any anti-tumor effects with a TGI of -14.61%. In contrast, narazaciclib at 50 mg\/kg and 100 mg\/kg exerted significant anti-tumor effects with a TGI of 85.49% and 94.55%, respectively. Based on the mouse PK results, narazaciclib at 50 mg\/kg in mouse is estimated to have an AUC of approximate 2000 h*ng\/mL, which is equivalent to the dose of 160 - 200 mg\/d in human patients. Therefore, 160 mg dose level is predicted to be an effective dose for narazaciclib in AML patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Narazaciclib at 160 mg\/d is predicted to be an effective dose in AML patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Small molecule drugs,Acute myeloid leukemia,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

A threshold of 6 &#181;g\/ml in plasma has been associated with target engagement with Atezolizumab. The extent to which patients could be overexposed with the standard 1200 mg Q3W flat-dosing remains unknown, but several <i>in silico<\/i> studies have suggested that flat-dosing with immune checkpoint inhibitors could lead to plasma concentrations far above the necessary levels to be efficacious. Here, we monitored Atezolizumab peak and trough levels in 27 real-world patients with lung cancer as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a population approach and optimal dosing-intervals were simulated with respect to the target trough levels of Atezolizumab. No patient displayed plasma levels below 6 &#181;g\/ml. The results showed that the mean trough level after the first course was 78.3 &#177; 17 &#181;g\/ml, i.e., 13 times above the target concentration associated with target engagement. The overall response rate was 55.5%. Low-grade IRAEs was observed in 37% of patients. No severe immune-related toxicities was observed. On univariate analysis, no relationship was found between exposure metrics of Atezolizumab (i.e., Cmin, Cmax, AUC at the first cycle or during the forthcoming courses) and pharmacodynamic endpoints (i.e., efficacy, toxicity). First-line Atezolizumab treatment and treatment for NSCLC were both significantly associated with efficacy on univariate analysis (p=0.0067 and p=0.0497, respectively), but further multivariate analysis did not confirm this relationship (p=0.2465 and p=0.9981). Smoking status was moderately associated with toxicities on univariate analysis (p=0.03), but this effect was not confirmed on further multivariate analysis (p=0.99). None of the other covariates (i.e., age, sex, NLR, number of metastatic sites, associated chemotherapy) were associated with efficacy or toxicity. Further simulations suggested that the dosing interval could be extended from the standard 21 days (i.e., Q3W) to 49 up to 136 days (mean: 85.7 days, i.e., Q12W dosing), while ensuring plasma levels always above the 6 &#181;g\/ml target threshold. This observational, real-world study confirms for the first time in real-world patients that the standard 1200 mg Q3W fixed-dose regimen of Atezolizumab results in significant overexposure in plasma. Of note, this overexposure was not associated with increased side-effects. As plasma levels always exceed pharmacologically active concentrations, the inter-individual variability we observed in PK parameters did not impact efficacy and could not explain differences in response. Our data suggest that dosing intervals could be markedly extended with respect to the target threshold associated with efficacy, thus lowering drug-cost in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

An intranasal (IN) formulation of NEO100 (NeOnc Technologies, Inc., Los Angeles), a highly purified version of perillyl alcohol, has been recently reported to enhance drug concentrations in the brain upon IN co-delivery. Here, we report detailed pharmacokinetics (PK) and tissue analysis to quantitatively examine the extent of increase in drug concentrations in the brain after IN NEO100 administration. Furthermore, we also confirmed that IN NEO100 increases brain drug concentration by circumventing the blood brain barrier.<br \/>Method: For PK analysis, either IN or oral formulation of a three-drug cocktail (ZEI, consisting of ZN-c3, everolimus, and infigratinib) was used to evaluate the impact of 3% IN NEO100 on the brain penetration profile of the three individual drugs. Athymic mice were grouped into four cohorts to receive 1) oral ZEI; 2) IN ZEI; 3) oral ZEI with IN NEO100; and 4) IN ZEI with IN NEO100. At 2, 4 and 6 hours post ZEI dosing, drug levels in plasma and brain tissue were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). For BBB disruption study, athymic mice were treated with IN delivery of saline (negative control) or 3% NEO100 one hour post intravenous Evans blue (2%) administration. Tumor bearing mice with disrupted BBB served as positive control. Two hours post Evans blue administration, animals were perfused, and brains were collected and sectioned for confocal microscopy to image Evan&#8217;s blue autofluorescence.<br \/>Results: PK analysis revealed that brain-to-plasma ratios (K<sub>p<\/sub>) for ZN-c3, everolimus, and infigratinib remained nearly equal, independent of the route of administration, <i>i.e.<\/i> 0.11, 0.03, and 0.82 vs 0.09, 0.03, and 0.87, for IN vs oral routes, respectively. Administration of the ZEI together with IN NEO100, either through oral or IN routes, resulted in higher drug concentrations, both in the plasma and in the brain. However, while overall drug exposure was increased, K<sub>p<\/sub> values of the drugs were not changed.

Here we characterized the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety profiles associated with tarlatamab treatment in SCLC, including the effects of patient-specific covariates (brain or liver metastasis, smoking status, number of prior lines of therapy, prior PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy, sum of target lesion diameters, and presence of anti-drug antibody).<br \/>Methods: The analysis dataset consisted of 412 subjects with SCLC from ongoing Phase 1 DeLLphi-300 study (dose range 0.003 mg to 100 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q3W) and Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 study (10 mg and 100 mg Q2W). Serum tarlatamab exposure averaged over the first cycle (28 days) was utilized as the predictor of response in the regression analysis. Efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate, best tumor size response, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Safety endpoints included overall treatment related adverse event (TRAE), overall treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), and TEAEs of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and associated neurologic events, and neutropenia. Only the grade &#8805; 3 adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.<br \/>Results: Significant exposure-response relationships were established for all key efficacy measures across the dose range investigated. Plateau in the exposure-efficacy relationship (maximal efficacy) was observed at the recommended dose of 10 mg Q2W. Exposures associated with lower doses were estimated to have lower efficacy. No clear trends for exposure-response relationships were identified for the evaluated AEs except for grade &#8805; 3 neutropenia, where a shallow trend was observed for increased neutropenia rate with increasing tarlatamab exposures. Of all the evaluated covariate relationships, only higher baseline sum of target lesion diameters was statistically significantly correlated with worsening of OS.<br \/>Conclusions: Overall results in this SCLC population suggest tarlatamab exposures associated with the recommended dose of 10 mg Q2W exhibited near maximal efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile. None of the evaluated patient-specific covariates resulted in clinically meaningful changes in efficacy or safety, and therefore do not warrant a dose adjustment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,BiTE antibody,Exposure-Efficacy,Exposure-Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.-W.

Additionally, GSTP has a chaperone function that regulates multiple oncogenic pathways such as KRAS and JNK. Since alternative pathways could compensate for the inhibition of a single kinase, targeting multiple pathways could lead to more effective therapy.<br \/>NBF-006 is a drug product comprised of GSTP siRNA encapsulated within a novel LNP. It is designed to deliver siRNA to localized and metastatic lung tumors.<br \/>Unlike other well-established drug modalities, there is a general need for increased understanding of the PK of RNA therapeutics. For NBF-006, we present popPK analysis of patients who have undergone treatment in a Phase I (a\/b) clinical study. A primary goal of popPK modeling is to identify PK parameters and sources of variability in a population. Other goals include correlating drug exposures with administered doses through identification of predictive covariates in a target population and establishing whether fixed dosing as opposed to weight-based dosing can be utilized in future clinical studies. Ultimately this analysis will help to inform decision-making for dosing regimens in future clinical trial designs and to better predict PK variability across populations.<br \/>A total of 48 advanced NSCLC (N=38), pancreatic (N=5), or colorectal cancer (N=5) patients received 4 doses (QW) of NBF-006 by infusion at 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2 or 1.6 mg\/kg followed by a 2-week rest period. In all studies, serial blood samples were collected at weeks 1 and 4. Plasma concentrations of siRNA were determined by hybridization ELISA. PopPK analysis was performed to characterize NBF-006 PK and to explore intrinsic and extrinsic covariate effects that could affect NBF-006 exposure.<br \/>The analysis included 695 quantifiable PK observations. A popPK model with two-compartment disposition and linear elimination adequately described the PK profile of NBF-006. Exploratory data analysis of dose-normalized PK profiles suggested that exposure increased proportionally with increasing dose from 0.15 to 1.6 mg\/kg. Little to no apparent accumulation nor exposure reduction was observed between weeks 1 and 4. The impact of individual patient covariates, including body weight, baseline ALT, sex, KRAS mutation, cancer type and race, was assessed on PK parameters. None of the covariates evaluated had a significant effect on NBF-006 clearance or central distribution volume (Vc) in the model. Vc showed a slight positive trend with higher body weight, but was not statistically significant.<br \/>A popPK model was successfully developed for NBF-006. No covariates were identified that impact NBF-006 exposure. The lack of a relationship of exposure with body weight suggests the potential to use fixed dosing in future clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Nanoparticle,siRNA,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The 3 paralogs (c-, N-, and L-MYC) have similar biological functions but show distinct tissular and timing expression patterns. To function, MYC must heterodimerize with its partner MAX and bind DNA via its basic, helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper domain (B-HLH-LZ). It has been estimated that MYC is aberrantly expressed in up to 70% of human cancers and hence MYC has been termed a &#8220;most wanted target for cancer treatment&#8221;. However, due to its nuclear localization, its intrinsic disorder and lack of an enzymatically active site, development of clinical grade potent &#38; selective small molecules targeting MYC remains an obstacle. Omomyc is a 91-amino-acids-long polypeptide that derives from the B-HLH-LZ domain of human MYC, containing four amino acid substitutions. Omomyc is capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with MYC and with MAX and such dimers blunt MYC activity by preventing its access to target DNA sequences (E-boxes) and replacing it by inactive complexes. Previous studies showed the cell-penetrating properties of recombinant Omomyc and its subsequent nuclear localization, where it displaces MYC from its genomic locations, causing a speci&#64257;c shutdown of MYC transcriptional signature and effectively stopping cell cycle progression. Further in vivo preclinical experiments showed that Omomyc blocks MYC-driven transcription and proliferation, induces apoptosis and recruitment of intratumoral immune in&#64257;ltrates, overall signi&#64257;cantly abrogating tumor progression and reducing tumor grading. A targeted LC-MS\/MS assay for the absolute quantification of 4 Omomyc proteotypic peptides was developed to assess the structural integrity of Omomyc and quantify functional Omomyc in tumor tissue. LLOQ and linear range of the panel was determined by spiking in dilution series of recombinant Omomyc protein into preclinical tumor tissue lysates. Finally, in the context of Omomyc clinical trial (NCT04808362), we used the panel to for quantification of functional Omomyc in FFPE tumor biopsies from 18 patients who received i.v. injection of Omomyc therapeutic. Data show that 2 h after i.v. administration, higher concentrations of the drug are reached in the tumors compared with serum and persist there with at least one order of magnitude higher concentration than in serum 72 h after administration in preclinical models. Functional Omomyc protein could be quantified in all of the 18 clinical tumor biopsies from treated patients showing that characterized LC-MS\/MS proteomic assay can be used in the normal routine of a clinical trial for accurate quanti&#64257;cation of therapeutic miniproteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Myc,Therapeutic proteins,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.-E.

Here we describe the effects of patient specific factors [age, sex, bodyweight, ethnicity, estimates of renal and hepatic function, prior lines of therapy, baseline disease status, emergence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA)] on tarlatamab exposures.<br \/>Methods: Tarlatamab serum concentrations were available from 420 subjects (8509 samples) pooled across the ongoing Phase 1 DeLLphi-300 study (dose range 0.003 mg to 100 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q3W) and Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 study (10 mg and 100 mg Q2W). The data were analyzed using a nonlinear-mixed effects modeling approach implemented in NONMEM (v7.5) software. Model selection and evaluation was guided by standard statistical and graphical approaches. Impact of key baseline demographic variables on tarlatamab clearance and volume of distribution were evaluated.<br \/>Results: Tarlatamab exposures increased in a dose-proportional manner and were not impacted by age, sex, ethnicity, estimates of renal and hepatic function, prior lines of therapy or baseline disease status. Asian race resulted in 14% higher peak serum concentrations relative to Caucasian subjects. Higher body weight (99 kg; 90th percentile) was associated with a 24% decrease in Day 28 pre-dose concentration (Ctrough) relative to median bodyweight (73 kg). Lower body weight (54 kg; 10th percentile) was associated with a 27% increase in Ctrough relative to median bodyweight. Positive ADA status resulted in a 24% decrease in Ctrough. However, at the recommended dose of 10 mg Q2W, neither body weight nor ADA status had a clinically relevant impact on tarlatamab efficacy or safety measures (Ahn et al, 2023).<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, based on these analyses, no dose adjustment for tarlatamab is required based on age, sex, bodyweight, ethnicity, estimates of renal and hepatic function, prior lines of therapy, baseline disease status or emergence of ADA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Lung cancer: small cell,BiTE antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephanie  M.

PBI-410 (GQ1010) is a next-generation TROP-2 ADC developed using GeneQuantum's Ligase-Dependent Conjugation (iLDC) technology, that integrates a highly stable linker and a novel camptothecin analogue payload, TopoIx. This study included comprehensive preclinical evaluations that demonstrated a favorable safety and TK profile and potential for broader therapeutic margin versus other Trop-2 ADCs approved or in development.<br \/>Methods: TopoIx underwent extensive Good Laboratory Practice toxicity assessments in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (payload alone) and as part of the intact ADC in Non-Human Primates. Rats were administered repeated intravenous infusions of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg\/kg of H0011 once a week over 5 doses. The potential toxicity profile of PBI-410 was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys via repeated intravenous infusions of 10, 30, and 60 mg\/kg doses every 3 weeks for 3 doses, followed by a six-week recovery phase.<br \/>Results: TopoIx administration in SD rats exhibited good tolerance, with slight reductions in body weight gain and food consumption. Microscopic tissue changes resolved post-drug withdrawal, except for persistent findings in the sciatic nerve. Repeated doses of PBI-410 in cynomolgus monkeys were well-tolerated, primarily manifesting as skin pigmentation and associated microscopic alterations in specific tissues, such as eyes, esophagus, thymus, and lymph nodes typical for topoisomerase inhibitors. Importantly, these changes were reversible upon drug cessation. The HNSTD\/NOAEL for PBI-410 was determined to be 60 mg\/kg. This corresponds to mean C<sub>max<\/sub> of 1760 &#181;g\/mL and AUC<sub>inf<\/sub> of 235000 &#181;g*hr\/mL for ADC and for TopoIx mean C<sub>max<\/sub> of 16.4 ng\/mL and AUC<sub>inf<\/sub> of 2610 ng*hr\/mL. The lower exposure of TopoIx suggests minimum payload shedding in the systemic circulation. Notably, PBI-410 demonstrated a significantly enhanced safety profile compared to other Topo1-based Trop-2 ADCs, including an absence of hematopoietic and intestinal toxicities, and no pulmonary toxicity or interstitial lung disease (ILD) observed.<br \/>Conclusion: PBI-410 demonstrated a favorable and differentiated nonclinical safety profile and favorable TK relative to those reported to date for other Trop-2 ADCs in development. This profile, in addition to the potent anti-tumor response and synergistic activity in combination with anti-PD1 reported previously, position PBI-410 as a best-in-class potential Trop-2 ADC and partner of choice for anti-PD1 combination therapy. Additionally, TopoIx has displayed excellent properties among the TOP1 inhibitors, making it suitable for a broader therapeutic application based on exceptional potency while maintaining a favorable safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Trop-2,Safety,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Complex adverse-event frequencies of drugs or their combinations were visualized as heatmaps onto a 2D UMAP grid. Adverse event frequencies were shown as colors to assess the ratio between individual and combined drug effects. To capture these patterns, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder using 7,300 single-drug heatmaps. Additionally, statistical synergy analyses were performed based on BLISS independence or Chi-square testing.<br \/>Results: The trained CNN model was able to decode patterns, showing that adverse events occur in global rather than isolated and unique patterns. Patterns were not likely to be attributed to disease symptoms given their relatively limited contribution to drug associated adverse events. Pattern recognition was validated using trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov and drug combination data. We examined the adverse-event interactions of 140 drug combinations known to be avoided in the clinic and found that near all of them showed additive rather than synergistic interactions, also when assessed statistically.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study provides a framework for analyzing adverse events and suggest that adverse drug interactions commonly result in additive effects with a high level of overlap of adverse event patterns.

Recent research indicates that phenformin may also serve as an effective anticancer agent. This study introduces the synthesis and evaluation of Re tricarbonyl phenformin complex (Re-(CO)<sub>3<\/sub>-Phenformin, Re-Phen), as a derivative of Phenformin and novel anticancer agent for pancreatic cancer treatment. Re-Phen was synthesized, purified, and characterized through preparative HPLC, NMR, mass spectrometry, and FT-IR. Subsequent <i>in vitro <\/i>studies, utilizing the MTS assay, assessed its cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, including Kras* murine PDAC and MiaPaca-2 human PDAC. Notably, Re-Phen exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic effects in MiaPaca-2 cells (IC50= 0.755 mM) and Kras* cells (IC50= 0.410 mM) compared to Phenformin treatment (IC50= 4.02 mM and 2.36 mM, respectively). These results highlight Re-Phen's enhanced anticancer activity, outperforming Phenformin in potency. Further investigation into the pharmacokinetics of Re-Phen involved an <i>in vivo<\/i> study with rats intravenously administered 2 mg\/kg of Re-Phenformin. Blood samples were collected at intervals (10 min to 24 h post-dose) and were analyzed by validated LC-MS\/MS. The pharmacokinetic profile of Re-Phen was best described by a 2-compartment model, using Phoenix<sup>&#174;<\/sup> WinNonlin (version 8.0), with a particular focus on comparing the profiles of Phenformin and Re-Phen. The study revealed that Re-Phen has a significantly extended half-life compared to Phenformin (9.13 hr vs 2.11 hr), indicating prolonged systemic retention. Additionally, Re-Phen demonstrated an increased area under the curve (AUC), suggesting greater systemic exposure at equivalent dosing (90.55 hr*ng\/ml vs 7.13 hr*ng\/ml). This could imply enhanced bioavailability or altered metabolic clearance of Re-Phen compared to its parent compound. The two-Compartment of Re-Phe, provide a deeper understanding of its pharmacokinetic characteristics. In conclusion, Re-Phen not only demonstrates superior anticancer efficacy <i>in vitro<\/i> but also exhibits a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile <i>in vivo<\/i>. The extended half-life and increased AUC of Re-Phen suggest the potential of offering improved therapeutic efficacy in pancreatic cancer treatment. These promising findings warrant further investigation and could position Re-Phen as a promising therapeutic agent for the pharmacological management of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Pancreatic cancer,In vitro,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (M6620, VX-970), which is currently being evaluated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies and radiation. Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose\/exposure relationships and tissue distribution which may influence berzosertib&#8217;s therapeutic window. To understand these concepts, we extensively described the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissue.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Dose proportionality was assessed using single IV doses of berzosertib (2, 6, 20 and 60 mg\/kg) administered to female BALB\/c mice. Mice were euthanized from 5 min to 24 h post-dose. Using a highly sensitive LC-MS\/MS method, berzosertib was quantitated in red blood cells, plasma, and tissues. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed using Phoenix WinNonlin to determine relevant PK parameters. Dose linearity was assessed by statistical comparison of dose-normalized plasma C<sub>max <\/sub>and dose-normalized tissue AUC across the four dose levels. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA with Tukey&#8217;s multiple comparisons test. Berzosertib plasma protein binding was assessed <i>in vitro<\/i> from 300 ng\/mL to 100 &#956;g\/mL using rapid equilibrium dialysis. An extensive PK study was also conducted in tumor-bearing mice to assess distribution by quantitating drug in tissues.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The dose proportionality study indicated that both plasma C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC increase with dose, and dose-normalized concentration vs time profiles suggested nonlinear increases in exposure based on different terminal slopes. At the two highest doses, dose-normalized AUC in each tissue were greater than the exposure generated at the two lowest doses. However, log transformations of AUC<sub>0-360<\/sub> plotted vs dose generated a slope of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.718 - 1.054), suggesting a linear relationship. The fraction of unbound berzosertib in mouse plasma increased at concentrations above 10 &#956;g\/mL, which is a concentration exceeded at the two highest doses and where nonlinearity in exposure is observed. Tissue analysis revealed the following tissues had a tissue\/plasma coefficient &#62;1: bone marrow, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, tumor, lymph nodes, thymus, and heart.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> IV berzosertib displayed nonlinear PK in mice. Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with greater than proportional increases in plasma and tissue exposure most likely due to saturation of plasma protein binding. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and subsequent PBPK modeling to inform optimal dosing and clinical deployment of berzosertib.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,ATR,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Joshua  J.

EIK1001 is a TLR7\/8 agonist that stimulates myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, activating immune and inflammatory responses. This dual activity provides another pathway, distinct from effects on checkpoint proteins, to enhance antitumor T&#8209;cell activity alone or in combination with ICIs.<br \/>Methods: Adults with advanced solid tumors received a range of doses of EIK1001 (QW IV) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W; NCT03486301) or atezolizumab (1200 mg Q3W; NCT04196530) in Phase 1 studies (n=128). PK samples were collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and C1D8 predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose, with sparse sampling thereafter. Matched cytokine BMx samples were collected.<br \/>The PK analysis population comprised pts with at least one measurable EIK1001 concentration (1563 observations from 94 pts). PK data were analyzed using non-linear mixed effects in Phoenix (v8.3). Covariate effects of the combination drugs were tested using a stepwise approach with a significance level of 0.05 for forward addition. All other covariates were evaluated using exploratory plots and formally tested using a full matrix approach. Empirical Bayes estimates were used to generate individual steady&#8209;state concentration-time profiles and calculate post-hoc PK parameters. Exploratory analyses of exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy were conducted.<br \/>Results: EIK1001 PK was linear and dose-proportional over the doses studied. Tmax ranged from 4&#8209;12 hrs with no accumulation. Pop-PK analysis indicated that body size influenced clearance, but intrinsic factors of age, gender, tumor type, ECOG status, or hepatic\/renal impairment (mild\/moderate) did not. Combination drugs did not influence clearance. These attributes support BSA-based dosing and inform inclusion\/exclusion criteria for future studies.<br \/>On C1D1, time-dependent increases in IL-6, IL-8, IFN&#947;, and IP-10 returned to baseline within 24 hrs. An earlier IL-8 increase (Tmax 3-5 hr) is consistent with TLR8 activation on various cells including neutrophils, whereas the delayed increase of IFN&#947;\/IP-10 (Tmax 5-8 hr) suggests a downstream effect. Dose-dependent increases in cytokines were observed, with median peak changes from baseline of 1.13- to 7.97-fold for IFN&#947; and 0.63- to 12.1-fold for IP-10. The 2 highest doses provided evidence of robust target engagement alone or in combination.<br \/>Conclusion: The linear, dose-proportional PK of EIK1001 is well described by the Pop-PK model. Increases in IFN&#947; and IP-10 were consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action, with doses representing target engagement identified. Further development of EIK1001 is underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,Immuno-oncology,TLR7\/8,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"D.

These side effects of taxanes need to be overcome to improve patient management. In this context, we have developed a nanoparticle drug delivery system. We have developed an immunoliposome loaded with docetaxel and grafted with trastuzumab using a microfluidic method by mixing an aqueous phase (KH2PO4 buffer) and an organic phase composed of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEGmal in a molar ratio of 50:31:1, to which docetaxel is added at a rate of 1.8% of the total lipid. We perform a thiolation reaction to graft the trastuzumab onto the polyethylene glycol chain. Resulting immunoliposomes were characterized by a mean diameter of 140 nm, a docetaxel encapsulation rate of 73% and a trastuzumab uptake rate of 400 units of trastuzumab by nanoparticle. C57BL\/6 mice were administered with docetaxel 1.9 mg\/kg and trastuzumab 160 ng\/kg or a mixture of free drugs or as liposomes at the same dose by intraperitoneal injection. Blood was collected 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h, 8h and 24h after injection and plasma was analyzed by HPLC-UV with Paclitaxel as internal standard. For each treatment group, pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure metrics were calculated using PKanalix&#174;: half-life T1\/2, elimination rate constant Kel and area under the curve AUC at the end points (AUCtlast) and infinity (AUCinfinity). Statistical tests were performed with Sigmastats&#174;. The results showed a marked change in pharmacokinetics with increased plasma exposure with liposomal docetaxel. Preliminary results show a longer half-life for liposomal docetaxel (40.76 h VS. 4.33 h, i.e., a 9.4-fold increase). The concentration of docetaxel appeared to decrease more rapidly between T1h and T6h with free docetaxel (Kel 0.16h-1) than with liposomal docetaxel (Kel 0.017h-1). The concentration of docetaxel reached a plateau over time, up to 24 hours (52.72&#177; 9.45 ng\/ml) in mice treated with immunoliposomes whereas Docetaxel was undetectable at T24h when treated with free drugs. There was a statistical difference in PK at T6h between liposomal docetaxel and free docetaxel, 69.86 &#177; 15.25 ng\/ml and 53.67 &#177; 4.92 ng\/ml, respectively (p &#60; 0.001, non-paired t-test). Liposomal docetaxel showed higher AUC0-t (x3.75) and AUC0-&#8734; values (x5.9) compared to non-liposomal docetaxel. In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest that we have developed a promising immunoliposome for the systemic delivery of docetaxel in HER2+ breast cancer with sustained exposure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Docetaxel,Pharmacokinetics,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

However, obtaining more clinically relevant pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy data for antibodies is still challenging in preclinical phase. Humanized FcRn (hFcRn) transgenic mouse model has a more faithful catabolism compared to WT mice, providing more accurate and predictable PK data of innovative antibody-based therapeutics at discovery stage<sup>[1]<\/sup>. In this study, we sought to investigate pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity characteristics of anti-PD-1 antibody in hFcRn transgenic mice and provide guidance for its differentiation of prediction value for drug PK and safety by comparing to WT mice.<br \/>Methods: Non-tumor bearing hFcRn mice and wild type C57BL\/6 mice were divided into 2 groups, 5 mice were enrolled into each group. Mice were administered anti-PD-1(Nivolumab) at 10 mg\/kg single dose after grouping by intravenous (IV) injection. Blood samples at 12 timepoints (15min, 6h, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 days) post-dosing were collected for PK and Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) analysis by MSD and ELISA.<br \/>Results: Nivolumab clearance in hFcRn mice followed a typical linear profile with rapid distribution phase and slow elimination phase (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> = 350 to 400 h). While the PK profile in C57BL\/6 mice displayed non-linear clearance and very short elimination phase (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> = 45 to 50 h). This data demonstrated that hFcRn mice have better correlated half-life with human (Nivolumab single dose by IV with 10mg\/kg, t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> = 595 h)<sup> [2]<\/sup>.<br \/>ADA analysis revealed that it was produced starting from Day 10 in wild type C57BL\/6 mice and the frequency of ADA induced by Nivolumab in wild type mice (2\/5) was higher than hFcRn mice (0\/5). The variation of Nivolumab level was correlated with ADA production in wild type mice. This suggested hFcRn shows lower immunogenicity than wild type mice for human IgG drug and can potentially improve negative effect of ADA interference on PK evaluation.<br \/>Conclusion: The result of this study demonstrated that the PK data in hFcRn mouse model was more predictive of human PK profile compared to wild type C57BL\/6 mice.

Understanding agonist-binding characteristics, pharmacokinetics, T cell subpopulation activation and differentiation kinetics, T cell life span in the tumor microenvironment, and the impact of T cell\/tumor interactions on tumor growth kinetics is crucial for the positive clinical outcomes of T cell agonists. Currently there is not a suitable model to describe these complex interactions.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We investigated the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-tumor efficacy of an anti-TNFR2 agonist, HFB3-1, and an anti-OX40 agonist, HFB10-1, in syngeneic tumor models. Flow cytometry was employed to profile post-treatment tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in dissociated tumor tissues. In vitro binding affinity was determined using Biolayer Interferometry. A semi-mechanistic model, integrating PK, tumor growth, and immune interaction networks (interactions among Teff, Treg, and tumor cells), was developed in Berkeley Madonna (version 10.5.1). This was subsequently adapted to a human tumor growth model with T cell interaction networks to assess the impact of doses and dosing regimens on tumor growth inhibition.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A semi-mechanistic PKPD model was successfully developed incorporating drug properties including binding affinity, agonistic effect, ADCC activity, and pharmacokinetics, and tumor growth characteristics including tumor growth kinetics, TIL composition, interaction, proliferation, and turnover. This model was applied to investigate the effect of Fc&#947;R, dose, and dosing frequency on <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy. Following incorporation of human PK and human tumor microenvironment properties into the model, tumor growth characteristics were simulated under varying human dosing regimens. Simulation results indicated that lower and less frequent doses optimize T cell co-stimulation for optimal anti-tumor activity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our semi-mechanistic PKPD model elucidates the intricate interactions between T cell co-stimulatory agonists and the tumor-immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. The model advocates for pulsatile agonism as the optimal anti-tumor activity for T cell co-stimulation agents. This model serves as a valuable tool for guiding dose and dose regimen optimization for T cell co-stimulatory agonists in clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Modeling,Immunostimulation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a negative regulator of T-cell signaling that has recently emerged as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. Inhibition of HPK1 can restore T cell function and anti-tumor immune responses, and several HPK1 inhibitors are currently under pre-clinical development, or clinical evaluation. Identifying clinically useful pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers in response to HPK1 inhibition is critical to characterize exposure-response relationship in early-phase trials and inform dose selection for later-phase studies. However, development and implementation of clinical PD assays are challenging because high sensitivity and specificity are required. Here, we developed a multi-biomarker strategy that combines a proximal biomarker (SLP-76 (Ser376) phosphorylation, a specific substrate of HPK1) and distal biomarkers (cytokine production) to evaluate target engagement (TE) and establish proof of mechanism (POM) of HPK1 inhibitors to determine their comprehensive PD profile. These PD biomarker assays were developed using peripheral blood as a surrogate tissue to assess HPK1 inhibition-induced pSLP-76 level decrease and cytokine levels increase, thus reflecting drug inhibitory effects and T-cell activity recovery. However, the lack of basal levels of these biomarkers presented a challenge for clinical workflow, as ex-vivo T-cell receptor stimulation of the clinical specimen is required after collection. Phosphoflow cytometry was prioritized over several technology platforms evaluated for quantifying blood pSLP-76 levels because of superior assay performance and signal stability under the developed clinical workflow. Blood cytokines upregulated upon HPK1 inhibition were first identified using targeted proteomics. IFN&#947;, IL2, TNF&#945;, and IL17A were next confirmed and validated using quantitative immunoassays. Both pSLP-76 and whole blood cytokine workflows were thoroughly optimized for every step of sample handling from specimen processing at clinical sites to sample analysis at testing lab to ensure standardized, precise, and robust assay performance for clinical application. In addition, consistent HPK1 inhibition potency values were achieved using blood from cancer patients, demonstrating that the established PD biomarker assays apply to the clinical target population. In conclusion, robust peripheral TE and POM biomarkers were successfully developed to support future phase I\/II studies with HPK1 inhibitors. These are expected to enable characterization of the exposure-response relationships and help define the therapeutic window and optimal dose.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{8D8F13DE-668C-4A0B-8FC1-B3127E1130DF}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Pharmacodynamics,Immunotherapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Neuropathy is a side effect defined by the injury of peripheral nerves causing a loss of sensation\/motion. Drug development pipelines typically involve testing in cell lines followed by animal investigations with translation to humans. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have widened new model systems to study adverse toxicities. With evolution in regulatory guidance the use of human- iPSC-derived tissue provides high-throughput access and a more relevant testing environment. Neuropathy is one of the most chemotherapy adverse effects. In this study we have screened 8 compounds. Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor), gemcitabine (approved ovarian cancer treatment), ivermectin (parasitic diseases treatment), flavopiridol (approved CDKs inhibitors), SNS-032 (approved CDKs inhibitor), mefloquine (anti-malaria drug), digitonin (nonionic detergent) and tamoxifen (hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treatment). These molecule toxicities were tested on neuronal-derived iPSCs Dopaneurone, GABAneurone, Glutaneurone, Motorneurone, Microglya and Astrocytes in high throughput screening. For the project, cells were plated in 384 well\/plates. DMSO tolerance was performed (up to 10%). Drugs were added, then, after 48h or 72h, total protease and protease activities were measured using CytoTox-Glo<sup>TM<\/sup>. Compounds were tested at 7 concentrations (from 10<sup>-4 <\/sup>to 10<sup>-9<\/sup>M).In this study we have validated cell culture and the assay conditions. The signal window range was good after 48h and 72h of treatment. No toxicity was found until 10% DMSO. A specific neurotoxicity signature was measurable for each drug tested. Digitonin, our positive control, induced toxicity in all IPSCs after 48h and 72h of incubation. On the contrary, Tamoxifen, our negative control, did not induce any neurotoxicity. The other molecules generated a signature of severe to mild neurotoxicity. These results are in agreement with their known adverse side-effects. In conclusion, this panel is a good tool to anticipate possible neurotoxicity within the 3Rs respect. It can be used in early drug de-risking or neuroprotection screening, with the aim of preventing\/reducing\/curing neuropathy in at-risk populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical testing,In vitro,Safety,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

OBI-992 is designed to have high serum stability and broad therapeutic index.

PK\/PD properties, including systemic and tumor exposures as well as receptor occupancy, were evaluated in a human lung cancer xenograft model. In vitro toxicity testing, including ADC toxicity on differentiating neutrophils and Fc&#947;R mediated toxicity, was evaluated using human monocyte THP-1 cells.

A PK\/PD study in tumor-bearing mice revealed that OBI-992 exhibited higher tumor exposure of free payload than Dato-DXd, resulting in a better antitumor efficacy. In addition, the antitumor effect positively correlated with percentage of receptor occupancy in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that OBI-992 had lower toxicity in differentiating neutrophils and THP-1 cells compared to Dato-DXd, suggesting that OBI-992 may cause less off-target toxicity. Toxicokinetics of OBI-992 in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that the systemic exposure of ADC was similar to that of total antibody. Furthermore, the systemic exposure of ADC and total antibody were found to increase in a dose-proportional manner. Major toxicities in monkeys were target-related skin lesions.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is induced by most antineoplastic agents, affecting cancer patients during or following completion of treatment. Neuropathy-specific pain medication is most often inefficient against pain, can cause major side effects that limit their use, do not address non-pain related symptoms, and do not stop CIPN progression. Most evidence suggests that physical exercise is the most efficient approach to reduce neuropathy symptoms and potentially, progression. Other publications have causally linked exercise, through the ability of contracting muscles to release low levels of interleukin-6 into the bloodstream thereby activating several metabolic and physiological pathways that help regenerate muscle and nerve tissue, affect glucose homeostasis, increase lipolysis, improve microvascular blood flow and reduce inflammation. Preclinical disease models of CIPN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) have confirmed that IL-6 administered at low doses is capable of stimulating peripheral nerve growth, thereby ameliorating motor and sensory functions and normalizing the associated pain or sensation disturbance of neuropathy. The maximum tolerated (MTD) dose of recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) has been established as a treatment for thrombocytopenia in hundreds of cancer patients using the drug product that was produced in the 1990&#8217;s (Process A) dosed intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC). We have developed a cGMP compliant version of rhIL-6 (SON-080) using a state-of-the-art process (Process B) that meets current regulatory guidelines for cell lines and processes. An analytical comparison of SON-080 with Process A rhIL-6 concluded that both drugs are highly comparable for at least 14 different key physicochemical characteristics. Therefore, we expect similar <i>in vivo <\/i>behavior with Process B material as compared with the Process A molecule. In order to support clinical plans for the safety and toxicity of rhIL-6, a dose range and schedule of administration that matches the current clinical protocol was performed in a cynomolgus monkey primate toxicology model. Under these conditions, SON-080 was found safe and well tolerated with a No Adverse Effect Levels (NOAEL) of 30&#181;g\/kg, the highest dose tested. On this basis, a fully controlled Phase 1b\/2a clinical study, SB211, is ongoing to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous SON-080 dosage and administration schedule that targets an exposure mirroring the endogenous release levels elicited by moderate to heavy exercise. Confirmation of safety in the first portion of the trial will pave the way for efficacy evaluation with the objective to provide CIPN patients with a novel, safe, and effective treatment for painful neuropathies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-6,Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy,Nonhuman Primate,Toxicokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The BBB desynchronizes drug concentrations between the body and brain, complicating the relationships between drug dose, effective concentration, and toxicity. In this work, we sought to understand the nature of these relationships in the context of dose schedule, in order to suggest minimally toxic and maximally effective strategies. We developed a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model to simulate the exchange of a drug between the body and the brain. Drug exchange was based on passive diffusion through the barrier and active transport into the brain as described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In the model, tumor cells exhibit binary resistance to the drug under a logistic growth model. The drug reduces the growth rate of the sensitive population while the resistant population suffers a small growth penalty because of the mutation conferring resistance. Strategy effectiveness was quantified in terms of survival time, the time until 95% of carrying capacity was reached, and toxicity was evaluated as the peak moving average over 18 days. Although the BBB complicates prediction of drug action, it simplifies drug impact by masking schedule effects. Our work suggests that drug concentrations in the brain increase with initial treatment until equilibrium between active transport, diffusion, and drug metabolism is reached. Fluctuations in drug concentration resulting from breaks between bolus dosing are greatly reduced in the brain relative to the body, and high frequency (daily) dosing results in a nearly constant equilibrium drug concentration. The rate at which equilibrium is reached and the drug concentration in the brain are unaffected by dosing period, as long as the average dose per day is constant. Our model suggests that the impact of dosing cycle length on survival time is negligible. Neutropenia is minimized by schedules with dosing cycle lengths that factor evenly into the 18-day neutrophil recovery period. These schedules have consistent toxicity throughout. Strategies with two, three, six, nine, and eighteen day cycles induce neutropenia least. As fluctuations in drug concentration are small at the equilibrium steady-state, effects of scheduling on drug interactions are predicted to be minimal. As drug concentration in the brain at equilibrium and latency to equilibrium are independent of dosing period, these parameters must be modulated through changes in the amount of drug dosed. The use of a loading dose may compensate for latency. Although this analysis is based on hypothetical drugs, it provides practical insights that are applicable across a wide range of systemically dosed small-molecule therapeutics. Further, the modeling framework derived here can be readily extended to guide the design of dosing schedules for real-world therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Blood-brain barrier,Pharmacokinetics,Resistance,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Nevertheless, adverse events, still limit the use of ADCs. The tox profile of an ADC is determined by its on- and off-target effects. On-target tox is caused by specific binding of the ADC to healthy target-positive cells; off-target tox is caused by target-independent binding of the ADC, e.g. via the Ab backbone or by payload release in circulation. In this study, we unravel the off-target tox mechanisms of ADCs that use amatoxins (RNA polymerase II inhibitor) as payload (ATACs) and use this knowledge to improve the TW of ATACs. Amatoxins are distinct from other ADC payloads as they are hydrophilic and thus require active transport to pass the cell membrane. The primary transporter of amatoxins in humans is the OATP1B3 transporter, which is exclusively expressed on hepatocytes. Thus, unspecific ATAC tox can be caused by free amatoxin, premature released in circulation and uptake by liver cells via OATP1B3, or by uptake of the ATAC via a yet unknown mechanism.<br \/>Material and Methods: ATACs are based on cysteine-reactive and site-specific amatoxin-linker constructs by HDP. <i>In vitro<\/i>: Binding of ATACs to Fc&#947;RI by BLI; Cytotoxicity of ATACs on HEKwt, HEK-OATP1B3 and THP1 cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>: Single i.v. dose of ATAC; Tolerability in mice; Efficacy in s.c. tumor models; Blood sampling for PK analysis; ADC\/total Ab detection by ELISA; DAR-loss analysis and toxin measurement by (intact) LC-MS.<br \/>Results: Liver tox caused by premature release of amatoxin in circulation was investigated thoroughly <i>in vivo<\/i>. DAR-loss, survival analysis, ADC and Ab measurements, indicated that the release of amatoxin in circulation cannot be the root-cause for off-target ATAC toxicity. Further, it was ruled out that the ATAC is taken up by OATP1B3 <i>in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo.<\/i> Thus, uptake of the intact ATAC via yet unknown mechanisms is responsible for liver tox. As liver tox is also known for other ADCs, several uptake mechanisms are described, one of which being Fc&#947;R-mediated uptake. Indeed, ATACs bind to the Fc&#947;R and trigger target-independent cytotoxicity on Fc&#947;R<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Point mutations at L234 and L235 (LALA mutation), the amino acids in the Fc part of the Ab responsible for Fc&#947;R binding, were shown to reduce Fc&#947;R binding. The LALA mutation significantly increased the tolerability of ATACs in mice and monkeys, whereas the anti-tumor efficacy was not impaired, leading to an improved TW.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data show that liver toxicity of ATACs is caused by unspecific uptake of the ATAC into liver cells at least partially mediated by Fc&#947;R. This knowledge was used to optimize the Ab backbone to minimize unspecific uptake into liver cells. Insertion of a LALA mutation to avoid uptake via Fc&#947;R reduced off-target toxicity of ATACs leading to better tolerability and an increased TW.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Toxicity,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Our previous research, demonstrated through simulation, indicated that an extended-interval dosing regimen (840 mg every 6 weeks) after two standard loading doses maintained efficacy with a nonsignificant exposure-response relationship with AESI.In alignment with the FDA's initiative &#34;Project Optimus,&#34; which aims to optimize drug dosing for improved therapeutic outcomes, we explore alternative dosage regimens for atezolizumab. Through a comparison of the traditional 30-year-old industry standard NONMEM software and the recently developed PumasAI software, we simulate these regimens, utilizing our previously published article as a benchmark. Given the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, it is crucial for pharmacokinetic modeling to adapt and leverage these advancements.

This makes it an attractive target for cancer treatment. In synovial sarcoma (SS), SS18-SSX fusion protein drives disease progression and integrates into BAF complexes, promoting tumor growth. Targeting BRD9 degradation is a potential therapeutic approach for SS tumors, as it depletes the essential SS18-SSX fusion protein upon which cancer cells depend for survival within the BAF complex.<br \/>FHD-609, a potent heterobifunctional degrader of BRD9, has been administered intravenously (IV) in medical facilities twice weekly during clinical trials. In order to facilitate less frequent and more convenient patient-centric dosing, a long acting injectable formulation was developed that allows subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) dosing every 4 weeks in preclinical studies. The formulation is an aqueous microsuspension containing the drug along with a polymer and surfactant which provides sustained release of FHD-609 upon injection. We compared the long acting injectable formulation dosed once every 4 weeks to the IV formulation dosed twice a week for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the efficacy of the long in xenograft models of different sensitivities, including cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Our results showed that a single dose of the injectable suspension formulation was well-tolerated in mice and exhibited a significantly flatter PK profile than IV injection with a lower peak to trough ratio and detectable compound concentrations 4 weeks post dose. Moreover, it demonstrated comparable in vivo efficacy and BRD9 protein degradation to the standard intravenous (IV) administration. The long acting FHD-609 injectable formulation has the potential to offer better patient compliance and acceptance in clinical settings than IV dosing. The long acting injectable formulation provides a promising and effective drug delivery option for various protein degraders that are not orally bioavailable.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Meiyun Lin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ammar Adam<sup><\/sup>, Abira Pyne Ramakrishnan<sup><\/sup>, Hafiz Ahmad<sup><\/sup>, Xiaohuan Wu<sup><\/sup>, Brandon Antonakos<sup><\/sup>, Chong-Hui Gu<sup><\/sup>, Ashish Ramani<sup><\/sup>, Victoria Amaral<sup><\/sup>, Claudia Dominici<sup><\/sup>, Qianhe Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Mike Collins<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Piel<sup><\/sup>, Sal Topal<sup><\/sup>, Brian Ethell<sup><\/sup>, Kelly McKiernan<sup><\/sup>, Scott Innis<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Foghorn Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d6362db3-37e4-4280-8a81-631fd551a696","ControlNumber":"7291","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

DNA damage repair inhibitors (DDRi) induce on- and off-target adverse events including hematological and gastro-intestinal toxicities<sup>1<\/sup>, which impact the therapeutic window. We evaluated the hematopoietic effect of ATRi tuvusertib and ATMi lartesertib, alone and in combination, on erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid bone marrow cell lineages.<br \/>Methods: Mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells were plated in 96-well plates in specific media cultures allowing growth and differentiation of all three lineages. The cells were cultured for a total of 7 (neutrophils and platelets) to 10 (erythroids) days in the absence of drugs to generate maturing populations. Various concentrations of tuvusertib and lartesertib were incubated in cell media and assessed using LC\/MS methods to ensure they remained chemically stable for the duration of the experiments. After <i>in vitro<\/i> differentiation, the lineages were cultured in the continuous presence of various concentrations of tuvusertib (0.003 to 3 &#181;M) and\/or lartesertib (0.01 to 10 &#181;M) encompassing an unbound plasma concentration range evaluated in phase 1 studies of these agents and their combination. Cells were evaluated in triplicate by flow cytometry on day 3 and 7 of drug exposure for neutrophils (CD34, CD38, CD33, CD15), megakaryocytes and platelets (CD41, CD42b), and erythroid cells (CD71, CD235a). In another set of experiments, to simulate a \"drug holiday\", cells were exposed to tuvusertib, lartesertib and their combination for 24 h, washed out and further cultured as described above before evaluation.<br \/>Results: Tuvusertib and lartesertib were stable in the specific media cultures up to day 7 of drug exposure. Continuous treatment with tuvusertib as a single agent inhibited the hematopoietic cells of all lineages more profoundly than lartesertib as monotherapy. Effects were consistently more pronounced after 7 days than 3 days of drug exposure. Continuous treatment of a combination of tuvusertib and lartesertib inhibited hematopoietic cells of all lineages. Treatment for 24 h followed by wash-out demonstrated a lesser effect compared to continuous treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: The phenotypic and functional changes induced by tuvusertib and lartesertib on <i>in vitro<\/i> cultures of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic cells are consistent with clinical observations in monotherapy studies,<sup> <\/sup>suggesting these models may be used to better understand and predict the hematological effects of monotherapies and combinations in the clinic. <i>In vitro<\/i> washout experiments may help support the concept of intermittent clinical regimens and warrant further investigation.<br \/>1.

Entresto, a combination of sacubitril and valsartan (Sac\/Val), offers a multi-modal approach. It enhances the beneficial response of the neurohormonal system of the heart while curbing the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and mitigating further cardiac damage by decreasing sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. The objective of this study is to assess the potential cardioprotective effects of Entresto on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) in a mouse model of breast cancer. To achieve this, a syngeneic tumor model of breast cancer was employed. Twenty-five 10-week-old female Balb\/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, Tumor, Tumor + entresto, Tumor + Dox, and Tumor + entresto + Dox. Tumor groups were injected with 4T1 wild-type cells into the mammary fat pad via intraperitoneal injection. Subsequently, after a week, Dox groups were treated with Dox at 8 mg\/kg body weight\/week for 3 weeks, while control and tumor + entresto received saline. Following Dox treatment, control, and tumor + Dox animals were gavaged daily with saline, while Entresto groups were gavaged with entresto (60 mg\/kg) for 3 weeks. Echocardiography assessed cardiac function at baseline and 3 weeks post-DOX treatment. All mice were euthanized at 4 weeks. Our results demonstrated that entresto treatment significantly ameliorated Dox-induced decreases in ejection fraction and fractional shortening while maintaining improved cardiac functions. Entresto also reversed Dox-induced altered levels of cardiac biomarkers (ANP and BNP). Gene and protein expression analyses in heart tissues revealed that entresto modulated the levels of autophagy-related (Beclin-1 and p62), apoptosis-associated (caspase 3 and Bcl-2) and antioxidant-related (Nrf2 and Keap1): genes and proteins expression altered by Dox treatment. Additionally, Entresto attenuated histological evidence of cellular toxicity, apoptosis, and fibrosis in Dox-treated animals with breast cancer. These findings suggest that Entresto confers cardiac protection against DIC in a mouse model of breast cancer without interfering with the antineoplastic effects of Dox. It underscores the potential clinical relevance of Entresto to enhance the safety and efficacy of doxorubicin-based cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-06 Preclinical toxicology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Doxorubicin,Cardiotoxicity,Breast cancer,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
