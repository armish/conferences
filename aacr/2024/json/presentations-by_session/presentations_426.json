[{"Abstract":"Introduction:<i> <\/i><b><\/b>Disseminated cancer cells (DCC) can be detected years before metastatic manifestation in bone marrow of lung cancer patients. Although a consensus protocol has been established, the impact of markers and methods for DCC detection are still not settled. We recently found that EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup> DCC detected by immunofluorescence (IF) outperform the classical immunocytologic (IC) detection by cytokeratin (CK) antibodies regarding prognostic impact. However, it remained unclear whether this difference resulted from biological traits associated with EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup> <i>vs<\/i> CK<sup>+<\/sup> DCC or from methodological reasons. We therefore performed a side-by-side comparison of IC <i>vs<\/i> IF for CK and EpCAM.<br \/>Methods: <b><\/b>We prospectively collected bone marrow (BM) aspirates from 56 non-metastasized NSCLC patients that underwent tumor resection with curative intention. After density gradient centrifugation, we analyzed the mononucleated cells by (i) IC using the anti-CK antibody A45-B\/B3 and (ii) by IF using the anti-CK antibody A45-B\/B3 and the anti-EpCAM antibody HEA-125. IF signals were captured and objectively quantified using ImageJ, whereas IC was evaluated by two independent observers. Marker-positive cells were isolated and subjected to Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) and whole genome sequencing for assessment of copy number alterations (CNA). Survival analysis was performed for progression-free survival (PFS), tumor-specific survival (TSS) and overall-survival (OS) after a median follow-up time of 72.5, 78.7, 78.7 months, respectively.<br \/>Results: IC and IF revealed the presence of CK<sup>+<\/sup> DCCs in 37.5% and 41.1% of cases, respectively (P=0.34). IF identified EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup> DCCs in 55.4% of patients, resulting in a 63.8% DCC-positivity rate found by IF, when combined with CK. The average number of DCCs per million MNC, the DCC density (DCCD), was 0.92, 0.93 and 1.44 for CK<sub>IC<\/sub> and CK<sub>IF <\/sub>and for EpCAM<sub>IF<\/sub>, respectively. No association was found between CK<sub>IC<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> DCCs and PFS, TSS or OS. In contrast, detection of EpCAM<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> and\/or CK<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> DCCs showed a trend towards reduced PFS (P=0.055), TSS (P=0.225) and OS (P=0.155). Subgroup analysis revealed that both EpCAM<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+ <\/sup>and CK<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> cells were correlated with worse PFS (P=0.016 and P=0.040, respectively) and TSS (P=0.033 and P=0.008, respectively). CK<sub>IF<\/sub>-positivity was also associated with worse OS (P=0.014), whereas EpCAM was not. CK<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> DCCs remained an independent prognostic variable for TSS and OS upon multivariate testing (hazard ratio: 6.45 and 3.31, respectively), while EpCAM<sub>IF<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> was not. The IF-marker-defined cell phenotypes exhibited comparable frequencies and distributions of CNAs across the entire genome (~50% of cells).<br \/>Conclusions: <b><\/b>Detection of CK<sup>+<\/sup> DCC by quantified IF analysis apparently outperforms CK detection by IC in survival analysis.

Its overexpression in various cancers, including mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung, is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, evasion of apoptosis, metastasis, and resistance to treatments. Mucin16 (MUC16) belongs to a family of proteins that play a crucial role in cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses. In cancer, alterations in mucin expression and structure may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by enhancing cell survival and immune evasion. Mesothelin is known to interact with mucins, influencing tumor cell behavior and metastatic potential. More specifically, the MSLN\/MUC16 interaction facilitates tumor cell invasion and peritoneal spread in ovarian cancer. However, reliable molecular tools to study protein interactions have been scarce. Here, we relied on the Naveni&#174; <i>in situ<\/i> proximity ligation technology to identify MSLN\/MUC16 in various cancer samples. The method detects proteins located within interaction range (&#60;40 nm) by means of antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotides that create amplified fluorescent signal. Since the technique does not compromise the structural integrity of tissues, communication between proteins can be studied in their native environment.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: Human FFPE tissue microarrays (TMA) with ovarian primary carcinoma and matched metastatic cancer (80 cores) and ovarian cancer tissue with normal tissue (100 cores) were deparaffinized and subjected to standard heat-induced antigen retrieval and blocking. Staining against the MSLN\/MUC16 interaction was performed with the NaveniFlex Tissue MR Atto647N kit (Navinci Diagnostics). Co-staining antibodies against pan-Cytokeratin and Ki67 were included in the detection mix. Immunofluorescence (IF), using the same MSLN and MUC1 primary antibodies, was completed on an additional slide of each TMA, and then secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor&#8482; 488 and 594 were used for detection. Imaging was performed on an Olympus scanner VS200.<br \/>Results &#38; Discussion: In this study, we showed that the interaction is abundant in ovarian cancer, with a distinguishable difference in the signal presence between cancerous and normal adjacent tissue. Furthermore, the additional tumor marker co-stainings give insights into the tumor invasion and growth. When comparing the Naveni&#174; signal of MSLN\/MUC16 against IF staining of each, the Naveni&#174; signal shows true interactions, as opposed to expression patterns. Understanding the roles of mesothelin and mucin in cancer, both individually and in interaction, is crucial for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic tools. Further research on their interaction and specific molecular pathways triggered by it is essential for devising effective strategies to combat cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,MUC16,Mesothelin,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Immunogenic changes in cancer cells induced by RT can lead to adaptive up-regulation of PD-L1 expression. As immune checkpoint inhibition plays an increasingly important role in prostate cancer, radiogenic PD-L1 upregulation may be of therapeutic importance. The aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 status on CETCs before and during RT.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> Peripheral blood samples were collected from 52 primary non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.

We found a correlation between PD-L1 status in CETCs and aggressiveness of cancer disease prior to RT. The frequency of PD-L1 positive CETCs depended on the grading and Gleason score of the primary tumor. Patients with a high Gleason score and G3 tumors had significantly more PD-L1 positive CETCs compared to patients with a low Gleason Score and G1 tumors. Moreover, patients in stage I\/II had significantly less PD-L1 positive CETCs compared to patients in stage III\/IV (mean 54.25 vs. mean 69.65; p&#60;0.05). A higher number of PD-L1 positive CETCs were detected in patients who had radical prostatectomy before start of RT than in those who had no surgical intervention (mean 66.24 vs. mean 47.46; p&#60;0.01). Interestingly, the fraction of PD-L1 positive CETCs decreased significantly during RT only in patients with G3 tumors and a high Gleason Score.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b> Our results indicated that PD-L1 in CETCs is closely related to the aggressiveness of the primary tumor and may be a co-factor associated with the progression of prostate cancer. PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade combined with RT represents a novel and promising treatment strategy that could contribute to improve the treatment efficacy of prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,PD-L1,Radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Over the past few decades, the incidence rate of CRC in individuals younger than 50 has been steadily increasing. Currently, diagnostic biomarkers play an important role in the detection and treatment of CRC. MAGE-A3 has been shown to be expressed in many tumor types, including colon cancer by RNA expression. Due to their high sequence homology, members of the MAGEA family have been difficult to evaluate and screen for their protein expression. However, in a previous study, highly specific antibodies were identified using CytoSections for MAGE-A3 immunohistochemistry. IL-1&#946; is a cytokine that induces inflammatory responses and when localized to the nucleus in colon cancer cells it can promote stemness. IL-1&#946; expression has been shown to be increased in wildtype IDH1 positive glioblastoma. However, the relationship between IL-1&#946; and IDH1 has not been studied in colon cancer. In this study, the difference in the expression of MAGE-A3, IL-1&#946;, and wildtype IDH1 compared to mutant IDH1-R132H in colon cancer tissues was evaluated. The results show that IL-1&#946;, wildtype IDH1, and MAGE-A3 were co-expressed in 27 of the 38 colon cancer tumors. However, IDH1-R132H expression was only seen in 20% of the tumors. This study suggests that MAGE-A3, IL-1&#946;, and IDH1 are candidate biomarkers for immunotherapy due to their high expression in colon cancer tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Immunohistochemistry,Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Exosomes, a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles released by tumor cells, can promote distal metastatic site development and could have promising diagnostic applications. However, the mechanisms controlling exosome secretion by cancer cells remain to be determined, which impedes clinical development. The actions of protein-folding chaperones could facilitate tumor exosome formation, payload loading, and extracellular release. Protein folding complexes link the expression of tumor-promoting oncogenes with the proteins driving oncogenic cancer behavior. Of these, the eukaryotic type II chaperonin, Chaperonin-Containing TCP-1 (CCT), folds many of the oncoproteins (e.g., KRAS, MYC, CDKs, STAT3, etc.) responsible for cancer growth and invasion. CCT is a complex machine composed of eight subunits, each encoded by a unique gene (cct1-8), which folds proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion. We and others showed that CCT is upregulated in breast, lung, and prostate cancer cells as well as neuroblastoma, leading to alterations in apoptosis, migration, cell morphology, and proliferation. Using T47D breast cancer and PC3 and 22rV1 prostate cancer cells, we exogenously expressed or depleted the second subunit of the CCT complex (CCT2). With these cells, we isolated exosomes from culture media by membrane-based affinity binding and examined exosomal RNA and protein content. In exosomes from prostate and breast cancer cells, we found abundant CCT2 subunit mRNA and protein in CD63+ exosomes ranging from 50 to 120 microns in size. When CCT2 was exogenously expressed in breast and prostate cancer cells, CCT2 mRNA and protein were higher in exosomes than other CCT subunits, and CCT2 was randomly distributed throughout the size range of exosomes. Of interest, an increase in CD63+ small exosomes (50-75 microns) was evident in cancer cells exogenously expressing CCT2 compared to mock-transfected and parental controls, suggesting a role for CCT2 in the exosomal secretory pathway. FACS-sorted CD63+ exosomes subjected to mass spectrometry yielded distinct protein content based on CCT2 expression. These findings are the first report of CCT2 driving exosome secretion in cancer cells and suggest that exosomes containing CCT2 RNA and protein are associated with metastatic potential. Exosomal CCT2 thus represents a promising diagnostic indicator for a liquid biopsy approach to monitor cancer recurrence and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein with a putative tumor suppressor function, plays a pivotal role in Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition (EMT). It affects cell motility indicators and promotes cytoskeleton reorganization and, ultimately, metastasis when downregulated, corroborating resistance to chemotherapy. The lack of universal markers that can predict the metastatic ability of cancer cells necessitates the evaluation of parameters, such as cell adhesion, viscoelasticity, and stiffness, to serve as unique biophysical metrics that predict cancer cell metastatic potential and elucidate how metastasis and cell mechanics are coupled. Therefore, we utilized fluidic-based single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) and Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) to measure the mechanical properties of single cancer cells with different metastatic potential. To explore the relationship between cell mechanics and metastatic cell behavior, we quantitatively demonstrate the progression of cancer cell biomechanics across different metastatic states using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with varying connexin 43 (Cx43) expression as a model of cells with varying metastatic potential. We measured, at a single-cell level and in real-time, the adhesion and viscoelastic properties of MDA-MB-231 cells and their response to chemotherapy. Our data show that cells with higher metastatic potential (down-regulated Cx43 expression) exhibited a softer, less adherent, and more viscoelastic phenotype, consistent with their metastatic state when in clusters compared to cells at the lower spectrum of metastatic potential (up-regulated Cx43 expression). These mechanical biomarkers are significantly absent in single cells outside of a cluster. Of particular interest, we also observed significant cellular stiffening upon treatment with docetaxel (DTX), a chemotherapeutic agent that targets microtubules, with a rapid and profound response of highly aggressive cells when compared to cells with attenuated metastatic potential. Such treatment schemes could render cancer cells less deformable, potentially impeding their ability to invade and metastasize to other tissues.

DHX36, a kind of helicase, is a new homologous gene of human DNA\/RNA helicase cloned by our laboratory by homologous molecular cloning which used the sequence of the maleless gene (mle) of Drosophila. Studies have shown that DHX36 upregulates the expression of proto oncogene and promotes the occurrence of cancer. At present, there are few studies on DHX36 in lung cancer. This study aims to clarify the relationship between DHX36 and lung cancer and provide a new molecular target for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer.<br \/>Methods: Twenty-eight pairs of clinical tumor samples from lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent tissues were collected, and the protein expression of DHX36 in different tissues was detected by western blot. Correlation between DHX36 expression and survival prognosis of lung cancer patients was analyzed by online database. Over-expression of DHX36 in A549 and H460 cells and knockdown of DHX36 in A549 and H1975 cell lines, then the migration, invasion and growth index of cells were analyzed by real-time cell analyzer. After DHX36 stable knock-down cell line was established in H1975 cells, they were injected into nude mice by subcutaneous injection and tail vein injection respectively at the same time as the control cells, and the growth of subcutaneous tumors and the metastasis of lung tissues in nude mice were recorded and collected respectively. The tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blot.<br \/>Results: In 28 pairs of clinical lung cancer tumor samples, we found that DHX36 was higher in cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues in 23 pairs, which indicated that DHX36 might be a kind of proto oncogene to promote the occurrence and development of lung cancer. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the high expression of DHX36 was related to the low survival of lung cancer patients. The results of RTCA showed that the abilities of growth, invasion and migration of cells in the over-expressed DHX36 groups were higher than those in the control groups. After DHX36 was knocked down, the growth, invasion and invasion of lung cancer cells were inhibited.<br \/>Conclusion: DHX36 is expected to be a new molecular target of lung cancer. Next, we will knock out DHX36 in lung cancer cells to observe the tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Metastasis,Oncogene,Biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"T.

Despite this impact on mortality, drivers of overall metastasis and site-specific organotropism are not well understood in NSCLC. To investigate these questions, we focused on Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common subtype of NSCLC. Although previous efforts have been made to examine LUAD organotropism, we sought to expand upon longitudinal modeling approaches and explore associations in an independent large clinical and genomic annotated cohort.<br \/>Methods: Using the artificial intelligence model from (Kehl et al. 2021), we annotated a clinico-genomic cohort of 2777 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, resulting in 59,177 annotated imaging reports. This resulted in time to metastatic site annotations for each patient, with median of 2 years follow up. Metastatic sites included brain, bone, adrenal, liver, lymph node, and mesentery. All patients were evaluated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and each patient had at least one tumor biopsy sequenced with targeted panel sequencing of 400+ cancer related genes. To infer genomic and clinical correlates of site-specific metastasis, we performed cause-specific and Fine-Gray hazard modeling in this cohort. We used the recurrent event Andersen-Gill model to infer predictors of longitudinal metastasis rates.<br \/>Results: Site-specific analyses yielded genes whose mutant status were significantly associated with a change in risk and\/or rate of certain metastatic sites. We found that NOTCH1 is significantly associated with an increased rate and risk of brain metastases (HR=2.46, P&#60;0.001). SETD2 is associated with decreased incidence of brain (HR=0.42, P&#60;0.001). SMARCA4 is significantly associated with increased incidence and rate of adrenal metastasis (HR=1.64, P&#60;0.01), while NF1 is significantly associated with decreased rate of adrenal metastasis (HR=0.72, P&#60;0.01). In a multivariable model, Female patients and younger patients had a lower rate of new metastatic sites. As previously seen, TP53 and SMARCA4 mutations associated with higher rates of new metastatic sites (HR=1.17, P&#60;0.001; HR=1.36, P&#60;0.001 respectively), and SETD2 is associated with a lower rate of new metastatic sites (HR=0.71, P&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: By using time-to-event analysis with longitudinal metastatic annotations, we identify potential drivers of overall metastasis and site-specific organotropism in LUAD patients. Identification of new associations and concordance of our results with previous studies also supports the utility of artificial-intelligence-annotated datasets, allowing for larger cohorts without the need for manual annotation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Lung adenocarcinoma,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

STK11 is a serine-threonine kinase that is comprised of an N-terminal domain containing a nuclear localization signal, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). In LUAD, STK11 loss of function impacts many aspects of coordinated cell motility and promotes alterations characteristic of metastasis including cell polarity and adhesion. Both kinase activity and subcellular localization are important for STK11 tumor suppressor function. Our objective was to develop a reliable method to identify pathogenic STK11 mutations. Using archival data from the University of Vermont Medical Center, we identified 28 STK11 missense variants that had not yet been functionally characterized. We evaluated the functional impact of these variants on STK11 kinase activity through detection of autophosphorylation using an in-vitro kinase assay, as well as their ability to induce p53 activity through a luciferase reporter. Of the variants studied, 5 were CTD mutations. These variants retained kinase activity and the ability to bind STK11&#8217;s partners STRAD-alpha and MO25 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Although the CTD of STK11 has no catalytic activity, it is thought to be integral for translocation to the cytoplasm where it can colocalize with actin and the cell membrane. STK11 dependent regulation of directional migration requires both proper localization to the actin cytoskeleton and kinase activity. Moreover, it has been reported that the C-terminal polybasic motif of STK11 (aa403-426), consisting of 3 Lysine and 5 Arginine residues is key for its localization and activation of AMPK at the plasma membrane. Therefore, when ascertaining functional status of STK11 in vivo, it is important to consider kinase independent STK11 functions. In LUAD cell lines, we show through immunofluorescent microscopy that expression of a truncated construct encoding STK11 with a CTD deletion results in nuclear sequestration. Additionally, point mutants in 3 of the polybasic motif residues (R409W, K416E and K423E) retain kinase activity and STRAD-alpha binding, but also lead to nuclear sequestration - highlighting the importance of a multipronged approach when assessing STK11 function. Future studies will assess the ability of these C-terminal domain mutants to phosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates, and their impact on cell migration and invasion. Additionally, we will utilize the TurboID proximity ligation system to assess the effect of C-terminal domain point mutations on binding partner accessibility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-02 Biomarkers of metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Lung adenocarcinoma,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe and the United States. In China, its incidence has been dramatically increased over past years. However, the mechanism of PCa progression and metastasis remains unclear. The androgen receptor (AR) has been demonstrated to play an important role in PCa progression and metastasis. We have previously established mouse models of PCa bone metastasis and PCa lung metastasis. We have obtained cell clones with bone-specific or lung-specific metastatic capability. By transcriptomic analysis of highly metastatic cell clones and their parental cells, we found a gene group including islet cell autoantigen 1 (ICA1) that are highly expressed in both metastatic cell clones. We further compared these results with RNA array data in clinical samples. Data comparison and correlation analysis showed that ICA1 was negatively correlated with AR expression. Survival analysis of PCa and lung cancer patients showed higher expression of ICA1 but with shorter overall survival. Down-regulation of ICA1 expression in highly metastatic tumor cells significantly inhibited cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion. ICA1 overexpression in parental RM1 cells apparently increased cell growth, migration, and metastasis. Interestingly, down-regulation of ICA1 also significantly activated AMPK\/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings are anticipated to shed light on the novel pathogenic mechanism underlying PCa and propose a compelling theoretical basis for the application of ICA1 in PCa.

Immunotherapy is a new treatment option but resistance is frequent. We have demonstrated that TNF induces trastuzumab resistance through mucin 4 (MUC4) upregulation and it is an independent biomarker of poor response to therapy in HER2+ breast cancer. MUC4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in metastasis (MTS) dissemination. Here, we evaluated the impact of the axis TNF\/MUC4 on the invasive capacity of TNBC cell lines and in a preclinical model of spontaneous MTS. Finally, we assessed the clinical impact of MUC4 expression in TNBC patients. TNF blockade was achieved with etanercept (E), which blocks the soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane isoform of TNF, or with the dominant negative protein INB03 (DN) which neutralizes only sTNF. BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cell lines treated with E or DN exhibit a decrease in MUC4 expression. To assess the impact of TNF blockade on tumor cells and its effect on the tumor microenvironment, we collected conditioned media (CM) from MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells treated with E or DN which were used to evaluate the invasive capacity of the TNBC cell lines. The invasion of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 was impaired with CM-Eta ( p&#8804;0.01) and CM-DN ( p&#8804;0.01 and p&#8804;0.05, respectively). Female<i> <\/i>BALB\/c mice bearing the TNBC LMM3 tumors were treated with IgG, DN, anti-PD-1 antibodies or DN+anti-PD-1 for two weeks. After the treatments we performed surgery to remove the primary tumor and the animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later. No effect on tumor growth was observed. However, the DN+anti-PD-1 group was the only one with less of 3 MTS per lung ( p&#8804;0.05). We obtained tumor extracts and found that the tumors of the animals treated with DN or DN+anti-PD-1 had decreased MUC4 expression measured by Western blot. We determined the presence of TILs by H &#38; E and the expression of MUC4, Ki67, PD-L1 (SP142), androgen receptor (AR) and cytokeratin 5 by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 56 early TNBC patients. MUC4 expression was inversely correlated with TILs presence (p=0.0003). Since TILs are associated with good prognosis, we evaluated the effect of BT-549-CM and MDA-MB-231-CM on T cell migration. CM-DN from both cell lines increased T cell migration compared to control CM ( p&#8804;0.01). MUC4 expression was inversely correlated with Ki67 ( &#8805;30%, p=0.036), PD-L1 (p=0.001) and AR (p=0.047) in our cohort. Moreover, MUC4 proved to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival (p=0.02), and is associated with a higher MTS risk (p=0.005). MUC4 is associated with poorly-infiltrated TNBC, and sTNF blockade downregulates its expression decreasing MTS when combined with anti-PD-1. We propose the TNF as a new target for the treatment of TNBC, and MUC4 as a predictive biomarker to guide a combined treatment of TNF blockers with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immunotherapy,TNF-&#945;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

In addition, we tested the impact of the pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of proteins and genes associated with TEAD1 activity in ARPC and SCNPC cell lines on TEAD1 expression, cell number, and tumor cell differentiation.<br \/>Results: Transcriptomic analyses revealed a decrease in YAP1, TAZ, LATS2, and TEAD2 and an increase in LATS1, TEAD1 and RBFOX2 transcript levels in SCNPCs compared to ARPCs in SU2C, rapid autopsy metastases, and PDX models. Similar results were observed in ARPC and SCNPC cancer cell lines, in the transplantable LTL331 prostate cancer transdifferentiation model, and scRNAseq of liver CRPC metastases from patients. The decrease in YAP1, TEAD2 and LATS2 expression correlates with increased methylation and the increase in TEAD1 correlates with decreased methylation in SCNPC PDX models, suggesting epigenetic control. The changes in YAP and YAP-associated proteins (most importantly TEAD1) at the epigenetic and transcriptional level were confirmed by IHC analysis comparing ARPC to SCNPC PDX models. Of the four TEAD proteins, TEAD1 expression was increased, with a concomitant decrease in TEAD2 and TEAD3, whereas low levels of TEAD4 transcript are maintained in the SCNPC phenotype. Notably, RBFOX2 was increased in the SCNPC datasets. RBFOX2 is a pre-RNA splicing regulator that promotes the inclusion of exon 6 in TEAD1 mRNAs associated with increased TEAD1 activity. The RBFOX2 spliced TEAD1 was observed in the SCNPC PDX models, while not detected in the ARPC PDX models.<br \/>Conclusions: The conversion of ARPC to SCNPC involves the loss of transcriptional regulators: AR, YAP, and REST inactivation in SCNPC. It also involves the expression of ASCL1 or NEUROD1, well described master regulators that are implicated in the conversion to and maintenance of the SCNPC phenotype. Our work suggests TEAD1 is another transcriptional regulator in SCNPC that warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Prostate cancer,Transcription factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

Indeed, primary tumors which are diagnosed early and treated in a timely manner have the highest rate of success. In contrast, metastatic disease and late diagnosis of tumors portend poor outcomes. Thus, understanding the underlying biology and developing novel therapeutic approaches for metastatic cancers is pivotal. Most cancer-based mutational characteristics are tissue-dependent, and cancers with higher mutational load are generally more susceptible to immunotherapy. We observed that poorly metastatic, murine breast cancer cells established a clear phenotypic difference in lung metastasis formation assays. Upon injection of these cells into immune-proficient mice, few, large metastases developed, whereas in immuno-deficient mice, many small metastases grew instead. To determine the molecular features which enable escape under immune editing, we designed the following workflow. We intravenously injected immune-proficient and immune-deficient mice with our poorly metastatic, murine breast cancer cells. As expected, cells readily engrafted in the lungs, causing a significant reduction in survival of immune-deficient mice. Furthermore, liver metastases were observed only in immune-deficient mice. Upon euthanasia, we resected and dissociated both organs. To isolate the tumor cells from these samples, we flow-sorted and subjected them to next-generation sequencing. To elucidate the epigenomic, genomic, and transcriptomic differences between metastases of each background, we performed ATAC, WGS, and RNAseq, respectively. By dissecting the evolutionary mechanisms which allow cancer cells to evade immune detection in metastasis, we can develop targeted immunotherapy strategies to diminish the spread (and lethality) of metastatic cancers. In the future, we plan to examine the descriptive discrepancies between the tissues reared with and without immune pruning in order to put forward innovative therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Immunomodulation,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

While most prostate cancers respond to androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapies, Aggressive Variant Prostate Cancers (AVPCs), characterized by RB1, Tp53, and\/or PTEN alterations, do not. AVPCs exhibit lineage plasticity in preclinical models, enabling the expression of non-prostate epithelial lineage markers to adapt to therapeutic pressures. However, a measurable definition of lineage plasticity as a potential therapeutic target for clinical trials is currently lacking. To arrive at said definition, we perform single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on lymph node metastases from twelve AVPC patients with matched sample pairs of both pre- and post-treatment. Additionally, we include snRNA-seq data from eight non-AVPC patients as a baseline. Expanding upon our prior establishment of tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) as an indicator of tumor cell lineage plasticity (<i>Nature Biotechnology<\/i>, PMID: 35697807), we employ unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts from individual cells to quantify this plasticity. We reveal a distinct cluster of tumor cells with notably high UMI counts in resistant samples, indicative of a less differentiated state and increased transcriptional diversity. This high-UMI cluster is marked by significant enrichment in pathways associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, one-carbon metabolism, and arginine metabolism pathways. Concurrently, there is a reduction in activity within the androgen receptor (AR) and DNA damage repair pathways. These characteristics suggest an enhanced capacity for lineage switching in AVPC tumor cells, potentially contributing to evasion from targeted therapies. Moreover, immune components within resistant samples consistently display lower UMI counts, indicating a diminished propensity for lineage plasticity.<b> <\/b>In conclusion, we present a better understanding of lineage switching in therapeutic resistance in AVPCs, paving the way for novel treatment strategies in PCa management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Prostate cancer,Lymph node metastasis,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Most prostate cancer deaths are due to metastasis, particularly to the bone. Metastasis occurs when cells from the primary tumor travel through the blood as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and settle in metastatic sites. CTCs are difficult to collect from patients, and understanding the relationships between CTCs and the tumor phenotypes of origin could reveal mechanisms of cancer metastasis. Hence, we utilized several genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of metastatic prostate cancer to evaluate tumor phenotypes and CTCs. We compared the tumor phenotypes of several GEMMs of metastatic prostate cancer and identified a level of heterogeneity among tumors, particularly focusing on a GEMM that demonstrated severe metastasis, especially to the bone. Next, we analyzed CTCs from this GEMM and focused our analysis on transcriptional states that are regulated by proteins called master regulators (MRs). MRs control the expression of groups of genes called regulons, and pharmacologically inhibiting these MRs may lead to reversal of cancer phenotypes. We hypothesized that these MRs may be mechanistic drivers of CTC cell state in prostate cancer metastasis. We investigated MRs enriched in CTCs from mice and screened and validated Lap2, the lamina-associated polypeptide 2 protein, as a regulatory driver in mice with metastatic prostate cancer. Analysis of bulk RNA-seq profiles from primary and metastatic prostate samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Stand Up to Cancer cohorts, respectively, revealed that the regulon-based activity of Lap2 was significantly higher in the latter group. Moreover, analysis of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of CTCs isolated from prostate cancer patients confirmed aberrant Lap2 activity. Finally, the role of Lap2 was assessed in human tissue from an engineered multi-organ-on-a-chip model of metastasis. Silencing of Lap2 production in cells dissociated from mouse CTC-derived organoids inhibited extravasation to the bone in the model, suggesting a critical role for Lap2 in metastasis. Our findings illustrate the unique transcriptional profile of prostate cancer CTCs associated with their metastatic potential. We identified Lap2 as a novel driver of CTC dissemination and metastasis in mice and validated its activity in human prostate cancer, which can aid future therapies to prevent metastatic progression in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,RNA-seq,Master regulator,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Poorly differentiated primary tumors often lead to unfavorable oncologic outcomes due to a heightened likelihood of metastasis to distant organs across various cancers. However, the relationship between stemness traits and metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) remains insufficiently explored. In this investigation, we analyzed bulk RNA-sequencing from microdissected primary tumor specimens and clinical data to pinpoint molecular subtypes linked to distant organ metastasis. Transcriptomic data from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples and available single-cell RNA datasets validated our bulk RNAseq findings. Comprehensive analysis highlighted the molecular traits of GC tied to hematogenous metastasis. Microdissection of primary tumor FFPE samples facilitated bulk RNA sequencing, encompassing samples from 33 metastatic and 31 metastasis-free patients, with 8 paired normal samples. Most samples contained less than 10% of tumor microenvironment (TME) components like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering, we achieved unsupervised subtyping of the gastric cancer gene expression matrix. Permutation tests based on subsampling indicated consistent high-level cophenetic coefficients at k=2, suggesting robust bifurcation of transcriptomic data into two clusters. One showed augmented stemness traits while the other emphasized differentiated mucosal genes, labeled as stemness and differentiated subtypes, respectively. GSEA highlighted a significant boost in the Hallmark angiogenesis score in the stemness subtype, not attributed to endothelial cell infiltration as verified by CIBERSORTx. This subtype also exhibited a marked decrease in hematogenous metastasis-free survival (HMFS) (p=0.008, log-rank test). Further, PDX samples were scrutinized. Post classification of the PDX graft expression matrix via logistic regression, we examined the endothelial cell fraction, determined by CIBERSORTx. Stemness subtype PDX grafts revealed a significant elevation in the host (mouse) endothelial cell fraction (p&#60;0.05). In addition, stemness PDX patient showed significant decreased HMFS (p = 0.03). We also categorized the pseudobulk expression matrix of malignant cells into stemness or differentiated subtypes using GSE183904 scRNA cohort. scRNA sample analysis consistently presented an elevated endothelial cell fraction in the stemness GC subtype. The outcomes suggest a propensity for angiogenesis in the TME of the stemness subtype of GC. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the stemness subtype of GC accelerates hematogenous metastasis, as evidenced through clinical data, bulk RNAseq, PDX, and scRNAseq data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Metastasis,Stemness,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Beyond these, we sought to understand transcriptomic variations of important therapeutic targets implicated in peritoneal organotropism and by extension, resistance to systemic regimens in CRC PM.<br \/>Methodology: FFPE tissue samples from CRC patients were collected during oncological surgical resection of the synchronous PM (cytoreductive surgery [CRS] with or without hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy [HIPEC]), or exploratory laparotomy for palliative surgery, with the majority of patients receiving systemic therapy prior to surgery. Samples were sequenced with whole transcriptomic sequencing. Paired and unpaired T-tests between PT and PM samples were undertaken with log2(fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped [FPKM]) gene expression values.<br \/>Results: Fifty-six (22 primary tumor [PT], 34 peritoneal metastases [PM]) samples from 35 patients, comprising 21 paired PT-PM samples, were included in this analysis. TEAD1 (unpaired T-test, p=0.087; paired T-test, p=0.041), FGFR1 (unpaired T-test, p=0.003; paired T-test, p&#60;0.001), PIK3CA (unpaired T-test, p=0.034; paired T-test, p=0.003), SMAD4 (unpaired T-test, p=0.095; paired T-test, p=0.010), and HAVCR2 (unpaired T-test, p=0.009; paired T-test, p=0.007) were found to be upregulated in the PM. Conversely, MET was found to be downregulated in PM samples (unpaired T-test, p=0.004; paired T-test, p=0.002). There were no significant differences in gene expression profiles of BRAF, RHOA, CD274, CTLA4, PDCD1 and TIGIT between PT-PM (all p&#62;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: Through CRC PT-PM comparisons, we identify potential therapeutic targets implicated in transcoelomic metastasis and provide rationale for development of immunotherapeutic biology and drug discovery for CRC PM. These findings underscore an exigent need to develop intra-peritoneal therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to systemic regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Peritoneal metastasis,Target discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Recombinant antibodies (rAbs) are superior to standard polyclonal and hybridoma-generated monoclonal reagents as they offer reproducible performance and consistent, scalable supply. A major focus of antibody manufacturers is to leverage rAb production strategies to generate antibodies against challenging targets for which there are few, if any, reliable antibodies. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are encoded by more than 820 human genes and represent the largest membrane protein superfamily in the genome. These seven-pass transmembrane domain receptors are involved in a multitude of physiological and pathophysiological processes related to various chronic diseases, including an array of malignancies. Perhaps 30-40% of all therapeutics are directed against GPCR activity, and ~350 of the non-olfactory GPCRs are thought to be potential candidates for drug development. However, for a slew of technical reasons, the development and validation of high-quality antibodies against GPCRs has proven difficult. In an effort to facilitate further research into GPCRs, GeneTex is combining its recombinant antibody production platform with enhanced validation techniques to make specific monoclonal antibodies against GPCRs with direct relevance to cancer and other diseases. GeneTex&#8217;s rAb production protocol employs a multi-parameter fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS)-based methodology to identify and select antigen-specific IgG+ memory B cells from an immunized rabbit (Starkie <i>et al.<\/i>, 2016). The heavy and light chain variable region genes from single cells are amplified, cloned, and co-expressed in mammalian cells to generate a monoclonal IgG. Application-specific testing is performed in conjunction with knockout\/knockdown (KO\/KD), differential expression comparison in cells and tissues, cell fraction enrichment (i.e., membrane extracts versus whole cell extracts), and other methodologies. Antibodies directed against extracellular GPCR domains are validated for specificity using GPCR arrays (CDI Labs, Baltimore, MD). This workflow has resulted in the production of specific antibodies for a number of GPCRs studied by cancer biologists. These include novel recombinant monoclonal antibodies to the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), retinoic acid-induced protein 3 (RAI3), CXC motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), CXCR4, and CXCR7. All of these antibodies were validated for at least two applications, while the specificity of three (i.e., RAI3, CXCR4, and CXCR7) is supported by KO\/KD data. GPCR array data argues for the specificity of the other two antibodies (i.e., DRD2 and CXCR2). This same production\/validation approach will be applied as GeneTex targets the remaining GPCRs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,Tumor biology,Tumor progression,Expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

MTC causes osteoblastic, osteolytic, or mixed lesions, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The <i>RET <\/i>proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor and is the driver oncogene in ~60% of MTC cases where a germline or somatic activating mutation results in ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor. However, the role of RET mutations in the genesis of bone metastasis lesions is unknown. We show that activating <i>RET<\/i> mutations promotes an osteoblastic phenotype in mice implanted with patient-derived MTC cells by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. We found that the radiographic appearance of osteoblastic lesions differed between the types of RET mutations (C634W and M918T). MTC cells with RET<sup>C634W<\/sup> mutation showed a four-fold increase in bone mineral density, trabecular bone volume, number, and thickness with a decreased number of osteoblasts compared to the non-tumor-bearing femur. TRAP staining revealed that osteoclast numbers per long bone were reduced in the injected femur compared to the control. In contrast, the MTC-RET<sup>M918T<\/sup> mutation showed an increased cortical thickness and porosity with reduced medullary area and increased bone formation rate compared to the non-tumor bearing femur. MTC cells formed tumors with extensive mineralized tissue, composed of bone matrix surrounded by osteoblast-like cells and osteoid. The knockdown of RET in the MTC-RET<sup>M918T<\/sup> model significantly reduced cortical thickness and increased the number of osteoclasts per bone surface. We observed increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in MTC-bearing femurs compared to controls, suggesting decreased bone resorption. The factors secreted by MTC cells, including OPG, inhibited osteoclast formation from primary bone marrow cells and Raw264 cells. In addition, RET knockdown by shRNA in MTC cells decreased OPG expression. Moreover, the MTC-conditioned media (CM) increased osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of the primary culture of pre-osteoblasts isolated from calvarial bone, long bones, and MC3T3 cells. The conditioned media of RET-depleted cells inhibits osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. The expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, OPG, and osterix increased in pre-osteoblast incubated with MTC-CM. Compared to primary non-metastatic tumors, the OPG expression increases in tissues of sporadic MTC bone metastases harboring RET<sup>M918T<\/sup> mutation. These results suggest that MTC with RET-activating mutations induces osteoblastic bone metastasis due to decreased bone resorption and increased bone formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,Bone metastasis,Osteoblast,osteoprotegerin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Metastases in existing mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is sporadic and often requires several months of aging. These factors limit these models for basic and pre-clinical research aimed at identifying mechanisms of metastatic disease. We have recently developed two novel mouse models of LUAD that feature constitutively active <i>Kras<\/i>, loss of <i>Trp53 <\/i>function and truncated <i>Dicer1<\/i> in different cell types. The observed survival and metastatic phenotypes of the models are dependent on the cell type in which the genetic alterations are made. We applied spatial proteomics and metabolomics to investigate molecular drivers underlying the phenotypic differences in our models.<br \/>Methods and Results: Mouse models were generated by adding mutations in <i>Dicer1<\/i>, an RNAse III enzyme within the microRNA (miRNA) biosynthesis pathway, to a mouse model of<i> Kras<\/i>-driven LUAD. For both models, tumorigenesis was induced by conditional expression of an oncogenic allele of <i>Kras<\/i>, deletion of both alleles of <i>Trp53<\/i> and deletion of one allele of <i>Dicer1<\/i> in one cell type and the expression of a truncated <i>Dicer1<\/i> allele in a different cell type. Mice expressing <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> and deleted <i>Trp53<\/i> in club cells without <i>Dicer1<\/i> truncation have a reported median survival of 28.6 weeks after tumor induction.<b> <\/b>We observed accelerated development of LUAD and lymph node metastasis (12.1 weeks) only when we induced tumorigenesis in club cells and truncate <i>Dicer1<\/i> in alveolar type II (ATII) cells. Induction of tumorigenesis in ATII cells and truncation of <i>Dicer1<\/i> in club cells did not accelerate tumorigenesis or lead to detectable metastasis. Prelminary spatial proteomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of proteins associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I in the tumors of both models which is consistent with processes of bioenergetic adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions. Gene Ontology annotation term enrichment revealed that the tumors of the two models have distinctive molecular function profiles. Both models show significant disruption of amino acid metabolism but only the model with increased metastatic potential showed apparent disruption in metabolites associated with steroidogenesis.<br \/>Conclusions: Through cell type specific truncation\/deletion of <i>Dicer1<\/i> we have generated a mouse model that rapidly develops <i>Kras<\/i>\/<i>Trp53<\/i> driven LUAD and metastatic disease. Our findings suggest that tumorigenesis and metastasis are influenced by miRNA-mediated communication between different cell types. Additional studies are underway to link miRNA expression in these models to the results reported here for spatial proteomics and metabolomics. We will continue to develop this model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,Mouse models,Lung adenocarcinoma,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

SnoRNAs are required for the 2&#8217;-O-methylation (2&#8217;-O-Me) and pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus being essential for ribosomal biogenesis and function. So far, the role of rRNA methylation (ribomethylation) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pathogenesis is unknown. To investigate the role of ribomethylation we included samples from 92 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (pathological stage IA to IIB) for comprehensive multi-omics profiling. Amongst transcriptomics, small RNA sequencing, proteomics, and whole exome sequencing, ribomethylation as epitranscriptomic dimension was analyzed using RiboMethSeq. We focused the analysis on complete tumor resection samples. Here 47 out of 106 2&#8217;-O-Me sites were fully methylated in all tumor samples suggesting a crucial role for methylation at this position. Surprisingly, 59 sites had a dynamic methylation pattern. By combining ribomethylation sequencing data of dynamic sites with whole-exome-sequencing as well as transcriptome and proteome analyses using a multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), we discovered a 2&#8217;-O-Me signature in a subset of NSCLC patients with a high risk of metastasis and poor prognosis. We termed the patient subset, with underlying ribomethylation signature, epitranscriptomic pro-metastatic phenotype (EPROMET). This phenotype was not associated with genetic mutations as analyzed by exome sequencing. Analysis of gene sets in both transcriptomics and proteomics showed an upregulation of secreted and extracellular matrix proteins in EPROMET patients. Alongside, the ribomethylation site with major contribution to the EPROMET signature; 18S-Um799, mediated through SNORD105\/105B, was found to be the most dynamic within the dataset. It also showed the largest difference between EPROMET and non-EPROMET patients. For functional validation, lung cancer cell lines with knockout of snoRNAs contributing to EPROMET signature were generated using CRISPR\/Cas9. Lung cancer cells lacking the corresponding rRNA modifications migrated slower <i>in vitro, <\/i>failed to grow at a distant site <i>in vivo <\/i>and were impaired in metastasis<i>. <\/i> Functionally, it was shown that the modulated ribomethylation signature effected translation of secreted proteins by altered mRNA binding to ribosomes. This study indicates the presence of a ribomethylome-associated phenotype of NSCLC related to metastasis and poor prognosis. Altered ribomethylation affects the ribosome function towards differential expression patterns of secreted proteins. Taken together, an epitranscriptomic pattern of 2&#8217;-O-Me is associated with invasion\/migration properties of NSCLC cells and with development of metastasis. The ribomethylome may present a suitable biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Noncoding RNA,Translation,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

While the upregulation of integrins is thought to promote cancer stemness and metastasis, the mechanisms underlying their upregulation in cancer stem cells (CSCs) remain poorly understood. Herein, we show that the death from cancer signature gene, USP22, is essential in maintaining breast cancer cell stemness by promoting the transcription of a group of integrin family members, in particular, integrin &#946;1 (<i>ITGB1<\/i>). Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of USP22 largely impaired breast cancer stem cell self-renewal and prevented their metastasis. Reconstitution of Integrin &#946;1 partially rescued USP22-null breast cancer stemness and their metastasis. At the molecular level, USP22 functions as a bona fide deubiquitinase to protect the proteasomal degradation of the forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), a transcription factor for tumoral <i>ITGB1<\/i> gene transcription. Importantly, unbiased analysis of the TCGA database revealed a strong positive correlation between USP22 and <i>ITGB1 <\/i>in more than 90% of human cancer types, implying that USP22 functions as a key factor in maintaining stemness across a broad spectrum of human cancer types possibly through regulating <i>ITGB1<\/i>. To support this notion, immunohistochemistry staining detected a positive correlation among USP22, FoxM1 and integrin &#946;1 in human breast cancers. Collectively, our study identifies the USP22-FoxM1-integrin &#946;1 signaling axis as critical for cancer stemness and offers a potential target for antitumor therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Ubiquitination,Integrins,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Roles of GDF15 as major inflammatory response factor also have been demonstrated in animal models, and it has also showed various malignant functions such as regulating metabolism, promoting metastasis by inducing EMT in cancer. Here, we revealed a novel potential role for RIP1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) in enhancing metastasis by controlling WNT-RIP1-GDF15 signaling. We showed that WNT3A treatment increased the expression of GDF15 and GFRAL. Immunohistochemical analysis of human CRC tissue arrays consisting of primary cancer and metastatic cancer also confirmed that the expression of GDF15 and GFRAL was increased in metastatic cancer. Human XL cytokine assay, western blot, and ELISA results confirmed that GDF15 expression was reduced in cell lines in which RIP1 was knocked down. Reduction of GDF15 expression and secretion by RIP1 knockdown showed suppression of EMT induction resulting to decrease of migration and invasion of CRC cells. Taken together, these results suggest a novel EMT-enhancing role for RIP1 in the WNT pathway and suggest a novel WNT-RIP1-GDF15 pathway contributing to CRC malignancy by promoting EMT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Colorectal cancer,Wnt signaling,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.-R.

Changes in amino acid sequence, mRNA splicing, and\/or polyadenylation sites are only some of the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing effects. Under physiological conditions, ADAR1 activity prevents autoinflammation by inhibiting the accumulation of endogenous immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA and by suppressing the Z-RNA sensor ZBP1. Such mechanisms are exploited by cancer cells to desensitize tumor response to therapies, therefore augmenting aggressiveness. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) will develop metastatic disease, which remains the leading cause of death in individuals with BC. We have hypothesized that ADAR1 and its interferon-inducible p150 isoform, play a pivotal role in promoting BC metastases since high levels of ADAR1 are associated with a worse prognosis in patients with high grade BC, especially in the triple-negative BC subgroup (TNBC), which is the most likely to develop brain metastases.<br \/>Methods: We established a humanized mouse model of breast cancer brain metastases (BC-BrM) using neonatal intracerebroventricular inoculation of MDA-MD-231 TNBC cells and primary patient derived metastatic cells in Rag2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>&#947;c<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. Before implantation, MDA-MD-231 cells were transduced with a nanoluc-GFP reporter for tracing ADAR1 enzymatic activity in the brain metastatic niche. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown vectors targeting ADAR1, combined with over-expression vectors of full-length ADAR1 or the p150 deleted isoform were adopted to detect editing changes in the metastatic model through RNA-sequencing of BC-BrM.<br \/>Results: BrM derived from MDA-MD-231 implants display upregulation of ADAR1 p150 and activation of the WNT\/&#946;-catenin pathway compared to the non-implanted cell lines. Upon shRNA knockdown of ADAR1, decreased expression of BC stem cell markers was detected via FACS in MDA-MD-231 ADAR1 knocked-down versus control BC-BrM isolated cells. We are now exploring molecular pathways affected by ADAR1 loss\/overexpression in establishing BrM.<br \/>Future Directions: We have developed a biorepository of primary patient-derived metastatic breast cancer samples and have begun the process of tracking metastatic kinetics and ADAR1 activation with the ADAR1 reporter in an orthotopic mouse model. Overall, this study will provide new insights into the molecular role of ADAR1 deaminase activity in establishing and maintaining metastatic niches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Breast cancer,ADAR1,RNA modifications,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Cancer cells have dysregulated ribosome biogenesis, which contributes to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Aberrant ribosome biogenesis not only drives the increased need for protein synthesis in rapidly developing cancer cells, but it also orchestrates tumor-related signaling cascades. We developed a robust scoring method for ribosome biogenesis and applied it to a broad range of TCGA tumor samples. By categorizing TCGA samples into distinct groups based on their ribosome biogenesis scores, we unveil significant prognostic associations in various cancer types. We used the scoring method and compared the scores with ssGSEA analysis using different ribosome biogenesis signatures in several databases to confirm these predictions. Furthermore, our research goes beyond predictive implications, delving into the biochemical complexities of ribosome biogenesis's impact on drug responses and resistance.

Notably, combined treatment, estrogens plus hypoxia, caused a significant down regulation of the long noncoding RNA H19, one of the most sensitive to these pro-tumoral stimuli. Mechanistically, H19 acts as transcriptional repressor: H19 over-expression decreases E-cadherin (CDH1) level causing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition whereas H19 reduction promotes the expression of E-cadherin and &#946;4 integrin (ITGB4) switching the tumor dissemination program toward an alternative mechanism, specifically the cohesive metastatic phenotype. We focused on this H19\/cell adhesion molecules circuitry by investigating its role as: 1.Novel prognostic biomarker at the time of biopsies. eNOS, HIF2a and &#946;4 integrin expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, H19 and CDH1 transcripts by Droplet Digital PCR on FFPE-biopsies in a retrospective cohort of PCa patients [n = 30; Gleason score GS&#8804; 7(3+4) n= 17, GS &#8805;7(4+3) n= 13; biochemical, local, or metastatic recurrence defining disease progression (n=8\/30; time of recurrence: range 2-6 years)]. Importantly, multivariate analysis of combined biomarkers, named &#8220;Bioscore&#8221;, defined by the presence of at least 3 among HIF-2&#945;, eNOS, CDH1, &#946;4 integrin &#8805;cut off or H19&#8804;cut off revealed its prognostic value for progression and Progression-Free Survival determined using the ROC analysis (p=0.003) and Kaplan Meier curve (p= 0.005), respectively. 2.Master regulator of metastatic program in vivo and ex vivo PCa experimental models. Upon H19 silencing, mimicking combined estrogens plus hypoxia treatment, luciferase-positive PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells led to increased E-cadherin and &#946;4 integrin expression, enhanced tumor growth and metastasis formation at bone, lung, and liver in PCa mouse models<i>.<\/i> Further, treatment with H3K27 demethylase inhibitor, GSK-J4, rescued cell adhesion molecules expression by modulating H3K27me3 level at gene promoters, reduced metastasis number and size, and induced cell death in PCa-derived Organotypic Slice Cultures. Additionally, treatment with JQ1 and dBET6 BET protein family inhibitors) markedly reduced both E-cadherin and &#946;4 integrin levels, cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth. Intriguingly, H19 silencing increased BRD3 and BRD4 levels, implicating H19 in BRD transcription.

To address this, we study novel dysregulated mitochondrial signaling mechanisms that cells utilize to metastasize. Here, we focus on how outer mitochondrial membrane protein&#8212;Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (MIRO2)&#8212;promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Our previous work identified higher MIRO2 mRNA expression in cancer vs. normal patient samples in a multitude of cancer types, which correlated with worse patient outcomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MIRO2 was critical for prostate cancer cell growth and survival <i>in vitro<\/i> and&#8239;<i>in vivo<\/i>. However, it remains unknown if MIRO2 only affects primary tumor growth or if this protein is important throughout tumor progression. Using siRNA mediated knockdown (KD) of MIRO2 we find MIRO2 KD ubiquitously reduces tumor cell invasion in breast, melanoma, pancreatic, and prostate cancer cells. Utilizing metastatic prostate and breast cancer models, we demonstrate that mice injected with MIRO2 shRNA cells have significantly lower metastatic burden compared to mice injected with control shRNA cells. To determine the mechanism that MIRO2 controls invasion and metastasis, we looked at which of the top protein-binding partners for MIRO2 may regulate tumor cell invasion. Of our top hits, we found that depletion of atypical myosin IXB (MYO9B) by siRNA most significantly reduced tumor cell invasion and phenocopied MIRO2 depletion. MYO9B has a well-defined role in controlling cell motility via inactivation of RhoA. Excitingly, we have found 1) MIRO2 KD results in increased active RhoA, phenocopying MYO9B KD, 2) dual ablation of MIRO2 and RhoA fully rescues tumor cell invasion, and 3) MIRO2 is required for MYO9B driven invasion. Taken together, we propose a novel signaling mechanism by which MIRO2 broadly promotes invasion and metastasis through MYO9B dependent inactivation of RhoA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Signaling pathways,Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

The molecular mechanism responsible for aggressiveness is poorly understood. A better understanding of molecular pathways involved shall precede the identification of newer diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets. We explored EPOR signaling pathway in Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and HNSCC cell lines.<br \/>Methods and Results: By using a validated in-house CTC isolation protocol, which addresses various drawbacks of currently available techniques and isolates CTCs suitable for various downstream molecular analysis, we isolated CTCs from HNSCC patients. The whole transcriptome analysis was performed from CTCs using ultra-low cell number RNA sequencing and corresponding primary tumors in 24 paired samples. We found a significant transcriptomic heterogeneity in CTCs, which are associated with overall disease outcome in HNSCC patients. To explore the plausible molecular pathways, we also identified 521 differentially expressed genes in CTCs with respect to primary tumors and various canonical pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling, and ECM receptor interaction were enriched in CTC samples. Overexpression of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) along with various genes encoded by mitochondrial genome and genes involved in maintenance of mtDNA in CTCs as compared to primary tumors was an important finding from our data. When analyzed in depth, there was a significant positive correlation between various genes involved in mtDNA maintenance (ABAT, NT5M) and encoded by mitochondrial genome (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-ND5, MT-ND6, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-ATP6, MT-CYTB) with EPOR expression in our RNA seq data which is also substantiated by analyzing TCGA data. We confirmed these findings experimentally in HNSCC cell lines Cal 27 and FaDu. It was also observed that metastatic cell line FaDu has significantly higher mtDNA content as compared to non-metastatic cell line Cal 27, which was correlated with EPOR expression. Treatment with low dose Erythropoietin (0.1IU\/mL) which a natural ligand for EPOR, enhanced mtDNA content in both the cell lines at low doses and boosted the metastatic capability while minimal effect on cell proliferation was observed.<br \/>Conclusion: EPOR signaling might promote the metastatic ability of cancer cells and may act as a potential target for cancer dissemination and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Circulating tumor cells,Mitochondrial DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Late-stage diagnosis of LUAD often results in the accumulation of a wide range of mutations in tumor cells, with altered <i>KRAS<\/i> being the most frequently encountered oncogenic driver. Co-mutation of the tumor suppressor <i>STK11 <\/i>is also common and occurs in 10-15% of KRAS-driven LUAD. Retrospective patient studies have demonstrated that concurrent oncogenic <i>KRAS <\/i>and <i>STK11<\/i> loss-of-function mutations are associated with metastatic disease, poorer patient survival, and inferior therapy response. The purpose of this study was to identify molecular mechanisms by which STK11 loss results in a greater metastatic potential in <i>KRAS<\/i>-driven LUAD in hopes of exploiting that knowledge to improve patient outcomes. For our studies, we utilized the <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutated, STK11-intact human LUAD cell line NCI-H2009. Both parental and &#8710;STK11 (generated by CRISPR\/Cas9) H2009 cells were seeded in Transwell&#174; inserts coated with fibronectin. As expected, H2009 &#8710;STK11 cells displayed a 1.6-fold increase in trans-well migration compared to the parental line (SEM 14393 &#177; 877.3 cells, n=6; p&#60;0.0001). To assess the invasive properties of parental and &#8710;STK11 cells in a three-dimensional environment, spheroids generated by hanging drop culture were embedded in Matrigel and imaged by light microscopy at zero and 24-hours post-embedding. Analysis demonstrates a 2.4-fold increase in invasion in &#8710;STK11 cells compared to parental cells (SEM 0.03 &#177; 0.01 mm<sup>2<\/sup>, n=19-21; p&#60;0.0001). Three-dimensional LUAD spheroids have been reported to more closely recapitulate <i>in-vivo<\/i> tumor transcriptomes compared to two-dimensional monolayer cultures. qRT-PCR analyses of our spheroids demonstrate that loss of <i>STK11<\/i> promotes a significant increase in the expression of lung cancer stem cell markers CXCR4, NANOG, CD44, and OCT4 (n=3-6; p&#60;0.002). These markers are known to support stem cell maintenance, chemoresistance, as well as metastatic potential, suggesting a mechanistic link between STK11 and their transcriptional regulation. To assess the impact of <i>STK11<\/i> loss on early and late-stage metastasis <i>in-vivo<\/i>, we will use an embryonic zebrafish xenograft model. Zebrafish represent a tractable metastasis model due to the number of conserved human homologs - most notable being the CXCR4\/CXCL12 axis which models cross-communication between zebrafish endothelium and cognate human tumor ligands. Current and future studies focus on investigating the role of STK11 in regulating stem cell markers; thereby identifying potentially novel therapeutic targets for <i>STK11<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> co-mutated LUAD patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Serine\/threonine kinase,KRAS,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.
