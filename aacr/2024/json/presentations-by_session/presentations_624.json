[{"Abstract":"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) poses a significant health challenge, with recent therapeutic advances yet to substantially improve long-term patient survival. Central to this study is the SLC35B gene family (SLC35B1-4), which encodes nucleotide sugar transporters essential to cellular membranes. Emerging research highlights a link between these transporters' dysfunction and the development and progression of tumors, yet the specific role of the SLC35B family in CRC remains unclear. Our investigation delves into the function of SLC35B genes in CRC, utilizing an integrated bioinformatics approach with databases like GENT2, TCGA, UALCAN, cBioportal, TIMER, and Kaplan-Meier plotter. Our analysis reveals a notable upregulation of SLC35B1\/2\/4 mRNA in CRC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, with a concurrent downregulation of SLC35B3. Promoter methylation analysis shows increased methylation for SLC35B1\/3\/4, while SLC35B2 demonstrates decreased methylation. According to GEO and TCGA data, CRC patients exhibiting high SLC35B4 expression face lower survival rates. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirms high SLC35B4 expression as an independent risk factor. Further, SLC35B4 expression correlates with increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages, and aligns positively with immune checkpoints such as CD274 and HAVCR2. In vitro assays link SLC35B4 to enhanced cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vivo, SLC35B4 knockdown leads to reduced tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. RNA sequencing identifies 241 genes differentially expressed in SLC35B4 knockdown compared to control cells, with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) associating SLC35B4 with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In summary, our research sheds light on the SLC35B gene family's role in CRC, especially SLC35B4, highlighting its potential as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in CRC, particularly through its involvement in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,SLC35B,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yu-Jia Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Chang-Chun Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cheng-Chin Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Chien-Yu Huang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"be9f8eed-592a-4e9b-adeb-6c4f9d19850f","ControlNumber":"9508","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Further exploration of medical mistrust within these groups is needed to inform research and clinical approaches to improve trust and health equity. This study examined the relationship between medical mistrust and access to cancer preventive care among Black, American Indian (AI) and White participants in Virginia.<br \/>Methods: A convenience sample (N=1,288) designed to oversample underrepresented communities in Virginia completed surveys assessing medical mistrust, access to medical care and colorectal cancer screening. Measures included the medical mistrust index, visiting a doctor in the last year (yes\/no), ever having a colonoscopy (yes\/no), perceived health status, race, age, sex, education, marital status, insurance coverage and rurality. Bivariate tests evaluated significant (p&#60;.05) associations between outcomes of having a doctor visit in the last year and colonoscopy screening with medical mistrust, health status, and sociodemographics; significant findings were included in logistic regression models. Differences among endorsements of individual mistrust scale items by race was also assessed.<br \/>Results: Sample was &#956; age=45 (SD=18), 47% female, 40% Black, 36% White, 14% AI, 45% had &#8804; high school diploma\/GED, 63% married, majority resided in metro areas (91%) and were medically insured (85%). Among the sample 80% had visited doctor in the last year and 63% of those eligible had a colonoscopy. Medical mistrust was significantly higher among Black and AI participants compared to White. In overall and stratified logistic regression models medical mistrust was not associated with visiting a doctor in the last year or obtaining a colonoscopy. 5 of 7 items of the medical mistrust index were endorsed more often among Black and AI participants compared to White. These included feeling that medical institutions deceive people (Black: r=0.07, p&#60;0.01; AI: r=0.07, p=0.01; White: r=-0.11, p&#60;0.01), cover-up mistakes (Black: r=0.11, p&#60;0.01; AI: r=0.96, p=0.04; White: r=-0.13, p&#60;0.01), conduct harmful experiments (Black: r=0.07, p&#60;0.02; White: r=-0.10, p&#60;0.01), lack competency (AI: r=0.07, p=0.01; White: r=-0.08, p&#60;0.01), and make mistakes often (AI: r=0.10, p&#60;0.01; White: r=-0.09, p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Medical mistrust was significantly higher among Black and AI participants compared to White but this was not associated with accessing medical care. Given differential endorsement of items dealing with medical errors and their concealment, these results suggest a need to investigate patient experiences after care is initiated to understand what factors may contribute to medical mistrust and care outcomes long term.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Screening,Race,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Black women face 2-fold higher mortality compared with other racial groups. To understand the role of tumor biology underlying these health inequities, we are sequencing the tumor exomes of 1,000 Black and 2,000 non-Black women in the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium. To inform this effort, we have completed whole-exome tumor sequencing in 35 EC patients. We present early sample performance and mutational insights of this pilot.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>We extracted DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues (cores, scroll) and matched normal specimens (blood, tissue) from 35 women diagnosed with EC in the Louisiana Tumor Registry, Nurses&#8217; Health Study, and Polish Endometrial Cancer Study. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted by the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University, which called somatic alterations using matched normal samples as the germline profile (NovaSeq6000). We excluded two contaminated core samples and one paired scroll with extremely low coverage, leaving 33 women in our analytic sample. We examined the mutational landscape of EC overall and separately in 7 Black and 26 non-Black patients. For 23 women, we obtained both an FFPE scroll of the full block and FFPE tumor cores enabling a direct comparative analysis of DNA extraction yield and sequencing performance by sample source. We ran a published allele-specific copy number and clonal heterogeneity analysis tool (FACETS) in these 23 women to calculate tumor purity by tissue type.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>Results from our pilot study revealed the most frequently mutated genes in our pilot population were <i>PTEN <\/i>(61%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (48%), and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (39%). We observed similar mutation frequencies for <i>PIK3CA <\/i>in both non-Black and Black women (38% <i>vs <\/i>43%). <i>TP53<\/i> was more frequently mutated in Black women (57% <i>vs <\/i>16%), while <i>ARID1A <\/i>mutation was more common in non-Black women (58% <i>vs <\/i>14%). 10 (30%) patient samples had chromosome 10 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Of these, 8 (80%) had PTEN bi-allelic alterations. Of participants with both core and scroll tissue available, both sample types were successfully sequenced, although cores showed modestly better performance: 74% of core samples (vs 26% for scrolls) had a higher percentage of bases read at a target depth of 100x, and the median tumor purity for cores estimated using FACETS was higher than scrolls (53% <i>vs <\/i>42%). Tumor purity could not be calculated for seven tissue samples due to either tumor diploidy or purity being too low: of these samples the majority were scrolls (86%). We observed greater concordance between core and scroll variant allele frequency when tumor purity was &#8805;30%: the benefits of cores vs scrolls matter at lower tumor purity.<br \/><i>Conclusions<\/i>In line with TCGA data, these pilot findings suggest potential differences in tumor mutational landscape by race and we will be interrogating these in our larger study population. FFPE core tissue generally performed better than FFPE scroll tissue in whole-exome sequencing, but our data suggest scrolls remain a viable option for sequencing when cores are unavailable. This has the potential to offer valuable insight for conducting population-based next-generation studies, which mostly rely on FFPE-derived tissues.<i><\/i><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole exome sequencing,Endometrial cancer,Epidemiology,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

CRC is influenced by the colorectal microbiome, which plays a pivotal role in inflammation, DNA damage, and production of cancer-promoting metabolites. Most prior CRC microbial studies have identified multiple microbes enriched in tumor samples, but these examinations have generally focused on CRC from a specific country and have not accounted for CRC patient&#8217;s tumor site, sex, diet, or geographical location. Further, the interconnection between somatic alterations and microbiome composition has not been comprehensively explored. Here, we examine the microbiome profiles of 963 whole-genome sequenced CRC and their matched-normal blood from 11 different countries with highly varying age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) for colorectal cancer. Matched normal blood samples exhibited a strong intra- and inter-microbial heterogeneity across the 11 countries. In contrast, while CRC tumors exhibited a higher microbial diversity when compared to their matched-normal samples, the top 10 most abundant CRC taxa were strikingly similar across all countries, suggesting a global convergence of the CRC microbiome composition. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the colorectal cancer ASR across 11 countries and the CRC microbial diversity (rho=0.91, p-value: 0.0002), suggesting that countries with high incidence rates also have high microbial diversities. After accounting for age, shipment batch, sex, and country-specific effects on the microbiome composition, we observed a core set of five microbial species enriched in CRC across all countries, which included <i>Bacteroides fragilis<\/i>,<i>Phocaeicola V<\/i>ulgatus, <i>Faecalibacterium Prausnitzii<\/i>, <i>Fusobacterium Nucleatum<\/i>, and <i>Escherichia Coli<\/i>. A strong correlation (rho=0.84, p-value: 0.0013) was observed between <i>Bacteroides fragilis<\/i> and a novel mutational signature characterized by A\/T[C&#62;G]T and T[T&#62;G]N substitutions. No association was observed between polyketide synthase gene complex (pks)+ microbe and the presence of the pks-derived colibactin mutational signatures. Furthermore, additional associations were observed between the microbiome and other mutational signatures and driver genes. Overall, this study delivers a global atlas of the microbial landscapes of CRC genomes across 11 countries and their links with genetic changes and epidemiological risk factors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-08 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Microbiome,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Recommendations for reducing risk of CRC include weight management, eating plentiful plant-based high fiber foods, and limiting intakes of red meats and ultra-processed foods. In addition, an increased proportion of monounsaturated and omega-3 fats in the diet is beneficial for promoting weight management and reducing inflammation. Despite the evidence supporting the importance of diet and the demonstrated success for eliciting dietary changes in research settings, simple methods that can be easily implemented in medical settings are lacking. We developed a bespoke mHealth app (MyBestGI), incorporating an autonomy-supporting, self-regulatory approach to behavior change. The program promotes identification of the benefits of healthy eating on well-being. Two versions of the program are being tested in a 12-month, 3-arm randomized trial that seeks to recruit 240 people at increased risk for CRC. Participants are randomized to either 1) a control group that receives written information on cancer preventive diets, 2) a treatment group that receives a MyBestGI app version for logging 4 food groups associated with increased risks of CRC (red meats, processed meats, added sugars and refined grains), or 3) a treatment group that receives a MyBestGI app version for logging the same 4 food groups to limit plus 7 food groups to encourage in personalized quantities. The two treatment groups also receive a user manual, behavior-oriented, biweekly text messages, and supportive coaching calls. Logging food groups is requested at least 3 per week for 3 months, and 3 per week every other week for the next 9 months. The app displays logging results relative to individualized targets and has features that prompt reflecting on the user&#8217;s own results and planning for future eating. The primary endpoints are weight loss and improvement in a dietary cancer prevention score. Recruitment began in June 2023, and the study is enrolling 8-10 participants per month. The drop-out rate is lower than expected. Compliance with study procedures and app use is high. Responses to the end-of-day reflection questions within the app show that 92% of users are neutral, happy, or very happy with their dietary behavior for the day. For the 15 participants who had 12 weeks of logging data available, foods were logged for an average of 38 days (range 20-75) which is slightly higher than the requested logging of 36 days over 12 weeks. Review of the support calls for protocol fidelity indicates participants are enthusiastic about the MyBestGI program, making changes in their eating, and are internalizing the autonomy-supporting beliefs promoted in the program. These early results suggest users are engaging with the MyBestGI app at a very high level, making use of the provided app features, and enjoying the program. The MyBestGI approach therefore has excellent potential to support dietary change towards a cancer preventive diet in a format that is facile to implement in high-risk populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Diet,Obesity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Tirzepatide treatment leads to weight loss in murine models of obesity, and clinical trials have shown the drug can achieve &#8764; 20% weight loss in obese patients. Obesity has been shown to increase risk and\/or to worsen prognosis of certain common cancers, including colon cancer, but the effect of tirzepatide on neoplasia has not been examined in detail. We studied the effects of this drug on mouse weight and energy balance and on the murine MC38 colon cancer model, which was previously shown to exhibit accelerated growth in hosts with diet-induced obesity. Tirzepatide led to substantial reductions in food intake, to reduced adipose tissue mass, and to significant decreases in circulating levels of insulin and leptin. Tirzepatide did not cause tumor regression, but reduced tumor growth rates by &#8764; 50%. Tirzepatide had no effect on MC38 cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and the effect of tirzepatide on tumor growth in vivo could be phenocopied in placebo treated mice simply by restricting food intake to the amount consumed mice receiving the drug. This provides evidence that the drug acts indirectly to inhibit tumor growth. Our findings raise the possibility that use of tirzepatide or similar agents may benefit patients with obesity-related cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Energy,Diet,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael N.

Most HNC patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease for which the 5-year survival is below 50%, stressing the need for chemoprevention. Recently, we have reported that the combination of resveratrol and EGCG induces synergistic apoptosis and inhibits xenografted HNC growth by inhibiting the AKT-mTOR pathway. This study investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of resveratrol, EGCG, and their combination using the 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis model. C57BL\/6 mice were exposed to 4-NQO (50 &#956;g\/ml) via drinking water for 10 weeks, followed by treatment with vehicle (50% sweetened condensed milk), resveratrol (30 mg\/kg), EGCG (30 mg\/kg) and their combination for 8 weeks, 5 days\/week. The mice were sacrificed on week 24, and the number of visible and microscopic lesions was counted. Resveratrol alone and in combination with EGCG significantly inhibited the number of visible lesions. In contrast, the number of microscopic lesions and lesion area was significantly inhibited only in the combination group. The expression of Ki-67 was also significantly inhibited in resveratrol and combination groups when compared with untreated control. Furthermore, RNASeq and qPCR analysis using an HNC cell line identified GDF15, ATF3, p21, p27, and Bim as significantly upregulated genes, with GDF15 being the most upregulated one. Expression of GDF15 and ATF3 proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. Taken together, our data strongly demonstrate the chemopreventive potential of the combination of EGCG and resveratrol and pave the way for further clinical developments. <i>(Supported by NIH Grants R15DE032063 and P20GM103434)<\/i><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-10 Prevention and treatment of premalignant lesions (intraepithelial neoplasia),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoprevention,Resveratrol,EGCG,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Adeoluwa  A.

Nonetheless, previous studies did not differentiate between first primary lung cancers (FPLCs) and those that occur in individuals with a history of cancer (i.e., subsequent primary lung cancers or SPLCs).<br \/><b>Objective <\/b>To examine whether the sex-specific pattern in lung cancer incidence rates differ by tumor sequence in the US.<br \/><b>Design, Setting, and Participants<\/b> Lung and bronchus (hereafter, lung) cancer diagnosed from 2001-2020 at ages 20 or older, stratified by sex and tumor sequence (first versus subsequent), were identified from the U.S Cancer Statistics Public Use Database.<br \/><b>Main Outcome and Measures <\/b>Age-standardized (2000 US standard population) incidence rates and female-to-male incidence rate ratio (IRRs) were calculated using SEER*Stat, overall and by age groups (20-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+ years). Trends in incidence rates were quantified using Joinpoint program, estimating annual percent change (APC).<br \/><b>Results<\/b> From 2001-2020, there were 3,333,495 FPLC diagnoses and 961,130 SPLC diagnoses. For FPLC, the incidence rate in women was 28% lower than in men (57.7 versus 79.8 per 100,000; IRR=0.72, 95%CI=0.72-0.72) with the sex gap greater with increasing age from 0.96 (95%CI=0.95-0.97) in individuals aged 20-49 years to 0.69 (95%CI=0.69-0.70) in those aged 70 years or older. For SPLC, the incidence rate in women was 33% lower than in men (17 versus 25 per 100,000; IRR=0.67, 95%CI=0.67-0.68). However, the lower incidence of SPLC in women was seen only among people aged 60 or older. Intriguingly, the incidence rate of SPLC in women was twice as high as in men among those aged 20-49 years (0.83 versus 0.44 per 100,000; IRR=1.90, 95%CI=1.83-1.96) and 25% higher among those aged 50-59 years (11.05 versus 8.84 per 100,000; IRR=1.25, 95%CI=1.23-1.27). From 2001-2019, incidence rates of FPLC decreased for both men (1.88% to 3.45% per year) and women (1.23% to 2.24% per year), although the decrease began in 2006 in women. For SPLC, the incidence rate in men showed a 2.74% annual increase from 2001-2007, followed by a decrease (APC=-1.91%, 95%CI=-2.27 to -1.68) from 2012-2019, while the incidence rate in women exhibited a 4.05% annual increase from 2001-2009, followed by a continued increase at a slower pace (APC=0.48%, 95%CI=0.28-0.69). The rising trends in SPLC among women were primarily driven by those aged 50 or older. In particular, the incidence rate of SPLC among women aged 70 or older increased by 5.4% per year from 2001-2009, followed by a 0.92% annual increase from 2009-2019.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Sex-specific patterns in lung cancer incidence differ considerably between first versus subsequent primary lung cancer. The findings highlight variations in sex-specific exposures within different populations at risk such as the general population versus cancer survivors. Further research is needed to identify reasons for the female predominance of SPLC among young adults and the concerning rise of SPLC rates in women.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-11 Prevention of second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Incidence,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

We analyzed the allele frequencies of 664,994 autosomal SNPs in the 54 OSCC cases. In a genome-wide association analysis, four SNPs within loci on chromosomes 6, 7, 9, and 12 were significantly different between OSCC patients and controls (corrected <i>P<\/i> &#60; 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6<\/sup>).

Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is associated with an overall survival rate of 30% but can be cured in up to 90% of cases if diagnosed early when the disease is still limited to the ovaries and fallopian tubes. While there is no effective screening method for EOC, developing novel and minimally invasive clinical tests is paramount to identify women with early disease as well as those who are at increased risk. Plasma-based microbiota signatures specific to EOC<b> <\/b>could become leading biomarkers of early disease in the field that complement existing clinical tools.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We utilized an established institutional biobank to access 180 biobanked plasma samples from: (1) women with EOC; (2) women with non-EOC solid tumors; (3) women undergoing gynecologic-related procedures and non-EOC surgeries; and (4) healthy controls. Batch 1 included 96 plasma samples (n=24 per group) and Batch 2 included 84 samples (n=19 per group and 8 repeat EOC samples). Microbial profiles of plasma specimens were assessed using an amplicon-based sequencing method that targets the 16S rRNA gene in the bacterial genome to study bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy in diseased and healthy women. A stringent bioinformatic pipeline was applied to filter out suspicious bacterial contaminants at the genus level. Bacterial decontamination procedures in the pipeline included evaluating repeat plasma samples of EOC cases and sampling nucleic acid isolation kit reagents to serve as negative controls (only in Batch 2) . Differential abundances of the plasma microbiota among the groups were assessed using analysis of compositions of microbiomes (ANCOM) as implemented in R software package ANCOM-BC.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified, classified, and quantified 564 bacterial genera in the circulation of women diagnosed with EOC, non-EOC solid tumors, benign gynecologic conditions, and healthy controls.
