[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects a significant number of individuals each year, ranking as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Bile acids (BAs), natural compounds crucial for digesting dietary fats, not only influence the gut microbiota but are also involved in gut health through their interaction with the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). Recent findings have highlighted certain microbiota-generated BAs like 3-oxo-lithocholic acid (LCA) and IsoLCA, modulate host immunity, hinder the expansion of intestinal pathogens, and potentially anti-aging. Despite the advancements in identifying the gut microbes behind these BAs, their precise impact on intestinal cells (IECs) and their role in disease progression are largely unexplored. Our pilot investigation unveiled 3oxoLCA as an FXR agonist, restoring FXR signaling in both cancer cells and APC<sup>min\/+<\/sup> mice (a classic CRC mice model). As a result, 3-oxo-LCA inhibits the growth of both human and mouse CRC cells, such as MC38, CT26 and HCT116. Additionally, 3-oxo-LCA also restrained the intestinal stem cells (ISCs)&#8217; proliferation in organoids from both wild-type and APC<sup>min\/+<\/sup> mice, and patient-derived CRC organoids (PDCOs). Remarkably, treatment with 3-oxo-LCA decreased BAs levels, improved gut barrier function, reduced tumor load, and inhibited tumor progression in APC<sup>min\/+<\/sup> mice. Furthermore, 3-oxo-LCA significantly suppressed tumor growth in cancer cell-derived xenograft model mice. Crucially, the 3-oxo-LCA-FXR interaction transcriptionally regulated key apoptotic genes, encouraging cancer cell death. These discoveries highlight the therapeutic promise of incorporating 3-oxo-LCA into strategies for treating CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Bile acid,Hormone receptors,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Obesity is associated with excess estrogen, hyperinsulinemia, activation of the Akt\/mTOR pathway, chronic inflammation, and a heightened capacity to harvest dietary energy, all of which contribute to the development and progression of EC. Intermittent energy restriction (IER) is thought to have anti-tumorigenic benefits and has been shown to have synergistic effects with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in various cancer types. Thus, we evaluated the anti-tumorigenic effects of a switch from high fat diet (HFD) to either IER or low fat diet (LFD) with carboplatin treatment in a mouse model of obesity-driven endometrioid EC.<br \/>Methods: <i>Lkb1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>p53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i> mice were fed either HFD or LFD starting at 4 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age, the HFD-fed mice were randomized to three treatment groups: continuous HFD, HFD-LFD switch, and HFD-IER switch. The LFD-fed mice were continuously maintained on LFD. At 16 weeks of age, all mice were injected with AdCre into the left uterine horn to induce EC development. At 26 weeks of age, mice were treated with placebo or carboplatin (50 mg\/kg intraperitoneally weekly) for 4 weeks (n=8-10 mice per group). EC incidence, tumor weight, and body weight were evaluated. EC gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis.<br \/>Results: EC incidence was lowest in the HFD-IER group (~60%) and highest in the HFD group (~80%); rates were similar in the other diet groups (~75%). The continuous HFD-fed mice demonstrated a 76% increase in tumor size relative to continuous LFD-fed mice (p&#60;0.001). At sacrifice and after carboplatin treatment, mean body weights were significantly higher (p&#60;0.05) in the HFD group (38g) than groups receiving continuous LFD (26g), HFD-LFD switch (28g), or HFD-IER switch (21g), although mean body weights were not significantly different within diet groups between placebo and carboplatin-treated mice. In placebo-treated groups, mean tumor weights were significantly lower in mice fed continuous LFD (0.62g), HFD-LFD switch (0.60g) and HFD-IER switch (0.26g) relative to continuous HFD-fed mice (1.10 g; p&#60;0.001). When comparing gene expression between the HFD-LFD and the HFD-IER placebo groups, genes related to cholesterol metabolism, estrogen response, and inflammation were preferentially up-regulated in the HFD-IER group. Carboplatin treatment reduced EC tumor size 42-69% across all diet groups (p&#60;0.05); tumor size was the smallest in the HFD-IER group (0.15g) relative to mice receiving continuous HFD (0.34g), HFD-LFD (0.29g) or continuous LFD (0.34g).<br \/>Conclusion: IER with carboplatin treatment may be an innovative combination treatment strategy in the management of EC, a highly obesity-driven cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,Diet,Endometrial cancer,Platinum drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, evidence regarding the influence of dietary inflammatory potential and mortality among people with MAFLD is rare. This study aimed to elucidate the association of the energy-density dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among MAFLD patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1988-1994, 1999-2010). MAFLD was defined as the evidence of hepatic steatosis with &#8805;1 of the following: type 2 diabetes (T2DM), overweight\/obesity (OW, BMI &#8805; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), or lean metabolic dysregulation (MD). Dietary intake was assessed through 24-hour dietary recalls. E-DII scores and component intakes were divided into tertiles, with T1 as the reference. Through linkage to National Death Index by December 31, 2019, mortality from all cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer were identified. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to analyze the association between dietary inflammatory potential and mortality among MAFLD and its subtypes patients.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 6537 MAFLD patients were included in the present analysis. During the median follow-up of 16.8 years, 2281 total deaths (534 cancer-related, 750 CVD-related) were documented. Compared to high dietary inflammatory potential, low dietary inflammatory potential presented a inverse association with all-cause mortality risk in MAFLD patients (HR <sub>T2 vs. T1<\/sub> = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72-0.95, HR <sub>T3 vs. T1<\/sub> = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.76-1.01, <i>P<\/i><sub> trend <\/sub>= 0.092) and OW subtype patients (HR <sub>T2 vs. T1<\/sub> = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.63-0.93, HR <sub>T3 vs. T1<\/sub> = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.92, <i>P<\/i><sub> trend <\/sub>= 0.009). No significant benefit was observed among T2DM and MD subtype patients. Further component analysis found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66-0.83), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.65-0.80), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.65-0.80), and linoleic acid (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.79-0.94) were linked with reduced cancer mortality risk in MAFLD patients.

Due to compromised intestinal surface integrity and the prolonged use of medication, individuals with UC often develop a folate deficiency, requiring folic acid (FA) supplementation. Prior findings from this group indicate that FA supplementation, at clinically relevant levels, promotes UC-associated dysplasia. Supplementation with FA resulted in an increased multiplicity of dysplasia and a significant elevation in the expression of several inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6, Cox-2, I&#954;&#954;-&#946;) within the colonic mucosa of mice with UC. Genome-wide expression profiling of normal and dysplastic colonic epithelial cells from mice treated with different doses of FA revealed differentially expressed genes were enriched for members of the ERK and NF-&#954;B pathways. Subsequent <i>in vitro<\/i> analyses, utilizing isogenic RKO colon adenocarcinoma cells exposed to various doses of FA, demonstrated the downregulation of ERK and p-ERK in wild type (WT) p53<sup>+\/+<\/sup> cells, while an increase in expression was observed in p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> cells at the protein level. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of the MAPK\/ERK pathway in the development of UC-associated neoplasms. An <i>in vitro<\/i> model that faithfully reproduces the inflamed microenvironment in the context of WT vs. mutant p53, the putative gatekeeper of UC-associated carcinogenesis, is needed to enhance our understanding of early changes in the colon that are induced by FA and drive tumor formation. Colon organoids are being generated by isolating crypts from WT p53<sup>+\/+<\/sup> and mutant p53<sup>+\/515A<\/sup> mice. These organoids are then co-cultured with mouse macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) in inserts to stimulate crosstalk between the macrophages and colonic epithelial cells, as in the inflamed colon. Analyses demonstrate that the macrophages express pivotal inflammatory cytokines characteristic of UC, including IL-1&#946;, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6, irrespective of the presence or absence of LPS stimulation. Co-cultured organoids and macrophages will be exposed to different concentrations of FA for various lengths of time, and the impact of treatment on the levels of ERK, p-ERK, and p65 will be assessed. The ability of p-ERK to mediate the transcriptional activation of NF-&#954;B and its downstream effector IL-6 will also be evaluated. Subsequent investigations employing this innovative experimental model will reveal the mechanisms by which FA supplementation promotes the progression of UC-associated dysplasia. Given the potential risks associated with FA supplementation in individuals with UC, there is an urgent need to translate these results to a clinical setting.

While anthocyanins, present in purple, red, and blue pigments, and chlorophyll, responsible for green pigments, are recognized for their antioxidant properties, limited evidence exists regarding their preventive effects on gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. In the year 2020, GI cancers constituted 29% of global cancer cases. To address this gap, this prospective cohort study investigates the association between the intake of colored fruits and vegetables and the risk of GI cancer in Korea.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Cancer Screenee Cohort, comprising adults undergoing check-ups at the National Cancer Center Korea, was analyzed for GI cancer cases diagnosed between October 16, 2007, and December 31, 2020.

We quantified the biological variability over six months with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We then estimated the numbers of cases, assuming 1:1 or 1:3 matched case-control study, required to detect an association at significance levels of 0.05 and 0.001 with 80% power, based on the number of fecal specimens collected per participant.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: For most alpha and beta diversity metrics, the temporal stability of fecal microbiome in samples collected at six months of interval was low to moderate, with ICCs of 0.6 or less. We observed heterogeneity in temporal stability for the proportions of species, genes and pathways, with ICCs varying between 0.0 and 0.9. For most microbiome measures from a single fecal collection, assuming an equal number of cases and controls at significance level of 0.05 (for alpha and beta diversity) or 0.001 (for species, genes and pathways), detecting an odds ratio of 1.5 per standard deviation of microbiome metric would require hundreds to thousands of cases. Specifically, detecting an association between alpha\/beta diversity metrics and an outcome would require between 1,000-5,000 cases. In addition, for low prevalent species (5% - 10%, median ICC = 0.09), 15,102 cases would be required; in contrast, for species with high prevalence (&#62;75%, median ICC = 0.41) 3,527 cases would be necessary; the same applies to genes and pathways. For an odds ratio of 1.5, assuming a 1:3 matched case-control study based on one fecal specimen per subject, 10,068 cases would be required for low prevalent species and 2,351 cases for species with high prevalence. Using the same study setting with multiple specimens per subject over time, the required sample size would be lower. Indeed, detecting an odds ratio of 1.5 for low prevalent species would require 15,102 cases with one specimen, 8,267 cases with two specimens, and 5,989 cases with three specimens.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our calculations suggest that to detect modest disease associations we would need a substantial number of cases.

In 2023, approximately 153,020 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 52,550 will die, including 19,550 cases and 3750 deaths in patients under 50 years of age. CRC in younger patients (less than 55 years) is known as early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC). It is a growing global phenomenon whose incidence and mortality has incidence from 11% to 20% between 1995 to 2019 and is expected to increase by 140% by 2030. While it has been linked to known and established risks for CRC, the underlying causes and mechanisms are poorly understood. Based on our current knowledge of the disease, we propose that EOCRC results from exposure of children and young adults to exposome factors that have been increasing globally in the last four decades that may impact the microbiome causing dysbiosis and inflammation in the distal colon and rectum, the anatomical site of EOCRC. Among the likely factors is the use of antibiotics, particularly in infants and children. In this study we hypothesized that early life exposure to antibiotics causes dysbiosis and inflammation in the distal colon and rectum leading to increased mutations and epigenetic events that promote EOCRC development. Specifically, we examined the effect of the most commonly prescribed pediatric antibiotics on the gut microbiota and inflammatory environment in the colon, and their impact on tumor development upon exposure to a carcinogen. We treated A\/J mice with multiples rounds of antibiotics and then exposed them to azoxymethane, a carcinogen to determine the effect on tumor development in the colon. The results showed that antibiotic exposure caused dysbiosis and inflammation in the colon of antibiotic treated mice as well as systemic inflammation in mice treated with antibiotics. Treatment with azoxymethane, a carcinogen in the presence of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis led to increased tumor burden in the distal colon. These results suggest a possible involvement of antibiotics on increased risk of EOCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colorectal cancer,Inflammation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

With long-term survival rates in patients being exceedingly low, understanding what factors delineate survival is imperative. When comparing spontaneous transgenic mouse models of pancreatic cancer housed in geographically distinct vivaria, regardless of a common lineage, we observed drastically different phenotype states in the respective locations. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome results in different gene expression profiles, leading to alterations in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Using various sequencing techniques, including 16s rRNA and RNA sequencing of the gut, we identified unique signatures at these respective institutions. Subsequent fecal microbiota transplantation and single bacterial species colonization experiments were performed to evaluate the ability of microbiomes\/specific microbiota to alter the rate of tumorigenesis. In addition to probing the gut microbiome, circulating metabolites from individual mice were quantified, and correlated to phenotype state. Following identification of potentially tumorigenic bacterially derived metabolites, single bacteria colonization experiments were utilized to determine the downstream effects of identified metabolites as well as the ability of directly altering the metabolic landscape to drive tumorigenesis. Additionally, murine derived pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to both identified bacteria alone or bacterially produced metabolite and analyzed by metrics such as proliferation and relative expression of transcription factors associated with cancer development <i>in vitro<\/i>. Taken together, these data demonstrate the ability of distinct gut microbiomes to directly alter the metabolic landscape in mice, thus differentially altering the progression of pancreatic lesions. By better understanding the factors that stratify survivorship, we can begin to employ clinically actionable methodologies in the treatment or prevention of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Metabolomics,Bacterial therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

During GERD, various types of bile induce oxidative stress and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in DNA damage and inflammation in cells. Although there has been much research documenting the shift in the esophageal microbiome from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria during this progression, there has also been an observed increase in the presence of Lactobacillus, a gram-positive commensal bacterium with probiotic qualities, in the esophagus during the progression from GERD to BE and eventually to EAC. Our previous research has demonstrated the ability of Lactobacillus spp. to not only colonize the esophagus under <i>in vitro <\/i>conditions of GERD, but also their anti-inflammatory and anti-genotoxic properties on esophageal cells exposed to bile. To assess the extent of reflux-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress during the progression of BE, we exposed two BE cell lines, CP-B and BAR-T, and the EAC cell line FLO-1 to ox bile or deoxycholic acid. Both bile types demonstrated significant increases in phosphorylated H2AX, as a marker for pronounced DNA damage repair. Next, we supplemented both live <i>L. acidophilus<\/i> and its postbiotic metabolites to cells exposed to ox bile and deoxycholic acid. We show a significant reduction in DNA damage as measured by pH2AX with both the live treatment and the treatment with postbiotic metabolites when compared to untreated, bile-exposed cells at various stages of BE and EAC. Ongoing experiments include assessing anti-genotoxic effects of postbiotic metabolites through DNA repair protein RAD51, reductions in oxidative stress though ROS marker 8-oxo-guanine, and anti-inflammatory effects through NFkB-associated inflammation. BE and EAC cell viability and proliferation upon bile exposure and postbiotic metabolite administration will also be assessed.

Although studies have identified pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) associated bacterial communities in the oral and gut samples, herein we hypothesize the prevalence of microbiota in pancreatic tumor tissues is different as compared to their matched adjacent, histologically normal appearing tissues and these microbial molecular signatures can be highly useful for PDAC diagnosis\/prognosis. In this study, we performed comparative profiling of bacterial populations in pancreatic tumors and their respective adjacent normal tissues using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics analysis. This study revealed a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinomycetota in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Interestingly, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) scores unambiguously revealed an enrichment of <i>Delftia<\/i> in tumor tissues, whereas <i>Sphingomonas, Streptococcus<\/i>, and <i>Citrobacter<\/i> exhibited depletion in tumor tissues. Furthermore, we analyzed the microbial composition between different groups of patients with different tumor differentiation stages. The bacterial genera, <i>Delftia<\/i> and <i>Staphylococcus<\/i> were very high in G1 stages (well differentiated) compared to G2 (well to moderate\/moderately differentiated) and G3\/G4 (poorly differentiated). However, the abundance of <i>Actinobacter<\/i> and <i>Cloacibacterium<\/i> was found to be very high in G2 and G3, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation of PD-L1 expression with the abundance of bacterial genera in tumor lesions. Our results indicated that three genus such as <i>Streptomyces, Cutibacterium<\/i>, and <i>Delftia <\/i>have a positive correlation with PD-L1 expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PDAC lesions harbor relatively different microbiota compared to their normal tumor-adjacent tissues, and this information might be helpful for the diagnosis and prognosis of PADC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Microbiome,Tumor,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Multiple molecular mechanisms linked to obesity drive breast cancer progression. Obesity shifts the gut microbiome in ways that may increase breast cancer risk. Microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-proteins and metabolites could directly affect breast epithelial cell signaling. In this study, we focused on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a structural component of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria and a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-agonist. Systemic LPS levels are known to increase in obesity. We hypothesize that chronic low-grade inflammation caused by LPS contributes to breast cancer initiation. To test this hypothesis, we first quantified levels of LPS, along with a panel of adipokines\/cytokines, in serum samples from women (n= 33; BMI range= 18.3-45.3 Kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>; Age range= 18-51 years). Women with elevated serum LPS had significantly higher BMI, leptin, and leptin\/adiponectin ratio, confirming a link between systemic LPS and metabolic markers of obesity. Other biomarkers of breast cancer risk include DNA damage. Analyses of non-cancerous breast tissue sections from matched donors revealed higher densities of DNA double-strand breaks (estimated based on 53BP1 foci counts) in women with high serum LPS. Experiments with HMT-3522 S1 breast acini showed that LPS increases DNA break frequencies and oxidative stress levels in 3D structures of mammary epithelium. Moreover, LPS increases oxidative lesions in the DNA (estimated based on 8-oxoguanine fluorescence in MCF-10A cells) that may lead to increased LPS-mediated DNA damage. Patient obesity status was associated with alterations in oxidative modifications in the breast proteome. We also found that LPS disrupts epithelial polarity, a hallmark of breast tissue homeostasis. In mammary epithelium, LPS activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF&#954;B) pathway by binding to the TLR4 receptor, leading to an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;). Interestingly, TLR4 blockade prevented the loss of apical polarity and DNA damage induced by LPS. Last, but not least, we show an association between LPS immunogenicity (anti-LPS IgA concentrations) and participant BMI in non-cancerous breast tissue samples. These novel findings show that LPS is a key systemic and local mediator of the obesity-modulated microbiome that increases breast cancer risk. The outcomes of our study underscore the importance of considering the microbiome in the prevention of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Obesity,Breast cancer,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Our prior study demonstrated the colon cancer protective effects of rice bran (RB) and ex vivo Bifidobacterium longum fermented rice bran (FRB) diet intervention against azoxymethane\/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM\/DSS)-induced CRC in gut microbiota-intact specific pathogen-free mice (SPF). RB showed higher levels of protection compared to FRB against CRC, as evidenced by diminished neoplastic lesion size and restored colonic epithelial integrity. The major objective of the present study was to leverage cutting-edge multispectral imaging technique for simultaneous detection of multiple immune cells markers and for a comprehensive analysis of distinct immune landscapes. We also performed spatial correlations within the tumor microenvironment of AOM\/DSS-SPF mice undergoing RB and FRB dietary interventions. The primary focus was on T cell subtypes including cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, B cells and macrophages (M&#934;) subtypes (M1 M&#934;, and M2 M&#934;) to uncover the intricacies of the immune landscape and the interplay for CRC prevention through dietary intervention. The results indicated that RB intervention for 15 weeks led to reductions in overall T cell subtypes in the colonic tissue, particularly Treg cells, which are associated with protecting tumors against immune surveillance in CRC. On the other hand, FRB intervention also resulted in reductions in overall T cell subtypes but exhibited higher infiltration of NK cells and proinflammatory M1 macrophages in the colonic tissue after 15 weeks. While an increased presence of NK cells might be beneficial in countering CRC, the infiltration of M1 macrophages could potentially lessen the impact of FRB compared to RB intervention in CRC protection. The outcomes suggest that the better protective efficacy of non-fermented RB diets is linked to the modulation of Treg cell infiltration, whereas the efficacy of the FRB diet is to some extent limited by the presence of M1 macrophages. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex immune landscape influenced by RB and FRB interventions in a murine model of inflammation-induced CRC, and a novel mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of dietary RB interactions with gut microbiota. In the future, observing immune modulation throughout diet intervention would enhance our understanding of the role played by these immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Colorectal cancer,Microbiome,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

However, whether endocrine-targeting therapies modify the non-cancerous breast microbiome to impact tumorigenesis is unknown. To examine this question, we performed 16S bacterial sequencing on DNA isolated from female C57BL\/6 mouse mammary glands (MG) administered tamoxifen citrate for 16 weeks and breast tissue from ovariectomized non-human primates administered tamoxifen citrate (TAM) for 2.5 years. In both models, we show that TAM significantly shifted &#946;-diversity and increased Firmicutes proportional abundance. TAM elevated the proportional abundance of <i>Lactobacillus spp<\/i>., <i>Streptococcus luticea<\/i>, and <i>Staphylococcus sciuri<\/i>. Female BALB\/c mice received intra-nipple injections of <i>Lactobacillus <\/i>and MG were harvested at 1-, 3-, 7-, and 14-days post-injection to show bacteria colonization and modulation of metabolism-associated gene and protein expression. B6.MMTV-PyMT mice were injected with <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> bacteria into the MG. Elevating MG <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> reduced tumorigenesis with an associated decrease in tumor proliferation and shifts in non-cancerous MG tissue metabolism. To elucidate the effects of combining TAM and probiotic bacteria on breast cancer outcomes, 4T1.2ER+ tumor-bearing female BALB\/c mice, fed either a control or Western diet were treated with TAM, <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> probiotic, or a combination of TAM + <i>Lactobacillus<\/i>. Results indicate that oral probiotic administration in combination with TAM reduced ER+ tumor growth. Plasma metabolomics revealed combination treatment elevated L-carnitine regardless of diet, suggesting drug-bug interactions modifying metabolite profiles. Cell viability assays on human MCF7 BC cells and non-cancerous mammary HMT-3522S1 cells treated with 1% probiotic-conditioned media (Pro-CM) revealed a significant decrease in cell viability in BC cells but not non-cancerous epithelial cells. Mitochondrial fuel oxidation Seahorse assay on murine 4T1.2ER+ cells treated with 1% Pro-CM, 1&#956;m 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) or combination revealed changes in metabolic substrate dependency, supporting role of microbial metabolites impacting metabolism. Tumor sections from patients with ER+ BC treated with aromatase inhibitors and\/or Faslodex in the neoadjuvant setting were stained for Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Ki67. Gram-positive bacteria negatively correlated with Ki67 immunoreactivity, suggesting endocrine-targeting therapies promote tumor Gram-positive bacteria associated with a decrease in proliferation. Taken together, our data indicates that endocrine-targeting treatments modify the breast microbiome associated with a shift in tissue metabolism to decrease proliferation and reduce ER+ BC risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-09 Microbiome and prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Microbiome,Tamoxifen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The reported impacts of fish oil, DHA, and EPA on colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC) have spurred debates, as certain studies suggest promotional effects while numerous others emphasize suppressive effects. Nevertheless, resolvins, oxidative metabolites of EPA and DHA, exhibit the ability to inhibit crucial pathways (such as TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946;) that contribute to CRC. 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of DHA and EPA, ultimately leading to the formation of resolvins. However, ALOX15 expression is commonly lost during human CRC. Whether loss of ALOX15 expression modulates the effects of DHA and EPA on CRC remains to be elucidated. We therefore conducted the experiments in preclinical CRC mouse models induced by Azoxymethane or <i>Apc <\/i>gene<i> <\/i>mutation to explore the hypothesis that ALOX15 expression in colonic epithelial cells regulates DHA and EPA metabolism to generate resolvins, subsequently influencing CRC outcomes. We found that 1) DHA and EPA exert differential effects on CRC, which can be further modified by factors such as their formulation (e.g., ethyl ester versus triglyceride); 2) targeted transgenic expression of ALOX15 in the intestines of mice (referred to as ALOX15-Gut mice) markedly augmented the production of resolvins and concurrently suppressed CRC; 3) the predominant products from the expressed ALOX15 enzymatic activity were identified as 17-HDHA and resolvin D5; and 4) the effects ALOX15 on increasing resolvin generation and suppressing CRC were consistent across various promoters used to drive ALOX15 transgenic expression in mice. These findings collectively underscore the profound importance of ALOX15 intestinal expression as a host-related factor in resolvin generation from EPA and DHA, which subsequently contributes to the suppression of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Resolvins,15-lipoxygenase-1 ,EPA\/DHA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

While interaction of natural food constituents or supplements with anticancer therapies are frequently investigated, studies on how food contaminants, such as mycotoxins, interfere with anticancer drugs is rare or lacking, despite the rise of mycotoxin occurrence in food worldwide. As the importance of the immune system during anticancer therapies is now well known, especially mycotoxins with immunomodulatory activity, such as alternariol (AOH) or deoxynivalenol (DON), which were reported as immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory, respectively, are of great concern. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate possible disadvantageous or beneficial interactions of the mycotoxins AOH or DON with the clinically routinely-used oxaliplatin, a known stimulator of the anticancer immune response as well as immunogenic cell death inducer. Effects of the mycotoxin-oxaliplatin combinations on cell viability of different colon carcinoma cell models were analyzed via CellTiter Blue, showing a mostly additive increase of anticancer activity with both mycotoxins. As the immune system was reported to play an important role in the anticancer activity of oxaliplatin, the combined influence of mycotoxins and anticancer therapies on immune cell stimulation was analyzed. To that end, monocytic THP-1 Lucia NF-&#954;B reporter cells were utilized and their activation, differentiation and polarization was monitored during combinatorial treatment, via luminescence, flow cytometry and qPCR, respectively. In line with its more immunostimulatory activities, oxaliplatin alone activated NF-&#954;B signaling in monocytic THP-1 cells. However, this increase in signaling was significantly suppressed in combination with AOH, while DON further enhanced the activation significantly. In line, during polarization of THP-1 macrophages to pro- (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) mediators, oxaliplatin strongly induced M1 markers (IL-8, TNF-&#945; and COX-2) on mRNA level, not altering the NF-&#954;B activity but partly downregulating M2 marker IL-10. This M1 stimulation was potentiated in the combination with DON, whereas AOH stimulated M2 marker expression. In conclusion, AOH was able to suppress the immunostimulatory potential of oxaliplatin, whereas DON enhanced it. Consequently, mycotoxins might affect the outcome of especially immunologically-active therapies. This should not only be considered in future risk assessment of food contaminants, but might also be a chance to fine-tune the anticancer immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Macrophages,NF-&#954;B,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Multiple preclinical studies have shown that a high-fat and high-sugar diets on the acceleration of pancreatic carcinogenesis, in the context of obesity. However, the impact of diets resembling the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid (FA) ratio in a Western-style diet, remains unclear. Furthermore, the role of the mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) in pancreatic carcinogenesis is poorly characterized. Thus, we aimed to determine the impact of a high-fat diet with a ratio of 9 parts omega-6 FA to each omega-3 FA, on early stages of pancreatic carcinogenesis in a genetically engineered LSL- KrasLSL-G12D; Ptf1aCre\/+ (KC) model of pancreatic cancer, with an emphasis on evaluating the contribution of the MAT within the pancreatic microenvironment. For this purpose, cohorts of male and female KC mice (6-8 males and females per diet group) were randomly assigned to either a control diet (CD) group (9:1 of omega-6 FAs to omega-3 FAs) or a high-fat diet (HFD) group (9:1 of omega-6 FAs to omega-3 FAs) and fed their respective diets until three months of age. After eight weeks on their diets, HFD-fed mice had significantly increased body weight, fat mass, and elevated serum leptin levels. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice had increased acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, associated with increased PCNA expression, ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation and elevated pro-tumorigenic immune cell expression compared to CD-fed mice. Although no significant differences in MAT weight or adipocyte size were observed after 8 weeks between the groups, metabolomics analysis of the MAT revealed that HFD-fed mice had significant upregulation of many key metabolites linked to proliferative and inflammatory pathways. For instance, HFD-fed female KC mice had significant differences in &#945;-linolenic acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, while male mice had significant differences in arginine biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and &#945;-linolenic acid metabolism. HFD-fed female mice had a significant increase in &#945;-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in MAT, concurrent with a reduction in inosine 5-monophosphate and &#945;-tocopherol compared to female CD-fed mice. HFD-fed male mice displayed a more pronounced difference in metabolites, including an increase in &#945;-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, malic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, and several other amino acids, with a concurrent reduction in lauric acid and palmitoleic acid compared to male CD-fed mice. In summary, a HFD accelerates pancreatic carcinogenesis through multifaceted mechanisms, including effects on the tumor and surrounding adipose depots. A HFD increases affects MAT metabolism in a sex-dependent manner, that might ultimately promote early-stage progression of pancreatic carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Pancreatic cancer,Diet,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Several studies have suggested the antitumor properties of saffron in many types of cancers including prostate. The objective of this study was to carry out in vitro studies of saffron-treated prostate cancer cells to ascertain the effects of saffron on key intermediates in prostate carcinogenesis. Our studies demonstrate significant inhibition of cell proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines via apoptotic pathways. We also demonstrate statistically significant down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase; COMT, MGMT, EHMT2, and SIRT1 in saffron-treated prostate cancer cells. In addition, saffron-treated prostate cancer cells displayed statistically significant dysregulation of DNA repair intermediates; WRN, p53, RECQ5, MST1R, and WDR70 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that saffron treatment induced changes in the expression of other key genes; DNMT1, DNMT3b, MBD2, CD44, HDAC3, c-Myc, NF-kB, TNF&#945;, AR, N-RAS and PTEN in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate important mechanistic targets of saffron mediating anti-tumor properties in prostate cancer. These findings suggest that the use of saffron supplements alongside standard treatment protocols may yield beneficial effects for individuals with prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,DNA repair,TNF-&#945;,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Due to their natural presence in colon, lung and breast tissue, bacterial therapies have been augmented using synthetic biology in order to treat infections, inflammation, and cancer. One major challenge is finding safe and effective host species and therapeutic payloads for a particular type of cancer. Here we explored the vast diversity of microbial isolates in the environment as a valuable source of novel therapeutic compounds that can be expressed by bacteria. Specifically, we isolated and identified soil bacteria from 25 local parks, and investigated their secreted compounds for anti-cancer activity using monolayer and 3D-spheroid cultures of lung cancer. Through metagenomic analysis, toxicology assays, varied growth conditions, and bacteria-cancer co-culture experiments, we found <i>Bacillus spp.<\/i> isolates from Manhattan parks' soil that secreted products with high, dose-dependent cytotoxicity against lung cancer models. We also demonstrate that <i>Bacillus subtilis<\/i>, a model organism for gram-positive bacteria, can colonize lung cancer tumor spheroids, pointing to its use as a viable strain for bacteria cancer therapy.

Recent work has shown that weight loss following bariatric surgery is potently protective against obesity-associated cancers. However, little is known about the potential anticancer effects of weight loss achieved through incretin-based therapies. We therefore interrogated the effects of the dual glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist tirzepatide (TZP) on body weight and tumor progression in a mouse model of obesity and transplanted colon cancer cells. Moreover, we tested whether TZP-mediated weight loss can reverse obesity-associated suppression of CD8+ T cell immunity. Male C57BL\/6J mice were fed either 60 kcal% fat diet (D12492) or a sucrose-matched 10 kcal% fat diet (D12450J) for &#8805;15 weeks to generate diet induced obese (DIO) or control mice, respectively. Once DIO mice reached a body weight of 47 g they were randomized to begin TZP treatment or receive a vehicle control every other day for 3 weeks (when stable body weights were reached for TZP mice). All mice then received subcutaneous injections with 2.5x10<sup>5<\/sup> MC38 cells and continued to receive TZP or vehicle. To determine the role of CD8+ T cell mediated tumor control in driving the effects of TZP treatment, mice received either CD8-depleting antibodies or an isotype control at days -2, 0, 2 relative to tumor cell injection and subsequently every 4 days. Tumor mass was determined by digital scale. Fasting blood glucose, body weight loss, and body composition were monitored to determine the metabolic effects of TZP. Immune cell populations were measured by full spectrum flow cytometry. We found TZP reduced body weight, fasting blood glucose, and adiposity relative to DIO mice, as was expected. These metabolic improvements were accompanied by reduction of tumor mass in TZP mice relative to DIO mice. DIO mice had increased levels of exhausted T cells which were normalized by TZP treatment. Depletion of CD8+ cells did not alter the tumor mass of DIO mice, indicating negligible CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor control. In contrast, CD8+ cell depletion in control and TZP mice increased in tumor masses to the levels comparable to those of DIO mice. These results demonstrate that TZP can mitigate obesity-associated acceleration of tumor growth and restore markers of effective antitumor T cell immunity. Critically, we find that restoration of CD8+ T cell function is essential for TZP&#8217;s ability to limit tumor growth in DIO mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the metabolic improvements achieved by TZP treatment are accompanied by mitigation of obesity-driven immunosuppression. These findings shed important light on the potential for TZP and other incretin-based therapies to limit obesity-associated cancer progression, and are especially timely given the growing population of patients utilizing incretin-based therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Immunomodulation,Metabolism,Metabolic syndrome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Dietary and surgical weight loss interventions reduce breast cancer risk but have significant limitations to their widespread use as anticancer strategies. Incretin-based pharmaceuticals safely and effectively promote weight loss, but whether these drugs exert similar protective effects against cancer is unknown. Here we test whether weight loss induced by the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)\/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist tirzepatide limits tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer. Ten-week-old female C57BL\/6NCrl mice were randomized to either a 10 kcal% low-fat diet (control; n=14) or 60 kcal% high-fat diet to promote diet-induced obesity (DIO; n=43). After 18 weeks on diet, DIO mice were randomized by body weight to either i) remain on the high-fat diet (DIO; n=15); ii) lose weight with tirzepatide (TZP; n=13); or iii) lose weight with 30% daily calorie restriction relative to control mice (CR; n=15). All mice were subcutaneously injected with either TZP or vehicle every other day for 13 weeks with the following escalating dosing schedule: 3 nmol\/kg TZP in week 1; 10 nmol\/kg TZP in weeks 2-3; 20 nmol\/kg TZP in weeks 4-7; 30 nmol\/kg TZP in weeks 8-11; and 40 nmol\/kg TZP in weeks 12-13. Fasting blood glucose and body composition was assessed after 9 weeks of weight loss, and 35,000 E0771 cells were orthotopically transplanted into the 4<sup>th<\/sup> mammary fat pad. Tumors growth was monitored for 4 weeks. TZP-treated mice lost on average &#62;20% weight loss by week 4 and remained at or below 20% weight loss for the remainder of the study. Directly prior to E0771 tumor cell injections, TZP-treated mice had lost 23.6&#177;8.9% body weight, versus 39.7&#177;3.6% in CR mice. Relative to DIO mice, blood glucose control was restored in both weight loss groups (DIO: 149.5&#177;18.5 mg\/dl; TZP: 124.5&#177;15.5 mg\/dl; CR: 107.6&#177;18.8 mg\/dl) and &#62;87.5% of the lost weight was attributed to fat mass, rather than lean mass, for TZP-treated and CR mice. Notably, tirzepatide suppressed tumor growth relative to DIO, but the CR group had a greater anticancer effect than TZP. Reduced tumor mass in both weight loss groups was accompanied by a significant reduction in circulating IGF-1, insulin, and leptin relative to DIO mice. These findings are timely and important because i) obesity is a highly prevalent metabolic disease that increases risk and progression of breast cancer and <u>&#62;<\/u>13 other cancers; ii) incretin therapies, which show promise as highly effective weight loss drugs, are increasingly being prescribed; and iii) the tumor suppressive effects of tirzepatide described herein newly suggest incretin agonism as another propitious option for breaking the obesity-cancer link.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Breast cancer,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Enrolled patients were diagnosed with stage I-III colon cancer and treatment na&#239;ve at time of tissue collection. Patients were classified as having a BMI &#60;30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (i.e., non-obese) or BMI &#8805;30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (i.e., obese) at baseline. Age, sex, tumor stage, and collection site were adjusted for in all analyses. Patients were 63.3 &#177; 13.7 years, 51% male, and 34% had a BMI &#8805;30. C57BL\/6J adult female mice were fed a low-fat control diet (Research Diets D12450J, n= 8) or a high-fat diet-induced obesity regimen (D12492, n=7) for ~23 weeks, at which time 700 <i>Apc-null;KrasG12D\/+;Trp53-null;Smad4-null;tdTomato <\/i>(i.e., AKPS) organoids were orthotopically transplanted into the colonic submucosa via colonoscopy-guided injection. Obese mice weighed more than controls (controls 26.4 &#177; 3.7 g <i>vs. <\/i>DIO 45.9 &#177; 9.7 g) and had more mesenteric fat surrounding the colon (controls 201 &#177; 143 mg <i>vs. <\/i>1176 &#177; 589 mg). Tumors were excised after 4 weeks of growth. RNA was extracted from bulk human tumor samples and from the epithelial-enriched EpCAM+ cell population in murine tumor samples for RNA sequencing. Genes differentially expressed between the reference and obese groups were identified using DESeq2. For gene set enrichment analysis, genes were preranked by log2 fold change for both human and mouse datasets. There were 76 and 132 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; FDRq&#60;0.10) identified in the human and mouse datasets, respectively. None of these 208 DEGs were common to both datasets. Thirty-five Hallmark gene sets in the human dataset and 25 Hallmark gene sets in the mouse dataset were significantly enriched in the obese group; 18 of these gene sets were common to both mouse and human datasets. These overlapping pathways were largely related to inflammation (e.g., inflammatory response, IL6 JAK STAT3 signaling, TNF&#593; signaling) and metabolism (e.g., cholesterol homeostasis, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism). Additional analysis revealed 204 genes common between the leading edges of both transcriptomic datasets. These transdisciplinary data suggest that obesity induces a set of metabolic and inflammatory processes and\/or pathways in colon tumors which is conserved between mice and humans. Future studies will mechanistically evaluate the role of candidate genes and pathways in obesity-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in our AKPS orthotopic organoid transplant mouse model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-08 Diet, nutrition, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Colon cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
