[{"Abstract":"The use of mitochondrial inhibitors to target oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer treatment presents a challenge due to dose-limiting toxicities. Moreover, while glycolysis-deficient cancers are vulnerable to OXPHOS inhibition in preclinical models, the full extent of phenotypical and mechanistic consequences of inhibiting OXPHOS in cancers capable of glycolysis is not yet well understood. Our results presented here offer promising insights into potential therapeutic gains from combining p53 restoration strategies with OXPHOS inhibitors, even when applied to glycolysis-competent CRC cells. Treatment with mitochondrial complex I inhibitors did not cause energy stress in CRC cells capable of glycolysis. It does, however, induce DNA replication stress, apparent through an observed cell cycle arrest at the S phase, enrichment of the G2\/M DNA-damage checkpoint regulation pathway, and replication fork slowdown. Intriguingly, CRC cells harboring wildtype p53 exhibited more severe replication stress than those carrying mutant p53. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p53 attenuates replication stress and reduces cell cycle arrest, underlining the important role of p53 in CRC cell responses to OXPHOS inhibition. Our targeted metabolomics analysis reveals that OXPHOS inhibition results in reductions in the purine nucleotides, adenine monophosphate (AMP) and guanine monophosphate (GMP), as well as the pyrimidine nucleotide, uridine monophosphate (UMP), in CRC cells, regardless of their p53 mutational status. By supplementing cell culture mediums with the purine nucleobases adenine and guanine, and the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine, we observed a partial reversal of the replication fork slowdown and reductions in cell viability. This suggests nucleotide deficiencies are involved in the induction of DNA replication stress caused by OXPHOS inhibition. The nucleotide deficiencies were associated with a decrease in the nucleobase precursor aspartate. By adding aspartate at a supraphysiological concentration, to overcome the low expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 required for cellular import of aspartate, we were able to restore the levels of nucleotides. Collectively, our findings suggest broader potential cancer treatment paradigms via OXPHOS targeting, extending beyond glycolysis-deficient cancers. Our data uncovers that CRC cells, which commonly exhibit the glycolytic phenotype, are susceptible to OXPHOS inhibition, with those carrying wildtype p53 showing heightened sensitivity. Therefore, p53 status could serve as a biomarker for predicting CRC responses to OXPHOS inhibitors. Moreover, our findings suggest that combined strategies of restoring p53 function, using small molecules such as APR-246, might enable reduced dosage of OXPHOS inhibitors in CRC treatment, thereby mitigating their dose-limiting toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,replication stress,oxidative phosphorylation,complex I inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

In human mitochondria, ClpXP degrades damaged respiratory chain proteins and is vital for the survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. This system consists of the barrel-like protease ClpP, capped by regulatory particles (RP) ClpX. In bacteria, ClpXP targets substrates with a co-translationally added SsrA sequence. However, in humans, the SsrA tag is absent, and the degradation markers for ClpXP remain unidentified. Notably, bacterial ClpXP homologues degrade substrates with phosphorylated arginine (pArg). We hypothesized that phosphorylated amino acids also mark substrates for ClpXP degradation in human mitochondria.<br \/>We showed that ClpXP preferentially degraded phosphorylated &#945;-casein substrate over dephosphorylated &#945;-casein. In contrast, ClpP activated by ONC201, without ClpX, degraded phosphorylated and dephosphorylated &#945;-casein with equal efficiency. Next, we screened a panel of phosphorylated amino acids and peptides for their ability to inhibit ClpXP-mediated degradation of &#945;-casein. Phosphorylated serine (pSer) amino acids and peptides inhibited ClpXP protease activity, while phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) or pArg did not. Likewise, Ser and free phosphate did not inhibit ClpXP protease activity. Thermal shift assays showed that pSer amino acids and peptides bind to ClpX, not ClpP. Hydrogen\/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that the addition of Ala-pSer-Ala (ApSA) peptide, but not ASA peptide induced conformational changes in the negatively-charged N terminus of ClpX, thus revealing a putative binding site for ApSA.<br \/>Earlier, we established that ClpP interacts with the respiratory chain complex II subunit SDHA. Knocking down of ClpP in AML cells affected the respiratory chain and increased reactive oxygen species. Therefore, we tested how ClpXP knockdown impacts levels of phospho-serine SDHA (pSer-SDHA) in intact cells. Using shRNA, we knocked down ClpP and ClpX individually in OCI-AML2 cells. After target knockdown, we pulled down pSer proteins and probed for SDHA. Knockdown of both ClpP and ClpX increased the abundance of pSer-SDHA compared to control. We subsequently added recombinant ClpXP protein to total mitochondrial lysates and the pSer immunoprecipitated fraction from OCI-AML2 cells. This led to decreased levels of pSer-SDHA but did not alter levels of total SDHA, consistent with its preference for pSer-marked substrates suggesting that ClpXP degrades pSer-SDHA. Further analysis showed elevated pSer-SDHA levels only in the insoluble mitochondrial protein fraction after ClpX knockdown, suggesting these might be damaged proteins.<br \/>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that serine phosphorylation promotes the degradation of damaged mitochondrial proteins by ClpXP protease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Phosphorylation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

We reported on the critical role of Protein of Relevant Evolutionary and Lymphoid Interest Domain 2 (PRELID2) in cell proliferation, emphasizing its regulatory function on mitochondrial ROS and maintenance of mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. Recent studies have begun to clarify the molecular mechanism of phospholipid biosynthesis by PRELID1 and PRELID3 under oxidative stress conditions. Inspired by this evidence, we analyzed the relationship between PRELID2 and phospholipid biosynthesis, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PRELID2 related to the control of mitochondrial ROS.<br \/>Methods: To analyze the dynamics of phospholipids and related mitochondrial molecules induced by oxidative stress, we examined the expression of YME1L and its substrates (OPA1, PRELID1) using Western blotting, which has been shown to be related to the turnover of other PRELI family proteins. Lipidomic analysis was performed using LC-MS on samples from HEK293 cells with stable expression of PRELID2 and control cells, as well as renal carcinoma cell lines with suppressed PRELID2 expression using siRNA and control cells. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes Cytochrome C and COX4 and their relationship with PRELID2 expression via Western blotting.<br \/>Results: Oxidative stress led to a noticeable decline in YME1L expression, which was correlated with decreased OPA1 and PRELID1 levels in control cells. Conversely, PRELID2-overexpressing cells retained stable expression of OPA1 and PRELID1. Furthermore, these cells exhibited a significant reduction in phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) levels. Suppressing PRELID2 expression in 786-O cells using siRNA resulted in significantly higher PG levels. When analyzing the molecules of the mitochondrial respiratory chain during oxidative stress induction, we observed that although oxidative stress induced a decline in cytochrome C expression in control cells, it remained consistent in PRELID2-expressing cells. However, PRELID2 expression did not affect COX4 levels.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings underscore the pivotal role of PRELIDs in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, proving instrumental in the oxidative stress-driven progression of renal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Mitochondria,Reactive oxygen species,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

It has a wide spectrum of clinical behavior that ranges from decades of indolence to rapid metastatic progression and lethality. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive PCa progression are still poorly understood. In PCa the expression of anoctamin 7 (ANO7) has been shown to diminish as the cancer progresses. We have previously linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the <i>ANO7<\/i> gene to the risk of aggressive prostate cancer and shown that in homozygous carriers of rs77559646, the variant leads to a total loss of ANO7 protein. ANO7 is a prostate-specific gene and is highly expressed in the luminal cells of the human prostate. ANO7 belongs to a family of calcium-activated chloride channels and select members of the anoctamin family have phospholipid scramblase activity. To uncover the cellular functions of ANO7 has proven challenging because ANO7 is not expressed in commercially available cell lines. To study the cellular functions of ANO7, we have generated stable prostate cell lines overexpressing ANO7 using lentiviral transduction. To gain information into what pathways ANO7 is affecting, we performed RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis. Interestingly, we found enrichment and downregulation of mitochondrial genes participating in oxidative phosphorylation in ANO7 cells. We assessed the mitochondrial function by measuring the oxidative phosphorylation capability of the cells and showed that the basal and maximal respiratory capacity of ANO7 overexpressing cells is indeed reduced. We also analyzed which of the three major mitochondrial fuels (glucose, glutamine and fatty acids) are not used as efficiently for oxidative phosphorylation in ANO7 overexpressing cells. The result proves that ANO7 cells are not utilizing glucose as effectively as control cells. Furthermore, the glycolysis stress assay showed that glycolytic capacity is increased in ANO7 overexpressing cells. In addition, a targeted metabolite screening revealed that aspartate is decreased in ANO7 cells, which again points towards perturbed mitochondrial function as aspartate is produced from a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate. By inhibiting the uptake of extracellular aspartate, we measured slower proliferation of ANO7 expressing cells, while inhibiting aspartate had no effect on control cells. Interestingly, preliminary results also suggest ANO7's involvement in regulation of phospholipid acyl chain length and saturation, offering insights into altered signaling observed in ANO7 cells. Taken together, this study shows for the first time that ANO7 rewires prostate mitochondrial functions and thus cellular metabolism, which could explain why it is beneficial for cancer cells to lose ANO7 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Mitochondria,Phospholipid,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Up to 90% of all lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is a complex and highly aggressive disease typical for poor prognosis and high rates of treatment resistance. Clinical management of NSCLC varies according to the stage. High-dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for localized non-resectable NSCLC. However, tumor hypoxia is a significant barrier to effective radiation therapy. In the last decade, first line NSCLC treatment has been substantially reinforced with the introduction of immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), yet long-term disease control occurs in less than 25% of NSCLC patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of treatment resistance is essential to address the dire need of introducing novel synergistic therapies to enhance anti-cancer treatment response in refractory NSCLC tumors. The basis of tumor hypoxia has traditionally been attributed to the oxygen supply deficit as malformed tumor vasculature fails to meet the high demand of the rapidly proliferating tumor mass. However, our preliminary analysis of NSCLC patient datasets in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer dataset revealed a significant correlation between high-level expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial subunits essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and high-level expression of hypoxia-regulated genes (Buffa hypoxia score). Furthermore, we have observed a direct correlation between copy number amplification (CNA) of several OXPHOS genes and hypoxia levels in patient samples. Because mitochondrial function consumes up to 90% of available cellular oxygen, its activity may be indirectly regulating oxygen availability in the tumor microenvironment by rapidly consuming oxygen upon its delivery to the tumor. Moreover, we have identified that almost 40% of NSCLC patients harbor CNA of these essential OXPHOS genes. To provide mechanistic insight into these clinical observations, we have generated mouse syngeneic NSCLC cell lines with modified mRNA expression levels of OXPHOS genes (representing deletion, diploid and amplified number of copies) identified in our screen and observed a direct effect on the rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in these cells. Our study investigates the previously unknown role of OXPHOS gene copy number in driving mitochondrial oxygen demand and thus contributing to tumor hypoxia and treatment resistance in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Copy number variation,Mitochondria,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Genome-wide CRISPR screens in isogenic MM cells with high and low NSD2 expression identified adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), an enzyme critical for transport of ATP from the mitochondria, as an NSD2-driven vulnerability. AK2 suppression in t(4;14) MM cells decreased NADP(H) critical for conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleosides by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Consequently, metabolomic studies revealed depletion of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in AK2-deficient t(4;14) MM cells, which resulted in replication stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. Exogenous supplementation with deoxynucleosides rescued AK2 depleted MM cells confirming the role of AK2 in dNTP homeostasis. In addition, NSD2 overexpression drives a large genome-wide increase in chromatin methylation, which depletes the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Accordingly, we found that high NSD2 expression in MM cells disrupts creatine biosynthesis, a process dependent on SAM. The creatine\/phosphocreatine system represents an alternative means of transporting high energy phosphate from the mitochondria. Hence, creatine supplementation restored NADP(H) levels and rescued AK2-deficient t(4;14) MM cells indicating that the hypersensitivity of these cells to AK2 depletion is driven by creatine deficiency due to NSD2 overexpression. Furthermore, AK2 inhibition impaired ATP-dependent protein<i> <\/i>folding increasing sensitivity of t(4;14) MM cells to proteasome inhibition. These findings delineate a novel mechanism in which aberrant transfer of carbon to the epigenome creates a metabolic vulnerability, with direct therapeutic implications for t(4;14) MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Cancer metabolism,Multiple myeloma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Universally diagnosed at stage IV, ATC is characterized by its lack of differentiation and metabolic dysregulation. Refractory to all established therapies, we propose natural alkaloid berberine (BBR) as a therapeutic with multitarget efficacy to alter mitochondrial metabolism and reprogram ATC&#8217;s aggressive phenotype. Assays used monocyte cell line U937, ATC cell lines T238 and SW1736, and immortalized normal thyroid cell line Nthy-ori-3-1. All assays used 100&#181;M concentration of BBR or DMSO vehicle control for 24 hours for a tumoricidal effect. Validation of in vitro findings via RNA-Seq was conducted by Genewiz from Azenta and Qiagen&#8217;s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for in silico modeling. Mitochondria were isolated via differential centrifugation. Modeling the ATC tumor microenvironment, U937 cells were activated and polarized into a proinflammatory macrophage phenotype. BBR treatment at the activation\/polarization stages, 33 soluble inflammatory mediators were downregulated in the conditioned media compared to controls. In targeting the aggressiveness of anaplastic thyroid disease, BBR slowed proliferation by 80% selectively in ATC cells from 48 to 72 hours, while sparing normal cells. BBR reduced migratory capacity by 30% in ATC cells after 24, 48, and 72 hours and reduced migration and invasion by 30%. These observations were substantiated by Western blot analysis - BBR selectively decreased phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and ribosomal protein S6, crucial downstream regulators of the pro-proliferative and pro-survival pathways in ATC cells. Further, BBR specifically modulated cancer-associated metabolism as observed through an increase in AMPK&#945; phosphorylation, a major rate-limiting protein in cancer-induced dysregulation with an anti-tumor effect. Validation of in vitro findings via RNA-Seq revealed more than 400 significantly differentially expressed genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, glycometabolism, sirtuin signaling, apoptosis, and proliferation. Following a comprehensive analysis, we identified significant downregulation of 25 of 37 total mitochondrially encoded genes (MTs) and 13 of 13<b> <\/b>mitochondrially encoded protein-coding genes comprising the oxidative phosphorylation complexes illuminating a clear link between BBR treatment and altered mitochondrial metabolism in ATC.<b> <\/b>Additionally, protein expression of significantly downregulated mitochondrial genes identified via RNA Seq was validated via Western blot demonstrating decreased mitochondrially-encoded protein expression related to oxidative phosphorylation. This work reveals a novel role for BBR as an inhibitor of mitochondrial metabolism that can be used to reprogram the aggressive nature of ATC and open the door for promising combination therapy in the treatment of ATC. <b><i><\/i><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Natural products,Mitochondria,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

This inferior survival of African American cancer patients is driven at least in part by distinctive intrinsic tumor biology, more specifically altered metabolic activity. However, underlying molecular mechanism for the African American bladder cancer mortality are largely unexplored. Our pioneering metabolomic findings demonstrate alterations in metabolic pathways between African American and European American bladder cancer, specifically those involved in driving energy metabolism. Along these line, we observed increased electron transport chain activity and ATP production in African American bladder cancer could be a result of distinctive rewiring of energy metabolism compared to their European American counterparts. We further performed gene set enrichment analysis by mapping metabolites to genes and observed that oxidative phosphorylation pathway was uniquely enriched in African American tumors compared to European American tumors. In addition, from in vitro assays, mitochondrial complex protein and activity were altered in African American bladder cancer. To determine the role of glutamine mediated increased electron transport chain activity and ATP production in African American bladder cancer, we evaluated the metabolic flux using 13C labeled tracers in both African American and European American bladder cancer cell lines. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that African American cell lines are more glutamine dependent and that producing increased tricarboxylic acid intermediates. Overall, our data indicate that elevated mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation driven by enhanced glutaminolysis may facilitate African American bladder cancer progression. These findings provide the rationale to use mitochondrial-specific inhibitors to target at least a subset of African American bladder cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Mitochondria,Metabolism,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

DDEC responds poorly to conventional platinum\/taxane-based chemotherapy, particularly in the case of extrauterine spread. This highlights a need to develop novel therapies for individuals with DDEC. Genetically, a third of DDEC cases have co-inactivating mutations of <i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>ARID1B.<\/i> These genes encode core subunits of the sucrose\/switch non-fermentable (SWI\/SNF) complex that regulate transcription. Furthermore, dual loss of ARID1A\/B is believed to play a role in driving DDEC tumor development. We hypothesize that ARID1A\/B dual-deficiency in DDEC generates unique genetic deficiencies that allow for the development of novel therapies for this cancer. We approached this hypothesis by first conducting a preliminary analysis of the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap), which has identified vulnerabilities in mitochondrial functioning in ARID1A\/B dual-deficient DDECs. As such, we aimed to understand the role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and redox homeostasis in ARID1A\/B dual-deficient DDEC to create new treatment options.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: A panel of ARID1A\/B dual-deficient and proficient endometrial cancer cell lines were treated with OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 and reactive oxidative species (ROS)-inducing agent elesclomol to identify shifts in drug response between the two groups. To account for genomic differences between the cell lines, we also treated an ARID1B knock-out isogeneic cell line with the drugs. Additionally, changes in metabolism in the endometrial cancer cell lines were measured using Seahorse metabolic flux assays to determine if ARID1A\/B dual-deficient cell lines have an increased dependency on OXPHOS for cell growth.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>While the Seahorse assays revealed no significant difference in OXPHOS and glycolysis activities between the two groups, drug sensitivity assays demonstrated that ARID1A\/B dual-deficient cancers are more sensitive to OXPHOS inhibition and increased ROS production than the proficient cell lines.

CIP2A upregulated the transcription and translation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and increases the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex IV and V, thus enhancing the function of mitochondria and promoting the level of oxidative phosphorylation in tumors. CIP2A inhibited the binding of PP2A-B56&#945; to FOXO3a, leading to the enhancement of the phosphorylation level of FOXO3a. The phosphorylated FOXO3a then translocated into the mitochondrion, and acted as a transcription factor to regulate CIP2A-mediated metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells.

A targetable class of cancer metabolic adaptation exploits mitophagy known to be linked to the cancer phenotype. Mitophagy selectively eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria by targeting them, via autophagosome shuttling, to the lysosome for degradation. Cancer cell mitophagy is triggered by elevated oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA damage caused by hypoxia, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. A high mitophagy demand can overwhelm the lysosome capacity resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and can suppress biogenesis of healthy mitochondria. We hypothesize that the newly discovered secretory mitophagy mechanism exports damaged mitochondrial fission-released segments to reduce the overload pressure on the lysosomal system, and thereby sustains cancer cell survival in the face of therapeutic mitochondrial stress. We have discovered a form of secretory mitophagy occurring <i>in vivo <\/i>in a growing solid tumor. Our molecular analysis of the full repertoire of extracellular vesicles, EVs, shed into the resident tumor interstitial fluid, IF, <i>in vivo<\/i> yielded a rich set of information about the functional state of mitochondria within the tumor cells, and the host cells. A set of proteins required for sequential steps of fission-induced mitophagy preferentially populated the CD81 positive IF EVs, including PINK1, DRP1 and FIS1. The export of cellular mitochondria proteins to CD81 positive EVs was confirmed by density gradient isolation from the bulk EV isolate followed by anti-CD81 immunoprecipitation, Mito Tracker export into CD81 positive EVs, ultrastructural characterization and Exoview analyzer. Further, we stimulated mitochondrial oxidative stress and blocked the fusion of the mitophagosome with the lysosome, which markedly stimulated the export of the secretory mitophagy unit. The outcome is new understanding of the importance of secretory mitophagy that can constitute a therapeutic target, and a new clinically relevant means of monitoring the in vivo state of mitophagic flux within the tumor microenvironment by means of mitophagy derived EVs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Extracellular vesicles,Breast cancer,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Precisely how mutations in BRCA1\/2 predispose women to develop high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is not completely understood. Although linked to various processes localized in the nucleus, BRCA1\/2 may also have essential roles in the cytoplasm, specifically in the regulation of key processes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism. Understanding how haploinsufficiency of BRCA1\/2 contributes to the potential neoplastic transformation of fallopian tube epithelial cells should reveal new insights into BRCA1\/2 function, and ultimately provide novel opportunities for preventative interventions in individuals with this mutation and new treatment opportunities for HGSC associated with BRCA1\/2 heterozygosity. We have identified distinct metabolic and mitochondrial deficits in BRCA2 mutation carriers compared to BRCA1 carriers and non-carriers. Fallopian tube epithelial cell lines derived from BRCA2 mutation carriers showed increased levels of mitochondrial respiration and activity followed by BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins regulating glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation showed differential expression based on mutation status. Transmission electron microscopy of BRCA2 mutation carriers showed increased disrupted mitochondrial networks when compared to wild type, suggesting that mutation status may contribute to increased mitochondrial fission. These observations reveal an entirely new aspect of BRCA1 and BRCA2 biology and further studies will disaggregate the effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 on mitochondrial function, versus DNA damage repair. Ultimately, this work will provide new insight into the adaptive changes within FT cells which promote neoplastic transformation and inform how high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) cells distinctively respond to microenvironmental stimuli.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,BRCA,Mitochondria,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

AMBRA1 has been implicated to exert both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive roles through regulating cell cycle and mitophagy in various solid tumors. However, the functional roles of AMBRA1 in modulating cancer stemness and tumorigenesis in HCC remain elusive. Initial analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed a significant inverse correlation between AMBRA1 expression and stemness indices (TSS) in HCC patients, with low AMBRA1 levels associated with an upregulated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene signature. To elucidate the functional consequences of AMBRA1 modulation in liver tumor development and stemness maintenance, we exploited both hydrodynamic mouse models and human HCC cell lines. Our findings indicate that hepatic AMBRA1 deletion enhances cancer stemness and tumorigenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, HCC cells with reduced AMBRA1 expression demonstrated heightened mitochondrial activity, characterized by increased oxygen consumption, respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular ATP levels. Apart from OXPHOS, we also observed a concomitant up-regulation and enrichment of MYC targets in TSS-high and AMBRA1-low HCC patients, pointing towards a deregulated c-MYC signaling to promote cancer stemness under AMBRA1 regulation in HCC. Collectively, our results demonstrate that AMBRA1 loss enhances mitochondrial function to support hepatic tumorigenesis in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stemness,Mitochondria,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yunong Xie<sup>1<\/sup>, Yimiao He<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Ma<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Man Tong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d37c73df-58bb-498f-9931-5a1418fe1dae","ControlNumber":"8576","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
