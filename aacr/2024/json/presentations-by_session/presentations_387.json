However, there is often little consideration into how nutrient availability affects the genetic dependencies of proliferating human cells. Moreover, efforts such as DepMap have catalogued cell fitness genes using <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines cultured in traditional media, which poorly replicate nutrient conditions found in the body. We recently tested the hypothesis that the nutrient environment can affect gene essentiality in human cells. By performing CRISPR screens with blood cancer cell lines, we identified sets of genes differentially required for cells cultured in traditional (e.g., RPMI) versus Human Plasma-Like Medium (HPLM). Among the strongest HPLM-essential hits was <i>HK2<\/i>, which encodes for the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2. Notably, most cancer cell lines co-express two hexokinases (HK1; HK2) that can each catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Interestingly, while these two HKs share high degrees of structural and biochemical similarity, only <i>HK2<\/i> deletion had differentially stronger effects in HPLM. Further, both HK1 and HK2 contain an N-terminal region that permits association with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). To investigate the conditional phenotype for loss of <i>HK2<\/i>, we generated <i>HK2<\/i>-knockout K562 leukemia cells, which displayed <i>HK1<\/i> expression levels comparable to those measured in control cells. We also confirmed that our <i>HK2<\/i>-knockout cells showed a stronger relative growth defect in HPLM versus RPMI. Importantly, the expression of HK2 cDNA normalized this defect. By contrast, the expression of kinase-dead HK2 did not provide any rescue effects, suggesting that HK activity is required for the conditionally essential role of HK2. We also engineered a cytosol-restricted HK2 by truncating its N-terminal OMM binding region. When we expressed this cDNA in our <i>HK2<\/i>-knockout cells<i>, <\/i>we observed complete rescue of the relative growth defect, suggesting that subcellular HK2 activity contributes to conditional <i>HK2 <\/i>essentiality. We are now purifying mitochondria to ask how the subcellular distributions of HK1 and HK2 vary with nutrient conditions. In addition, we are also comparing the tracing patterns of 13C glucose in <i>HK2<\/i>-knockout and control cells to ask how <i>HK2<\/i> deletion affects glucose utilization. Finally, given that we normalized glucose levels across our screening conditions, we are applying a systematic approach to determine the gene-nutrient interaction that underlies the conditional phenotype for <i>HK2 <\/i>deletion. Collectively, our data suggest that HK2 serves a non-redundant and conditionally essential role. We expect to generate novel insights into how <i>HK2<\/i> supports human cell growth and why this role can further depend on nutrient availability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Hexokinase,CRISPR,Conditional gene essentiality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Kimberly  S.

However, the impact of these metabolic defects on tumor-targeting immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that restricting endogenous and exogenous serine in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells results in mitochondrial dysfunction coupled to cytosolic mitochondrial DNA accumulation and cGAS\/STING1-dependent type I interferon secretion. Serine-deprived tumors have suppressed growth, accompanied by type I interferon signaling and tumor infiltration by immune effector cells. Blocking cGAS\/STING1 signaling in tumor cells limits the immunostimulatory and anticancer effects of serine deprivation. Moreover, serine-depleted tumors exhibit increased sensitivity to a programmed cell death 1 blocker. Lastly, transcriptomic data from human CRCs suggest that malignant lesions with reduced serine abundance have higher immune infiltration. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for serine as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial integrity and hence a suppressor of anticancerimmunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

In many cancer cells, serine can be taken up from the circulation or can be synthesized through the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) . We have recently discovered that luminal breast tumors are auxotrophic for serine due to lineage-specific silencing of the SSP gene <i>PSAT1<\/i>, rendering luminal breast cancer cells sensitive to serine deprivation both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. At present the only way to reduce serine availability for tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> is through dietary serine starvation, which in mice reduces circulating serine levels by ~50% and has been shown to inhibit the growth of numerous mouse models of cancer. Importantly, dietary serine is achieved in mice using a synthetic protein-free diet that may be difficult for humans to sustain. Nevertheless, dietary serine starvation is currently being explored in a clinical trial for pancreatic cancer. To circumvent some of the challenges associated with dietary serine starvation, we have developed a therapeutic serine degrading enzyme that we are exploring as a potential treatment for serine auxotrophic tumors. Our enzyme, eSDH, is based on the human serine dehydratase enzyme that facilitates the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent irreversible deamination of serine to pyruvate and ammonia. Relative to wild-type serine dehydratase, eSDH has significantly improved stability in serum as well increased activity towards serine. Injection of eSDH into mice is well-tolerated and leads to long-term, near-complete (&#62;95%) reduction in circulating serine levels without the need for dietary changes. Importantly, eSDH treatment inhibits the growth of serine auxotrophic cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We are currently assessing the efficacy of eSDH treatment in advanced models of luminal\/ER+ breast cancer and when utilized in combination with endocrine therapy and other standard-of-care treatments for luminal\/ER+ cancer patients. In addition to the degradation of serine, eSDH also depletes circulating L-threonine (threonine), which could contribute to the <i>in vivo<\/i> activity of eSDH<i>.<\/i> However, we have recently developed new eSDH variants that are highly selective for serine over threonine and show enhanced specificity for serine auxotrophic cancer cells. In conclusion, we have developed a prototypical therapeutic serine degrading enzyme that may provide an opportunity to clinically achieve more complete serine starvation in patients without the need for restrictive dietary changes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Serine metabolism,Serine dehydratase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Vipin Rawat<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Huiping Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Ladan Mashouri<sup>2<\/sup>, Prarthana Prasanth<sup>1<\/sup>, Kelly Conger<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarita Bhetawal<sup>2<\/sup>, Alessandra Araujo<sup>2<\/sup>, Everett Stone<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Coloff<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois College of Med. at Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c649f6ec-d34f-4924-9bc4-be4e8e9f28b1","ControlNumber":"8342","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

However, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced esophageal pathology remain unclear. In our previous study, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) as a transcriptional target of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in the esophageal epithelial cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the NRF2\/ACSS2 axis in regulating alcohol-induced metabolic reprogramming in esophageal squamous epithelial cells.

A key &#8212; yet poorly understood &#8212; facet in the disease state is cachexia, a multi-organ pathological state characterized by physical wasting and tissue catabolism. It occurs in 80% of PDAC patients, and to date there are no preventative or early detection methods. Cachexia leads to limited tolerance to anti-cancer therapy and contributes to disease lethality. Here, we present the first-of-its-kind systemic metabolomic analysis across cachectic stages to better understand disease progression.<br \/>We used the well-established mutant KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>(LSL\/+) mutant p53 inducible mouse model of PDAC. Model physiology faithfully recaptures human cachexia: we observe progressive overall weight loss as well as loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. As with human disease, weight loss occurs prior to loss of appetite in the animals, suggesting physiological changes independent of nutrition. Importantly, our model captures the period prior to weight loss (pre-CAC), as well as early-CAC (&#60;10% weight loss) and late-CAC (&#62;10% weight loss).<br \/>We profiled the metabolomes of the pancreas, interstitial fluid, plasma, liver, 3 different adipose tissues, and 3 skeletal muscles, from male and female mice, control and tumor-bearing, across all 3 stages of cachexia. Each tissue has a unique metabolic trajectory across cachexia stages; pathway and correlation analyses showed a particular emphasis on lipid alterations in peripheral tissues. Strikingly, we find systemic metabolic changes prior to tissue wasting, including rewiring in the liver before the presence of metastases. This indicates systemic alterations as early as pre-CAC.<br \/>We therefore used computational modeling to identify metabolites that may be participating in cross-tissue networks. A key finding, confirmed by <sup>13<\/sup>C tracing, was the circulation of lactate and glucose and their uptake by the liver and pancreas. Network maps also suggest lipid rewiring in distal tissues, changes in abundances of these same lipid species in plasma, and their consequent alterations in the tumor and liver.<br \/>A fundamental question remains: can we predict cachexia development before the manifestation of symptoms? We used feature selection algorithms based on statistical learning, training the models only on a subset of data. Specific sphingolipids and triglycerides were the key lipid species that distinguished control and pre-CAC. We find that the model &#8212; trained only on pre-CAC &#8212; is able to determine early-CAC with an 85% accuracy and late-CAC with a 90% accuracy. Thus, a limited set of metabolites that are altered in pre-CAC could have predictive value for future cachexia development.<br \/>Overall, our work provides a resource for the field and advances our understanding of systemic metabolism in PDAC cachexia. We hope this will lay the foundation for cachexia prevention and treatment.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,Cachexia,Computational biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

To comprehensively identify cancer-relevant RNA modifications and their regulators, we screened all 150 annotated human RNA modifying proteins across 18 different normal and cancer cell lines using a CRISPR-based genetic knockout system. Fifty RNA modifying proteins were essential for survival of at least one cell type. A third of these essential genes were amplified in 38 different human primary cancer types and potentially drive cancer growth. Unexpectedly, the number of essential genes per cell line varied considerably, and this variation was not due to tissue of origin. Instead, we found that cancer cell-specific mitochondrial metabolic plasticity was responsible for the unique requirement of certain RNA modifications. For example, leukemia cells with high intrinsic drug tolerance required mitochondrial flexibility to survive treatment with the anti-leukemic drugs cytarabine and venetoclax. Synthetic lethality screens revealed that drug-resistance is abolished by deleting the mitochondrial methyltransferase TRMT5, which is responsible for the formation of N1-methylguanosine (m1<\/sup>G) in the tRNA anticodon loop. In summary, our study identifies cancer-relevant RNA modifying enzymes, and reveals a novel promising drug target for therapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Acute myeloid leukemia,RNA modifications,Epitranscriptome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

We identified a novel mechanism of therapy resistance in which cancer cells enter an endocycling cell state, undergoing repeated S and G phases without dividing. As a result, resistant endocycling cells are 40 times larger than mitotic cancer cell controls. Interestingly, we observed that these non-proliferative endocycling cells can eventually give rise to proliferative progeny weeks after chemotherapy is removed, modeling cancer recurrence. We hypothesize that this endocycling cancer cell state is a critical driver of therapy resistance and cancer lethality.<br \/>We evaluated oxidative stress in endocycling cells that survived the days and weeks following chemotherapy treatment using DCF-DA staining. We found increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endocycling prostate cancer cells compared to untreated mitotic cells when normalized to cell size. Given that mitochondria are major producers and regulators of ROS, we hypothesize that cells surviving in this resistant state alter mitochondrial structure and function in response to increased oxidative stress. We performed immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy on mitochondria in untreated cells and cells following chemotherapy treatment to observe their morphology. Surviving endocycling cells had increased mitochondrial fragmentation when compared to the untreated group, a result that was further supported by reduced expression of phospho-DRP1 Ser637 via western blot.<br \/>To assess changes in glucose metabolism, we then utilized isotope tracing-based metabolomics with [U-<sup>13<\/sup>C]glucose on untreated and surviving endocycling cells following chemotherapy. Endocycling cells had decreased labeling of <sup>13<\/sup>C in TCA cycle metabolites, suggesting a decrease in mitochondrial function when compared to untreated cells. Ongoing work involves further studying metabolic reprogramming as cells enter this resistant state with parallel labeling experiments using [1,2-<sup>13<\/sup>C]glucose and [U-<sup>13<\/sup>C]glutamine to perform mathematical modeling-based <sup>13<\/sup>C-metabolic flux analysis. In addition, we engineered a cell line to track mitochondria in real-time to quantify mitochondrial dynamics underlying the morphology observed in untreated and surviving cells.<br \/>Our goal is to characterize how this therapy-resistant cell state alters its mitochondrial structure and function to survive therapeutic stress. Identifying vulnerabilities of this phenotype will enable new approaches for eliminating drug resistance in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-03 Mitochondrial function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Therapy resistance,Cancer metabolism,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
