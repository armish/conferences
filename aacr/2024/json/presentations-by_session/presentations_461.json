[{"Abstract":"Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is associated with a decrease in intestinal microbiota and beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Dietary fiber can modulate the intestinal microbiome and SCFA production which effect intestinal epithelium health and immunity. Therefore, we hypothesized that a high-fiber diet in recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) could result in an increase of beneficial commensals, concentrations of SCFAs, and decreased risk of GVHD.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated dietary data and fecal samples of allo-HCT patients receiving unmodified grafts (n=95) at MSKCC (day -10 to day +30 relative to allo-HCT) and correlated microbial &#945;-diversity (16s rRNA, n=568 samples) with fiber intake and acute GVHD in No-GVHD (n=30), Non-LGI-GVHD (GVHD except lower gastrointestinal tract, n=41), and LGI-GVHD patients (lower gastrointestinal tract GVHD, n=24).We tested concentrations of cellulose fiber (0%, 6%, 12% and 40%) in a GVHD mouse model (C57BL\/6J into BALB\/c) to assess survival, microbial composition (shotgun sequencing n=180; n=30 per group), cecal SCFAs concentrations (GC-MS n=24, n=8 per group), and lastly, T cell subsets (Th1\/Th17\/Tregs) and colonic epithelial MHC-II expression (flow cytometry n=54, n=18 per group).<br \/>Results: In allo-HCT patients, fiber intake correlated positively with microbial &#945;-diversity (R=0.3, <i>p<\/i>=0.04), especially in the LGI-GVHD group (<i>p<\/i>=0.007). Additionally, patients with high fiber intake had higher microbial &#945;-diversity compared to the low fiber cohort (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001).GVHD mice receiving a fiber-rich diet (12%), compared to 0% and 6%, had a higher microbial &#945;-diversity (<i>p<\/i>=0.01); reduced GVHD lethality (<i>p<\/i>=0.02); and a decrease in the <i>Enterococcus sp.<\/i> (<i>p<\/i>=0.004) and <i>Akkermansia<\/i> <i>sp<\/i>. (<i>p<\/i>=0.01) abundance; taxa which are associated with worse overall survival and increased risk of lethal GVHD. In contrast, compared to 12%, the 40% fiber diet resulted in worse survival (<i>p<\/i>=0.002), lower &#945;-diversity (<i>p<\/i>=0.05) and a higher abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium sp<\/i>. (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001).Cecal butyrate in GVHD mice was higher in response to the 12% vs. the 0% (<i>p<\/i>=0.01) and 6% (<i>p<\/i>=0.05) fiber diets. Mice treated with12% fiber displayed higher number of Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+), than those with 0% (<i>p<\/i>=0.001) and 6% (<i>p<\/i>=0.02); and a lower expression of MHC-II in epithelial cells (EpCAM+CD45-) vs. 0% fiber (p=0.02).<br \/>Conclusions: We demonstrated that a higher fiber intake in allo-HCT patients is associated with an increase in &#945;-diversity; especially in LGI-GVHD patients. In a pre-clinical GVHD-model, optimal fiber consumption (12% cellulose) leads to an increase in &#945;-diversity, a decrease in pathogen relative abundance, increased T-regulatory cells, and a decrease in GVHD lethality. These results suggest that dietary fiber could be utilized to prevent GVHD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gut microbiota,T cell,Bone marrow,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jenny Paredes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anqi Dai<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruben  J.

The role of the microbiome in cancer is a complex and evolving area of research. While much is still being learned, there is evidence suggesting that the microbiome can influence cancer development and progression in several ways. Some bacteria within the microbiome can produce substances that may be either carcinogenic or protective against cancer. For instance, the conversion of certain dietary components by gut bacteria can produce metabolites that may either promote or inhibit cancer development. Different cancers may be associated with specific alterations in the microbiome, for example, the gut microbiome has been extensively studied in relation to colorectal cancer, with certain bacterial species potentially contributing to the development of this cancer. However, the role of microbiome in Pancreatic cancer is still not extensively studied, henceforth, we did a preliminary study to identify novel bacterial communities around pancreatic cancer microbiome by 16SrDNA sequencing in human pancreatic cancer xenograft model mice. Isolating total genomic DNA from the pancreatic model mice feces, 16SrDNA PCR was done using specific primers and the amplicon obtained as PCR product was confirmed by standard DNA gel electrophoresis with a 1 kb standard ladder to be 1.5kb in size universal for all bacterial 16SrDNA. The amplicon was then sent for Next Generation Sequencing at Zymo Research Corporation (CA). The resultant DNA sequences were analyzed by bioinformatics studies and their phylogeny identified by comparing with 16SrDNA data base. Differential abundance of the bacteria&#8217;s of the genera Lachnoclostridium, Robinsoniella, Alistipes, Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were observed analyzing the data along with other bacterial communities. We are currently continuing the project to identify more bacterial communities of significance in the pancreatic cancer microbiome and investigating the role and significance of these bacterial communities in pancreatic cancer tumor microenvironment.

Colibactin binds directly to DNA, causing alkylating damage leading to double stranded DNA breaks. Colibactin mutagenesis results in mutations in hexameric A-T rich DNA motifs that can be identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS) as mutation signatures SBS28 and SBS88 (SBS-pks). Since WGS is not routinely used clinically, we developed an approach to specifically identify SBS-pks using a clinical targeted exon capture assay, MSK-IMPACT. In an institutional pan-cancer clinical cohort of 78,905 tumors we identified 15,967 samples with &#62; 20 mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT. We identified 150\/1,884 samples with microsatellite stable CRC with &#62;10% mutations attributable to SBS-pks. Examining clinicopathologic and genomic features of SBS-pks+ compared to SBS-pks- CRC tumors, we found that SBS-pks+ signatures are significantly enriched in younger age of onset compared to SBS-pks- CRC patients (median age 55 vs median age 59, p=<b> <\/b>0.0028). SBS-pks+ CRC exhibit similar driver mutations and tumor mutational burden (TMB) compared to SBS-pks- CRC but are associated with increased fraction of genome altered (FGA). To mechanistically investigate colibactin-associated damage we developed a novel long-term human colon organoid-microbe co-culture model system that takes advantage of reversal of polarity in suspension culture. WGS of human CRC organoids co-cultured for three months with pks+ and delta-pks E. coli NC101 confirmed induction of pks+ specific SBS-pks signatures, validating the model. Leveraging this model and a biobank of normal colon organoids from donors aged &#60;\/&#62; 50 years, we are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the association of SBS-pks with younger age of onset CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumorigenesis,Microbiome,Colon cancer,Environmental exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Oral cancers are expected to cause 11000 deaths in the US in 2023. OSCC comprises a complex microenvironment involving a 3D collagenous matrix, innate and adaptative immune cells, fibroblasts, and opportunistic microorganisms. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum, <\/i>for instance, is related to OSCC development in different aspects, such as inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and coordinating the immunological response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although some advances were achieved in understanding the OSCC TME, there is an urge to develop advanced <i>in vitro<\/i> models to investigate the immunosuppressive role of opportunistic microorganisms in OSCCs. Offering a promising avenue for studying OSCCs, organs-on-a-chip serve as microphysiological platforms that closely emulate the complexities of biological tissues within the highly controllable microfluidic, cellular communication, and extracellular matrix. Here, we developed an OSCC on-a-chip to understand the immunomodulatory profile of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> on macrophages in the TME. We cultivated oral squamous carcinoma cells in 3D in a collagen matrix (2.5 mg\/mL) in a microfluidic device that has a central chamber (1mm in width) and two lateral channels connected by triangular pillars (space between pillars of 115 &#181;m). Our tested groups were collagen matrix containing OSCC (5.10<sup>5 <\/sup>cells\/mL) in the presence or absence of heat-killed antigens (1.10<sup>6<\/sup> CFUs\/mL) from <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> (ATCC 23726). <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> cells were integrated with collagen gels and oral squamous carcinoma cells for three days. On the fourth day, we added 2.10<sup>3<\/sup> THP-1 derived macrophages (differentiated with PMA 100 ng\/mL) in the lateral channel to evaluate their chemoattraction to the 3D matrix in the presence or absence of <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> for 48 hours. We noticed a significantly higher number of macrophages invading the 3D matrices that had heat-killed antigens when compared to the groups containing just OSSCs. By immunofluorescence, we stained the cells with markers for M1 (CD86) and M2 (CD163) and observed a significantly lower number of CD86 and a higher number of CD163-positive cells in the <i>F. nucleatum<\/i> stimulated group. When cytokines and chemokines were measured from these chips by Luminex assay, we found that the presence of heat-killed bacteria upregulated TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, IL-6, VEGF, and CCL5 significantly, showing that the presence of <i>F.nucleatum<\/i> might stimulate tumor-associated macrophages-like cells. These results enable us to understand how the early interactions between opportunistic microorganisms and the immune system modulate the suppression responses in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Using scRNA-seq coupled with immune profiling analyses, we found that <i>Akk <\/i>suppressed the populations of immunosuppressive cells, including monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (m-MDSCs) and M2 macrophages, by suppressing the differentiation of these cells from monocytes, which leads to T cell proliferation and activation.

Clinically, the fecal level of <i>Akk<\/i> in HCC patients was decreased in NAFLD-induced HCC patients and serves as a potential biomarker for predicting PD1 response in HCC patients.<br \/>Conclusions:<i> <\/i><i>Akk <\/i>regulates the immune tumor environment by regulating two key immune suppressive cells via regulation of the LPS flux to develop NALFD-induced HCC. This finding provides a solid therapeutic basis for a rational combination with PD1 for the treatment of this deadly disease.

Several solid tumors including lung cancer are also implicated in the gut microbiome in cancer initiation and progression, possibly affecting signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment. However, the microbiome in the peripheral lung tissue is unexplored and their relationship to the lung tumor microenvironment is still unknown. Thus, to explore the relationship between the microbiome and the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the lung cancer tissue, especially in lung cancer patients accompanied by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We confirmed the presence of a diverse microbiome in peripheral lung cancer tissue. Next, we focused on individual species. We observed significant differences in the relative abundance of several species between COPD and non-COPD patients, and cancer and non-cancer tissue. Then, we focused on the metagenomic diversity between samples. The number of species in COPD patients and cancer tissue were decreased. And the bacterial total abundance in each sample were observed similar trend. On the other hand, alpha diversity in each sample were showed different trend to them. In the analysis of beta diversity using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), clusters were formed in each group. These findings suggest that microbiome imbalance known as dysbiosis in the peripheral lung tissue may affect the tumor microenvironment resulting in cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Lung cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Atsushi Matsuoka<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kazuhiko Shien<sup>2<\/sup>, Shuta Tomida<sup>3<\/sup>, Daisuke Mizuno<sup>1<\/sup>, Masayoshi Ohki<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryo Yoshichika<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomohiro Higashihara<sup>1<\/sup>, Naohiro Hayashi<sup>1<\/sup>, Fumiaki Mukohara<sup>1<\/sup>, Mao Yoshikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken Suzawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiromasa Yamamoto<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinichi Toyooka<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Thoracic, Breast and Endocrinological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Thoracic, Breast and Endocrinological Surgery, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Center for Comprehensive Genomic Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"88720726-a012-47cb-99fd-445d37371a78","ControlNumber":"6062","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

CH mutated macrophages and neutrophils have increased capacity to home to peripheral tissues, driving local inflammation; they are also implicated in immunotherapy related toxicity. The relationship between CH and the microbiome in those treated with immunotherapy is not well understood.<br \/>RESULTS: 35 patients with stage IV melanoma treated with upfront immunotherapy; treatment and cohort characteristics are below (Table 1). We performed error corrected duplex sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a panel previously validated for CH mutations. With a cutoff of 0.5% variant allele frequency (VAF), among 10 CHIP positive patients, we found mutations in TET2 (8\/10), DNMT3A (7\/10), PPM1D (2\/10), and JAK2 (1\/10). There was no difference in either survival or response based on CHIP status (Log-Rank Chi-Square p=0.44); however, CHIP positivity was associated with greater microbiome richness as measured by alpha diversity (p=0.0012 Shannon diversity) and distinct structural\/compositional diversity vs CHIP negative patients as measured by beta diversity (p=0.032, R<sup> <\/sup>Squared= 0.045). We inferred KEGG pathway activity from whole genome sequencing and identified that CHIP positive patients were enriched for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis while CHIP negative patients had higher expression of nucleotide sugars biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism pathways.<br \/>DISCUSSION: In patients treated with immunotherapy for melanoma, microbiome diversity signatures correlate with presence of CHIP. The analysis suggests that there are distinct taxonomic and functional features defining CHIP positivity. The effect of these cells in the tumor microenvironment and their role in immunotherapy response requires further exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Nevertheless, the bacterial strains that may have an effect, and the underlying mechanisms, are largely unknown. To identify potential bacterial species, microbiome sequencing was performed on fecal and tumor samples obtained from KPC mice and patients with pancreatic tumors in this study. To identify metabolites associated with bacteria, untargeted metabolomics were analyzed on serum and tumor samples. Furthermore, advanced and high-throughput techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, tumor organoids, engineered bacteria and germ-free mouse models, were used to elucidate the specific influence on the immune microenvironment of pancreatic tumors. Our findings reveal an increased abundance of <i>Enterococcus faecalis<\/i> (<i>E. faecalis<\/i>) in the gut during the development of pancreatic cancer, accompanied by its accumulation in the tumor. Patient-derived <i>E. faecalis<\/i> strain and its metabolite X, facilitated pancreatic tumor growth, reduced the recruitment of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, and caused their dysfunction in the tumor, relying heavily on <i>E. faecalis<\/i> intratumoral colonization. We found that X inhibits the production of anti-tumor chemokines like CCL21 and CCL8 in tumor cells, reducing peripheral CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration into the tumor. Furthermore, X was found to inhibit glycolysis and compromise the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by decreasing the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Additionally, oral doxycycline, an antibiotic that targets intratumoral <i>E. faecalis<\/i>, effectively enhanced the therapeutic effect of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. Finally, we present evidence that X may predicts efficacy and survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Together, our findings provide new insights into the role of <i>E. faecalis<\/i> in mediating the immune environment of pancreatic tumors, highlighting <i>E. faecalis <\/i>and X as potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Microbiome,Immunosuppression,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Yet, the changes in microbial features of CRC patients before and after surgery remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate the impact of surgical intervention on the gut microbial diversity and abundance at the patient level.<br \/>Methods: This hospital-based study analyzed data from 36 CRC patients who underwent CRC surgery at the Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital between January 2020 and May 2022. Fecal samples from these patients were collected twice, both before surgery and during the post-surgery follow-up period. DNA extraction from stool specimens was performed using the MAG-Bind Universal Pathogen kit. This was followed by amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region, with subsequent bioinformatics analyses conducted using QIIME 2. To compare the alpha diversity indices of patients before and after surgery, we employed both the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.<br \/>Results: Out of the 36 patients, 21 were male and 15 were female, with a mean age of 63.8 years. The average duration between surgery and post-surgery fecal sample collection was 2.3 years. Post-surgery, the alpha diversity indices decreased compared to pre-surgery, but the differences were not significant, except for Faith's PD. At the phylum level, <i>Firmicutes<\/i> and <i>Actinobacteriota, <\/i>both recognized as beneficial bacteria, increased in abundance after surgery, while <i>Bacteriodota,<\/i> typically considered harmful, significantly decreased. At the genus level, variations in microbial abundance also showed an increase in <i>Blautia<\/i>, <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i>, and <i>Collinsella<\/i>, and a decrease in <i>Enterococcus<\/i>, <i>Romboutsia<\/i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium<\/i>. The rise in <i>Bifidobacterium <\/i>abundance following surgery suggests a gut environment altered by the surgery to favor beneficial bacteria. However, a specific species decline in <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis<\/i> was observed, highlighting that CRC surgery may have distinct impacts on different bacterial species.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study indicates a slight decline in gut microbiome diversity following surgery. At the phylum level, there was an observed increase in beneficial bacteria and a decrease in harmful bacteria post-surgery, suggesting potential health improvements in CRC patients. Further research, particularly with a larger sample size and encompassing a broader range of bacteria, is needed to better understand the patterns and implications of microbiome variation in relation to surgical outcomes. Such insights could be pivotal in optimizing patient care and recovery strategies post-surgery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colorectal cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

The intestinal microbiome may contribute to CRC pathogenesis and response to therapy; how organisms drive metastasis and treatment resistance is not known.<br \/><b>Purpose: <\/b>To define the microbiome contribution to EO-CRC and response to treatment by analyzing longitudinal samples from previously untreated patients with CRC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We designed a prospective biospecimen collection platform and selected patients with previously untreated CRC. We collected stool, biopsy or surgical tissue, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline and serially throughout treatment. Stool samples were analyzed using shotgun sequencing. Alpha diversity was calculated using the inverse Simpson index and compared between groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Beta diversity was analyzed using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and compared using PERMANOVA. Multivariate associations between species abundance, metabolic pathway abundance and clinical covariates were performed using MaAsLin2 R package.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We analyzed a total of 132 stool samples from 65 patients with CRC including up to 5 samples from a single patient over time. Mean alpha diversity did not differ significantly by primary site, stage or age at diagnosis. Beta diversity was significantly different between samples from right- compared with left-sided CRC (P=.011) and pre- and post-surgery (P=.001). Beta diversity also differed significantly by diagnosis age (&#60;50 vs. <u>&#62;<\/u> 50) (P=.001 all samples, P=.032 baseline samples). When CRC baseline samples were examined at the species level, <i>Blautia glucerasea<\/i> was associated with right-sided primary (P&#60;.001, Q=.1). Considering non-metastatic cases, recurrence was associated with increased <i>Enteroscipio rubneri, Actinomyces oral taxon 448, Bacteroidales sp.<\/i> and <i>Lancefieldella parvula<\/i> (P<u>&#60;<\/u>.01, Q&#62;0.1). We further investigated metabolic pathway associations. The superpathway of L-threonine metabolism was significantly increased in samples from patients with right-sided colon cancer at baseline (P&#60;.001, Q=.03). Considering samples across all time points, right-sided colon cancer was associated with increased abundance of pathways associated with propanoate degradation, L-threonine metabolism, yeast NADPH production, and hydroxyphenylacetate degradation (all P&#60;.001, Q&#60;.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The functional effects of the intestinal microbiome may underlie the distinct biology of right-sided colon cancer.

However, the rate of SSIs following a clean surgical procedure is &#60;3%. Overuse of antibiotics is associated with potential adverse effects, including disruption of the composition and function of the native gut microbiota. Numerous studies have shown a negative impact of antibiotics on response and survival in patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint blockade. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of a single dose of perioperative cefazolin on the gut microbiome and immunity.<br \/>Methods: In this pilot trial (NCT04875728), 22 eligible pts diagnosed with clinical stage I or II melanoma undergoing wide excision with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy were enrolled between October 2021 and January 2023. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of cefazolin as standard-of-care (ABX, n=11) or no antibiotics (No ABX, n=11) at the time of surgery. Stool samples were collected before surgery, on post-operative day (POD) 14 and POD90 for metagenomic sequencing (WMS). Bulk RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at the same timepoints was performed and data processed using DESeq2, log-transformed, and standardized for subsequent analysis. Immune pathway enrichment scores were calculated using GSVA for each sample with gene lists from 3 immune pathways (ADAPTIVE_IMMUNE_SYSTEM, INNATE_IMMUNE_SYSTEM, and CYTOKINE_SIGNALING_IN_IMMUNE_SYSTEM) from REACTOME (https:\/\/reactome.org) and immune cell gene signatures from Danaher P et al, 2017.<br \/>Results: Treatment with a single dose of perioperative cefazolin was associated with a decrease in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiome 2 weeks postoperatively in pts who received perioperative cefazolin versus those who did not receive antibiotics (p=0.057, R2=0.0526); this persisted to POD90 (p=0.021, R2=0.0948). WMS showed prominent and persistent decreases in Akkermansia muciniphila (POD14: Log2FC=-8.38, q&#60;0.001) and Alistipes communis (POD90: Log2FC=-4.47, q&#60;0.001) in the ABX group compared to No ABX, respectively. RNA-seq analysis of PBMCs from pts revealed differences in immune subsets at POD90 between ABX and No ABX groups including decreased IFN-&#947; signatures (p=0.02) in pts who received perioperative cefazolin.<br \/>Conclusions: Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with profound and persistent reduction in microbiome diversity and composition, particularly of bacterial species associated with protective metabolic and inflammatory effects. Further studies will seek to assess the functional impact of this reduction on the immune response in a murine model, evaluate the generalizability of our findings across broader cohorts of patients undergoing surgery, and apply these findings to guide clinical management decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

This study aims to delineate the microbiome characteristics of CRC patients compared to healthy individuals, using a comprehensive metagenomic approach.<br \/>We utilized a cohort of 80 CRC patients and an equal number of matched healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and subjected to in-depth metagenomic sequencing, targeting both structural and functional profiles of the microbiome. Data analysis involved advanced bioinformatics techniques. Key observations were subsequently validated in an independent cohort to bolster the findings.<br \/>Our analysis revealed significant alterations in the microbiome composition of CRC patients versus healthy individuals. Notably, there was an increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria, such as Bacteroides Vulgatus in CRC patients. These bacteria are implicated in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis. Conversely, there was a noticeable depletion of beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus in the CRC group. Functionally, the microbiome in CRC patients was characterized by enriched pathways related to DNA repair, cell cycle control, and metabolism pathways like Citrate cycle and Galactose metabolism. Validation in an independent cohort confirmed these distinctive microbiomic patterns.<br \/>Our study provides compelling evidence of altered microbiome landscapes in CRC patients, highlighting potential roles in disease development and progression.

Current standard-of-care treatments allow for a median survival of 12 to 18 months. GBM has a poor survival prognosis, observing less than 6% of patients surviving 5 years post-diagnosis. Among recent treatment advancements, the oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGDOX armed with the T-cell activator OX40L is promising. Studies have unveiled a relationship between the gut microbiome and high levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as isobutyric and propionic acid, to immunotherapy response. Changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome associated to viroimmunotherapy efficacy remain unclear. Here, we assessed the gut microbial changes in addition to isobutyric and propionic acid levels regarding viroimmunotherapy efficacy. Immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice were intracranially implanted GL261-5 GBM cells and received intratumoral injections of PBS (control) or Delta-24-RGDOX. A na&#239;ve group with no tumor nor treatment was also included. Fecal pellets were collected at three different time points: (1) before tumor implantation, (2) before treatment, and (3) 14 days after the first dose of treatment. Genomic DNA was isolated with the QIAGEN DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit from fecal pellets (n=75), followed by sequencing with the Illumina platform of the 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region. Quality assessment of the sequences was executed in QIITA. Bacterial community analysis with a sequencing depth of 1,470 reads, while using the taxonomic database SILVA, was followed downstream with QIIME2 and R. Metabolic profiling of SCFA of the fecal pellets was performed through Gas Chromatography. Results showed significant differences in bacterial community structure of viroimmunotherapy-treated mice with survival of &#62;100 days compared to controls (ANOSIM p-value=0.006). Alpha diversity metrics showed significant differences in richness between the naive and tumor-implanted mice of the PBS (KW p-value=0.049) and Delta-24-RGDOX (KW p-value=0.019) groups, highlighting that tumor presence alters the gut microbiota. Additionally, viroimmunotherapy-treated mice with survival of &#62;100 days had a significant increase of <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> and the butyrate-producing bacterias <i>Erysipelatoclostridium<\/i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae<\/i>. Also, we found significantly higher levels of isobutyric acid and lower levels of propionic acid in viroimmunotherapy-treated mice with survival of &#62;100 days (p-value&#60;0.05). These findings suggest that butyrate-producing bacteria coupled with higher levels of isobutyric acid may be important in the efficacy of Delta-24-RGDOX. This highlights the microbial and metabolic changes associated with oncolytic viral therapy efficacy.

Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) provides information about the microbiome in addition to gene expression. This research probes the correlation between microbial abundance, host gene transcription, and therapeutic efficacy, pinpointing a beneficial microbial strain and its mechanism of action.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: Bladder tissue biopsies from NMIBC patients underwent WTS and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. After in silico evaluation, in vitro assays including WST, quantitative PCR, and immune cell profiling were performed on mouse splenocytes. These assays were followed by in vivo assessment in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine tumor models.<br \/>Results: Among 59 biopsies, non-recurrence correlated with heightened presence of Lactococcus species LC_001 and Bifidobacterium species BB_003. Notably, BB_003 was associated with an extended recurrence-free survival (RFS). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) implicated BB_003 in mediating a pro-inflammatory cascade, accentuating macrophages and interferons. In vitro WST assays showed the antitumor potential of BB_003_&#946;, characterized by upregulated pro-inflammatory gene transcription. This strain increased effector CD8 T cells and M2 macrophages. In vivo, direct live BB_003_&#946; introduction into subcutaneous tumors curtailed tumor proliferation. An increase in effector CD8 T cell populations within tumors and elevated cDC1 and M1 macrophage counts in tumor-draining lymph nodes were observed. Intravesical administration of live bacteria markedly decreased bladder weight, amplifying interferon alpha and beta gene expressions compared to controls.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>According to this study, BB_003_&#946; inhibits tumor growth and is involved in immune response. Our study confirmed the antitumor properties of BB_003_&#946; and suggested that cytokine and immune cell stimulation play a key role in its mechanism of action.

One of the emerging components of interest in the tumor microenvironment is the presence of intracellular microbes. Numerous studies have focused on colon and pancreatic cancer because of their proximity to the commensals in the gut. The female reproductive system is another site in our body where the rich vaginal microbiome has the potential to affect nearby organs and impact diseases. However, there is still little investigation done to understand the impact of microbes on Ovarian Cancer (OC).<br \/>Objective: To understand the role of the microbiome in OC metastasis, to develop new therapies to target the tumor microbiome<br \/>Methods: We used a co-culture study, the parameters of which were optimized to study the infection of microbes in different cell lines. Using a wide array proteome profiler, we looked for cytokines and chemokines to understand changes in signaling post-infection. Protein levels in the conditioned media using ELISA. Changes in actin, paxillin, and LC3B (autophagy marker) were monitored using immunofluorescence microscopy and western blots. Migration was studied by using transwell assay and spheroid cultures.<br \/>Results: We have identified two species of bacteria preferentially enriched in human ovarian tumors based on recent findings in the literature. We have demonstrated that these microbes are better at infecting OC cells in vitro over non-specific bacteria, can reside intracellularly, and are metabolically active. Upon infection, this intracellular uptake drives the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine signaling by cancer and normal ovarian surface cells. We have also observed increased autophagy, changes in the actin cytoskeleton and reduced Paxillin foci on cancer cells infected with OC-associated microbes. This has led to increased migration in them; however, inactivated microbes did not change their migratory behavior. The infection also caused individual tumor cells to form more numerous and larger colonies when seeded into soft agar, suggesting an effect on cancer cell migration. Furthermore, we have shown that these microbes also elicit a more robust reaction in immune cells like Dendritic cells and macrophages, causing them to secrete chemokines like CCL 2,3,4,5, which also cause the cancer cells to migrate and have the potential to recruit neutrophils to drive the tumor microenvironment towards an immunosuppressive phenotype.<br \/>Conclusion: Most ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at Stage III\/IV, where cancer has metastasized, and is unresponsive to immunotherapy as the cancer is considered &#8220;cold&#8221;. Through functional studies, we were able to gain insights into the role of the microbiome, which is associated with the clinical outcomes of OC, hoping to potentiate the existing therapies by probing the tumor microbiome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Tumor metastases,Autophagy,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
