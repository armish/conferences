[{"Abstract":"<b><i>Introduction:<\/i> <\/b>Bladder cancer (BlCa) ranks as the sixth most prevalent cancer in the world. A number of urine based BlCa detection tests have recently been approved for clinical use, including the NMP22 tests and the bladder tumor antigen (BTA) tests for both detection and monitoring of patients with known bladder cancer. The FDA have approved them both for surveillance in BlCa only in conjunction with cystoscopy. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are poor, and cannot distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive tumors. This project aims to identify alternate markers that can overcome these drawbacks.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i> <\/b>We characterized the global metabolome of 47 bladder tumors retrieved by radical cystectomy (RC) or TURBT, including 14 specimens with matching plasma and serum samples. All specimens were subjected to untargeted metabolomic approaches with gas chromatography- time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) to profile primary metabolites, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography MS (HILIC-QTOF MS) to profile biogenic amines, and liquid chromatography charged surface hybrid MS (LC-CSH-QTOF MS) to characterize complex lipids. Differentially expressed metabolites were analyzed with respect to grade, stage, metastases, and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For selected metabolites, area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated as % sensitivity vs. 100% specificity. Expression of highly discriminatory metabolites were then validated in the plasma and serum samples to determine which forum would provide greater specificity.<br \/><b><i>Results: <\/i><\/b> We first assembled a discovery cohort of 33 patients who did not have matching blood specimen for primary metabolites, biogenic amines and complex lipids. Comparison of high vs low grade tumors yielded two lipids, a sphingomyelin (SM (d38) and a phosphatidylcholine PC(p-38), that were significantly different (adjusted p-value&#60;0.05, log<sub>2<\/sub>fold change&#62;2.5). These results were validated in the 14-sample cohort with matching plasma and serum of which the latter showed significant correlation between tumor and plasma (Spearman R=0.872, adj p=0.03).<br \/><b><i>Conclusions:<\/i><\/b> Our results indicate that certain sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines may be useful as plasma markers of high grade BlCa. Further analyses are required to evaluate whether these markers are more discriminatory compared to existing urinary markers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-04 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Plasma,Metabolomics,Phospholipid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.-M.

It also plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer development and progression. Advance-stage prostate cancer treatment is primarily based on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that blocks the male hormone testosterone. Moreover, prostate cancer patients who undergo ADT develop cognition impairment such as loss of memory, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Several studies have shown a positive association between ADT and the risk of cognitive impairment. Currently, there are no clinical markers to identify patients at-risk to ADT-mediated cognition. This demands a need for biomarkers that can help distinguish the vulnerability of patients toward cognitive impairment undergoing ADT. We utilized a in-vivo model to identify biomarkers and the impact of ADT in different regions of the brain. Sixteen-week-old BALB\/c mice were gavage 50 mg\/kg\/day of enzalutamide (mimicking ADT) for 5 days per week (0.2 ml of vehicle consisting of 0.5% methylcellulose and 0.025% Tween 20) for a total of 8 weeks. Control animals received 0.2 ml vehicle per day for the same time period. Mice were observed for behavioral changes post-enzalutamide treatment and brain PET scans were generated. The experiment was terminated, the brain was excised for cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and subjected to mass spectroscopic (MS) analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified and validated using qRT-PCR in the mice blood. Enzalutamide treatment for 8 weeks resulted in a modest weight gain and lack of attention and letharginess in these mice. Examination of PET scan and H&#38;E sections of mice brain from control group by light microscopy showed a normal morphology of neurons in the cortex. Enzalutamide treatment showed lower neuron density and signs of neuron injury, as well as cytoplasmic swelling of the astrocytes. MS analysis identified a number of differentially expressed proteins that were validated in the blood. These include ABCB10, CAB, DAZAP1, DCU, DERL1, FBXO, MBNL, PUM2, SERL1, SLC8A3, SLC9A, TCF20, VIM, and ZYXIN. Among them, the expression of SLC8A3, PUM2, and SERL1, were significantly higher than others in the enzalutamide-treated group. Taken together, our findings suggest that enzalutamide treatment in mice leads to cognitive impairment like that observed in men on ADT protocol. Our study highlights that blood-based markers can be developed for ADT-mediated cognition which can lead to the identification of new strategies for prevention and early intervention to improve the quality-of-life of patients suffering with advance-stage prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-04 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen deprivation therapy,Cognitive impairment,Biomarkers,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most common chemotherapy-induced side effects that impact 50% of all patients who receive chemotherapy and can lead to discontinuation of drug treatment. Treatment with Bortezomib (BTZ), Cisplatin (CIS), and Vincristine (VIN) has been established as the most common trigger of Chemotherapy&#173;lnduced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) among cancer patients. Since CIPN can lead to disabling long-term adverse effects, many cancer patients discontinue or limit their treatment regimen once they see signs or symptoms of CIPN. Therefore, it was hypothesized that developing diagnostic\/prognostic biomarkers that can accurately predict the onset or progression of CIPN would help to determine the chemotherapy eligibility with the above-mentioned drugs and proactively prepare for protective care. Hence, our initial goal was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of CIPN that would allow for the identification of suitable biomarkers that can be used for monitoring before or during chemotherapy with BTZ, CIS, and VIN. Initially, we conducted i<i>n vitro<\/i> studies to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms activating CIPN related pathways. We used neuronal Schwann cells (RT4), for testing the neurotoxic effects of BTZ, CIS, and VIN that might precede or coincide with the onset of CIPN in an <i>in vivo<\/i> condition. Interestingly, the BTZ treatment was able to significantly reduce the intracellular level of NSE and S100B in RT4 cells compared to the untreated controls, when they were measured using an immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. Furthermore, we conducted an <i>in vivo<\/i> study to determine the CIPN using rats. We used the sciatic nerve (SN) from drug-treated animals to check the S100B level using the ELISA method. Our preliminary results showed that levels of S100B in the SN of Rats were reduced following 8 weeks of treatment with the PN-inducing chemo drugs. We anticipate that this study will enrich our understanding of how chemotherapy medications induce PN in cancer patients and guide us to identify reliable biomarkers (This project was supported by the PFRDG grant of the Nova Southeastern University, Ft.

HPV represents a more recent risk factor for which treatment may be individualized. HPV expresses viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins which downregulate wild type p53 and Rb respectively. Triptolide, a derivative of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been shown to inhibit viral E6, thereby reactivating wild type p53. Therefore, triptolide may target HPV positive HNSCC as a putative treatment. To explore this, we compared mutation, methylation, and expression of triptolide gene targets between HPV positive and HPV negative samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program.<br \/>Patient data was queried from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas for HNSCC using cBioPortal. This included a total of 523 patients with 487 meeting inclusion criteria. 415 patients were HPV (-) and 72 were HPV (+).Differences in direct genomic alterations, DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and protein expression of the 34 known triptolide targets were compared between these two groups using the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure with a significance level of q &#60; 0.05.<br \/>Significant differences of the studied genes (q &#60; 0.05) are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in protein expression.<br \/>Of the 34 known triptolide targets, HPV positive and negative samples show variable enrichment. Triptolide targets exhibit greater methylation and mRNA expression in HPV positive samples supporting triptolide&#8217;s efficacy in these samples. However, other triptolide targets are the differentially expressed and methylated in HPV negative samples, so the compound may have a beneficial effect in this context as well. Further studies are required to test efficacy of triptolide against HPV positive and HPV negative HNSCC in vitro and in vivo models.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{D072406F-7E37-4DE6-8CCE-1EECD001D115}\"><caption>Table 1.

Whether specific characteristics of APC mutation or APC-related signaling pathways contribute to tumor initiation, advanced progression, and recurrence in the precancerous lesions remain to be elucidated. This study included145 sporadic precancerous adenomas from the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. Expression of six APC-related proteins (&#946;-catenin, p-YAP, CtBP, EB1, Asef, and N-terminal APC) in adenoma and non-tumor tissues (n=22) were quantitatively detected by immunohistochemistry. Targeted sequencing of APC was done for 108 adenomas. Metachronous adenoma status was obtained from chart review. <i>YAP<\/i>-correlated genes and their functional enrichment analysis were conducted using gene expression data of 326 adenomas from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We found that nuclear &#946;-catenin and p-YAP overexpression only existed in adenoma tissue, correlated with each other (r=0.26, <i>P<\/i>=0.0018), and associated with APC mutations (<i>P<\/i>=0.05). P-YAP was strongly associated with odds of large adenomas (OR=14.25, 95%CI=3.32-61.18, <i>P<\/i> trend&#60;0.0001), villous growth pattern (OR=58.71, 95%CI=10.49-328.61, <i>P<\/i> trend&#60;0.0001) and advanced adenomas (OR=12.62, 95%CI 4.57-34.86, <i>P<\/i> trend&#60;0.001), and showed a significant interaction with nuclear &#946;-catenin on advanced tumor (OR=16.82, 95%CI 4.41-64.08, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001). After adjusting for selected covariates and mutually adjusting for biomarkers with <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.20 in crude models, p-YAP overexpression remained significantly associated with advanced adenomas (OR=12.31, 95% CI=3.78-40.10, <i>P<\/i> trend&#60;0.0001). YAP-correlated genes were significantly enriched in autophagy, unfolded protein response, and sirtuin pathways with predominantly pro-tumorigenic alterations. APC mutation and selected biomarkers were not significantly associated with metachronous adenoma. In conclusion, p-YAP overexpression might be a promising biomarker for high-risk sporadic adenoma. In addition to its synergistic effect with nuclear &#946;-catenin, p-YAP may play tumorigenic roles through interaction with other cancer pathways in human sporadic adenoma. This study provided new evidence for oncogenic effects of p-YAP in human sporadic adenomas and shed light on the complex network of Hippo, Wnt, and other oncogenic signaling pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-10 Molecular markers in prevention research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Colorectal adenoma,YAP1,APC mutation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The British Society of Gastroenterology 2020 (BSG20) guidelines stratify patients into high\/low risk of metachronous disease, using the size, dysplasia, and number of polyps found at index colonoscopy. This study aims to explore the prognostic significance of Ki67 proliferation percentages in adenomatous polyps, with metachronous disease. Tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from 1201 index adenomatous polyps with representative cores of basal and luminal adenomatous epithelia. 67% patients were identified as high risk at index colonoscopy. The median time to detect metachronous polyps was 55 months (range 6-72 months) with 56% of patients developing metachronous polyps by the end of follow-up. TMA was stained for Ki67 using immunohistochemistry. Ki67 proliferation percentages in adenomatous epithelia was quantified using QuPath. Data was split into training (n=830) and test (n=371) datasets. The Ki67 proliferation cutpoint was made using Survmine R package using the training dataset. X<sup>2<\/sup> test was used to study associations with clinicopathological criteria and Kaplan survival analysis was used to assess Ki67 association with metachronous lesions. Ki67 percentages were higher in lumina than in basal adenomatous epithelium (median Ki67 were 63% &#38; 48%; respectively). Total Ki67 percentages were computed by averaging luminal and basal values. Thresholds of 70%, 64% and 59% were employed to classify patients into low\/high categories based on luminal, basal or total percentages; respectively. In the training cohort, high luminal, basal or total Ki67 were associated with metachronous lesions (p values 0.032, &#60;0.001 and 0.006; respectively). Other associations were significant between luminal or total Ki67 and location of index polyps (p=0.017 &#38; p=0.044; respectively), histology (p=0.019) and advanced future lesion status (p=0.002 &#38; p&#60;0.001; respectively). In multivariate cox regression analysis, high Ki67 was an independent prognostic factor for metachronous polyps (luminal Ki67 HR=1.28, CI: 1.052-1.560, p=0.014; basal Ki67 HR=1.639, CI: 1.313-2.046, p&#60;0.001; total Ki67 HR=1.344, CI: 1.105-1.635, p=0.003) when adjusted to number of index polyps and BSG20 risk score. BSG20 risk score stratification of patients in terms of metachronous disease was improved when combined with luminal, basal or total Ki67 in the training datasets (all p&#60;0.05). Prediction of metachronous disease by the combined groups was validated in the test cohort for luminal, basal and total Ki67 (all p&#60;0.05). High Ki67 proliferation rates in adenomatous polyps are independently associated with the development of metachronous polyps and may help improve the BSG20 criteria.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-10 Molecular markers in prevention research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenoma,Colorectal,Biomarkers,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

However, the relationship of accelerated aging with metabolic dysfunction across different levels of BMI (i.e., metabolic obesity phenotype) and whether it may mediate the relationship with obesity-related cancer (ORC) risk is not well established.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To test this hypothesis, we are leveraging existing blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) data within the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative (WHI) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohorts. Weight, height and blood pressure were measured by trained technicians in the respective cohorts and fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were quatified by standard clinican assays. Metabolic obesity phenotypes are classified as metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), metabolically healthy overweight\/obese (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy overweight\/obese (MUO) when defined by ATP III criteria. Age acceleration was measured as a residual from regressing pan-tissue Horvath&#8217;s DNAmAge on chronological age.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The mean baseline age was 64 &#177; 6.6 years and 54 &#177; 5.7 year among WHI and ARIC participants, respectively and the age acceleration was measured at an mean follow-up time of 16 years from baseline for WHI and 3.5 years from baseline for ARIC cohort. The outcome of interest, ORC incidence was observed among 474 participants of which 387 were women. The median time for cancer diagnosis from baseline was 25 year and from DNAm measurement was 18.6 years. Of the 4341 (70% women) participants included in the analysis, 23.9% were MHNW, 3.2% MUNW, 39% MHO, and 33.5% MUO. A 31.5% of MHNW, 40.4% of MUNW, 28.7% of MHO, and 35.2% of MUO showed age acceleration. MUNW (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11) and MUO (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.40) individuals at baseline had increased odds of experiencing age acceleration at a follow-up visit. The risk of all ORC combined was significantly elevated among MUO (HR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.27-2.09) compared to MHNW. Age acceleration at the follow-up visit was not significantly associated with ORC risk (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.75-1.11). These analyses were not adjusted for confounders.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> MUNW and MUO individuals had increased odds of age acceleration at a follow-up visit. Furthermore, MUO individuals were at an elevated risk of ORC, compared to individuals with MHNW. Accelerated aging does not appear to mediate this association, as accelerated aging was not associated with ORC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-10 Molecular markers in prevention research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolic syndrome,Methylation,Aging,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Prasoona Karra<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Garnet L.

Early detection can limit the need for aggressive treatments and improve prognosis. We analyzed early immune and molecular markers in benign breast disease (BBD) biopsies prior to BC development to identify women at elevated risk of developing node-positive invasive BC, which might direct surveillance and prevention efforts aimed at reducing incidence of this disease. Utilizing the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort, we compared women who developed node-positive BC following their BBD biopsy (cases; n=42) with those who remained cancer-free (controls; n=37), matched on patient age and biopsy date. We used NanoString nCounter system to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cases and controls. We also developed a multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) approach using Opal system by Akoya Biosciences for comprehensive marker detection in FFPE tissue, enabling correlation of cells expressing DEGs with innate and adaptive immune cells. Digitized images were segmented, and cell phenotyping, and spatial relationships were compared between cases and controls. Our findings revealed significantly increased expression levels of IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8, a factor involved in immune cell differentiation) in controls as compared to cases and found that increased IRF8 expression in cases is correlated with delayed cancer onset. Additionally, controls exhibited higher frequencies of CD4+, CD8+, CD68+, CD20+ and CD11c+ immune cells, and lower frequency of Ki67+ staining, with a notable increase of CD11c+\/CD68+ cells, a marker for M1 type macrophages, indicating a pro-inflammatory, antitumorigenic immune microenvironment polarization. Furthermore, our mIF analyses offer new insights into spatial biomarker localization, enhancing prognostic accuracy. Our findings suggest that decreased numbers of immune cells in BBD biopsies may be associated with increased risk of developing axillary node-positive BC. This research underscores the importance of dissecting molecular and immune interactions in BBD for assessing the risk of this disease. Our results have the potential to improve individualized risk assessment, leading to more targeted surveillance and informed screening, potentially reducing BC incidence and mortality through early intervention. This study not only contributes to our understanding of BC pathogenesis but also opens avenues for developing novel preventive strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,cancer immune suppression,breast cancer,benign breast disease,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), the transdifferentiation of acinar cells into duct-like cells, is a predisposing event to PDAC development that is also linked to Hippo signaling, a major pathway involved in fibrosis and inflammation. Hippo activation is initiated by the yes-associated protein (YAP) in conjunction with the PDAZ binding motif (TAZ) and TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor. Thus, the synthesis of the novel covalent TEAD autopalmitoylation inhibitor, CV-4-26, presented an opportunity to therapeutically target ADM. CV-4-26 binds to the TEAD lipid binding pocket, which, in turns, hinders TEAD palmitoylation, thereby leading to the inhibition of the Hippo pathway. Utilizing our 3D organoid p48Cre\/+LSL-KRASG12D\/+ (KC) mouse model, we demonstrated pronounced phenotypic and molecular inhibition of ADM by CV-4-26, resulting in a conserved acinar phenotype, as well as downregulation of downstream markers of the YAP\/TAZ complex. The compound did not reverse ADM to the acinar state once ducts were visibly formed. Yet, CV-4-26 demonstrated a lack of cytotoxicity (up to 25 &#181;M) as determined by Calcein AM staining. Biomechanical measurements of extracellular matrix stiffness acquired through calculations of fluorescent nanoparticle displacement further displayed decreased moduli as a response to inhibition treatment. Moreover, a 56-fold downregulation of collagen (COL1A1, COL1A2) mRNA, markers for PDAC development, was observed. However, less reduction in the collagens and extracellular matrix stiffness was observed in the ADM reversal treatments, corroborating our morphology and gene expression results. Our data suggest that combining CV-4-26 by ADM inhibition with standard of care therapies for PDAC may enhance the penetration of small molecules through the tumor&#8217;s extracellular matrix.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,acinar ductal metaplasia,Organoids,YAP\/TAZ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In the United States, it is estimated that there were 26,500 new cases and 11,130 deaths from stomach cancer in 2023. Unfortunately, despite improved treatment in recent years, ~65% of gastric cancer patients present with aggressive metastatic disease, and they die within one year of diagnosis. Therefore, the identification of newer and effective therapies to target the precancerous stages of the disease promises possibilities for the prevention of gastric cancer in patients harboring these lesions. Gastric metaplasia and dysplasia are precancerous lesions that often progress to gastric cancer. Since anti-VEGF-A anti-angiogenic agents have shown efficacy in advanced gastric cancer patients, we hypothesized that VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis has a functional role in the pathogenesis of gastric metaplasia and dysplasia.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: The Initial experiments were undertaken in human gastric metaplasia and dysplasia tissues and murine gastric metaplasia and dysplasia tissues collected from a well-established <i>Helicobacter felis<\/i> (<i>H. felis<\/i>) induced murine model of gastric tumorigenesis simulating human patients to detect angiogenesis (CD31\/MVD) and identify angiogenic pathways using GeoMx DSP Spatial Proteomics and NanoString nCounter assay. Thereafter, further experiments were undertaken in the <i>H. felis<\/i>-induced murine model of gastric metaplasia and dysplasia, simulating human patients using VEGF-A hypo mice to determine the role of VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in the progression of these lesions.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: Although our results indicated angiogenesis and VEGF-A expression in both human and mouse gastric metaplasia and dysplasia, inhibition in the progression of the precancerous gastric lesions was observed in only 40% of the VEGF-A hypo mice, thereby suggesting that VEGF-A induced angiogenesis might not be the major angiogenic pathway in these precancerous lesions in every patient. A similar phenomenon is also seen in some gastric cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Prevention,Antiangiogenesis,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

SMUG1, an enzyme involved in base excision repair, removes uracil and certain oxidized bases from DNA to mitigate adverse genotoxic and mutagenic effects and represents a promising target for cancer therapy. A growing body of evidence suggests that SMUG1 is involved in tumorigenesis, and deficiency of SMUG1 correlates with poor prognosis in several cancers. We hypothesize that upregulation of SMUG1 by a small molecule activator may be a viable strategy for reducing tumorigenesis in at-risk populations. We report on the properties of SU0547 - a SMUG1 activator that was derived from the EGFR inhibitor drug gefitinib - which shows reduced kinase inhibition and potent activation of SMUG1 both in vitro and in human cell lines.<br \/>Methods: MTT proliferation assays were used to screen for toxicity and to determine the effect of SU0547 on 5-hydroxymethyl-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine (5-hmdU)-treated cell lines. The effect of the compound on SMUG1 expression was determined by Western blot and RT-qPCR while its effect on DSBs via &#947;H2AX expression in 5-hmdU-treated cells was determined by immunofluorescence and Western blot.<br \/>Results: SU0547 activates SMUG1 by 347 &#177; 50% in vitro at 100 nM, with an AC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.55 &#177; 0.62 &#181;M. We examined whether it can modulate SMUG1 activity in a panel of human cell lines by artificially inducing DNA damage with the native SMUG1 substrate 5-hmdU and treating cells with the activator. In all five human cancer cell lines tested, SU0547 caused the cells to become significantly more resistant to 5-hmdU by factors of 2.1 to 5.3-fold. A series of CRISPR-Cas9 generated SMUG1 KO cell lines showed resistance to 5-hmdU and SU0547 had no effect on these treated cells, confirming that this activator acts on endogenous SMUG1. To determine the effect of the activator on double-strand breaks (DSBs), cells were treated with 5-hmdU with or without the compound and DSBs were visualized and quantitated by examining &#947;H2AX foci. 5-hmdU treatment induced &#947;H2AX foci while SU0547 treatment significantly reduced these foci to near or below baseline levels. These results were confirmed using Western blot quantitation of &#947;H2AX.<br \/>Conclusions: We envision that this activator will serve as a useful tool for further studying the role of SMUG1 in mediating 5-hmdU toxicity and will enable the testing of our hypothesis that enhancing DNA repair processes may serve to inhibit mutagenesis and slow progression of pre-neoplastic lesions to invasive cancers associated with genomic instability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair enzymes,Chemopreventive agents,Cancer prevention,Oxidative DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

As this cancer is frequently slow growing, opportunities for cancer interception exist, particularly among men with low-grade tumors who frequently undergo active surveillance. A well-tolerated vaccine intervention would be ideal for this population. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines built on a replication-deficient alphavirus backbone such as VEEV, offer several advantages for vaccine development. Sequences for relatively large antigens can be encoded and efficiently expressed, at low vaccine doses. Practical and efficient delivery of the saRNA is possible with advanced nanoparticles such as cationic inorganic lipid nanoparticles (LION). Among candidate antigens for a prostate cancer interception vaccine, we selected prostein (SLC45A3), a protein whose natural expression is restricted to the prostate gland and prostate cancer and ERG, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors frequently involved in chromosomal translocations in prostate cancer. We generated saRNA constructs with several design strategies and demonstrated that upon in vitro transfection, both antigens are expressed as assessed by mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. This was achieved using commercial transfection reagents and LION. Prostein expression was particularly notable in that this eleven-transmembrane protein could be detected in HEK-293 cells using flow-cytometry and cell-surface staining. Nearly 50% of the cell population stained positively. Immunogenicity of the vaccines was tested in mice. Following formulation with LION particles i.m. injection and boosting, saRNAs coding for prostein elicited strong cellular immunity as demonstrated by IFN-&#947; ELISPOT analysis. Detailed analysis of intracellular cytokine expression indicated a strong CD8 response. saRNAs coding for ERG also showed antigen-specific ELISPOTs. Using commercially available recombinant ERG protein, an ELISA was developed and a strong humoral response to the ERG saRNA vaccine was demonstrated. The saRNA vaccines will be further credentialled with additional preclinical studies including cancer preventive efficacy studies in genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Premalignancy,Vaccines,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Most patients with HGSC are diagnosed at advanced stage diseases. Despite the high response rate to platinum\/taxane-based chemotherapy, most of these patients will develop recurrent chemoresistant disease. Recent studies showed the cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play an important role in modulating the malignant phenotypes of HGSC. CAFs are primarily responsible for producing factors such as cytokines and growth factors to modify the TME niche to promote the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Recently, we have identified a previously unrecognized mechanism in which metabolism of reactive CAFs is reprogrammed through an upregulated glutamine anabolic pathway in HGSC. This dysfunctional CAF metabolism confers atypical metabolic flexibility and adaptive mechanisms in CAFs, allowing them to harness carbon and nitrogen from noncanonical sources to synthesize glutamine in nutrient-deprived conditions existing in the TME. Our preliminary data show that tumors developed from syngeneic fallopian epithelial cell-derived cancer cells injected IP into C57BL\/6 mice, which started to be fed with normal diet two weeks before tumor cells injection had significantly higher tumor burden than those fed with the glutamine-deprived diet. Moreover, tumor-bearing mice treated with glutaminase inhibitor for 3 weeks demonstrated significantly lower tumor burden than those treated with the control vehicle. These findings suggest that the interplay between CAFs and HGSC cells enriches glutamine in the ovarian TME; and glutamine depletion can not only suppress ovarian tumor growth but also prevent the development of advanced progressive diseases. In addition to the direct promoting effect of glutamine on the glutamine addicted HGSC cells, increased CAF-derived glutamine can also affect the activity of other stromal cell types such as immune cells in the TME, which subsequently modulate HGSC cell growth. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) were performed on serial tissue sections of tissue microarrays generated from the abovementioned murine samples. Mice fed with a glutamine-deprived diet or treated with the glutaminase inhibitor not only have a significantly lower tumor burden but also induced dramatic changes in the cellular and molecular composition within the TME. In particular, mice fed with a glutamine-deprived diet had greater B-cell-related immune response, reduced stemness, and EMT of ovarian cancer cells, and more activated CAFs, which may result in increased stiffness of the ECM and subsequently enhance the malignant phenotype of HGSC cells. Further studies to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which spatial cellular and metabolic profiles modulate HGSC pathogenesis and progression are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-11 Molecular targets for prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Glutamine metabolism,Ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Chemoprevention, which aims to prevent CRC through eradication or prevention of precursor colonic adenomas, represents an alternative strategy to address this problem. The imipridone dordaviprone (ONC201) has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells through both upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and the integrated stress response. More recently, we have shown that ONC201 induces TRAIL and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and reduces adenoma formation in the<i> <\/i><i>Apc<\/i><i><sup>min\/+<\/sup><\/i> CRC mouse model. We hypothesized that ONC201 would similarly enhance human colonic adenoma cell death through both TRAIL-dependent and TRAIL-independent mechanisms. We therefore evaluated the effects of ONC201 in two adenoma-derived organoid lines: one developed from an adenoma obtained from an individual with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and the second from a sessile serrated adenoma (SSA).<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Sensitivity of the FAP and SSA organoid lines to ONC201 was assessed using CellTiter-Glo&#174; luminescent cell viability assay. Organoids were plated in triplicates and treated with ONC201 (concentration ranging from 0 uM to 20 uM). Results were analyzed after 72 hours of incubation. Western blotting was performed on lysates generated from organoids treated with either 1.69 uM DMSO, 1.69 uM ONC201, or 3.38 uM ONC201 for FAP and 1.23 uM DMSO, 1.23 uM ONC201, or 2.46 uM ONC201 for SSA for 0, 24, or 48 hours. Co-culture experiments were performed with the adenoma-derived organoids (dyed using blue CMAC dye) and human NK-92MI cells (dyed with green CMFDA dye) treated with either 845 nM DMSO, 845 nM ONC201, or 1.69 uM ONC201 for FAP and 615 nM DMSO, 615 nM ONC201, or 1.23 uM ONC201 for SSA. Fluorescent images following administration of red live\/dead dye were performed using DAPI, FITC, and cherry red channels on ImageXpress&#174; at 0, 24, 48, and 72hours.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> ONC201 demonstrated antineoplastic effects in adenoma-derived FAP and SSA organoids. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ONC201 in FAP and SSA organoids were 1.69 uM and 1.23 uM, respectively. As was noted in rodent studies, the mechanism of action of ONC201 appears to be mediated through modulation of multiple pathways including the TRAIL pathway (TRAIL and DR5 were both upregulated) and the integrated stress response (ATF4 was upregulated). Co-culture with NK cells revealed an increase in NK-mediated organoid cell death. The ability of ONC201 to enhance NK-mediated killing is still being evaluated. Further analysis of the effects of ONC201 on stemness markers and on T-cell-mediated organoid cell killing are currently underway and may reveal other potential biomarkers and chemopreventive strategies for ONC201.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoprevention,Imipridone,Organoids,Adenoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, LDCT screening among those currently eligible based primarily on age and smoking criteria yields a large number of false-positive findings and many lung cancers occur among individuals who currently are ineligible. A biomarker that identifies lung cancer risk independent from that caused by age and cigarette smoking might increase specificity and increase the number of people eligible for LDCT screening. Recently we demonstrated that a biomarker measuring TP53 somatic mutations in bronchial brush biopsy specimens from grossly normal airway epithelium was significantly associated with cancer status independent of age and smoking status. Additionally, the TP53 biomarker was synergistic with traditional risk score models (e.g. PLCO<sub>M2012<\/sub> risk score). The goal of this pilot study was to test the TP53 biomarker in nasal brush biopsy specimens, a potential surrogate tissue obtained using less invasive collection methods. <b>Methods: <\/b>Nasal brushings from 10 lung cancer and 11 control subjects were collected at the University of Toledo and Vanderbilt University Medical Center under approved institutional protocols. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted with the Qiagen AllPrep DNA\/RNA kit using a modified protocol. Amplifiable copies of gDNA were measured using quantitative PCR. For each test a sample comprising 25,000 amplifiable copies of gDNA was combined with 50,000 copies of a TP53 internal standard and a complexity control, then PCR amplified, purified and barcoded. Samples were pooled to create two NGS libraries, each with approximately equal numbers of cases and controls, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (Two V3 flow cells, 2 x 250 paired-end). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using Qiagen CLC Workbench. Variants were called using the Basic Variant Detection Tool. Poisson Exact Test was utilized to determine the significance of endogenous variants relative to internal standard variants at the same base position and a Bonferroni correction was applied to minimize false discovery. Comparison of variant numbers between cases and controls was conducted using an f-test followed by a paired t-test. <b>Results and Conclusions: <\/b>Consistent with previous results in airway epithelium, in this pilot study the TP53 mutation biomarker measured in nasal brushing was associated with lung cancer (p=0.0085). Measurement of the TP53 biomarker in nasal brush specimens in a larger case-control study currently is underway along with a pilot study in gDNA from peripheral blood.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Biomarkers,Early detection,TP53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.
