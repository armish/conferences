[{"Abstract":"Background: Clinical diabetic traits have been reported to be associated with increased colorectal cancer risk (CRC) in observational studies. Using the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis method, we examined the causal association between glycemic traits, such as fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and survival in a cohort of CRC patients.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a two-sample MR analysis among a cohort of patients with locally advanced CRC at Seoul National University Hospital. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated (<i>P<\/i>&#60;5&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) with the three glycemic traits were obtained from the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium, Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network, and Korea Biobank Array. Three-year and five-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as outcomes. Survival analysis was conducted using subgroup analysis by cancer stage and subsite in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age and sex to examine whether glycemic traits affected survival.<br \/>Results: A total of 509 patients were included in our final analysis. MR analysis showed that HbA1c levels were associated with poor three-year OS (&#946;=4.20, <i>P<\/i>=0.02). Sensitivity analyses did not show evidence of any violations of the MR assumptions. In the cancer subgroup analysis of the Cox proportional hazards model, pooled hazard ratios for FG were significantly associated with poor three-year OS and PFS regardless of cancer stage. FI was not significantly associated with any three-year survival endpoints. Among stage III patients, three glycemic traits were significantly associated with both five-year OS and PFS. Location-specific subgroup analysis showed a significant association between three glycemic traits and five-year PFS in patients with left-sided colon cancer. FG was associated with poor three-year survival for colon cancer but not rectal cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest that FG and HbA1c could be used to predict prognosis in CRC patients. Lifestyle and\/or pharmacological interventions targeting glycemic traits could help improve survival for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Mendelian randomization,Type 2 Diabetes,Glycemic traits,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

We have previously shown in epidemiology studies that disruption of the circadian rhythm may be associated with increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer, including germline polymorphisms in certain circadian rhythm genes. This study sought to investigate the relationship between tumor circadian rhythm gene expression and lethal prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: We studied patients with primary prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and Physicians&#8217; Health Study (PHS). We created a composite score of mRNA expression using principal components that incorporated 11 circadian rhythm genes: <i>AANAT, ARNTL, CLOCK,<\/i> <i>CRY1, CSNK1E, MTNR1A, MTNR1B, NPAS2, PER1, PER2, PER3<\/i>. An age-stratified analysis was performed, and the mean differences of the score both by Gleason score and compared to normal tissue were calculated. The relationship between the score in prostate tumor tissue and lethal prostate cancer (metastases\/prostate cancer-specific death) vs. indolent disease (no metastases after &#62;8 years of follow-up) was assessed using logistic regression. The contribution of each gene was evaluated by leave-one-out analysis, generating scores leaving out one gene and assessing the relationship between the modified score and lethal disease.<br \/>Results: Among 404 cancer patients in HPFS\/ PHS, there were 119 lethal events over 30 years of follow-up (median: 17 years). The circadian rhythm gene score was lower in tumor tissue compared to tumor-adjacent, histologically normal tissue (mean difference in units of standard deviation [SD] of gene score: -0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.48 to -0.15). In addition, the score was lower in Gleason 9-10 compared to Gleason 6 tumors (mean difference in SD units: -1.05, 95% CI: -1.55 to -0.54). The three <i>PER<\/i> genes were the most strongly correlated with each other and with the score (Spearman correlation coefficients from 0.52-0.88 for the score and 0.31-0.63 between <i>PER<\/i> genes). Higher circadian rhythm gene scores were inversely associated with lethal prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] for highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.90) in a dose-response fashion and after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. The association appeared to be stronger in patients aged &#8805;65 years (OR for highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.47) compared to &#60;65 years at diagnosis (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.29, 2.17). Results were consistent in the leave-one-out analysis for all genes except <i>PER2<\/i> (OR for highest vs. lowest quartile: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.83) and <i>PER1<\/i> (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.30 to 1).<br \/>Conclusion: This study examining intratumoral circadian rhythm gene expression contributes further evidence in support of the relationship between circadian rhythm disruption and aggressive prostate cancer. Tumor expression of <i>PER1<\/i> and <i>PER2<\/i> may be a predominant factor in the association.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Circadian genes,Metastasis,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We estimated relative and absolute SPC risks following BC in BRCA1\/2 PV carriers using genetic testing laboratory data in England, linked for the first time to population-scale electronic health records data from the National Disease Registration Service and Hospital Episode Statistics.<br \/>Material and methods<br \/>The cohort contained 27,154 women diagnosed with primary BC and tested for germline BRCA1\/2 PVs between 1995-2019. Follow-up began at the latest of the genetic test dates and one year following the BC diagnosis and continued until the first SPC diagnosis, death, migration, relevant surgery, and the end of 2020, whichever came first. We estimated overall and site-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by comparing observed and expected SPC counts, with expected counts calculated using incidences for the general English population accounting for calendar year, SPC site, age, and gender. We stratified the SIRs by age, estrogen-receptor status, and cancer site. We further assessed associations using Cox regression adjusted for age at BC diagnosis and estrogen-receptor status of the first BC, and estimated 10-year absolute SPC risks with Kaplan-Meier analysis.<br \/>Results<br \/>There were 1909 BRCA1 (138 with SPCs) and 1926 BRCA2 (101 with SPCs) PV carriers, with mean follow-up lengths of 4.2 and 4.4y and median follow-up lengths of 3.4 and 3.6y. In BRCA1 PV carriers, there were elevated contralateral BC (SIR:15.3, 95%CI:11.5-19.8), ovarian (SIR:43.3, 95%CI:30.9-58.9), non-breast and non-ovarian combined (SIR:2.23, 95%CI:1.63-2.98), colorectal (SIR:4.72, 95%CI:2.58-7.92) and uterine (SIR:3.42, 95%CI:1.25-7.44) SPC risks. In BRCA2 PV carriers, there were increased contralateral BC (SIR:7.53, 95%CI:5.33-10.3), ovarian (SIR:16.5, 95%CI:10.1-25.5), non-breast and non-ovarian (SIR:1.72, 95%CI:1.27-2.27) and pancreatic (SIR:6.57, 95%CI:2.63-13.5) SPC risks. Consistently, when we compared BC survivors carrying a BRCA1 PV to BC survivors without a PV in either gene, they were at elevated contralateral BC (HR:3.94, 95%CI:2.91-5.33), ovarian (HR:35.7, 95%CI:21.3-60.0), non-breast and non-ovarian (HR:1.53, 95%CI:1.11-2.12) and colorectal (HR:2.95, 95%CI:1.56-5.55) SPC risks, whereas BRCA2 PV carriers were at increased contralateral BC (HR:2.59, 95%CI:1.83-3.65), ovarian (HR:12.3, 95%CI:6.93-21.9) and pancreatic (HR:5.32, 95%CI:2.30-12.3) SPC risks.

The objective of this study was to build off previously described signatures of adaptation in CEZ wolves, identify networks of genes associated with immune adaptation in CEZ wolves, and determine prognostic significance of these genes in human cancer datasets to provide insight into immune adaptation and cancer immunity.<br \/>RNA from blood samples of wolves in CEZ, Belarus (BLR), and Yellowstone (YLS) were sequenced previously. Here we analyzed these data by mapping wolf transcripts to human orthologs. Radiation exposure (in CEZ and BLR) was quantified by intramuscular Cesium-137. Differential gene expression (DESeq2), network co-expression analysis (lmQCM), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) assessed transcriptomic changes between populations. Germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for all three populations were inferred from RNA-seq data.<br \/>Genes differentially regulated between populations, including gene modules showing signatures of polygenic selection through increased rates of genetic divergence (p&#60; 0.05) in CEZ wolf populations, were deemed as outlier genes. Those n=3,180 CEZ outlier genes were then investigated in human cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine prognostic impact in 10 tumor types highly conserved between human and canines.<br \/>GSVA confirmed activation of neutrophil and macrophage signatures in CEZ wolves and suppression of several adaptive immune-related signatures (p &#60; 0.05 vs BLR and YLS). A signature including immune checkpoint targets was also significantly differentially expressed in CEZ wolves. In TCGA, Cox PH analysis identified 23 genes over-expressed in CEZ wolves with significant positive prognostic impact in &#8805; 2 human tumor types. PTPN6, previously identified to have positive prognostic value in bladder cancer<sup>1<\/sup>, was also prognostic in three additional tumor types. In human bladder cancer, genes identified as differentially regulated in CEZ wolves were disproportionately associated with improved survival.<br \/>As predicted, gene signature variations in CEZ wolves reveal a distinct immune profile, likely shaped by prolonged radiation exposure. These findings, along with evidence of polygenic selection, suggest adaptation to multigenerational radiation exposure (an oncogenic stress). Notably, the enrichment of genes with positive prognosis in human cancer overexpressed in CEZ wolves present a valuable model to explore genetic underpinnings of cancer immunity and advance our understanding of cancer resilience in humans.<br \/>Reference:<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup>Shen C. et al.

However, whether TRM exerts any immunosurveillance role in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of all lung cancers, remains unclear. Our comprehensive analysis of multiple independent single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets of patient NSCLC samples generated reliable, unique TRM signatures, through which we could infer the abundance of TRM in NSCLC. We discovered that TRM abundance is consistently positively correlated with CD4+ T helper 1 cells, M1 macrophages, and resting dendritic cells in TIME and significantly impacts the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In addition, TRM signatures are strongly associated with immune checkpoint genes and the prognosis of NSCLC patients, suggesting that TRM signatures are promising prognostic markers for immunotherapy in NSCLC. We then built a machine learning model to predict patient survival based on the TRM signatures and immune related genes. The accuracy of the model was validated by Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, principal component analysis, and t-distributed random neighbor embedding. We developed a 4-gene risk score that effectively stratified patients into low-risk and high-risk categories. The patients with high-risk scores had significantly lower overall survival than patients with low-risk. The prognostic value of the risk score was independently validated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) dataset and multiple independent NSCLC patient datasets. Notably, low-risk NSCLC patients with higher TRM infiltration exhibited enhanced T-cell activation, macrophage regulation, and other TIME immune responses related pathways, indicating a more active immune profile benefitting from immunotherapy. Altogether, this study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between NSCLC TRM and TIME and their impact on patient prognosis, highlighting the importance of TRM in shaping the NSCLC microenvironment. The development of a simplified 4-gene risk score provides a practical prognostic marker for risk stratification.<br \/><b>Keywords:<\/b> Tissue resident memory T cell, non-small-cell lung cancer, prognosis, tumor immune microenvironment, machine learning","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Tissue resident memory T cell,Prognosis,Tumor immune microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Circulating inflammatory cytokines have been associated with an increased risk of CRC, but no studies have examined the impact of BMI on immune gene expression in preinvasive lesions. Our analysis combines data from 3 retrospective epidemiologic studies among patients with colorectal adenomas or serrated polyps. Using a cross-sectional design, we investigate whether BMI categories (obese (OB), overweight (OW), normal (NL)) are associated with T-helper gene pathways.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: For each patient, we include demographic, clinical, and specimen (archival FFPE for RNA isolation) data. Immune gene expression data was determined using the NanoString nCounter platform on a subset of cases (n=100) balanced by study site and lesion type from our cohort (n=630). Genes were normalized using a modified RUVseq methodology. We examined 4 pathways (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg) defined by gene lists included in the NS immune v2. panel. Differences in pathway expression by BMI categories were analyzed using our distance-based methods (Wd* multivariate analysis of variance and TW2 pairwise method) adjusted for age &#38; sex. Using linear regression analysis, we generated coefficients (p-values) for OW and OB vs NL for genes within each pathway.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 86 samples passed QC. Th2 and Th1 pathways were significant for OW vs NL (p&#60;0.05) whereas Th17 was marginally significant (&#60;0.1). Several genes within the Th1, Th2, and Th17 pathways were enriched in OW vs. NL: e.g., <i>IL2<\/i> (coeff. 0.77 (p=0.008), <i>IL5<\/i> (coeff. 1.02, p=0.001), <i>IL17F<\/i> (coeff. 0.57, p=0.05), respectively. (Table)<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Enrichment of genes specific to the Th pathways in OW persons suggest that metabolic immune modulation may be important in early colorectal carcinogenesis.<table

Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) present a challenge for cancer risk assessment and functional data will be essential to resolve many VUS. To address this, we developed a cloud-based environment to collate, curate, integrate and analyze all published functional data related to <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> missense VUS. Then, functional evidence criteria for pathogenicity were determined for each assay using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG\/AMP) classification guidelines and ClinGen criteria. Our approach involved retrieving published articles reporting one or more functional assays of <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>missense variants reporting variant impact on various biochemical and cell biological functions. Functional results were recorded using original authors' thresholds and categories, then converted to ordinal variables to harmonize: [0 = no functional impact], [1 = intermediate impact], and [2 = functional impact]. For <i>BRCA1<\/i>, we updated our previous published integration (Genet Med. 2021;23:306-315) with 14 additional publications, collating results from 53 instances of functional assays reporting functional data on 3,219 unique missense variants. For <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 28 publications were identified reporting data from 141 instances of functional assays on 4,759 unique missense variants. Utilizing a panel of 542 and 396 known pathogenic and benign reference variants for <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>, respectively, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and ACMG\/AMP odds of pathogenicity for each instance of the assay. The remaining variants were assigned a relevant functional assay code weight for each assay instance. Our study successfully derived ACMG\/AMP evidence strength from functional data for 3,040 <i>BRCA1<\/i> (94% of 3,219) and 2,704 <i>BRCA2 <\/i>(57% of 4,759) missense variants.

A recent cross-ancestry lung cancer GWAS identified a common germline variant, rs12203592 (C\/T), in chr6p25.3 as a new signal, and quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization analysis using lung and blood tissues (GTEx v8) identified <i>IRF4<\/i> as a likely target of rs12203592. rs12203592 has previously been linked with diverse traits, including pigmentation phenotypes, smoking cessation, lymphoblastic leukemia, melanoma, and other skin cancers. rs12203592 also appears to have varied allelic effects in different cell types. Namely, the lung cancer risk-associated T allele is correlated with higher <i>IRF4 <\/i>expression in lung tissue and blood cells (GTEx v8) but lower expression in primary melanocytes (n = 106; Zhang et al). Since previous studies established the melanocyte-specific allelic function of this SNP through lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs), we hypothesized that cell-type-specific TFs mediate the observed allelic effect in different tissue\/cell types and further contribute to the unique role of IRF4 in lung tumorigenesis. To identify these potential cell-type-specific regulators, we performed mass spectrometry using the nuclear extracts from three cell lines representing lung, blood, and melanocyte lineage. The results nominated the NF-kB and ZEB protein families as the most prominent T-specific binders in the A549 lung cancer cell line, which was validated by electromobility shift assays. Consistent with these findings, tissue-based SNP-gene interaction analysis demonstrated that the mRNA levels of NF-kB and ZEB family members (4 of 7 genes) were correlated with <i>IRF4<\/i> expression with a significant interaction with rs12203592 in GTEx lung tissue (P &#60; 0.017), where the correlation is mainly observed with the T allele. Notably, the SNP interaction was less pronounced in whole blood or melanocytes, and the correlation of these TFs and <i>IRF4<\/i> expression was mainly observed with the C allele in melanocytes. To begin to establish the roles of these TFs and IRF4 in lung tumorigenesis and given that <i>IRF4<\/i> was shown to promote endogenous DNA damage and proliferation of lung-lineage cell lines, we will investigate the roles of NF-kB and ZEB in <i>IRF4<\/i> regulation in these contexts using knockdown and overexpression of these TFs. To further investigate lung cancer-specific IRF4 function, we will identify potential targets of IRF4 among lung cancer-associated functional variants established through our previous studies. This data will help elucidate the context-specific roles of <i>IRF4<\/i> in lung cancer development and provide clues to gene regulation in a pleiotropic GWAS locus.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Transcriptional regulation,Cancer risk,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in MMR genes hinder diagnoses and clinical management. Multiplex assays of variant effects (MAVEs) are high-throughput cellular assays designed to provide functional data on variant activity. Successful MAVE experiments accurately define the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants and small insertions-deletions which can then be applied to clinical variant classification (VC). Here we report internally generated MAVE datasets for three MMR genes (MSH2, MLH1 and PMS2) and estimate their impact on patients.<br \/>Three separate pools of targeted variants were generated for three MMR genes. Pooled variants were introduced into cell populations such that each cell contained one variant copy of an MMR gene. Single-cell RNA expression profiles were generated for the cells which were then normalized and filtered. Supervised machine learning was used to find patterns in gene expression that were different between cells harboring established pathogenic (P) and benign (B) variants and to assess the accuracy of variant predictions. VC impact was estimated for all datasets by simulating VCs with the added MAVE evidence compared to the original VCs. Variants with an original VC that was different after MAVE evidence were counted as impacted.<br \/>Overall results are shown in Table 1, including the number of variants successfully targeted, the number of known P and B variants used for training and testing, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the distribution of calibrated predictions, and the estimated patient impact for each model.<br \/>The MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2 MAVE models provide a high-quality source of functional evidence for VC with the potential to impact many patients in the future.<br \/>Table 1.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{9257E139-6469-45E6-9A02-D4EBDA14D993}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gene<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSH2 model<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MLH1 model<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PMS2 model<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Variants successfully targeted (n)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">223<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">212<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">214<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Known pathogenic (P) and benign (B) variants used to train the model<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29 P<br \/>72 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31 P<br \/>55 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 P<br \/>71 B<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Known pathogenic (P) and benign (B) variants used to test the model<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 P<br \/>32 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 P<br \/>22 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 P<br \/>31 B<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUROC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.9996<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.9642<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.9918<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of variants strongly predicted P (PPV &#8805; 95%) or B (NPV&#8805; 95%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">44 P<br \/>177 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">52 P<br \/>160 B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26 P<br \/>183 B<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"># of variants with uncertain prediction<br \/>(PPV &#60; 80%, NPV &#60; 80%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Estimated # of impacted variants<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 LP&#62;P<br \/>3 VUS&#62;LP<br \/>26 VUS&#62;LB<br \/>31 LB&#62;B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 LP&#62;P<br \/>5 VUS&#62;LP<br \/>17 VUS&#62;LB<br \/>7 LB&#62;B<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 LP&#62;P<br \/>1 VUS&#62;LP<br \/>17 VUS&#62;LB<br \/>6 LB&#62;B<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Gene profiling,Lynch syndrome,Hereditary cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Findings for proteins with support from both MR, after correction for multiple-testing, and colocalization were replicated using two independent cancer GWAS, one of European and one of African ancestry. Proteins with evidence of prostate-specific tissue expression were additionally investigated using spatial transcriptomic data in prostate tumor tissue to assess their role in tumor aggressiveness. Finally, we mapped risk proteins to drug and ongoing clinical trials targets.<br \/>Results: We identified 20 proteins genetically linked to prostate cancer risk (14 for overall [8 specific], 7 for aggressive [3 specific], and 8 for early onset disease [2 specific]), of which a majority were novel and replicated. Among these were proteins associated with aggressive disease, such as PPA2 [Odds Ratio (OR) per 1 SD increment = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.54-2.93], PYY [OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.43-2.44] and PRSS3 [OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.89], and those associated with early onset disease, including EHPB1 [OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.99-4.21], POGLUT3 [OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.86] and TPM3 [OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64]. We confirm an inverse association of MSMB with prostate cancer overall [OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.82], and also find an inverse association with both aggressive [OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.82-0.86] and early onset disease [OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.68-0.74]. Using spatial transcriptomics data, we identified MSMB as the genome-wide top-most predictive gene to distinguish benign regions from high grade cancer regions that had five-fold lower MSMB expression. Additionally, ten proteins that were associated with prostate cancer risk mapped to existing therapeutic interventions.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the importance of proteomics for improving our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and of opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we demonstrate the added benefit of in-depth functional analyses to triangulate the role of risk proteins in the clinical aggressiveness of prostate tumors.

Whilst smoking is the main determinant, genetic factors also play a crucial role as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified &#62;50 loci associated with lung cancer risk. Yet, for most of these loci, it is still unknown how they contribute to lung cancer risk. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have been powerful in linking GWAS variants to potential target genes, providing genetic mechanisms underlying common diseases such as cancers. However, the current eQTL resources lack ancestral diversity and are primarily based on bulk tissues. Emerging single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL) approaches can detect context-specific gene regulation but are mainly of blood samples or cultured cells and still representing European populations. This limits our abilities to test GWAS variants in cancer-relevant cell types as well as in diverse populations. To generate a resource to characterize lung cancer GWAS loci, we are building a lung sc-eQTL dataset of Asian population while addressing common challenges of tissue sc-eQTL. Namely, processing fresh tissue in a population scale is logistically challenging and costly, and epithelial cells (including cell types of lung cancer origin) are vulnerable to the dissociation and freezing\/thawing process. To address these issues, we incorporated sample multiplexing and cell type balancing. We collected fresh tumor-distant normal lung tissues from 131 never-smoking Korean women and dissociated them before cryopreservation. We then performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using 10x Chromium Single Cell 3&#8217; v3.1 chemistry with multiplexing of ~6 samples\/batch. To enrich for epithelial cells, we utilized flow cytometry with surface markers of four major lung cell types (epithelial: EpCAM+\/CD45-, immune: EpCAM-\/CD45+, endothelial and stromal: EpCAM-\/CD45-) before 10X library preparation. Concurrently, we performed DNA genotyping and imputation using matched blood samples. Following scRNA-seq (~36,000 reads\/cell) we performed a genotype-based sample demultiplexing using Demuxlet. By integrating Demuxlet and Scrublet, we identified ~89% of the detected cells as singlets. After applying QC to filter empty droplets and low-quality cells, we obtained 428,619 cells or 3,272 cells\/patient. Cell annotation guided by Azimuth label transfer using the Human Lung Cell Atlas, identified 28 cell types including 7 of epithelial origins. We will further perform eQTL analyses for individual cell types using pseudo-bulk and LIMIX (linear mixed model) or SAIGE-qtl (poisson regression) methods followed by aggregation across the cell types. By incorporating lung cancer GWAS data, we will identify cell-type specific susceptibility genes. Our dataset will provide a unique resource for lung cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression analysis,Single cell eQTL,Cell-type specific susceptibility genes,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

However, HCPs face challenges due to a lack of specialized training and confidence, particularly in communicating genetic risks to patients. Hence, it becomes paramount to identify the essential skills and expertise required by HCPs for genetic counseling. Additionally, gaining insight into their perspectives regarding the content of genetic counseling that should be provided to patients is of utmost importance.<br \/>Methods: An integrated mixed-methods systematic review and content analysis were performed across five databases on 23 May 2023, employing predetermined search strategies. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and data analysis was conducted using a deductive content analysis approach with MAXQDA 2020.<br \/>Results: The review encompassed 14 studies from seven countries, revealing moderate risk of bias. It was perceived by HCPs that hereditary cancer families require information in seven specific categories including, cancer risk-reducing strategies; personalized cancer risk; family implications of hereditary cancer; psychological issues; genetic testing; the role of pathogenic genes in hereditary cancers; and social issues related to genetic testing. The study also highlighted the educational needs of HCPs, pinpointing areas such as method for supporting decision-making; clinical management in hereditary cancer families; resources for supporting hereditary cancer families; guidance to support familial communication; genetic testing; the role of each profession; and methods for supporting psychological aspects.<br \/>Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for specialized training programs to equip HCPs with the necessary skills and knowledge for effective genetic counseling. Additionally, understanding HCPs&#8217; perspectives on the content of genetic counseling is vital for tailoring educational resources and enhancing the genetic counseling process in managing cancer risks.<br \/>Grants: This research was supported by a grant of the Korean Cancer Survivors Healthcare R&#38;D Project through the National Cancer Center, funded by the Ministry of Health &#38; Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: NCC 23F1940-1)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hereditary cancer,Healthcare professional,Genetic counseling,Educational needs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

We aim to characterize the evolving utilization of GT and GC services for potential hereditary breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers (HBOPP).<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed a retrospective single-institution chart review of a balanced racial subset of HBOPP patients who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria diagnosed from 2019-2013. Data were analyzed using chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>503 HBOPP patients were studied. GT was discussed with 50.5% (n=254) of patients, 42.3% (n=213) completed GT, but only 8.7% had GC (n=44) (Table 1). Patients who were younger, had managed care, or had a family history of cancer were significantly more likely to have a GT discussion and complete GT (all p&#60;0.01). Pancreatic cancer (RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.05-0.21) and prostate cancer patients (RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.02-0.10) were less likely to have a GT discussion with their provider than breast cancer patients. HBOPP patients had a lower likelihood of having a GT discussion with each additional year of age at diagnosis (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.93-0.98). Among patients who had a GT discussion, prostate cancer patients (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.04-0.47) and Black patients (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.71) were less likely to complete GT. Ovarian cancer patients (RR 12.1; 95% CI 5.19-28.5) and patients with a family history of cancer (RR 2.26; 95% CI 1.05-4.86) were more likely to have GC.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Inequities persist in GT and GC. NCCN-eligible patients who were older or had prostate or pancreatic cancer were less likely to have GT discussion. We found that Black patients were less likely than White patients to complete GT. GC rates were low across all groups except patients with ovarian cancer.

Unlike CM which is driven by somatic mutations due to UV exposure, risk factors for MM are less defined. While germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes are well-studied in CM, they are less understood in MM. Herein, we aimed to identify the prevalence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes in a large MM cohort.<br \/>Methods: A cohort of 247 MM patients (pts) from MD Anderson Cancer Center with available blood for germline sequencing was identified. Pt characteristics were reflective of U.S. MM population with median age of 63, 60% females and 84.6% white. Clinicodemographic features of pts including tumor site, key somatic mutations (BRAF, NRAS, KIT) and personal history of other malignancies were abstracted, and their frequencies were compared in pts with and w\/o germline mutation. Frequency of <i>MITF<\/i> and <i>CHEK2<\/i> alleles were compared to expected population control rate based on TOPMED by Fisher&#8217;s exact test.<br \/>Results: Among 247 pts, 10.9% had germline mutations, primarily in <i>MITF <\/i>(c.G952A:p.E318K) (2.4%) and <i>CHEK2<\/i> (c.1100delC:p.T367fs) (1.6%) at OR of 13.9 (95%CI 5.0, 30.9) and 16.4 (4.4, 42.9) compared to population control rate (Table 1). MM sites of origin were gastrointestinal (36%), genitourinary (34%) and head &#38; neck (30%). In terms of somatic mutations, <i>KIT<\/i> (26%) was most common, followed by <i>NRAS<\/i> (15%), non-V600E BRAF (6.5%) and BRAF V600E (2.4%). These variables did not differ between those with and w\/o germline mutation. Pts with germline mutation had a higher incidence of non-melanoma malignancies (48% vs 29%; p=0.044).<br \/>Conclusions: This study reports a high prevalence of germline cancer susceptibility mutations in the largest cohort of MM to date, including mutations which are actionable. There is overlap with known <i>MITF<\/i> risk alleles for CM. We are currently performing a GWAS to comprehensively understand the genetic architecture of risk in MM.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C5F2CBE5-2973-41FE-B866-192376FB9AC9}\"><caption>Table 1.

Recent evidence has shown that germline mutations may also impact the development of SCLC, however, remains understudied. We sought to identify novel germline mutations in SCLC including unexplored copy-number variations (CNVs) in our cohort of patients.<br \/>Methods: We applied a custom hybrid-capture gene panel of 191 cancer predisposition and commonly mutated genes in SCLC to a pre-treatment cohort of 67 patients with SCLC. Variant calls were performed using VarScan2 (2.3.8), Pindel (0.2.5b8) and CNVs were assessed using DeCON 1.0.2. Calls were annotated using the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria and classified using gnomeAD (release 2.11), ESP6500 (ESP6500SI-V2), 1000Genomes, ExAC (release 0.3), COSMIC (v70), dbSNP (build 147), and ClinVar (NCBI ClinVar 20190305). We annotated variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with several in<br \/>silico tools including MutationTaster, LRT, Polyphen2 HDIV, Polyphen2 HVAR, SIFT, PROVEAN, and Deepmind AlphaMissense. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were done to examine differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) from the date of diagnosis. Continuous variables were tested using Kruskal-Wallis H test and categorical variables using Fisher&#8217;s exact test.<br \/>Results: The median age of our cohort was 68 years old, 64% (43\/67) were male, 89% (60\/67) were current\/former smokers, and 58% (39\/67) were Extensive-Stage. 64.6% (42\/67) of patients self-reported a family history of cancer and 16% of the patients also self-reported personal history of cancer. In terms of self-reported ancestral background, 76% of were Caucasian, 1.5% were Middle-Eastern, 3% were Latin American, 14% were Asian, and 4.5% were Black. We identified pathogenic\/likely pathogenic alterations in 7\/67 patients. Five (71%) were novel alterations (<i>BCORL1, FANCC, ATR<\/i>, and <i>BBC3<\/i>) and a novel CNV (<i>SLFN11<\/i>) with the remaining two (29%) previously described mutations (<i>CHEK1<\/i> and <i>BRIP1<\/i>). We identified 191 VUS in 60\/67 patients. 4.7-14.1% of VUS were in silico predicted to be pathogenic. Patients with the 7 pathogenic alterations had a numerically larger OS (HR = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.18-1.39, p = 0.18) and PFS (HR = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.16 - 1.24, p = 0.11) compared to the rest of the cohort. We identified 20 variants at low variant allele fractions (0.05 to 0.24), likely somatic mutations. Some genes identified are implicated with clonal hematopoiesis such as <i>GNAS, STAG, TET2<\/i>, and <i>MGA<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, we have identified several novel germline alterations (mutations and CNVs) in patients with SCLC. In addition, we utilized in silico prediction models to categorize potential high-risk VUS. Our findings suggest that beyond tobacco exposure germline alterations may also modulate development of tumorigenesis in SCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hereditary cancer,small cell lung cancer,germline,gene panel,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, some cases who were suspected hereditary cancer represented having variant of uncertain significance (VUS) or no variants even though they had family members with many cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate variants function especially in splicing variants and to explore other candidate genes by whole genome sequencing (WGS) in suspected hereditary cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Total of 44 patients who clinically suspected hereditary cancer without defined pathogenic variants after NGS panel test were enrolled. Among them 11 patients had intronic variants and their variant effects were predicted by SpliceAI, a deep learning-based tool. To define alternative splicing, total RNA was extracted from patients buffy coats and cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT. Then the cDNA was amplified by specific primers and performed sequencing. Also, WGS was performed in 15 patients then comprehensive analysis encompassing 392 unique genes was performed including 282 well-established hereditary cancer predisposition genes and 228 DNA repair-related genes. We confirmed the variant by various type of studies and predicted impact on protein by analysis.<br \/>Results: We analyzed intronic variants of 11 patients; ATM c.4611+3A&#62;T(n=1). BRCA1 c.547+30A&#62;G (n=2), BRCA1 c.5152+6T&#62;C(n=1), MSH2 c.2635-7G&#62;A(n=1), MUTYH c.934-2A&#62;G(n=2), NF1 c.1527+4A&#62;C(n=1), NF1 c.3871-14G&#62;T(n=1), PALB2 c.3350+5G&#62;A(n=1), and SMARCA4 c.3546+1G&#62;A(n=1). Though two intronic variants (ATM c.4611+3A&#62;T and SMARCA4:c.3546+1G&#62;A) were observed a likelihood of aberrant splicing aggregate SpliceAI score more than 0.8, we observed three intronic variants induce alternative splicing (ATM c.4611+3A&#62;T, NF1 c.1527+4A&#62;C, and PALB2 c.3350+5G&#62;A).In addition, WGS analysis demonstrated 6 out of 15 patients have germline variants in relevant genes. Four single nucleotide variants (SMARCAL1:c.1632delA, SETMAR:c.441dup, FAN1:c.590C&#62;A, and PRF1:c.445G&#62;A) were validated by sequencing and those were likely pathogenic variant (LPV) by ACMG\/AMP criteria of ClinGen. Copy number variations were identified in 2 patients (PMS2 heterozygous deletion and RAD50 duplication) and structure variant of MSH2 was identified in one patient.<br \/>Conclusion: Our analysis showed in silico analysis results might be different from functional analysis and rare variants in cancer predisposition genes could be confirmed WGS. However, large number of patients study would be needed to confirm necessity of WGS for hereditary cancer.

However, the prevalence of <i>PALB2<\/i> germline variants in Korean patients has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of <i>PALB2<\/i> germline variants and the risk factors in Korean population. Methods: We analyzed the data of 3755 patients who performed hereditary cancer germline next generation sequencing (NGS) panels, including <i>PALB2<\/i>, at the National Cancer Center in Korea between 2008 and 2022. Genetic variants were classified using a five-tier system following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines as follows: pathogenic (PV), likely pathogenic (LPV), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign. We retrospectively reviewed 102 individuals who were confirmed to have the <i>PALB2<\/i> germline variant with PV, LPV and VUS. Also, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with <i>PALB2<\/i> heterozygous PV or LPV.<br \/>Results: A total of 102 patients (2.7%, 102\/3755) represented <i>PALB2<\/i> germline variants with 81 (79.4%) VUS, 14 (13.7%) LPV, and 7 (6.9%) PV. Detected twelve germline <i>PALB2<\/i> LPV or PV were as followings; c.3350+5G&#62;A (n=6), c.454A&#62;T (n=3), c.1048C&#62;T (n=2), c.2016dup (n=2), c.1424C&#62;G (n=1), c.1976_1977del (n=1), c.2095dup (n=1), c.2834+2T&#62;C (n=1), c.2920_2921delAA (n=1), c.3317delT (n=1), c.902delA (n=1), and exon 11 deletion (n=1). 35 <i>PALB2<\/i> VUS were detected in 81 patients. Among 21 female patients with LPV or PV (median diagnosis age 50 years; 25-69), 18 carriers (85.7%) and 3 carriers (14.3%) were diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively. For 18 breast cancer patients, 3 patients had bilateral breast cancer and 3 patients had multi-organ cancers (ovary, thyroid, or colorectal and gastric cancer).Also, 15 carriers (71.4%) have first-degree relatives with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, gastric, liver, thyroid, and colorectal cancer and 10 carriers (47.6%) have second-degree relatives with breast, pancreatic, lung, gastric, liver, prostate, lymphoma, laryngeal, and uterine cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: In our study,<i> PALB2<\/i> germline PV or LPV were detected at a low frequency of 0.56% in Korean cancer patients. Family history was an important risk factor for suspected germline pathogenic variants, and bilateral breast cancer was observed in 16.7% of breast cancer patients who harbored <i>PALB2<\/i> PV or LPV.

Eligibility is limited to patients 18 years or older with a confirmed first stage 0-4 breast cancer diagnosis within the last year. Consent is completed via phone, patient portal, or in-person. Upon enrollment, a baseline questionnaire and blood collection are completed. Annual follow-up surveys that capture BC outcomes are sent to all living participants. The MCBDR cohort (N=9,215, enrolled between 2001 and 2023) is 99% female, with an average age at diagnosis of 58 years (SD=12.7). Currently, MCBDR has an average time since diagnosis of 9.8 years (SD=6.4). The participants are 94% white, and 55% live in Minnesota. At the time of baseline questionnaire completion, 77% were married, 84% had a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher, and 8% reported financial hardship. Further, 35% reported a history of smoking, 11% consumed more than two drinks per day, and 9% reported fair or poor social relationships. Within MCBDR, 53% of the participants had stage 0 or 1 cancer at diagnosis, while 28% had stage 2, 9% stage 3, and 3% stage 4 BC. Tumors were triple negative in 9%, HER 2 positive in 9%, hormone receptor-positive and HER2 low or negative in 55%, and 27% had missing HER2 status. Pathological TNM staging was available on 98%, among which 33% were staged at T2 or higher and 27% were node-positive. Definitive BC surgery was completed at Mayo Clinic for 73%, with 35% undergoing mastectomies and 44% having lumpectomies. 74% were treated with radiation, 56% underwent chemotherapy, and 79% were treated with endocrine therapy.<br \/>Clinical genetic testing results have been nurse-abstracted for 94% of the cohort. Of those known to be tested, 521 (6%) had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation identified in a BC causing gene. In addition, whole exome sequencing was completed on 71% of MCBDR participants in 2020, in which 167 previously unknown pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified.<br \/>After the initial diagnosis and active treatment phase, nurse abstraction identified 151 (2%) participants known to have been diagnosed with a contralateral BC diagnosis, and 4% known to have been diagnosed with a second primary other than breast. Recurrence in the same breast has been reported for 242 (3%), with 72% of those recurrences occurring within 5 years of initial diagnosis and another 19% occurring 5-10 years post diagnosis. Among the 1,262 (14%) who are deceased, 24% died from BC and 19% had distant metastases at diagnosis or a distant recurrence. Amongst all deceased, 6% died within 1 year of their diagnosis and 43% died within 5 years of diagnosis. For participants who died from BC, 10% died within 1 year of their diagnosis and 64% died within 5 years of diagnosis. MCBDR data has been used in numerous publications and is an essential resource for efficient observational research analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survivorship,Longitudinal Cohort,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

African Americans (AAs) with HNSCC demonstrate worse overall survival compared to European Americans (EAs). While the reasons behind this disparity are multifaceted, recent findings suggest that biological features in HNSCC may contribute to differences in disease progression. However, race-related biological factors in HNSCC have been relatively little explored. We have identified the gene UBASH3B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a role in the stabilization of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). High expression of UBASH3B in AAs is associated with significantly worse overall survival compared to high expression in EAs and low expression in AAs. This study seeks to examine the role of UBASH3B in HNSCC and determine its impact on tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that the upregulation of UBASH3B in AAs contributes to the survival disparity by promoting tumor progression through EGFR signaling. Preliminary data using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) shows overexpression of UBASH3B in tumor samples of both AAs and EAs HNSCC samples. Plus, the overexpression of UBASH3B is associated with perineural invasion. Additionally, among AA-HNSCC patients, advanced T-stage is associated with increased UBASH3B expression. Elucidating the role UBASH3B plays in tumorigenesis will give us a further understanding of HNSCC in African Americans and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for new treatment options, as well as the biomarkers for the detection of the high-risk group.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Survival,African American,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
