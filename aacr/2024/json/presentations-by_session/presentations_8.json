Advances in molecular analysis have recently identified the presence of intratumoral microbiota in several solid cancer types. However, the specific ways these microorganisms interact with human cells within the TME and contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Our recent research provides new insights into how bacterial components of the intratumoral microbiota contribute to tumor heterogeneity, particularly in head and neck and colorectal cancers. To investigate these interactions, we have adapted and applied emerging technologies in spatial transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and single-cell sequencing (INVADEseq). Our spatial analyses show that the intratumoral microbiota are not distributed randomly within human tumors; instead, they localize to distinct microniches that promote immune and epithelial cell functions supportive of cancer progression. These bacterial-colonized microniches are characterized by myeloid cell infiltration, upregulation of MAPKs and immune checkpoint proteins, and reduced T-cell levels. Furthermore, INVADEseq single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled us to identify the dominant host cell-associated bacteria, the human cell types they infect, and their impact on the transcriptional programs of infected cells from patient tumor specimens. In oral squamous cell carcinoma, <i>Fusobacterium<\/i> and <i>Treponema<\/i> species have been identified as the dominant cell-associated bacterial taxa, primarily infecting subsets of macrophages and aneuploid cancer epithelial cells and upregulating pathways associated with cancer progression. Our findings offer insights into the complex interplay between intratumoral microbiota and human components of the TME, emphasizing their role in supporting intratumoral heterogeneity and influencing cancer progression. Understanding these dynamics holds significant promise for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting bacterial-human spatial and cellular interactions within the TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Oral cancers,Colorectal cancer,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susan Bullman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This involves the accumulation of mutations in cells that undergo premalignant clonal expansion. Despite this accumulation, we (and others) have found discordance between mutations and histological phenotypes in cancer cells (Erickson et al., Nature 2022). The current belief is that this discordance may depend on molecular interactions between cancer cells and other cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the immune and other tumor-associated cells. If so, characterizing those TME interactions is crucial for understanding the mechanisms driving malignant transformation. Tools in spatial biology offer a wide range of technologies that quantify different types of biomolecules in tumor and adjacent TME. These technologies provide information about distinct aspects of tissue anatomy, such as its morphology, genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. An overall ambition in multimodality analysis is to reduce biases from data aggregation from multiple tissue sections. Here, several multiomics computational and experimental methodologies approaches that capture the cancer ecosystem from a single tissue section will be described. We have performed unbiased whole organ spatial analysis of prostates, allowing us to generate phylogenetic and spatial descriptions of the multiclonal disease. By comparing with lymph node metastasis, we can now study the MTE of the seeding\/spreading clone. We have also devised strategies to spatially map B-cells and T-cells (BCR and TCR repertoire) in the MTE showing spatial niches harboring unique BCR sequences. In addition, a deep dive into the most recent high-resolution Visium HD data is covered, allowing the detailed exploration of data-driven patterns in cancer and MTE including tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in breast cancer. Deep learning offers exciting possibilities to expand the spatial toolbox leveraging the increasing amount of available high-resolution spatial gene expression data. Here, recent improvements that make 3D models of the tumor ecosystem conceivable will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Transcription,Imaging,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joakim Lundeberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
