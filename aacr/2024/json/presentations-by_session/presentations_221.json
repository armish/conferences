[{"Abstract":"PD-L1 programmed death ligand 1\/CD274 has been shown to be an excellent immune therapy target for many tumors. Currently, studies have shown PD-L1in combination with other immune therapy targets can improve patient outcomes generating the need for new targets. One candidate is the cancer testis antigen Melanoma Antigen Gene Family (MAGE-A) because these genes have limited expression in normal tissues and high expression in cancer. Clinical trials have already begun targeting MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 proteins in multiple tumor types. Protein assessment of individual MAGE-A family members has been challenging due to sequence homology as high as ninety-five percent between members. Previously, with the use of CytoSections two highly specific antibodies for immunohistochemistry to MAGE-A3 (clone OTI1H1) and MAGE-A4 (clone OTI2C1) were found. In this study, the MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 antibodies were screened with PD-L1 on colon, lung, and bladder cancers. Results show detection of both MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 in 25% of colon; 30% of lung; and 20% of bladder cancers. More than 70% of the lung and bladder cancers were positive for MAGE-A4 but only six of twenty-four colon cancers were positive for MAGE-A4. The results show 60 percent of the positive for MAGEA3 or MAGEA4 in colon, lung, and bladder cancers were also positive for PD-L1. This study suggests that MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 have tumor specific expression patterns and a potential to be a co-immunotherapy target with PD-L1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Bladder cancer,MAGE-A3 MAGE-A4,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

It is necessary to establish biomarkers that can predict the malignant potential for each patient and the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in order to select the optimal treatment for each individual case.This study was designed as a companion study to the phase III comparative study (JASPAC 01 of gemcitabine (GEM) and S-1 therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy after pancreatectomy. Among the 22 candidate biomarker genes that have been reported to be involved in pancreatic cancer treatment prognosis, we focused on E2F transcription factor 7 (E2F7), which is associated with a significantly poor overall survival rate when highly expressed. E2F7 is one of the target proteins of p53 and has been reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation. We examined the possibility of E2F7 expression in pancreatic cancer surgery and the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/>Patients and Methods: After optimizing the E2F7 imunostaining protocol, we scored E2F7 protein expression using the slides from excised tissues from JASPAC 01 registered cases. We investigated the relationship between malignancy and treatment efficacy using the case cohort treatment allocation information, clinicopathological information, and prognosis data.<br \/>Results: Immunostaining was performed on approximately 330 resected pancreatic cancer specimens from 24 facilities nationwide. Of the 311 patients for whom E2F7 protein expression could be scored, 202 patients who completed the assigned treatment were included in the analysis. In 88 cases with high E2F7 expression, no significant difference in clinicopathological factors was observed between the S-1 treatment group and the GEM treatment group, but the S-1 treatment group showed better recurrence-free survival (RFS, <i>P=<\/i>0.066) and overall survival (OS, <i>P=<\/i>0.015) were observed. On the other hand, in the 114 patients with low E2F7 expression, there was no significant difference in clinicopathological factors between the two groups (RFS, <i>P<\/i>=0.168, OS: <i>P<\/i>=0.276). High E2F7 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues may affect S-1 sensitivity, GEM resistance, or both.<br \/>Conclusions: It is considered that high expression E2F7 in pancreatic cancer may affect the therapeutic efficacy of GEM and S-1, which are frequently used in adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Adjuvant,Gemcitabine,E2F,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

We aimed to elucidate further understanding of important signaling pathways implicated in BCG response using gene expression data. The goal is to identify a gene signature for predicting BCG response and survival post-BCG therapy.<br \/>Methods: Gene expression data for the BCG treated NMIBC cohort was downloaded from TCGA. Individual gene expression data analyzed with univariate cox proportional hazard models versus overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) independently. The survival outputs were then fed into String DB network analysis. Overlapping genes in the 2 networks were combined into a Z- sum composite score for survival prediction. Correlation analysis was performed for the overlapping genes.<br \/>Results: Based on the selection criteria, 35 patients were available for the study. In OS analysis a total of 622 genes were filtered based on HR&#62;2 or &#60;0.5 with adjusted-p &#60;0.05. Network analysis of those significant genes demonstrated significant calcium ion transmembrane transport upregulation in patients with better OS, showing a subnetwork of 16 genes. In the PFS analysis, 500 genes with HR&#62;2 or &#60;0.5 with adjusted-p&#60;0.05 were subjected to network analysis. The main cluster was enriched in cation transmembrane transport upregulated in patients with better PFS, and consisted of a subnetwork of 39 genes. There were 295 shared genes between the genes associated with improved OS and PFS gene sets. A composite score constructed from these 295 genes revealed an optimized cutoff of the lower 70th percentile of expression versus the upper 30th percentile of normalized summed gene expression (HR = 0.192, p = 0.00048 for OS; and HR = 0.171, p &#60; 0.0001 for PFS). Internal correlation reveals 3 sub-clusters of gene expression within our data set.<br \/>Conclusion: Similar to <i>in vitro <\/i>studies we report increased cation transport expression <i>in vivo<\/i>, that was significantly associated with improved OS after BCG immunotherapy. Our composite gene signature score was able to identify a poor survival subgroup&#8212;about 1\/3 of patients&#8212;with 5-fold worse PFS and OS following BCG therapy. Increasing calcium signaling may potentiate BCG response in currently poor BCG-responders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression analysis,Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Given the coupling of host nutritional status and gut microbiota composition, we investigated the pre-treatment associations of nutritional status and biomarkers with ICI treatment response and survivals.<br \/>Methods: We recruited stage III-IV NSCLC patients. Pre-ICI treatment clinical information and blood samples were obtained. Clinician assessed ICI response and survival data were recorded. The nutritional\/inflammatory indicators were compared based on treatment response and survivals. ICI Clinical Benefit was defined as 12-month progression free survival. Pearson Chi-square or Fisher&#8217;s Exact test was used to compare categorical metrics; non-parametric analysis compared continuous metrics by treatment response. Overall survivals were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations.<br \/>Results: Of the 76 patients recruited, all were ECOG performance status 0 (14.5%) or 1 (85.5%). 36 (47%) had Clinical Benefit with median survival 21.3 mo. vs. 6.6 mo. among the No Clinical Benefit patients (p&#60;0.01). Non-responders had significantly more often weight loss, lower serum albumin, elevated red cell distribution index (RDW) and worse scores for Frailty Index, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Non-responders had significantly more inflammation with a higher Systemic Immune Response Index (SIRI) and RDW. Overall survival was negatively correlated with: 1. weight loss; 2. low serum albumin; 3. low serum sodium; 4. high RDW; 5. elevated total neutrophils, total white blood cells, total monocytes, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio; 6. adverse MNA and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index; 7. elevated SIRI and Systemic Immune Inflammation Index (SII). ICI response prediction accuracy using a solely MNA-based model was significantly high in terms of AUROC of 0.85 [95% CI= (0.76, 0.93); p&#60;0.05]. In multivariable analysis, the predictor of immunotherapy response and survival was the 6-measure MNA which strongly correlates with weight loss, low serum albumin and depressed Frailty Index.<br \/>Conclusions: An adverse nutritional status with accompanying chronic inflammation is strong predictor of non-response to ICI. Since lung cancer patients with depressed pre-treatment nutrition have a low likelihood of an ICI response, they should be promptly referred for dietician consultation for intensive nutritional therapy which may improve their clinical outlook. Considering the negative association of malnutrition\/inflammation with response to ICI treatment in NSCLC patients who still qualify as ECOG performance status 0-1 patients, prospective clinical trials should also stratify their results by nutritional status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Inflammation,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Cachexia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

We retrospectively examined 2828 cases of CRC patients who took cancer-genome panel tests in Japan between June 2019 and November 2022. The time to first-line treatment failure was longer with regimen with oxaliplatin than with those with irinotecan in CRC patients with Chr20q11,21 amplification (12.2 versus 9.2 months, p=0.0481). Oxaliplatin induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) and then cellular apoptosis. A key event of the DNA damage response to DSBs for cellular survival is the extensive phosphorylation of Ser139 of Histone H2AX adjacent to the chromosomal break. TPX2 whose gene resides in Chr20q11,21 has been reported to repress the phosphorylation of H2AX upon ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the amplification of TPX2 and oxaliplatin sensitivity in human CRCs. The knockdown of TPX2 decreased the oxaliplatin-susceptibility of COLO320 and Caco-2, CIN phenotype CRC cell lines which highly expressed TPX2. However, TPX2 knockdown did not reduce the oxaliplatin sensitivity of HCT-116, an MSI phenotype CRC cell line with low-level of TPX2 expression. The knockdown of TPX2 in CIN phenotype CRC cells, not in the MSI phenotype CRC cells, enhanced the phosphorylation of H2AX upon the DNA-damage induced by oxaliplatin. These findings suggest that amplification of TPX2 contributes to the oxaliplatin-susceptibility of CRCs with CIN phenotype through DNA repair machinery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Oxaliplatin,Drug sensitivity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Shohei Ueno<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Taichi Isobe<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryosuke Taguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Tsuchihashi<sup>3<\/sup>, Koichi Akashi<sup>1<\/sup>, Eishi Baba<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Oncology and Social Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Hematology, Oncology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"36f5524e-5459-4e91-9d75-3f8a62922396","ControlNumber":"1568","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Postoperative recurrence in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated with therapeutic strategies similar to those for metastatic disease. However, in postoperative recurrence cases, PD-L1 evaluation is generally based on archival resection specimens, because there is little opportunity for a new biopsy of the recurrent site. Therefore, it remains unclear whether TIME of recurrent lesion is similar to TIME of primary lesion at surgery, and the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody for postoperative recurrent NSCLC patients based on TIME status at surgery is unknown.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Cohort A included 59 patients with advanced and 25 patients with postoperative recurrence NSCLC who treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. PD-L1 expression and CD8-TIL were evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor specimens obtained at diagnosis in the advanced cases and at surgery in the postoperative recurrence cases. Tumor proportion score for PD-L1 and the extent of CD8-TIL were evaluated and classified as high or low. TIME was categorized into 4 subclasses, according to the respective PD-L1 and CD8-TIL, as follows: (class I) high\/high; (class II) low\/low; (class III) high\/low; and (class IV) low\/high. Progression-free survival (PFS) of pembrolizumab was compared based on TIME. Cohort B consisted of 50 NSCLC patients who underwent radical resection, and whose tumor specimens were obtained from recurrent site. As in cohort A, TIME was assessed for paired resection and recurrent tumor samples.<br \/>Results: In cohort A, the median PFS of pembrolizumab for the advanced cases were 25.7 months in class I (n=25), 2.3 months in class II (n=8), 8.0 months in class III (n=20), and 6.5 months in class IV (n=6) (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), respectively; while those for the postoperative recurrence cases were 9.0 months (n=7), 4.3 months (n=7), 7.6 months (n=6), and 2.5 months (n=5) (<i>p<\/i>=0.55), respectively. In cohort B, TIME for resected primary lesion were observed in 9 with class I, 20 with class II, 3 with class III and 18 patients with class IV, respectively. The concordance of PD-L1 category (high vs low) between resected primary lesion and recurrent lesion was 88.0%, while that of TIME classification was 54.0%.<br \/>Conclusion: TIME classification using tumor specimens just before administration of anti-PD-1 antibody was useful predictive biomarker. However, TIME alterations between resection and postoperative recurrence were observed in many cases, suggesting that TIME based on tumor specimens at surgery may not be useful for predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody for postoperative recurrent NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Postoperative recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Its role in breast cancer (BC) has been studied but a consensus remains elusive. We focused on gene expression of a CSC marker CD133 and studied its clinical significance in ER-positive\/HER2-negative (ER+\/HER2-) BC, the most prevalent subtype. We utilized multiple independent large patient cohorts of gene expression and clinical variables for transcriptome analysis.<br \/>Methods: A total of 2969 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=1065) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC, n=1904) BC cohorts, as well as BC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC; GSE25066, GSE20194, GSE32646 cohorts) were analyzed.<br \/>Results: By analyzing SCP1039 and SCP1106 single-cell sequencing cohorts, we found that epithelial cells were the predominant source of CD133 gene expression in the tumor microenvironment. High expression of CD133 in ER+\/HER2- BC correlated with elevated gene expressions of the other CSC markers; CD24, NOTCH1, DLL1, and ALDH1A1 (all p&#60;0.001), and significantly enriched WNT\/&#946;-Catenin, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling (all FDR&#60;0.25), which are all known pathways related with CSC in TCGA and validated in METABRIC cohort. Consistent with CSC phenotype, CD133-high BC was negatively enriched with Hallmark cell proliferation-related gene sets, such as E2F Targets, G2M Checkpoint, MYC Targets V1, Ki67 gene expression and proliferation score (FDR&#60;0.25 and p&#60;0.001, respectively) in both cohorts. CD133-high BC was negatively associated with DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1, E2F7 in both cohorts (all p&#60;0.001). In agreement, CD133-high BC was associated with less homologous recombination deficiency, lower silent and non-silent mutation rates. Surprisingly, CD133-high BC exhibited a proinflammatory microenvironment, as represented by higher cytolytic activity in the METABRIC and higher lymphocyte infiltrations, TGF-beta response, and TCR richness in TCGA (both p&#60;0.001), but less Th1 cells, M1 macrophages and dendritic cell infiltrations consistently in both cohorts. It also enriched signaling pathways related to inflammation and immune responses such as inflammatory response, allograft rejection, TNF-alpha, IL-6, TGF-beta signaling, and complement signaling (all FDR&#60;0.25). CD133-high tumors had better pathological complete response after NAC in GSE25066 cohort and improved Disease-Free Survival and Overall Survival in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (all p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: CD133-high ER+\/HER2- BC is associated with CSC phenotype, reduced cell proliferation, and impaired DNA repair, but enhanced inflammation, potentially explaining the better response to NAC and favorable patient prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD133,Cancer stem cells,Hormone receptors,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

In this regard, different clinical trials have failed, unable to stratify these patients to find an effective response to specific therapy. This study aimed to identify biomarkers exclusively expressed in the basal mammary compartment that can help us to subclassify the triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Based on computational analysis from single-cell RNA sequencing data, we have identified a list of basal identity-associated genes (BC-markers). Subsequent histological validation confirmed the expression pattern of these markers in a cohort of 50 samples, which has allowed us to stratify triple-negative breast cancer patients into BC-TNBC and luminal-like subtypes. Importantly, the expression of these markers correlated with poorer prognosis in TNBC patients. Functional analysis revealed that <i>TAGLN<\/i> played a significant role in cell proliferation and migration, potentially impacting tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, the expression of these BC-markers is associated with a mesenchymal phenotype which corresponds to the previously described Lehmannn&#8217;s mesenchymal-like signature.

The randomized METIMMOX trial (NCT03388190) examined if patients with previously untreated, unresectable abdominal metastases from MSS-CRC may achieve therapeutic efficacy from short-course oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FLOX) and sequential ICB (nivolumab) repeatedly. Half of study patients assigned to this experimental treatment had significantly extended progression-free survival (PFS) while the other half had shortened PFS, compared to the control-group patients given standard FLOX chemotherapy with median PFS 9.3 months. Here we explored if somatic mutations (mut) unveiled by next-generation sequencing might provide insights into responsiveness to the METIMMOX regimen.<br \/>Procedures: Patients had MSS-CRC with infradiaphragmatic metastases deemed unresectable and were eligible for first-line oxaliplatin-based therapy. They were randomly assigned to the control group of FLOX (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid) Q2W or the experimental group of alternating 2 cycles each of FLOX Q2W and nivolumab Q2W, with prespecified break periods. Radiologic response assessment was done every 8 weeks with PFS as the primary endpoint. Diagnostic tumor biopsies and baseline metastasis biopsies were sequenced with the TruSight Oncology 500 assay. TMB was calculated using only coding, non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants and insertions\/deletions with variant allele frequency &#8805;5% and sequencing depth &#8805;50&#215;, applying the effective panel size as the megabases (Mb) denominator.<br \/>Results: Sequencing data were acquired from 20 experimental-group patients with median PFS 7.9 months (minimum 2.0, maximum 41.6). Median TMB was 5.1 mut\/Mb (minimum 0.8, maximum 11.8), concordant in patient-paired primary tumor and metastasis specimens. The TMB was associated with treatment outcome; the higher TMB, the better PFS with hazard ratio 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.98; <i>p<\/i> = 0.026, Cox regression) for a PFS event with increasing TMB.

Identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies. This study aims to identify predictive biomarkers for FLOT4 treatment efficacy using a multi-omics approach.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a preliminary differential gene expression analysis in diagnostic tissue pre-treatment and surgical resection post-treatment in six patients (two GEJ and four GC) who all exhibited a partial pathological response (G2) to neoadjuvant FLOT4 chemotherapy. Utilizing DESeq2 for differential gene expression and David pathway analysis for functional insights, we have begun to unravel the complex molecular response to treatment. Upcoming assays include blood gDNA and tumor tissue whole exome sequencing (WES), comprehensive methylation profiling, miRNA characterization, and proteomics via LC-MSMS.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary data suggest alterations in gene expression associated with cell adhesion, extracellular matrix interaction, and immune response pathways. Three common genes (<i>CXCL2<\/i>, <i>CXCL3<\/i>, <i>CXCL1<\/i>) were identified among upregulated pathways in GEJ patients, while one common gene (<i>IL1A<\/i>) was observed in GC patients. These findings suggest a complex network of biological processes influenced by FLOT4. In-depth results, including whole-exome sequencing, methylation patterns, and miRNA profiles, will be completed and presented at the conference.<br \/>Conclusion: These initial findings propose that changes in gene expression related to cellular architecture and immune response are indicative of a partial response to FLOT4 in both GEJ and GC patients. The identified genes and pathways may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes.<br \/>Future Directions: By the time of the conference, we anticipate including a more extensive patient cohort with complete response or no response to FLOT4, and comparative analyses with a FOLFOX treatment group. The integration of forthcoming WES, methylation, miRNA, and proteomics data will provide a more comprehensive molecular predictive model.<br \/>Keywords: FLOT4 chemotherapy, gastroesophageal junction cancer, gastric cancer, predictive biomarkers, differential gene expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,FLOT4 chemotherapy,differential gene expression,predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Expression levels of HER2 are a key pathogenic and treatment-associated factor in breast carcinomas, with HER2 expression reported as per the ASCO\/CAP scoring guidelines. Outside the intense focus on the HER2 overexpression few studies currently exist that look at the comprehensive molecular profile of these aggressive tumors .<br \/>Design: Our institutional pathology database was searched for patients with breast carcinoma diagnosed between 2009 and 2013 and with HER2 scored as 3+ based on immunohistochemistry, or HER2 2+ with confirmatory positive FISH results. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 523 gene panel, and clinicopathologic data were gathered from the institutional electronic health record system. A CoMutation plot was made using the CoMut python library.<br \/>Results: The mean age of the patients at time of diagnosis was 56.1&#177;12.7 years. The tumors were overwhelmingly high-grade, with 26\/30 being grade 3 and the remaining 4\/30 being grade 2 and a mean size of 2.6 cm. All were histologically invasive ductal carcinoma, and 26\/30 were scored as HER2 3+ on IHC while 4\/30 were HER2 2+ with positive FISH. ER was positive in 30% of cases (9\/30), PR was positive in 23.3% (7\/30), p53 was positive by IHC in 53.3% (16\/30), and the mean Ki-67 proliferative index was 47.1%. 20 of the 30 (66%) cases meeting the inclusion criteria had pathogenic mutations detected by NGS testing. Several distinct molecular subgroups were seen on the CoMutation plot (figure 1). The mean tumor mutational burden (TMB) was 14.1 mutations per megabase. A significant subset of the tumors 70% (14\/20) showed <i>TP53<\/i> mutations, and 30% (6\/20) show PIK3CA mutations. Of interest, only 1\/14 tumors showed a co-occurring homologous recombination repair gene mutation and one tumor (1\/20) showed mutations in 2 homologous recombination pathway genes (<i>FANCA <\/i>and <i>BRCA1<\/i>) as well as numerous additional mutations (tumor mutational burden of 65.3 mutations per megabase).<br \/>Conclusion: Overall the mean TMB was 14.1 mutations\/megabase in this HER2-positive breast cancer study set. Over 2\/3 of our HER2-positive breast cancer cases also had <i>TP53<\/i> mutations. In addition, 1\/3 had PIK3CA mutations, suggesting that a subset of HER2-positive carcinomas also harbor other potentially actionable mutations which may increase the effectiveness of our existing interventions. Additional studies are needed to further subclassify genetically distinct subsets of HER2-positive breast cancers and to further understand clinical, pathologic and treatment-related differences in this aggressive breast cancer subset.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HER2\/neu,Molecular profiling,Molecular subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

SPF45 is also thought to be related to anti-cancer drug resistance, suggesting that the SPF45 molecule has a different resistance mechanism from the conventional mechanism of anticancer drug resistance. In this study, we investigated the relationship between SPF45 expression and anticancer drug sensitivity in gastric cancer.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A total of 654 gastric cancer cases were used in this study. SPF45 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between SPF45 expression and clinicopathological factors was evaluated.<br \/>Results: Of the 654 gastric cancer cases, 240 were positive for SPF45 expression and 414 were negative for expression. There was no significant difference in age and gender between the two groups, but SPF45-positive cases were significantly more frequent in patients with undifferentiation (p = 0.004), lymphatic invasion (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.013) and venous invasion (p&#8201;&#60;&#8201;0.001). As for anticancer drug therapy, 215 of the 654 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical surgery were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and 94 patients with advanced recurrent gastric cancer were treated with chemotherapy. 75 SPF45-positive-patients who received 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy (S-1, UFT, 5-DFUR) after surgery had significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) than 140 SPF45-negative-patients (p=0.027). 102 SPF45-positive-patients who didn&#8217;t receive adjuvant chemotherapy was no significantly different in RFS from 203 SPF45-negative-patients. In the 215 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 81 DPD-positive patients had significantly worse RFS than DPD-negative patients (p=0.043). In the 305 patients who didn&#8217;t receive adjuvant chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in RFS between DPD-positive patients and DPD-negative patients (p=0.880). SPF45-positive cases were significantly more frequent in patients with DPD expression (p&#8201;&#60; 0.001).In 94 patients with advanced recurrent gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy, there were 42 recurrent patients and 52 stage IV patients. 50 of SPF45-positive patients had significantly worse progression-free survival than 44 of SPF45-negative patients (p&#8201;&#60;&#8201;0.001). Regarding overall response, SPF45-positive-patients had worse response rate than SPF45-negative-patients (p=0.016).

Also, to assess the change of PSIG during anti-cancer treatment and the relation with clinical condition.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods<\/b>: Newly diagnosed advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients were enrolled. The inclusion criteria included pathology or cytology-proved stage IV and non-operable stage III non-small cell lung cancer, treatment-na&#239;ve, and planned to receive chemotherapy, EGFR-TKI therapy. Or, planned to receive any line of singe agent immunotherapy. We planned to enroll 30 patients in each treatment group (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, EGFR TKI therapy) with and additional control group of stage I NSCLC.Blood sample from each enrolled patient was obtained for INF-&#947; release assay (IGRA) within 3 days before the initiation of systemic therapy and 8-12 weeks after treatment. The IGRA was performed with QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube (QFT-GIT; Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacture&#8217;s instruction. The amount of INF-&#947; produced in response to PHA is determined by the INF-&#947; level in the PHA-coated tube minus saline-coated tube, and is termed PHA-stimulated INF-&#947; (PSIG) level. Patients with PSIG level above 7.06IU were defined had high PSIG level according to our previous study. we also performed our in house INF-&#947; level by ELISA. Tumor response was assessed mainly by chest CT and brain MRI (if available) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECST) .<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Total 116 patients were enrolled. Demographic distribution was summarized in Table 1. Thirty-five of 116 (30.2%) patients had latent TB infection, while 12 patients (10.3%) had indeterminate OFT test, all due to low mitogen-stimulated INF-&#947; level. 84 patients had been obtained post-treatment blood test, and the box-plot of in-house INF-&#947; level were shown in Figure1. For stage I control group, INF-&#947; level seemed higher after surgery; for chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the INF-&#947; level also seemed increase among responders (who achieved disease control after treatment).

The oxidative state of the tumor and its microenvironment plays a critical role in this response and highlights the importance of better understanding the role of redox enzymes in response to immunotherapy. In fact, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) effectors can either up or down regulate PD-L1 expression depending on their targets and mechanisms of action. Our data indicate that DUOX2, an NADPH enzyme involved in the production of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>, is expressed in about forty percent of human gastric cancers and is significantly increased in esophageal cancers. Moreover, DUOX2 expression in human gastric and esophageal cancer cells corresponds to down regulation of the immune checkpoint PD-L1. Conversely, down regulation of DUOX2 increases PD-L1, HIF-1&#945; and c-Myc expression in these cells. To better understand the role of DUOX2 in the production of ROS and how it interferes with the expressions of HIF-1&#945; and PD-L1, we also evaluated its effects on the ROS scavenger glutathione (GSH) and the ROS generating Ceramide in cells expressing or not DUOX2. The down regulation of DUOX2 reduced by more than half Ceramide levels and significantly increased GSH levels. This is consistent with the known effect of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> on Ceramide generation through sphingomyelin hydrolysis and H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> inhibitory effect on HIF-1&#945; binding and accumulation of HIF-1&#945; protein. Because HIF-1&#945; is a known regulator of PD-L1, DUOX2 expression on some tumors could thus interfere with PD-L1 expression through generation of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>. Moreover, because HIF-1&#945; and PD-L1 expression contribute to radio-resistance, DUOX2 expression could sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy. On the other hand, tumors lacking DUOX2 expression would be expected to be more sensitive to immunotherapy targeting PD-1 and\/or PD-L1. DUOX2 expression thus appears to hold significant potential as a valuable biomarker to guide therapeutic decisions regarding radiation or immuno-therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Reactive oxygen species,PD-L1,Gastric cancer,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

In this study, we investigated the correlation between immunohistochemistry (IHC), multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), and RNA Salah Targeted Expression Panel (RNA STEP) for ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 in formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 14 SCLC samples collected under an IRB-approved protocol (MCC19163). For the mIF evaluation, FFPE samples were immunostained using the AKOYA Biosciences OPAL TM 7-Color Automation IHC kit on the BOND RX autostainer. For RNA STEP, nanoString nCounter TagSet chemistry was used to measure gene expression levels of test FFPE samples relative to a reference pooled human normal mRNA control. All three methods demonstrated significant correlation for ASCL1 levels (Table 1). IHC and RNA STEP NEUROD1 results exhibited significant correlation. However, mIF NEUROD1 results did not correlate with the results of other methods likely due to non-specific positivity of the NEUROD1 mIF antibody. No strong correlation was observed between any of the methods for POU2F3 and YAP1. Only 2 of the 14 samples displayed positive POU2F3 protein expression by IHC; one of these also had elevated POU2F3 expression by RNA STEP. Importantly, the sample with the highest POU2F3 protein expression by IHC also had the highest values by mIF and RNA STEP. All samples were negative for YAP1 by IHC and RNA STEP. Notably, ASCL1 staining was primarily observed in CD56+ POU2F3- cells by mIF. These findings highlight the reliability and utility of IHC and RNA STEP in assessing transcriptional factors in SCLC. Also, mIF presents an innovative method for the simultaneous analysis of multiple markers using a single tissue section, enabling the concurrent detection of multiple markers within individual cells.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{E740FB44-7DBC-4E36-A2F4-EBEE32434DB8}\"><caption>Table 1.

Traditional ICK assays utilizing antibody staining for endpoint data generation pose challenges in capturing dynamic interactions. Moreover, antibody labeling for data quantification may compromise sensitivity, especially with low-affinity antibodies or a limited number of cells. The anticipation of label-free lymphocyte subset classification and real-time effector\/target cell interaction analysis in one field of view is expected to provide more valuable insights than traditional ICK assays. Previous studies achieved 70-80% accuracy in image-based lymphocyte subset classification using digital holographic microscopy, light scattering, etc. but the cells&#8217; condition during the cell sorting or sample preparation process may affect the lymphocyte subset status, resulting in real morphological discrepancies. Our approach focuses on directly sorting human PBMCs to enable label-free, dynamic interaction analysis of natural immune system responses in one field of view.<br \/>Method: In this study, PBMC samples from 6 individuals were separated using standard-density gradient centrifugation and labeled with antibodies. Data were acquired using the Holotomographic Microscope HT-X1 (Tomocube Inc.). We employed Densenet 121 as the deep learning model architecture, considering the trade-off between memory consumption and performance. The cross-entropy loss function was utilized, and the AdamW optimizer was chosen for model parameter optimization. Input data consisted of 3D refractive index (RI) data for individual cells, each of sized (20, 54, 54). Individual cell labeling was performed using staining information.<br \/>Results: An overall accuracy of 93.75% in Human PBMC subtype cell classification was achieved. In stage 1, an accuracy of 97.56% was demonstrated in classifying [CD14, CD15, Others]. Among the cells classified as \"Others\" in stage 2, [CD3, CD19, CD16&#38;CD56] displayed an accuracy of 93.5%. In stage 3, classifying [CD4, CD8] within the CD3 subtype achieved an accuracy of 90.2%. This classification is presumably based on pattern recognition of the chromosomal landscape in holotomography images.<br \/>Conclusion: Our research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of real-time label-free lymphocyte subset classification. This approach enabled the classification of effector cells as live cells in ICK assay and the analysis of effector-target cell dynamic interactions. Further training in the classification of more detailed subtype cells and various cell death types will provide additional insights. The advancement of this technology is expected to play a pivotal role in disease prevention, treatment, vaccine development, medical research, and academic studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,ICK,Lymphocyte subset,Label-free cell classification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

So far, testing the predictive value of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand 1 (PD-L1) has shown contrasting results. Here, we aimed to validate the predictive value of PD-L1 SNPs in advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs as well as to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of identified SNP candidate. rs822336 SNP efficiently predicted response to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1-based immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients as compared to rs2282055 and rs4143815 SNPs. rs822336 SNP mapped on promoter\/enhancer region of PD-L1, differentially affecting the induction of PD-L1 expression in human NSCLC cell lines. The induction of PD-L1 expression by rs822336 SNP was predicted by allele-specificity binding of two identified transcription factors: C\/EBP&#946; and NFIC. As a result, silencing of C\/EBP&#946; and NFIC differentially modulated the induction of PD-L1 expression in human NSCLC cell lines carrying different rs822336 genotypes. In addition, binding microarray validated the allele- specificity binding of C\/EBP&#946; and NFIC to PD-L1 promoter\/enhancer region based on rs822336 genotype in human NSCLC cell lines. Lastly, the induction of PD-L1 expression by rs822336 genotype differentially affected the susceptibility to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab of human NSCLC cell lines co-cultured with HLA class I antigen matched PBMC. These results have clinical relevance since identified rs822336 SNP and the induction of PD-L1 expression as novel biomarkers for predicting ICI-based immunotherapy in NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,SNP,NSCLC,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

BH3 mimetics disrupt this balance by disturbing the interaction of a specific anti-apoptotic protein, leading to the initiation of apoptosis. However, relying solely on molecular data for the specific anti-apoptotic protein can be challenging due to the functional redundancy within the BCL2 protein family and their complex interaction network. Therefore, comprehensive profiling information considering protein complexes is essential to determine apoptotic dependencies, particularly in a clinical context. In this study, we adapted a Single-molecule Protein Interaction Detection (SPID) platform that can assess levels of protein complexes in a quantitative manner. Out of the 47 metrics included in our Apoptosis Signaling 47 panel, we utilized 22 assays to measure apoptosis dependencies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells obtained from 32 patients. By combining these metrics, we developed a predictive model for the ex vivo response to ABT-199 treatment, focusing on three key biomarkers: BCL2-BAX complex, BCL2-BIM binding potential, and BCLxl-BAK level. From a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, the model exhibited high accuracy with a value of 0.94 area under the curve (AUC). We further validated our model by comparing the predicted response to the therapeutic outcomes in 10 AML patients according to the 2017 ELN guidelines, and achieved 100% sensitivity (4 out of 4 identified correctly) and 83.3% specificity (5 out of 6 identified correctly). Overall, our platform provides an effective method to explore apoptosis dependencies in clinical samples based on the information regarding protein complexes within the BCL2 protein family. Three key molecular biomarkers can be translated into a gauge for predicting therapeutic outcomes of BH3 mimetics, suggesting an improvement of precision medicine in AML treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,Biomarkers,Acute myeloid leukemia,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongwon Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Changju Chun<sup>2<\/sup>, Byungsan Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Saem Hong<sup>1<\/sup>, Yunseo Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Youngil Koh<sup>3<\/sup>, Tae-Young Yoon<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PROTEINA Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b9d4c33e-ed00-4506-bc01-c98879ecadba","ControlNumber":"1520","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

To date, (1) we cannot predict irAE risk reliably at patient level and (2) irAEs remain a diagnosis of exclusion as there are no specific clinical or biological markers. The goal of this study was to elucidate intricate transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of immune cells in patients evolving irAEs.<br \/>Methods: This pilot trial was conducted as part of a prospective multicenter cohort study (NCT04631731). The study cohort consisted of n=71 patients who were treated with ICIs across Blacktown and Westmead Hospitals, NSW, Australia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from both pre-treatment and after 6-8 weeks post-ICI commencement. Samples were further utilized for RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and Chromium 3&#8217; gene expression analysis (10x Genomics).<br \/>Results: The median age was 67 years old with the 78% (n=56) of Caucasian origin. The predominant number of patients were treated with dual ICIs. N=21 patients experienced irAEs. Firstly, a differential analysis established a set of genes which were significantly (FDR&#60;0.01) dysregulated between patients with (group A) and without irAEs (group B) and were mostly related to cell cycle and regulation. Notably, phospholipase D signaling pathway was exclusively upregulated in group A and is known to be linked to B cell expansion. Secondly, a cell enrichment analysis within the group A revealed a significant increase of CD4+ and CD8+ T central memory (Tcm) cells upon the toxicity onset as compared to baseline stage. Thirdly, the flow cytometry data established that group A had (1) higher expression of CD27 on CD4+ T cells, a member of Traf-linked tumor necrosis factor receptor family essential for T cells&#8217; maturation and (2) lower expression of inhibitory receptor LAG3 (CD223) which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis of immune system through suppression of T cell proliferation. Finally, we sequenced CD45+ cells from n=4 patients from group A and n=4 from group B at both pre- and post-treatment stages. The unsupervised clustering established 17 different clusters in our single cell dataset with cluster 11 was unique only to patients from group A. The differential analysis established that a set of n=62 genes was significantly upregulated (p&#60;0.05) in cluster 11. Functional annotation established that B cell activation and proliferation pathways were enriched by those genes further stressing B cells&#8217; role in irAEs development.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Our real-world cohort study established significant molecular and cellular differences between patients with and without irAEs.

As the majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, we aimed to characterize heterogeneity and dynamics of multicellular tumor ecosystem following anti-PD-1 treatment using scRNA-seq.<br \/>Methods: In a phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab on advanced hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients (NCT03419481), we performed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic profiling of biopsy samples from 26 patients before and during treatment. The composition and distribution of immune aggregates in responsive tumors was characterized by scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome analyses. The anti-tumor efficacy of combined therapy with anti-PD-1 and inhibition of immunosuppressive macrophage were further determined in RIL-175-derived PD-1-resistant mouse model.<br \/>Results: After initial data processing and quality control, we obtained 353,329 high-quality cells that included tumor cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Our analysis revealed that baseline tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells exhibited a strong association with improved prognosis. Notably, treatment-induced expansion and differentiation of tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells with memory-like phenotype highly correlated with durable ICB response. Moreover, we observed a co-occurrence pattern of key anti-tumor immune subsets in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which associated with ligand-receptor pair interactions. Spatial transcriptome analysis further validated the presence of immune aggregates in responsive tumors. Importantly, we derived an responsive signature from immune aggregates, which showed a strong association with improved prognosis in pan-cancer ICB datasets. Paired comparisons of pre- and on-treatment macrophage percentages in non-responders revealed a specific expansion of an immunosuppressive macrophage subset. Inhibition of this macrophage subset could overcome ICB resistance by enhancing T cell function in our PD-1 resistant model. We further observed that a tumorous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program might contribute to therapeutic resistance via TME remodeling.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study suggests that tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells and immune aggregates may be associated with durable ICB response, while ICB-induced upregulation of immunosuppressive macrophages and EMT<sup>hi<\/sup> tumor cells contributed to therapeutic evasion. These findings provide valuable insights for identification of predictive biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for ICB therapy of HCC.

Agilent Technologies, Inc. is developing Claudin 18.2 IHC 14G11 pharmDx as an immunohistochemical (IHC) assay for the detection of Claudin 18.2 protein in gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma in support of clinical studies conducted by Transcenta Therapeutics. Analytical verification for Claudin 18.2 IHC 14G11 pharmDx included sensitivity, specificity, and precision assessment. Testing was performed on human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) gastric and GEJ tissues using Autostainer Link 48 with EnVision FLEX visualization system. Biomarker expression was evaluated using Tumor Proportion Score (TPS). TPS is defined as the percentage of viable invasive tumor cells that exhibit convincing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. Sensitivity testing of 102 commercially procured FFPE gastric\/GEJ specimens demonstrated a broad dynamic range of Claudin 18.2 positivity that covered TPS from 0% to 100%. Specificity tests confirmed specific targeting of the Claudin 18.2 protein in a variety of normal and abnormal tissues. For laboratory precision testing, which evaluated the assay variability in relation to run, instrument, operator, and reagent lot, &#8805; 95% of TPS values were within expected variability limits for each parameter. For observer precision testing, two-sided 95% confidence intervals were &#8805; 85% for negative, positive, and overall agreements when assessing two clinical cutoffs. These results demonstrated the Claudin 18.2 IHC 14G11 pharmDx assay can provide reliable and reproducible results in day-to-day testing. Analytical verification testing indicates Claudin 18.2 IHC 14G11 pharmDx is a sensitive, specific, and precise assay for detecting Claudin 18.2 in gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma. Claudin 18.2 IHC 14G11 pharmDx for Investigational Use Only\/for Performance Evaluation Only will be used for patient selection in the upcoming phase III trial of gastric\/GEJ adenocarcinoma where applicable ethics committee and regulatory approvals have been granted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Assay development,Biomarkers,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Cytokines are small proteins that play a crucial role in the immune response to cancer. However, not all patients respond to cytokine-based immunotherapies, and some may experience severe side effects. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies could greatly improve the efficacy and tolerability of treatment. In this context, the study of predictive biomarkers, such as the expression of immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1 and TIGIT, and the profiling of cytokines within the tumor microenvironment, has become crucial. These biomarkers could provide valuable information about the patient's immune response to the tumor and their likelihood of responding to cytokine-based immunotherapies.<br \/><b>Method<\/b> A multimodal approach to stratify predictive biomarkers in head and neck cancers was used. The methodology was founded on combining metabolic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to offer a comprehensive understanding of potential biomarkers. The data from different modalities were integrated using bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms. This comprehensive dataset was analyzed to identify multimodal biomarker signatures that could predict patient responses to cytokine-based therapies.<br \/><b>Result<\/b> Preliminary finding showed significant heterogeneity in the expression of PD-L1, TIGIT, and various cytokines across the tumor microenvironment. This underscored the complexity of head and neck cancers. Certain multimodal biomarker signatures, which included specific patterns of immune checkpoint molecule expression, cytokine profiles, and immune cell infiltration, correlated robustly with patient responses to cytokine-based therapies.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> Our study demonstrates the considerable potential of a multimodal stratification approach in deciphering the complexity of head and neck cancers and predicting responses to cytokine-based immunotherapies. By integrating metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we identified unique biomarker signatures that strongly correlated with therapy responses. This work underscores the invaluable role of integrated predictive biomarker profiles in enhancing the precision of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Predictive biomarkers,TIGIT,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.
