[{"Abstract":"Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223) is a targeted alpha therapy that binds to newly formed abnormal bone in bone metastases and induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cancer cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Radium-223 is used for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Darolutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer or non-metastatic CRPC. We studied the antitumor effects of radium-223 in combination with darolutamide using LNCaP human prostate cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and an intratibial LNCaP model mimicking prostate cancer metastasized to bone.<br \/>The <i>in vitro<\/i> antiproliferative effects of radium-223 and darolutamide were determined using LNCaP cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted on RNA sequencing data from LNCaP cells treated with the synthetic androgen R1881 alone or in combination with darolutamide. LNCaP cells were inoculated into the right tibia of male NOD.scid mice. The mice (n=7-9\/group) were randomized based on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and treated with vehicle, radium-223 (330 kBq\/kg, Q4Wx2, i.v.), darolutamide (100 mg\/kg, BID, p.o.), or with a combination of radium-223 and darolutamide, for 41 days. PSA and the bone turnover markers PINP and CTX-I were measured every second week in serum. Tumor-induced abnormal bone area, bone formation rate and radium-223 uptake in tumor-bearing tibiae were determined by X-ray, histomorphometry and gamma counter, respectively.<br \/>The combination of radium-223 and darolutamide showed synergistic antiproliferative effects with combination indexes between 0.69-0.75 <i>in vitro<\/i>. GSEA demonstrated a prominent darolutamide-induced downregulation of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways. <i>In vivo,<\/i> the combination treatment showed synergistic antitumor efficacy (p=0.04) as demonstrated by lower PSA concentrations when compared with the vehicle, radium-223 or darolutamide monotherapies (p=0.004, p=0.011 and p=0.002, respectively). In the vehicle and combination treatment groups, the mean serum PSA was 541% and 95.9% of the pre-treatment level, respectively. Furthermore, radium-223 alone or in combination with darolutamide inhibited increased bone turnover, tumor-induced abnormal bone growth and trabecular bone formation when compared to vehicle. Concurrent administration of darolutamide did not affect radium-223 uptake in tibiae.<br \/>Radium-223 in combination with darolutamide exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The synergistic effects could be due to the radiosensitization of cancer cells by darolutamide-induced downregulation of DDR pathways. Our results suggest that the combination of targeted alpha therapy with an androgen receptor inhibitor is a promising treatment strategy for mCRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Prostate cancer,Targeted alpha therapy,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Novel molecular targets are expected to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) in TNBC. BUB1, a mitotic checkpoint Serine\/Threonine-protein kinase is known to impact chromosomal segregation during mitosis. However, its precise role in DNA damage repair in response to RT remains largely unknown. We demonstrated that BUB1 is overexpressed in BC (vs. normal breast) and considerably raised in TNBC with poor survival outcomes using differential gene expression analysis. In multiple TNBC cell lines, cell proliferation assays revealed that pharmacological (BAY1816032) or genomic (CRISPR) ablation of BUB1 was cytotoxic. Using clonogenic survival assays, we observed that BUB1 ablation radiosensitized TNBC cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549) while its ablation did not radiosensitized breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). Furthermore, by depleting endogenous BUB1 (siRNAs and CRISPR) and reintroducing wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead (KD) BUB1, we demonstrated that inhibition of BUB1 kinase function is responsible for the radiosensitization phenotype. BUB1 ablation increased tumor doubling time in SUM159 xenografts when combined with radiation. Ki67 levels were also reduced in these tumors, confirming the efficacy of the combined treatment. BUB1 ablation led to persistent radiation-induced DNA DSB (gH2AX foci) indicating decreased DNA-DSB repair. BLRR assays confirmed that BUB1 impacts the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Biochemical analyses showed that BUB1 ablation stabilized total- and phospho- DNAPKcs (S2056) following RT such that half-lives could not be estimated. In contrast, RT alone caused BUB1 stabilization, but pre-treatment with BUB1i and DNAPKi prevented stabilization. To evaluate the recruitment of DDR proteins to the chromatin following RT, soluble nuclear and chromatin-enriched fractionations were performed which illustrated an increase in recruitment of phospho- and total-DNAPK, KAP1, and ATM to chromatin indicating that BUB1 is important in the activation and recruitment of critical NHEJ proteins to DSBs. In addition, BUB1 staining of TNBC TMAs demonstrated significant correlation between BUB1 protein expression with tumor grade and stage in TNBC patients. Our findings demonstrate that ablation of BUB1 sensitizes TNBC cell lines and xenograft to RT and BUB1 mediated radiosensitization may occur through NHEJ. Our results suggest that BUB1 may serve as a novel molecular target for radiosensitization in women with TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),DNA damage,Radiation therapy,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Treatment consists of maximal safe tumor resection, chemotherapy (temozolomide) and radiotherapy; however, this aggressive treatment offers only a modest improvement in outcomes, with average life expectancy of approximately 12 months. Consequently, novel, effective and easily translatable therapies are urgently required. While radiotherapy is an effective treatment for many solid tumors, GBM displays an innate radio-resistance that contributes to treatment failure. Therefore, there is a need to identify chemotherapeutics that can be used as radiosensitizers to increase efficacy. Notably, a key pathway involved in therapeutic resistance is apoptotic evasion, which is driven by upregulation of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins that inhibit the pro-apoptotic proteins necessary for the apoptotic response. Recent advances in drug development have produced a range of BH3 mimetics - novel chemotherapeutics with potential to reinstate apoptosis by targeting specific pro-survival molecules. We hypothesized that the radiation sensitivity of GBM cells would be enhanced by using BH3 mimetics to inhibit pro-survival molecules and release the apoptotic block. A panel of BH3 mimetics was tested in combination with radiotherapy across three patient-derived GBM cell lines (G7, E2 and R15), using a 3D clonogenic culture system that recapitulates <i>in vivo<\/i> growth patterns and responses. We found that the BCL-XL inhibitor, A1331852, significantly radiosensitized all 3 GBM lines. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed A1331852 to induce PARP1 cleavage in G7 cells when used as a single agent. Subsequent<i> in vivo<\/i> studies were conducted in our well characterized orthotopic G7 xenograft murine model of GBM. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the pro-survival proteins MCL-1 and BCL-XL were upregulated in irradiated tumors. Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic study in the same orthotopic murine model, allowing for drug delivery evaluation, and optimized treatment scheduling. Importantly, A1331852 was found to be blood brain barrier penetrant at 25 mg\/kg, with increased drug detected in tumor vs normal brain tissue. From these data, a survival study investigating A1331852 as a radiosensitizing agent was carried out in the same G7 GBM orthotopic xenograft model. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increase in survival of mice treated with A133852 plus radiotherapy compared with the radiotherapy only group (<i>p <\/i>= 0.0309). Overall, we have demonstrated that dependence on BCL-2 family proteins is a vulnerability that can be targeted to improve radiotherapy response in GBM. Furthermore, we have identified a promising BH3 mimetic, A1331852, to use in combination with RT and have completed a proof-of-concept <i>in vivo<\/i> study that confirms the potential of BH3 mimetics to improve outcomes for patients with GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,Glioblastoma,Bcl-2 protein family,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

VPA is thought to exert its anti-tumor effects in part through inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), upregulation of apoptosis and autophagy, and disruption of DNA repair mechanisms. Overall survival of patients treated with VPA in combination with TMZ and radiation therapy (RT) was significantly improved compared to historical controls (mOS 29.6 months). Hence, to establish a preclinical benchmark, we investigated the effectiveness of VPA alone and in combination with the radiotherapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: Anti-proliferative effect of VPA in combination with radiation was assessed across multiple GBM cells lines (long-term cultures and PDX lines). Athymic mice were implanted with PDX GBM cells orthotopically and were randomized into four cohorts: vehicle, VPA, IR (6 gy), VPA + IR (6 gy). Animals were treated with 300mg\/kg\/day of VPA alone or in combination with 6Gy of radiation. Treatments were performed either via intraperitoneal route for 3 consecutive days or via a gastric gavage 5 days on\/2 days off for the duration of the study. For pharmacodynamics (PD), animals were sacrificed after 3 days of drug treatment at 2hr, 24hr and 4 days post last dose and processed for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for acetylated H3K9\/14, KI67, pH2AX, and cleaved caspase 3.<br \/>Results: VPA treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in GBM cell viability and enhancement of radiation sensitivity. Pharmacodynamic analysis of tumor-bearing mice demonstrated a significant increase in acetylated H3K9\/14 levels upon treatment with combination of VPA and irradiation. Elevation of acetylated H3K9\/14 levels was present 2 hours after the administration of the last dose of VPA and it persisted for 4 days. Treatment of mice with irradiation upregulated levels of the apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase 3, which was further enhanced upon VPA and irradiation combination treatment. No reduction in tumor volume or survival benefit was seen in VPA alone or combination cohorts.<br \/>Conclusion: Consistent with previous reports, treatment of PDX GBM line with VPA reduced cell viability <i>in vitro<\/i>, increased histone acetylation, and cell death. However, these changes were not sufficient to provide survival benefit in the intracranial model and warrants further investigation into the genetic requirements for radiation sensitization by VPA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Valproate,Glioblastoma,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Normally mitochondria exist in long networks due to mitochondrial fusion but in PDAC mitochondria are fragmented due to excessive fission. We previously found that forcing PDAC cells to increase mitochondrial fusion suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, leading to improved survival in multiple preclinical models. The tumor suppressive mechanisms of mitochondrial fusion remain unclear, and thus we explored the role of redox homeostasis through uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a metabolic protein normally upregulated in PDAC that was downregulated upon forced mitochondrial fusion. We hypothesize that UCP2 mediates the oncogenic effects of mitochondrial fragmentation in PDAC.<br \/>Methods: We explored if Ucp2 is necessary and sufficient for inducing tumor suppression upon mitochondrial fusion. The effects of Ucp2 loss or overexpression were characterized by metabolic flux assays, proliferation, mitochondrial ROS (mROS), membrane potential, and morphology measurements. We also examined if Ucp2 recapitulates mitochondrial fusion-induced tumor suppression via pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation and assessed the impact on mitochondrial health and cell growth. We utilized the <i>LSL-KRAS<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup>; <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>; <i>Ptf1<\/i><i>&#9082;<\/i><i> Cre <\/i>(KPC) cell line as our parental line for all genetic manipulations, with a nontargeting (sgGFP) KPC cell line as a control.<br \/>Results: Murine PDAC cells with enhanced mitochondrial fusion reduced Ucp2 transcript levels by 70% and was correlated with 3.5-fold increase in mROS, 50% reduction in OXPHOS via oxygen consumption rate assay, and a 4-fold increase in membrane potential compared to controls. Ucp2 re-expression did not rescue these phenotypes, suggesting that Ucp2 alone may not be sufficient for tumor suppression. However, inhibition of Ucp2 in PDAC cells reduced proliferation by 70%, while inducing a 3-fold increase in mROS levels, which was recapitulated with Ucp2 abrogation, thus Ucp2 may be necessary for tumor suppression. Enhanced mROS via Ucp2 inhibition significantly increased radiosensitivity (p-value &#60; 0.0001), suggesting that although it does not recapitulate the mitochondrial fusion phenotype, UCP2 may be a novel target for radiosensitization in PDAC.<br \/>Conclusions: Mitochondrial fusion may not suppress tumor growth by altering redox homeostasis via UCP2, but forcing mitochondria to fuse elucidated the impacts of UCP2 downregulation on cell metabolism. Thus, we uncovered that UCP2 may be a novel target for radiosensitization. Further insight into UCP2&#8217;s role in redox balance, and how it is disrupted with UCP2 modulation enables development of novel therapeutic combinations with UCP2 inhibition that complement and potentially synergize with existing therapeutic strategies such as radiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Reactive oxygen species,Radiosensitization,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

We used an unbiased in vivo gene knockdown screen in na&#239;ve T-cells and introduced them into irradiated host tumors to identify novel immunosuppressive genes activated during radiation. From the screen, we found that butyrophilin 1A1 (BTN1A1) knockdown causes T-cell expansion in irradiated tumors. This points to the potential immune checkpoint role of BTN1A1. We validated that BTN1A1 expression is inducible in activated T-cells and that blocking BTN1A1 contributes to T-cell activation. We tested an anti-mouse BTN1A1 antibody (STC109) in mouse colon tumor models (CT26 tumors), we observed partial anti-tumor efficacy using single agent STC109, which was enhanced by the combination of STC109 with radiation. We also got similar result in in mouse lung tumor models (LLC tumors) using anti-mouse BTN1A1 antibody, and the combination treatment showed an improved suppression of tumor growth and lung metastasis compared to single agent. Moreover, our data shown that knockout of BTN1A1 in 4T1 tumor models shown dramatic defect of tumor growth, and the BTN1A1 ko tumors are more sensitive to radiotherapy. These findings indicate the role of BTN1A1 in tumor immune response from radiation stress, and that anti-BTN1A1 has strong potential to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Combination therapy,Immune response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

At the time of diagnosis, it is often already advanced or metastatic, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. Treatment of NSCLC mainly relies on surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, but the survival rate has not increased significantly in the past decade. Therefore, finding appropriate treatment methods is necessary and crucial. Radiotherapy (RT) is a frequently employed approach for tumor treatment and serves as the primary local treatment for NSCLC. However, it often results in a poor prognosis and severe side effects when administered at high-dose irradiation. Existing literature suggests that RT may trigger the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#922;B), potentially compromising its therapeutic efficacy. Consequently, the question remains: Can targeting NF-&#922;B signaling enhance the sensitivity of RT in NSCLC Furthermore, studies have indicated that elevated levels of CXCR5 in NSCLC contribute to tumor growth. CXCR5 is situated upstream of the NF-&#922;B pathway. As a result, it becomes imperative and indispensable to develop strategies targeting the CXCL13\/CXCR5\/NF-&#922;B signaling axis to counteract NSCLC growth. Lenvatinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeted drug. It has been proven to inhibit VEGFR1-3, FGFR1-4 and PDGFR, inhibiting tumor growth. Lenvatinib has received clinical approval from the US FDA for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been shown to inhibit NF-&#922;B expression in HCC. However, the potential radiation-sensitizing mechanism of Lenvatinib in lung cancer remains unexplored. This study is dedicated to investigating the effects and molecular mechanisms of combining Lenvatinib with radiotherapy in NSCLC. Our results suggest that lenvatinib may enhance the sensitivity of NSCLC to RT. Furthermore, evidence from both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways (Caspase-3\/Caspase-8\/Caspase-9) and TUNEL experiments supports the idea that the combined treatment of lenvatinib with RT induces a more pronounced apoptotic response compared to individual treatments. Additionally, silencing CXCR5 in NSCLC also appears to enhance its responsiveness to RT. In our western blot (p-ATM, p-CHK2), flow cytometry (p-ATM), we showed that the combination of lenvatinib and RT may effective induce DNA damage. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> data demonstrates that the combination of Lenvatinib and RT exhibits superior tumor growth inhibition. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor tissue also revealed an upregulation of apoptosis-related proteins and the downregulation of CXCL13\/CXCR5\/NF-&#922;B related proteins. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Lenvatinib can serve as a radiosensitizer, enhancing the sensitivity of NSCLC patients to radiotherapy by targeting the CXCL13\/CXCR5\/NF-&#922;B signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Lenvatinib,Radiation therapy,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-L.

More effective therapies are needed as standard treatments, which include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are inefficient due to radio-chemo-resistance and relapse. The goal of this project is to investigate the efficacy of seco-duocarmycin SA (sDSA) as an anticancer drug, alone and the potential synergy of combining proton radiation and sDSA in human GBM cell lines. Proton therapy offers numerous advantages in treating cancers because of its superior dose distribution and biological effects. sDSA is an exceptionally potent agent that selectively alkylates DNA at the N3 position of adenine, making it of great interest as a therapeutic drug. We hypothesize that by pairing sDSA with proton radiation, a more dynamic effect will result, which will amplify their collective power, unleashing an enhanced cytotoxicity against human GBM cells. GBM cell lines (T98G and LN18) were exposed to graded doses and concentrations of protons and sDSA respectively in order to evaluate cellular changes in proliferation, survival, cell cycle, apoptosis\/necrosis induction, and DNA damage. Results show that proton radiation and sDSA when used alone induce a dose-dependent decrease of cell proliferation, an increase in foci formation, and an increase in G2\/M phase arrest in LN18 and T98G cells. The data also illustrates that the combination of proton radiation and sDSA synergistically enhances these effects. The utilization of proton radiation in conjunction with sDSA against GBM represents an innovative and previously unexplored approach. Currently, the cellular mechanisms of sDSA cytotoxicity are not well understood or studied, and even less is known regarding the effects when combined with proton radiation. This study serves as a vital cornerstone in unraveling the biological response of GBM cells when confronted with proton radiation and sDSA, paving the way for the future development of a more precise and potent combination therapy.<br \/>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Alkylating agents,Antitumor agents,Cytotoxicity,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for treating solid tumors, but its effectiveness is often limited by the poor infiltration of CAR-T cells into the tumor microenvironment. Thus, enhancing a robust infiltration of chimeric antigen receptor T cells into solid tumors is essential for an effective antitumor response and therapeutic success.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we investigated the combined effects of multiple doses of low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) and CAR T-cell therapy on tumor growth and survival using two models of NSG mice implanted with gastric carcinoma (GSU) or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (CAPAN-2) cells. The engineered CAR-T cells were designed to target guanyl cyclase-C (GCC) or mesothelin, respectively. Furthermore, our study employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a small cohort to investigate the impact of LD-RT and CAR-T cell therapy on tumor stiffness and plasticity.<br \/>Results: The synergistic effect of combining low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) with T-cell therapy resulted in enhanced tumor control and prolonged survival in mice with tumors, surpassing the outcomes observed with either monotherapy alone. This combined treatment holds promise for improving responses in patients with solid tumors by leveraging LD-RT to enhance the intratumoral infiltration of effector T cells. Our findings suggest that the nanomechanical signature may be a potential biomarker for LD-RT combined CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings substantially contribute to treating solid tumors using cell therapies, highlighting the potential for improved infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells following radiotherapy (RT), which can transform existing therapeutic strategies for solid tumors while minimizing toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,CAR T cells,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Standard of care includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) for locally advanced, unresectable disease. Despite radiotherapy being an effective and sometimes curative option for many cancer types, radio-resistance is common, and pre-clinical research in recent years has found that RT can initiate a more aggressive, pro-invasive phenotype in the remaining cells post treatment (1,2). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.There is accumulating evidence highlighting a role for the RhoGTPase family in mediating radioresistance and enhanced invasion (2, 3). Understanding their role in PDAC progression may aid the identification of novel chemotherapeutics that could be used alongside RT in the future. We present <i>in vitro <\/i>data that confirms the pro-migratory effect of RT and importantly indicates a significant increase in metastases formed in a clinically relevant model of PDAC (KPC Pdx1-Cre; Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>) after treatment using a small animal radiation research platform (<i>n=31, p&#60;0.0001<\/i>). In concurrence with previous literature, we found that PDAC cell motility was dependent on the RhoGTPase pathway, RhoA\/ROCK1 (p=0.004<\/i>). However, post-RT, this dependency was switched to an alternative pathway, CDC42\/Rac1\/MRCK, indicating a clear change in the balance of RhoGTPase signaling (p=0.002<\/i>). This switch was confirmed via high-throughput immunofluorescence analysis. To widen this investigation further, we performed an siRNA screen targeting all members of the RhoGTPase family. Preliminary results indicate signaling dependency on Rac2, Rac3 and CDC42 post-RT. Additionally, we have performed RNAseq to investigate pro-invasive gene signatures arising from the acute irradiation of pancreatic cancer cells. This was done at sufficient depth to identify splice variants, with differential transcript expression (DTE) analysis identifying 236 differentially expressed transcripts and the differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis identifying 28 transcripts and 23 genes. Initial functional enrichment analysis found gene signatures relating to cell migration and adhesion, which may be indicative of an invasive phenotype. In conclusion, we present in vitro <\/i>and in vivo <\/i>data suggesting RT may promote a more invasive phenotype in PDAC at least in part due to a switch in RhoGTPase signaling.<br \/>1.

Therefore, dMMR CRC are the best candidates for immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) compared to proficient DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) CRC. Early clinical trials revealed that only 30-55% metastatic dMMR CRC responded to ICI. Recent studies utilizing allograft models have demonstrated that tumor immune landscape can be primed with radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). Although early results have been quite promising, allograft models often fail to accurately predict efficacy for many reasons, but most often are due to a lack of heterogeneity.<br \/>Methods: To better understand how heterogenous MMR expression impacts tumor development and response to ICI alone or in combination with RPT, we developed a new mouse model that develops three tumor types: (1) homotypic dMMR tumors that express green fluorescent protein, (2) homotypic pMMR tumors that express red fluorescent protein, and (3) heterotypic tumors with a mixture of dMMR and pMMR cells. Surveillance bright field and fluorescent colonoscopies allow us to assess treatment response by measuring tumor size and proportion of dMMR and pMMR tumor cells in real-time. These outcomes are verified through <i>ex vivo<\/i> imaging and histological analysis.<br \/>Results: Tumor response to anti-PD-L1 ICI was dependent on MMR status. Homotypic dMMR tumors exhibited the strongest response: significantly smaller in treated mice than controls, exhibited areas of vascular congestion and increased CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells infiltration. Response of heterotypic MMR tumors varied depending on percentage of dMMR cells; tumors with a high percentage of dMMR cells remained small, whereas tumors with a low percentage of dMMR had an outgrowth of pMMR cells. Treated and untreated homotypic pMMR tumors were indistinguishable. To enhance the response of all three tumor types, mice were treated with dual ICI treatment, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, or RPT. Animals administered the tri-therapy (dual ICI + RPT) survived significantly longer with fewer tumors than animals treated with either dual ICI or RPT alone.<br \/>Conclusions: Our innovative mouse model allows for the highly detailed characterization of tumor response to therapies. Simplistic allograft models may not adequately account for the dynamic effects that neighboring cell death may have on radio-resistant cells, on tumor vascular perfusion and oxygenation, or on tumor immune infiltration and adaptive immune recognition of remaining cells. We begin to fill these critical gaps in knowledge and therefore the results from our studies will help guide the translation and integrated use of ICIs and RPTs in clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Tumor heterogeneity,Preclinical,Radioimmunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

RT-induced DNA lesions can be repaired by multiple mechanisms including homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and disruption of either of these pathways can enhance cytotoxicity. A key component of the NHEJ pathway is the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), and loss of kinase activity can significantly increase radiosensitivity. Herein we describe the results of our medicinal chemistry campaign to develop a potent and selective DNA-PKcs inhibitor, WNC0901. WNC0901 inhibits DNA-PKcs kinase activity in a cell free system with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.071 nM and demonstrated at least 30-fold higher sensitivity than other family members (ATM, ATR, mTOR, PI3K). WNC0901 has limited aldehyde oxidase (AO) liability with a T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> &#62;2000 min in liver cytosol and is stable for over 120 minutes in the presence and absence of an AO inhibitor. A preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis in wista han rat (IV=2mg\/kg, PO=20mg\/kg) demonstrated 116% apparent absolute oral bioavailability, 2.6 hour terminal half-life, 33.0 mL\/min\/kg clearance, and a 2.6% unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kpuu). WNC0901 also had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in beagle dog (IV=2mg\/kg, PO=20mg\/kg) with moderate clearance (8.5 mL\/min\/kg), high apparent absolute oral bioavailability (131%) with good exposure (AUC=36092 h*ng\/mL), moderate half-life (4.28 h), and low protein binding (74.3% fraction unbound). The volume of distribution was moderate in both species (Vss = 1.32 L\/kg in wistar han rat and 1.87 L\/kg in beagle dog). In cell culture, WNC0901 inhibited autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs in HT29 cells irradiated with 10 Gy with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 32.7 nM and robustly inhibited autophosphorylation in both U251 glioma and A549 lung cancer cell lines at 300 nM in combination with 5Gy. In a clonogenic assay, 5Gy irradiation (10% survival) combined with 100nM WNC0901 demonstrated modestly enhanced cell killing (1.5% survival), and maximal effects were seen at 300nM (0.04% survival, p&#60;0.01). Similar radiosensitizing effects with 300 nM WNC0901 were seen in the A549 cell line (0.2% survival with combination compared to 19% with 5Gy alone, p&#60;0.01).<br \/>In summary, WNC0901 inhibits DNA-PK kinase activity and provides potent radiosensitization in a GBM and lung cancer cell line. Future studies will assess the combination of WNC0901 and RT in GBM patient-derived xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Several treatment strategies are used including the FDA approved <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-vipivotide tetraxetan (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617) for the treatment of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, not all patients respond to treatment due to tumor intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, the combination of targeted radionuclide therapy with inhibitors against e.g. DNA damage response, cell cycle progression or cell survival pathways are investigated to enhance the radiosensitivity of the tumor. Current models to study radioresistance in prostate cancer are based on cancer cell lines or cell-line derived xenograft models, but these models do not account for the heterogenous and complex biology of the disease. To overcome this issue, we have developed a radioresistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) prostate cancer model (ST1273, XenoSTART), that is positive for PSMA. Resistance to radiation was initially established by sequential irradiation of the tumors with external beam radiation. Moreover, the model has proven to be resistant towards treatment with 30 MBq <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617. Utilizing this radioresistant model we are now able to investigate the treatment response of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617 in combination with different drug inhibitor classes to evaluate their potential radiosensitizing effect. The PARP inhibitor, Olaparib, was administered at 50 mg\/kg QDx48 alone or in combination with a single dose of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617 in radioresistant ST1273 tumor bearing NMRI nude mice. First results showed a prolonging treatment effect of Olaparib given in combination with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617 compared to <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617 alone. Tumor relapse was observed 29 days after treatment with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617 alone, whereas it was observed 49 days after combination treatment. Olaparib given alone did not influence tumor growth. To further investigate the mechanism of resistance we are currently investigating the radiosensitizing potential of additional compounds and evaluating the tumors by RNA- and whole-exome- sequencing. Altogether, we successfully established a PSMA positive prostate cancer model resistant to PSMA targeted radionuclide therapy. With this model we are able to investigate the radiosensitizing effect of different drug classes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,Radiation therapy,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Most advanced-stage NSCLC patients have brain metastases that render an abysmal prognosis. Standard-of-care radiation therapy for NSCLC brain metastasis includes stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) if the number of lesions is less than ten, otherwise whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is administered. Challenges in applying radiotherapy include overcoming radiation resistance and reducing significant associated co-morbidities. Cancer neuroscience is an evolving area, and the purpose of this study is to determine if activation of GABA(A) receptors intrinsic to NSCLC cells can improve radiation efficacy in primary NSCLC and its brain metastasis. We find that a GABA(A) receptor activator, AM-101, impairs the viability and clonogenicity of NSCLC primary and brain metastatic cells. Employing a human-relevant <i>ex vivo<\/i> &#8216;chip&#8217;, AM-101 is as efficacious as docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic used with radiotherapy for advanced-stage NSCLC. <i>In vivo<\/i>, AM-101 potentiates radiation, including conferring a significant survival benefit to mice bearing NSCLC intracranial tumors generated using a patient-derived metastatic line. GABA(A) receptor activation stimulates a selective-autophagic response via multimerization of GABA(A) Receptor-Associated Protein (GABARAP), stabilization of mitochondrial receptor Nix, utilization of ubiquitin-binding protein p62, and upregulation of Beclin-1. A high-affinity peptide disrupting Nix binding to GABARAP inhibits the cytotoxicity of AM-101. This supports a model of GABA(A) receptor activation driving a GABARAP-Nix multimerization axis that triggers autophagy. In NSCLC brain metastases patients, GABA(A) receptor activation may improve radiation efficacy and tumor control while allowing radiation dose de-intensification to reduce toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Lung cancer,Autophagy,GABA(A) receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

These biological adaptations include the activation of hypoxic survival pathways that play an important role in acquiring radioresistance which becomes most challenging with treatment regimens using high doses of radiation\/fraction (e.g., hypofractionated radiotherapy). Therefore, inhibiting key regulators within these pathways and thereby exploiting these survival mechanisms, gives rise to new potential drug targets for combined treatment modalities. This novel strategy investigated in our laboratory relies on the concept of biological cooperation: while ionizing radiation kills primarily well-oxygenated cells, such inhibitors of survival kinases will drive quiescent tumor cells under hypoxia and\/or nutrient deprivation either directly into cell death or into re-entry into a proliferative and thereby more ionizing radiation-sensitive state. One of the survival kinases we are investigating in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) is DYRK1B (dual-specificity tyrosine regulated kinase 1B). We demonstrated that the expression of DYRK1B was upregulated under serum-starvation and hypoxia, but not in response to IR. The small molecule DYRK1B inhibitor AZ191 and shRNA-mediated DYRK1B knockdown significantly reduced proliferative activity and clonogenicity of SW620 tumor cells alone and in combination with IR under serum-starved conditions, which correlated with increased ROS levels and DNA damage. Furthermore, AZ191 successfully targeted the hypoxic core of tumor spheroids while IR preferentially targeted normoxic cells in the rim of the spheroids. A combined treatment effect was also observed in patient-derived colorectal carcinoma organoids but not in healthy tissue organoids. This data shows that inhibition of DYRK1B in quiescent tumor cells could drive tumor cells on their own into crisis or into a more radiosensitive cell cycle phase and thus supports our strategy of biological cooperation. In the continuation of this project, we have performed a drug-screen with approx. 3&#8217;000 clinically relevant compounds in colorectal tumor cells lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in order to explore additional hypoxia-mediated survival pathways contributing to radioresistance. Thereby we aim to identify novel combined treatment modalities to overcome radiotherapy-induced hypoxia and hypoxia-related resistance mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ionizing radiation,Hypoxia,Combination therapy,Spheroids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The prerequisite for developing more effective interventions for these patients is that the molecular mechanisms leading to a radioresistant phenotype in these tumors are clear to researchers. Unfortunately, the radioresistant mechanisms remain elusive to date. We recently identified that a highly conserved and cancer-related microRNA, i.e. <i>miR-21-5p<\/i>, plays an important role in radioresistance of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We analyzed the RNA-sequencing data of 290 tissue samples from TCGA database, and found the expression of <i>miR-21-5p<\/i> was significantly upregulated in many OSCC samples (N=271) when comparing to adjacent normal tissues (N=19). The difference was further confirmed on our freshly collected OSCC tissues from patients in operation room. We performed RNA-sequencing analysis in 11 OSCC samples and their adjacent normal tissues. Among the 2106 differentially expressed genes between OSCC and normal control groups, we found that several important DNA repair genes (RAD50 double strand break repair protein gene, <i>RAD50<\/i>; DNA Polymerase Theta, <i>POLQ<\/i>;<i> <\/i>Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related<i>, ATR<\/i>) were significantly overexpressed in OSCC samples (P&#60;0.05), while positive correlations between <i>miR-21-5p<\/i> expression and DNA repair genes <i>RAD51<\/i> and <i>XRCC4<\/i> were identified in the OSCC cohort. Notably, <i>ATR<\/i> is an important DNA damage response gene, while <i>XRCC4<\/i>, <i>RAD51<\/i>, and <i>POLQ<\/i> are involved in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair through non-homologous end joining, homologous recombination, and microhomology-mediated end joining, respectively. OSCC cell lines were further recruited to study the relations of <i>miR-21-5p<\/i> with radiation-induced DSB repair. By analyzing kinetics of 53BP1 foci, a biomarker for detecting DSBs, we found that anti-<i>miR-21-5p<\/i> transfected cells showed more residual foci, indicating of unfinished repair of DSBs, at 5 hours and 18 hours post irradiation. The deficient DSB repair resulted from anti-<i>miR-21-5p<\/i> transfection were further confirmed by single cell gel electrophoresis with comet assay. Consistently, the same treatment resulted in fewer clonogenic survivors in colony formation assay, demonstrating increased radiosensitivity of OSCC cells when <i>miR-21-5p<\/i> was antagonized. This work provided novel insights about the mechanism of <i>miR-21-5p-<\/i>induced radioresistance in OSCC, which may give rise to novel therapeutic strategy for improved treatment of OSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common subtype, further stratifies into PAX3 or PAX7 and FOXO1<i> <\/i>fusion-negative (FN) or fusion-positive (FP) RMS. FP RMS is the higher risk subtype and is more aggressive, metastatic, and less responsive to treatment. Front-line treatments for RMS FP patients have had limited progress in the recent years and existing treatments such as radiotherapy lacks tumor cell selectivity, resulting in toxic side effects.<br \/>To address this, we conducted a high-throughput drug screen to identify radiosensitizers to enhance efficacy of RMS radiotherapy. Using three patient-derived FP RMS tumoroids, we screened a comprehensive drug library with and without radiation, comprising 528 drugs at varying stages of pre-clinical and clinical trials. A validation screen of the top 29 drugs was conducted on a larger cohort of samples including eight patient-derived FP RMS tumoroids and three non-cancer models. The screening revealed that drugs targeting the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-xL) exhibited both potent radiosensitization and cytotoxicity selectively for FP RMS. Notably, the sensitivity to BCL-xL inhibitors correlated with elevated <i>BCL2L1 <\/i>expression and PAX3<i> <\/i>fusion status. Additionally, drugs targeting polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and other cell cycle-related genes exhibited robust radioprotective effects across both RMS and non-cancer models.<br \/>Our findings propose the therapeutic potential of BCL-xL inhibition, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with radiotherapy. In parallel, we show the protective potential of PLK1 inhibition to mitigate radiation toxicity. In the long term, we aspire to integrate the identified radiosensitizing and radioprotecting compounds with existing treatment regiments for RMS, maximizing precision and efficacy in RMS radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,Rhabdomyosarcoma,High-throughput assay,Bcl-xL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

While several factors contribute to this disparity, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), is notably overexpressed in tumors originating in Black women compared to White women, which is associated with tumor progression and resistance to radiation therapy (RT). Caloric restriction (CR) is noted to reduce the expression of members of the IGF-1R pathway. We hypothesize that CR increases the efficacy of RT, in Black women, by downregulating the IGF-1R pathway to decrease tumor growth.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: To understand the feasibility of implementing CR in Black women with BrCa, patients received a CR diet during adjuvant breast RT on an IRB approved investigator-initiated clinical trial and pre- and post- measures were evaluated. BrCa cell lines originating from Black (MD-MBA-468 and MD-MBA-157) or White patients (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436) were exposed to RT in the presence and absence of CR medium, IGF-1 to upregulate the pathway, and PPP, an IGF-1R inhibitor to evaluate the role of dietary interventions and IGF-1R pathway modulation in altering the RT response. Finally, human BrCa tissue was collected and ex vivo explants were used to evaluate the role of diet to augment the RT response.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In the pilot clinical trial, 32 patients were enrolled, 50% of whom were Black (16B\/16W). Black patients had more adverse baseline physiologic parameters and corresponding higher insulin and systemic inflammation as measured by ESR, IFN&#947;, Il-1&#946;, and TNF&#945; at baseline. Adherence to CR was 87.3% for the Black patients who had an average weight loss of 7.33 lbs, and decreased insulin and cholesterol levels after CR+RT. In intro, in Black originating cells, cell viability experiments showed that CR+RT decreased cell viability by 53% &#38; 46% while RT alone reduced viability by 32 &#38; 41%. In White originating cells, CR+RT decreased cell viability by 52% and 53% while RT alone reduced viability by 42% and 26%. IGF-1R inhibition with PPP caused a more significant decrease in viability when given with RT than CR+RT did. The opposite effect was noted when IGF-1 was added to the cell lines and that increase was prevented by treatment with IGF-1+RT+CR. This was confirmed in vivo. Explants revealed CR helped decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis for all cancer patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Taken together, these data demonstrate that Black patients can adhere to dietary interventions during RT therapy for breast cancer which may help achieve better tumor control via downregulation of the IGF-1R pathway which is often notably upregulated in this population. This benefit is widely applicable with equivalent efficacy between patients of both races and all breast cancer subtypes. Future studies should investigate the role of downregulating IGF-1R via dietary interventions to narrow disparities in breast cancer outcomes in our black patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Radiosensitivity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Clonogenic survival assays were used to assess the radiosensitivity of TNBC murine cell lines to AURKB inhibition. In these assays, AURKB inhibitors were delivered at sub-IC50 concentrations 24 hours prior to RT, and radiation enhancement ratios (rERs) were calculated. Immunofluorescent microscopy using DAPI stain assessed micronuclei. Propidium iodide staining to assess aneuploidy was completed via flow cytometry. To assess the radiosensitizing effects of AURKB inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i>, the 4T1 syngeneic TNBC cell line was injected bilaterally into Balb\/c mice and treated with Barasertib and RT.

Mechanistically, combined AURKB inhibition and RT significantly increased micronuclei formation in 4T1 cells 24 hours after RT compared to vehicle control (p&#60;0.0001).

Furthermore, long-term hormone ablation has side effects, such as, impotency and osteoporosis. Addressing this gap, we introduce an innovative dual-frequency focused ultrasound (FUS) platform for non-ablative focal therapy, which induces protein unfolding, ER stress, and increases heat-shock protein expression along with translocation of endoplasmic reticular chaperone proteins (e.g., calreticulin) on the tumor cell surface, thereby sensitizing them for phagocytosis by dendritic cells for efficient antigen presentation and cross priming. We hypothesized that FUS-mediated acoustic immune priming can be combined with ablative therapies, such as, hormone ablation and\/or radiation therapy (RT) for induction of tumor-specific adaptive immune response and better tumor control than monotherapy in murine prostate cancer models. Utilizing murine prostate cancer cell lines, MyC-CaP and RM1, we explored the cellular responses to androgen deprivation, observing distinct sensitivities. Twenty-four hours after FUS treatment tumor cells experienced mechano-thermal stress response with 15-fold increase in Hspa1a expression. Transmission Electron Microscopy studies showed formation of myelin figures, nuclear membrane deformation, and lipid droplet formation. In vivo, the combination of FUS (220w\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> intensity for 3 sec at focal point) and RT (8-10 Gy daily x two fractions) markedly delayed tumor growth and achieved complete cure in 14-17% of animals. Through multicolor flow cytometry, we detected significant alterations in the immune microenvironment, including increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and reduced tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor bed. However, we also observed a compensatory rise in pro-tumor immune cells such as PMN-MDSCs and Tregs with significant suppression of eosinophils (p&#60;0.05). Interestingly, there was suppression of splenic PMN-MDSCs, Mo-MDSCs, and tumor draining lymph node macrophages, suggesting systemic immune modulation in peripheral lymphoid organs of FUS+RT-treated tumor-bearing animals. Our findings reveal that the combination therapy of FUS and RT improves tumor control in murine prostate cancer and significantly modulates the systemic and tumor immune microenvironment. This approach offers new avenues for immunotherapy, potentially transforming the treatment landscape for prostate cancer, typically resistant to conventional immunotherapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Ultrasound,Prostate cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

While radiation effectively eliminates cancer cells, the damage it causes to surrounding healthy lung tissue leads to an immune response that can impact treatment regimen and lead to long term fibrotic tissue formation. The mechanism of radiation pneumonitis and the inflammatory response in the lungs is poorly understood. However, it is known that the TRAIL pathway plays an important role in inflammatory and fibrotic response. Through our previous work, it was discovered that modulating the TRAIL pathway via pegylated recombinant long-acting TRAIL (TLY012) in both WT and TRAIL-\/- C57Bl\/6 could suppress radiation pneumonitis in mice that were exposed to 20 Gy of thoracic radiation with shielding of other organs as early two weeks post exposure. In addition to the TRAIL pathway, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) is a cytokine that is known to play a key role in fibrosis. Broad spectrum integrin inhibitor GLPG0187 is known to inhibit the activation of TGF-&#946; via binding to specific integrin receptors. In order to determine if the inhibition of TGF-&#946; could suppress radiation pneumonitis without stimulation of the TRAIL pathway, DR5 null mice were utilized for the experiment. Male DR5-\/- C57Bl\/6 mice received a single 20 Gy thoracic radiation dose with shielding of other organs and were treated with 100 mg\/kg of GLPG-0187 or control twice a week via IP injection with the first dose being administered 1 hour before radiation (n = 4\/treatment\/group). 13 days post-irradiation, lungs, sternal bone marrow, and peripheral serum were collected. Upon histological analysis, it was observed that there were thinner alveolar borders and lessened inflammation compared to the control mice. Mice were weighed every three days, and it was discovered that mice treated with GLPG-0187 maintained steady weight compared to the control group. Additional analysis including immunohistochemistry, cytokine profiling, and quantification needs to be conducted. As the TRAIL pathway could not be modulated in the DR5 null mice, these findings suggest that GLPG-0187 was able to suppress radiation pneumonitis via inhibition of TGF-&#946;. While some rescue from radiation pneumonitis was observed via GLPG0187, it was to a lesser extent compared to treatment of WT and TRAIL-\/- C57Bl\/6 mice with TLY012. Future directions include investigating the synergistic effects between TLY012 and GLPG0187 in suppressing radiation pneumonitis and decreasing fibrotic response to radiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TRAIL,TGF-&#946;,Radiation,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The fusion-positive (FP)-RMS variant expressing chimeric oncoproteins such as PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1 shows a dismal prognosis with 5-year survival of less than 30% compared to non-metastatic fusion-negative (FN)-RMS variant. In the last years, a lot of interest has focused on new targets identification to improve the radiotherapy (RT) efficacy. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) radio-sensitize different cancer cell types including RMS. Recently, we reported that MS-275, a Class I and IV HDACi, in combination with RT affected cell survival, reduced colony formation ability, increased DNA damage repair inhibition and reactive oxygen species formation in FP-RMS cells. However, despite promising preclinical studies , HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) achieved only modest success in human clinical trials for solid tumors, frequently showing several toxicities, probably because of the limited specificity of many HDACi. Thus, a major effort is being directed toward identification of HDACi which are selective for HDAC isoforms often uniquely implicated in the radioresistance of specific cancers. In order to identify the class I HDAC responsible of radioresistance in RMS we knocked-down HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 expression in combination with RT. Interestingly, we observed an increased radiosensitivity only in HDAC3-depleted FP-RMS cells. Thus, we focused on HDAC3 to understand the mechanisms by which it promotes radioresistance in RMS. We observed that HDAC3 is overexpressed in RMS patients and cell lines compared to the normal counterpart. Furthermore, RMS cells are strongly dependent by HDAC3 expression while slight dependency has been observed with other class I HDACs in DepMap portal. We demonstrated that HDAC3 depletion by CRISPR in combination with RT in FP-RMS cells increases apoptosis, reduces colony formation ability, cancer stem cells population and anchorage independent growth and reduces cell growth <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i>. Accordingly, HDAC3 depleted cells in combination with RT reduces levels and activation of key player of FP-RMS biology such as MYCN, ERK and AKT. Moreover, HDAC3 KD increases radiotherapy-induced DNA double strand break and impairs DNA repair mechanisms reducing levels and activation of both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factors such as ATM, RAD51 and DNA-PKcs. Thus, we developed a new potent and highly specific HDAC3 inhibitor (HDAC3i). The new HDAC3i is highly specific in targeting FP-RMS cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> while no effects have been observed in normal cells such as myoblasts and lung fibroblast. Moreover, the drug treatment in combination with radiotherapy phenotypically and molecularly recapitulated what observed in HDAC3 depleted cells.The study has been founded by Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC) to FM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,DNA damage response,Histone deacetylase,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.
