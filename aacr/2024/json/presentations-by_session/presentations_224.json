[{"Abstract":"Introduction: We developed a liquid biopsy assay based on <b><u>exo<\/u><\/b>somal and cell-free microR<b><u>N<\/u><\/b>A (exo- and cf-miRNA, respectively) for patients with chemotherapy-na&#239;ve, m<b><u>e<\/u><\/b>tastatic, unresectable, <b><u>RA<\/u><\/b>S and BRAF wild-type colorectal cancer (mCRC), to predict progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) before the commencement of first-line <b><u>t<\/u><\/b>reatment with <b><u>E<\/u><\/b>GFR inhibitors (EXONERATE).<br \/>Methods: Patients with mCRC were consecutively enrolled in two open-label, nationwide clinical trials and received first-line cetuximab or panitumumab. Cf- and exo-miRNA expression was quantified using RT-qPCR in plasma samples obtained before exposure to EGFR inhibitors. The prespecified primary endpoint was 12-month PFS, hierarchically tested in left-sided mCRC, right-sided mCRC, and the entire cohort. As secondary endpoints, the EXONERATE status was correlated with PFS and OS hazard ratios (HR).<br \/>Results: After excluding those with RAS\/BRAF mutations and unavailable samples, the complete analysis dataset comprised 120 patients (94 with left-sided and 26 with right-sided mCRC; 87 received cetuximab and 33 panitumumab). As expected, right-sided mCRC patients showed inferior PFS and OS outcomes (HR 1.80 [CI<sub>95% <\/sub>= 1.13 - 2.80] and 1.80 [CI<sub>95% <\/sub>= 1.00 - 3.27], respectively). Genome-wide small RNA sequencing on 20 patient samples identified 12 cf- and 14 exo-miRNA candidates, then narrowed to 8 and 9 based on best performance. We employed machine learning algorithms to develop two liquid biopsy assays, one based on cf- and the other on exo-miRNAs, predicting 12mPFS with AUC values of 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. These were then combined to establish the EXONERATE assay for left-sided mCRC (AUC = 0.89), successfully validated in right-sided mCRC patients (AUC= 0.84). Among left-sided mCRC patients, 35% were EXONERATE-high, exhibiting shorter median PFS (mPFS = 9.5 vs. 18.5 months, p&#60;.001) and a higher mortality rate (HR 0.21 [CI<sub>95% <\/sub>= 0.10 - 0.42]). In the right-sided mCRC cohort, the EXONERATE-high panel robustly identified patients with shorter mPFS (8.6 vs. 23.7 months, p=.0042) and predicted 12mPFS with high accuracy (sensitivity 100%, NPV 81%, PPV 100%). Although in univariate analysis both the EXONERATE panel and sidedness showed associations with PFS and OS, in multivariate analysis only the EXONERATE panel could fully account for the differences in PFS and OS (HR 0.22 and HR 0.19, respectively). Hence, we employed the EXONERATE panel agnostically of tumor sidedness and observed that EXONERATE-high patients demonstrated poorer survival outcomes in mPFS (8.9 vs. 19.6 months, HR 0.27 [CI<sub>95% <\/sub>= 0.17 - 0.41]) and mOS (22.6 vs. &#62;60 months, HR 0.18 [CI<sub>95% <\/sub>= 0.09 - 0.37]).<br \/>Conclusion: The EXONERATE panel robustly predicted PFS and OS outcomes in both right- and left-sided mCRC patients before receiving either EGFR inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Colorectal cancer,MicroRNA,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

In this exploratory biomarker analysis, we retrospectively evaluated the association of proteome signature, genetic mutations, and hematological indices with efficacy.<br \/>Methods: Serum proteomics data were generated via Olink<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Explore 3072 platform for 168 patients (training: 80; validation: 88). Genetic mutations were assessed by Med1CDx<sup>TM<\/sup> panel for 305 patients. Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were analyzed in all 585 patients. Clinical data cutoff date was June 13, 2022.<br \/>Results: From Olink data, we generated a 15-protein signature. Results in the validation cohort are shown in the table below. Patients with upper signature score derived higher PFS (7.89 vs 4.17 mo, HR 0.37) and OS (17.18 vs 9.74 mo, HR 0.27) benefit from adding serplulimab, than those with lower signature score (PFS: 4.40 vs 4.34 mo, HR 0.68; OS: 9.05 vs 9.22 mo, HR 0.76). Patients with mutations in RB1 or NOTCH pathway had better tumor responses to the treatment of serplulimab-chemo (ORR: 80% and 86%, respectively) when compared to patients without mutations in RB1 or NOTCH pathway (ORR: 58% and 68%). Patients with NLR &#8804;4.6, PLR &#8804;338.3, and LDH &#8804; upper limit of normal tended to have longer PFS and OS in both treatment groups; NLR and LDH were further proven to be independent prognostic biomarkers in multivariate regression (P = 0.002 and P &#60;0.001, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: We found a 15-protein signature showing predictive power for serplulimab-chemo treatment; RB1 or NOTCH pathway mutations were enriched in serplulimab-chemo responders; baseline NLR and LDH were independent prognostic biomarkers for ES-SCLC.

Despite widespread use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) across diverse solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the quest for a clinically informative biomarker for long-term benefit remains unmet. Here we investigate the potential utility of clinicopathological and spatial proteomic profiling of tumor specimens from NSCLC patients to identify predictive biomarkers of long-term benefit to ICB.<br \/>Methods: Forty-nine patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC who received ICB at Hospital del Mar, Barcelona between 2017-2021 were included. Long-term responders (LTR, n=21) were defined as patients achieving a maintained radiologic response for more than 2 years, and short-term responders (STR, n=28) as patients presenting disease progression within the first six months of ICB initiation. Clinicopathological information, incidence of immune related adverse (irAES) and PD-L1 tumor proportion score assessed by IHC was available for all of them. DSP GeoMx was performed in subset of patients (LTR n=14 and STR n=14), to assess 49 immune biomarkers. Pancytokeratin (panCK; epithelial), CD3, CD20 and SYTO 13 (nuclear) were utilized as morphology biomarkers. Regions of interest were placed in tissue areas containing tumor and segmented in Tumor (PanCK+) and tumor microenvironment (TME) (PanCK-) that was used on downstream analysis. Digital counts were normalized using the protein expression of housekeeper proteins. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models. A <i>P<\/i> value less than 0.05 was considered significant.<br \/>Results: Our analysis revealed specific characteristics of LTR patients compared with STR, namely LTR population was enriched for PD-L1 positive in tumors (p=0.005) and a higher incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (p=0.001). Within the Tumor compartment, LTR patients displayed significantly higher levels of IDO1, CD8, PD-L1, CD45, HLA-DR and STING, while STR patients exhibit higher levels of B7-H3, CD56 and OX40L (p&#60;0.05 for all proteins). Comparison analysis of the TME compartment between LTR and STR revealed augmented levels of IDO1, CD8, CD45, CD11c, CD27 and CD3 in LTR patients, and lower levels of B7H3 and OX40L compared with STR patients (p&#60;0.05 for all proteins).<br \/>Conclusions: Our comprehensive analysis of metastatic NSCLC patients treated with ICB has unveiled distinct clinicopathological and immunological features associated with long-term benefit of ICB, highlighting the presence of pre-existing antitumor immunity as a stronger predictor of long-term benefit. These findings offer insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for enhancing ICB outcomes in metastatic NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immuno-oncology,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Our group previously established four transcriptionally defined subtypes of SCLC, each with distinct cell surface targets (<i>Gay et al, Cancer Cell 2021).<\/i> Further, we identified SLFN11 (a putative DNA\/RNA helicase) as a candidate biomarker of sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, including topoisomerase inhibitors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2\/<i>ERBB2<\/i>) expression has been previously described in a subset of SCLCs and has been linked to poor prognosis. HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) (where the payload is a topoisomerase I inhibitor) have received FDA approval for various solid tumors, highlighting their therapeutic potential. Similarly, TROP2 (<i>TACSTD2<\/i>) ADC sacituzumab govitecan has shown promising clinical efficacy in a SCLC (TROPiCS-03 basket trial). However, it is unclear what the predictive biomarkers are to these ADCs in SCLC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Expression of <i>ERBB2 and TACSTD2<\/i> mRNA was analyzed using publicly available patient datasets. We also characterized surface expression of HER2 and TROP2 by flow cytometry in SCLC cell lines at baseline and after cisplatin\/etoposide treatment. We then assessed the cytotoxicity of T-Dxd and sacituzumab govitecan in a panel of SCLC cell lines representative of each SCLC subtype, as well as SLFN11 status.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Analyses of HER2\/<i>ERBB2<\/i> and TROP2\/<i>TACSTD2<\/i> in SCLC cell lines and patient datasets showed a range of <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression with enrichment in the non-neuroendocrine subtypes (SCLC-P and SCLC- I subtypes). We further validated HER2 and TROP2 surface levels by flow cytometry in a subset of SCLC cell lines. Intriguingly, we observed that surface expression of both HER2 and TROP2 increase after frontline chemotherapy cisplatin\/etoposide treatment. As expected, T-Dxd and sacituzumab govitecan exhibit cytotoxicity in a subset of SCLC cell lines. We found a strong correlation between the <i>in vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity (IC50) of sacituzumab govitecan with SLFN11 (rho= 0.74, p=0.015). Importantly, SLFN11 is bimodally distributed in SCLC and we found <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>TACSTD2<\/i> to be enriched in the SLFN11-high group of SCLC patients. We also found <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>TACSTD2<\/i> to be correlated with each other (rho = 0.53, p &#60;0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: In this study, we demonstrate that HER2\/<i>ERBB2<\/i> and TROP2\/<i>TACSTD2<\/i> are enriched in a subset of SCLC. FDA-approved ADCs, T-DXd and sacituzumab govitecan each have preclinical activity in SCLC with SLFN11 as a predictive biomarker of payload cytotoxicity. We also found HER2 and TROP2 target levels increase after frontline chemotherapy (cisplatin\/etoposide) in SCLC, which suggest their efficacy may be enhanced in relapsed SCLC where treatment options are extremely limited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Lung cancer: small cell,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSR) play critical roles in various biological processes, including inflammation, immune regulation, and cell death. In this study, we sought to investigate the predictive role of TNF-related genes in patients receiving ICI.<br \/>Methods: The RNA expression levels of 18 TNF-related genes were assessed in a pan-cancer cohort of 217 patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center. Using a reference population of 735 tumors and 35 histologies, transcript abundance was adjusted to internal housekeeping gene profiles and rated (0-100th percentile). The patients were clustered into two groups based on the 18 TNF-related genes expression using Ward&#8217;s hierarchical clustering. Associations between overall survival and previously demonstrated independent ICI predictive variables were assessed. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used and considered statistically significant when p-value&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.05.<br \/>Results: Four TNF-related genes (CD137, CD70, GITR, and TNFSF9) were associated with positive programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (PD-L1&#8805;1% immunohistochemistry TPS), while TNFSF18 was associated with negative PD-L1 expression (corrected p-value&#60;0.05). No gene was associated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H) (TMB&#8805;10 mutations\/Mb) (corrected p-value&#62;0.05). We clustered the patients based on their 18 TNF-related genes expression into two signature clusters, high (n=94) and low (n=123). Patients in the high expression signature cluster were more likely to have high PD-L1 compared to the low expression cluster (corrected p-value&#60;0.05). The high expression signature cluster was associated with better survival compared with the low expression cluster (HR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.05-2.13 (p=0.026)). When adjusting for TMB, MSI, PD-L1, TP53 and KRAS status, the TNF high expression signature cluster was still associated with better overall survival (HR=1.71, 95%CI:1.11-2.66 (p=0.016)). Other than the TNF high expression signature cluster group, only the presence of KRAS mutation was a predictor of a longer survival (HR=2.09, 95%CI:1.28-3.42 (p=0.003)).<br \/>Conclusion: A high TNF-related gene expression profile may serve as an independent predictor for longer overall survival for patients treated with ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

However, predicting response to NACT remains a challenge in everyday clinical practice. Increasing (pre)- and clinical evidence demonstrate the importance of cancer biomechanics in mediating therapy response. We and others have previously demonstrated that complex biomechanical alterations in cancer tissues, can be measured by the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) at the nanoscale level. Incorporating AFM measurements of clinical biopsies within standard of care is thus a promising avenue to leverage tissue mechanics as prognostic and predictive biomarker for solid cancers.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Fresh clinical biopsy samples from 545 breast cancer patients were measured using the AFM-based Automated and Reliable Tissue Diagnostics (ARTIDIS) investigational device - ART-1. Measurements were performed on baseline biopsies within routine clinical workflow in the Breast Clinic, University Hospital Basel. This cohort comprises 30 patients who received NACT including: anthracycline and\/or taxane based chemo (n=17), and anthracycline and\/or taxane with platinum chemo (n=13). Study endpoints were radiological complete response (rCR) prior and pathological complete response (pCR) after surgery. Multiparametric nnanomechanical signature data has been analyzed in an automated manner using the proprietary ARTIDISNET software platform.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: From the 30 patients who received NACT, 12 patients presented with rCR, 17 patients presented with rPR, and 1 patient presented with rNR. pCR has been achieved only in 9 patients. In this study, he ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature of response to NACT in breast cancer showed 100% negative predictive value (NPV) and 89% positive predictive value (PPV), with 93% of accuracy for patients receiving chemotherapy, independent of molecular subtype or treatment regimen. Sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 85% (AUC=0.91).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature can be seamlessly integrated within clinical settings to predict response to standard of care NACT in patients with breast cancer in a prospective manner. These results are currently being validated in a global, multicentre prospective study in breast cancer (ANGEL, NCT06085833), enrolling in total 2706 patients, with the aim to support implementation of the ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature into routine clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biopsies,Breast cancer,Predictive biomarkers,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of high metabolic activity in liver cancer and its impact on clinical outcomes and treatment responses remains limited. We aimed to elucidate the metabolic features of liver cancer associated with clinical outcomes, particularly overall survival and responsiveness to sorafenib treatment.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing cross-species comparisons of genomic data, we integrated gene expression profiles from liver tissues in metabolically challenged mice and from patients with cirrhosis and liver cancer. To categorize patients, we developed a genomic predictor and applied it to gene expression data from a cirrhosis cohort (n=216) and large liver cancer cohorts (n=1390). Comprehensive statistical and informatics analyses were conducted to evaluate clinical significance, including overall survival and responses to standard treatments. Moreover, we integrated genomic data derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models into our analytical framework.<br \/>Results: Our integrated data analysis unveiled three distinct metabolic subtypes of tissues: high, moderate, and low metabolic subtypes. In the cirrhosis cohort, the high metabolic subtype was significantly associated with early liver cancer development. Among liver cancer cohorts, the high metabolic subtype exhibited characteristics such as poor survival, heightened hepatic stem cell features, increased genomic instability, and elevated expression of AFP, KRT19, EPCAM, and SALL4. Notably, when liver cancer patients undergoing systemic sorafenib treatment were stratified using our genomic predictor, those with low and moderate metabolic activity derived significant benefits from sorafenib therapy. Conversely, the high metabolic subtype displayed substantial resistance to sorafenib, suggesting that metabolic activity may dictate the response of liver cancer cells to sorafenib treatment. Gene network analysis of the metabolic expression signature identified multiple signaling pathways that potentially contribute to sorafenib resistance in liver cancer cells. Our analysis predicted the activation of pathways such as the TGF-&#946; pathway (TGFB1), consistent with previous findings of TGF-&#946; pathway activation in highly metabolic cancer cells. Additionally, our analysis identified YAP1, HIF1A, and MAPK pathways as activated pathways in sorafenib-resistant liver cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: This study identifies clinically and metabolically distinct subtypes of liver cancer, biomarkers associated with these subtypes, and mechanisms underlying metabolic-mediated resistance of liver cancer cells to sorafenib. Furthermore, the metabolic subtypes observed in PDX models provide valuable tools for selecting appropriate preclinical models for future research endeavors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Liver cancer,Sorafenib,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Although predictive biomarkers can guide treatment decisions, response prediction for chemo- and immunotherapy is still a challenge. Recent studies showed the potential of functional testing to assess patient sensitivity to drugs in various cancers, but NSCLC is lacking. This study reports the feasibility of ex vivo 3D micro lung tumor testing with native tumor microenvironment (TME) to enable treatment sensitivity profiling for all drug classes in parallel.<br \/>Methods: Fresh NSCLC tumor tissue was collected from pleural fluid stage IVa\/b (N=24) or resected primary tumor for stage I-III disease (N=11). Tumor clusters were isolated and exposed to drugs, while preserving the TME. Thirteen therapies were included, including cisplatin, pembrolizumab, osimertinib, and positive control for immune sensitivity (SEA). Morphological features were extracted from high-throughput 3D imaging data. Chemo- and targeted therapy sensitivity was based on AUC comparison of fitted dose-response curves. Immunotherapy sensitivity was classified on percentage and statistical significance of tumor killing, immune cell proliferation and cytokine profiling.<br \/>Results: The overall assay success rate for solid samples was 64% (7\/11), with 100% (4\/4) success after protocol optimization. For pleural fluids, the overall success rate was 33% (8\/24), caused by many samples arriving without tumor content (13\/24, 54%). Excluding these samples, a technical success rate of 73% (8\/11) was obtained. The assay was robust and reproducible (mean Z&#8217; = 0.38, CV = 16.1%). Results were delivered in two weeks and on average, eight treatments were tested in parallel per sample.<br \/>Patient-specific response profiles were observed for chemo-, targeted and immunotherapy. General immunotherapy sensitivity (SEA) was measured in 50% (6\/12) of the tissues. Distinct responses were observed for the different immunotherapies: 33% (4\/12), 17% (2\/12) and 8% (1\/12) of the patients responded to pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and\/or ipilimumab, respectively. Strong response to osimertinib was observed in a patient with EGFR exon 19 mutation (AUC = 0.26) versus resistance in a WT patient (AUC=0.92).<br \/>Conclusion: Ex vivo 3D micro tumor testing using liquid and solid tissues is feasible for NSCLC patients with resected primary tumor or pleuritis carcinomatosa. Distinct patient sensitivity profiles for chemo-, targeted and immunotherapies were measured. A preliminary correlation of targeted therapy response with mutation status was found.<br \/>Discussion: The ex vivo 3D micro tumor testing platform is proven predictive for platinum-based therapy. The current study established the methods to accurately measure ex vivo NSCLC responses to all drug classes to correlate with clinical measures and further validate the platform for guiding treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,Ex vivo,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

Identifying circulating immune populations as biomarkers could reveal crucial insights into the mechanisms driving treatment success.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b>Using unbiased single-cell profiling (with cytometry by Time-Of-Flight, CyTOF), we characterized the systemic immune compartments of over 250 peripheral blood mononuclear samples from 89 patients with advanced melanoma before and during combination therapy. We evaluated the association between circulating immune populations and clinical outcome using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests, and investigated the prognostic values of these features using survival analysis. Additionally, we assessed treatment-induced immunological effects, providing insights into the dynamic changes within the immune system during therapy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b>We characterized circulating T cells, NK cells, B cells, and monocytes from peripheral blood. Following combination therapy, there was a shift from na&#239;ve and central memory T cells to effector populations in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compartments. There was also a broad activation observed in both adaptive and innate populations, characterized by an elevation of multiple co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules. Lower CD8+ NK cell populations prior to combination therapy were predictive of durable clinical benefit (DCB). Pre-treatment measurements of Tregs were not predictive of outcome, but higher Tregs one month after starting therapy, as well as increases of Tregs from pre to post treatment, predicted better progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Starting from early on treatment, higher &#8220;exhausted-like&#8221; CD8+ T cells, characterized by positive expression of at least two co-inhibitory markers, is associated with resistance.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b>aCTLA-4 and aPD-1 combination therapy led to a longitudinal shift from na&#239;ve and central memory to effector phenotypes in T cells, along with a broad activation in both adaptive and innate populations. Within innate immune compartment, favorable clinical outcome was associated with lower CD8+ NK cells, capable of regulating proliferation and activation of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, one month after the start of the therapy, the increase in Tregs and a decrease in 'exhausted-like' CD8+ T populations are associated with a better response. Collectively, these analyses suggest potential treatment-specific correlates of efficacy and may enable biomarker-selected patient populations in future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Cancer immunotherapy,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

In this phase II clinical trial of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy, potential therapy-related biomarkers in tumor samples, and changes in the tumor microenvironment during treatment were analyzed, and a predictive model for efficacy was developed.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This was a prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase II trial. Patients with G\/GEJ adenocarcinomas (stage cT3-4aN+M0) were treated with PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab in combination with oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (XELOX) as neoadjuvant treatment for 2 or 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was the major pathological response (MPR). The secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR) rate, R0 resection rate, and safety.

Recent studies have elucidated a strong relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using single-cell multi-omics technology. In this study, we aim to develop predictive models for both objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) using TIME features with machine learning in advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: A total of 210 patients with advanced NSCLC who received anti-PD-1\/PDL-1 therapy at Shanghai Chest Hospital from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2023 were included in this study. Among them, 110 cases who received pembrolizumab were randomly split into training set and validation set with a 2:1 ratio. The remaining patients were designated as independent validation cohort. Five multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) panels were developed based on literature review and in-house dataset mining. mIHC tests were performed using baseline tumor samples. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by ORR and PFS (RECIST v1.1). ORR and PFS models were developed using machine learning methods in training set with 5-fold cross-validation and further validated in validation set and independent validation cohort.<br \/>Results: After data cleaning, 68 cases in training set and 34 cases in validation set were further analyzed. In terms of single immune- or spatial- based biomarker, positive rate of PD1+ cells in stroma and spatial relationship of PD1+\/PDL1+ cell pairs exhibited the highest correlation with ORR. In addition, positive rate of PDL1+ tumor cells and nearest distance between FOXP3+ cells and tumor cells were highly correlated with PFS. Our ORR model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in the training set and 0.82 in the validation set. When applying optimal cutoff in our PFS model to stratify patients into low- and high- risk groups, low-risk group showed prolonged PFS in both training set (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001; HR: 0.25, 95% CI [0.13 - 0.51]) and validation set (<i>p<\/i> = 0.00046; HR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.09 - 0.55]). Moreover, our ORR model outperformed PDL1 IHC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.60; DeLong&#8217;s test <i>p<\/i> = 0.005) in these 102 patients. Independent validation of the models is still awaited.<br \/>Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we developed and validated ORR and PFS predictive models for first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients based on mIHC technology. Our models displayed superior diagnostic performance compared to PDL1 IHC results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,NSCLC,Spatial TIME,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

The 5-year survival rate is only 12.5%. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data has shown about 51% of PAAD patients didn&#8217;t achieve complete response after first course of treatment (CRAFCT); this study is to use TCGA data to develop survival-treatment associated gene signature to screen the patients, and provide novel therapeutic strategies to customize patient treatment. <b>Methods:<\/b> RNAseq data of 177 PAAD patients and their clinical data were downloaded from TCGA data portal and processed. The dataset was randomly split into training and testing data. RNAseq data analysis and survival analyses were performed on the training data to identify the survival-treatment associated genes, and a survival-treatment gene signature was derived and independently tested on the test data using signature score by cutoff, logistic regression, and random forest. Furthermore, the signature was validated by an independent dataset of 96 cases. <b>Results:<\/b> Among the 177 patients, 137 patients had the information of CRAFCT, and 122 patients had specific treatment information. Among those 122 patients, 99% received chemotherapy, 36% received radiation therapy. About half of the PAAD patients (51%) didn&#8217;t achieve CRAFCT. RNAseq data analysis identified 304 significantly expressed genes associated with the status of complete response Yes vs No, and survival analyses further selected 55 genes associated with both treatment and survival as a signature. This signature, using z-scaled scores and the cut-off of 0.3, was applied to the 99 patients of training data; the accuracy is 0.66, and the patients predicted to be Yes had a significantly better (p=0.005, HR=0.42) overall survival than those predicted No. To further test the signature, we applied it to the test data of 78 patients; the random forest model showed patients screened to be Yes had a significantly better (p=0.016, HR=0.43) overall survival than those screened No. The signature (using 40 of the 55 genes) was applied to an independent dataset of 96 cases to significantly screen the patients to be Yes vs No (resistance to treatment) with p=0.04 and HR=0.57, showing the 55-gene signature is valid and robust. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> A 55 survival-treatment associated gene signature was developed and validated robustly, and can potentially be applied as a novel strategy to screen patients for treatment response\/resistance. These 55 genes could also be targeted to develop new drugs for those difficult to treat PAAD patients. <b>Disclaimer:<\/b> The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or policies of USUHS, HJF, the DoD or the Departments of the Army, Navy or Air Force.

Hence, we developed a novel and solely Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) based histopathologic prognostic biomarker, called SARIFA (Stroma AReactive Invasion Front Areas, i.e., direct contact between tumor cells and fat cells).<br \/>Materials\/Methods: Based on a previous study, in which we could show that gene-expression based computational drug response prediction (<i>oncoPredict<\/i>) indicates a SARIFA-dependent differential drug sensitivity, we investigated whether SARIFA-status can predict which CRC patients might benefit from adjuvant therapy. SARIFA-status was established for 1,727 CRC patients from the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study. Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis was performed (median follow-up: 4.79 years, with 1,463 deaths being observed in the first 10 years of follow-up [933, 63.8%, were CRC-related]). Only stages II to IV were included for further analysis regarding differential treatment response (n = 1,384).<br \/>Results: In Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis including patient age, sex, tumor location, pTNM stage, grade of differentiation, and mismatch repair status, SARIFA-positive CRC patients (n=496) benefitted significantly from adjuvant therapy (HR<sub>CRC-specific<\/sub> 0.59; 95% CI 0.44-0.78) compared to SARIFA-positive patients treated with surgery alone, which was not significant for SARIFA-negative CRC patients (HR<sub>CRC-specific<\/sub> 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.15). Regarding overall survival (OS), adjuvant therapy led to better OS outcomes regardless of SARIFA-status (HR<sub>overall <\/sub><sub>all patients <\/sub> 0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.87).<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that SARIFA-positivity predicts a CRC-specific survival benefit from adjuvant therapy. As SARIFA-positivity is closely linked to an upregulation of lipid metabolism and an altered immune response, further studies are warranted to explore the potential benefit of not only conventional chemotherapy but also immunotherapy, targeted therapy as well novel drugs targeting lipid-metabolism. As SARIFA-status can be assessed fast and easily on for every cancer patient available H&#38;E slides, SARIFA-status could serve as an ideal biomarker for a more detailed patient stratification in prospective clinical trials, and should be implemented into clinical routine if further validated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,Carcinoma: adenocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Mechanistically, GRB2 binds and inhibits RAD51 ATPase activity to stabilize RAD51 on stalled replication forks. In GRB2-depleted cells, PARP inhibitor (PARPi) treatment releases DNA fragments from stalled forks into the cytoplasm that activate the cGAS-STING pathway to trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover in a syngeneic mouse metastatic ovarian cancer model, GRB2 depletion in the context of PARPi treatment reduced tumor burden and enabled high survival consistent with immune suppression of cancer growth.

Pathologic diagnoses were independently confirmed. Analysis was performed using the Seurat package in R Studio. Immunostaining validation was performed on a separately banked cohort. Bulk RNA sequencing data and clinical data were extracted and analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.

To explore this, we developed the academic ARIANES phase 2 basket trial, which evaluated the PARPi rucaparib (R) and the anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab (A) in selected patients (pts). We performed single-cell RNA + T cell receptor sequencing (scRNA+TCR-seq) on 3 sequential tumor biopsies in a pts subset.<br \/>Methods: ARIANES comprised 4 molecularly-selected DNA damage response deficient (DDRd), 3 platinum-sensitive, and 2 unselected cohorts of pts with non-small cell lung (NSCLC), prostate (CRPC), and other non-breast non-ovarian cancers. R was administered for 3 weeks, followed by R+A. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks per cohort. scRNA+TCR-seq was performed on fresh biopsies collected at baseline, on R, and on R + A in the same lesion, with concomitant plasma collection. We tracked the evolution over time of tumor and microenvironment cells, differentially expressed genes and signatures within each cell population, and TCR clonal dynamics.<br \/>Results: ARIANES enrolled 130 pts, including 27 DDRd CRPC and 3 DDRd NSCLC pts, on which we focus here. Best ORR by RECIST v1.1 was 22% (6\/27) in CRPC pts, and mPFS: 7.9 months (95% CI 4 - 11.1) at data cut-off. ORR was 0% in NSCLC pts. We successfully profiled 3 sequential fresh biopsies in 2 <i>BRCA2<\/i>-mutant CRPC, 1 <i>ATM<\/i>-mutant, and 1 <i>RAD54L<\/i>-mutant NSCLC pts. Tumor, T and B lymphoid, myeloid, plasma, dendritic, NK, endothelial, and stromal cells were identified in all samples. Differential expression testing unveiled <i>PARP1<\/i> upregulation in tumor cells on R. One CRPC pt with prolonged partial response displayed activation of innate immune sensing pathways (including cGAS-STING and IFN signaling) in tumor and immune cells, as well as JAK\/STAT and <i>CCL5<\/i>, all increasing gradually on R and R + A; scTCR-seq revealed the expansion of specific T cell clonotypes on R + A. One <i>ATM<\/i>-mutant NSCLC pt with 6-month stable disease displayed increased cGAS\/STING, JAK\/STAT and <i>CCL5<\/i> activation on R in NK cells only, and no TCR expansion. None of the above was observed in the 2 pts who progressed. Complete clinical and translational study results will be presented at the congress.<br \/>Conclusion: Sequential scRNA+TCR-seq enables the dynamic assessment of tumor and immune cells on therapy. Our data confirms the potential of R to activate innate immune pathways in pt tumors, and R + A to induce T cell activation and clonal expansion. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing a longitudinal single-cell resolution analysis of the clonal evolution of tumor and immune cells in pts on PARPi + anti-PD-L1. We identify potential biological correlates of therapy response, including the activation of innate immune pathways and TCR expansion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,PARP inhibitors,Anti-PD-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined as the outgrowth of a single clone driven by acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in the absence of hematological abnormalities. Previous studies have shown the association of CH with aging and a higher risk of developing secondary hematologic malignancies in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy agents. It is therefore of great interest to study CH incidence prior to and post chemotherapy exposure and its association with the evolution of hematologic malignancies. We aimed to characterize CHIP variants of a highly selected group of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).<br \/>Methods: Comprehensive ultra-high-depth whole exome sequencing, employing unique molecular barcode technologies, was performed using plasma-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and matched white blood cells (WBC) DNA and tumor DNA from pre-NACT (n=10) and post-NACT (n=10) samples of patients with HGSC. CHIP variants were defined as heterozygous variants found in both the WBC and cfDNA samples from the same patients with variant allele frequency less than 5% in the WBC and higher than 0.5% in cfDNA samples.<br \/>Results: Our analysis identified 93,088 variants, impacting 13,780 genes. Among them, 463 variants were already known and published, and 5,548 variants were common to the COSMIC genes signature. The number of CHIP variants significantly decreased after chemotherapy (p = 0.004). We then focused on CHIP variants enriched after chemotherapy and identified 77 that showed higher VAF in post-NACT cfDNA samples, which may be associated with the development of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia\/myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AML\/MDS). Among them, interestingly, we found a missense mutation with protein change in <i>CDK12<\/i> (chr17_39492765_G_T). We noticed that 38% of the CHIP variants found in cfDNA samples, were also found in matched tumor samples. Among these, another <i>CDK12<\/i> missense mutation (chr17_39492768_A_T) showed higher VAF in post-NACT tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our innovative approach detected a higher number of CHIP variants than currently characterized. Analysis of cfDNA from HGSC patients consistently demonstrated a reduction in CHIP mutations post-NACT. The subset of variants with increased VAF post-NACT may be associated with therapy-related t-AML\/MDS. The detection of cfDNA CHIP variants in matched tumors highlights the potential predictive role of CHIP in t-AML\/MDS development, emphasizing its consideration in therapeutic protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Circulating tumor DNA,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Based on the results of FRESCO-2, F was FDA-approved for adults with previously treated mCRC, irrespective of biomarker status. In mCRC, CEA levels and imaging are routinely used to monitor response to systemic therapy. We investigated early CEA changes during treatment in FRESCO-2 and possible relationships with efficacy.<br \/>Methods: Pts with abnormal baseline (BL) CEA were included based on local lab reference ranges. Serum CEA levels were measured at BL and Day 1 (D1) of each 28-day cycle (C) except C1. Changes in CEA levels were analyzed at C2D1 and C3D1. CEA response was defined as &#8805;50% decrease from BL, and CEA progression was defined as &#8805;100% increase from BL. Tumor evaluation was performed by CT or MRI scan every 2 cycles. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method; hazard ratio (HR) was estimated via Cox proportional hazards model; p-value was generated from log rank test.<br \/>Results: Overall, 88.3% (407\/461) vs 90.4% (208\/230) of pts had abnormal BL CEA in F vs P arms; median BL CEA values were similar between treatment arms (Table). At C3D1, the proportion of pts who had a CEA response was significantly higher with F vs P (35.5% vs 3.8%, <i>P<\/i> &#60;0.001) and the proportion who had CEA progression was significantly lower (5.7% vs 47.2%, <i>P<\/i> &#60;0.001). Pts in the F arm with CEA response at C3D1 had improved OS and PFS vs pts without CEA response and pts with CEA progression (Table). These results were consistent for pts who had an early CEA response at C2D1 (Table).<br \/>Conclusion: CEA response at C2D1 and C3D1 could be considered an early predictor for improved OS and PFS. Pts with CEA response seem to benefit from F + BSC compared with pts without response or with CEA progression.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B403899D-B305-4308-A20B-2CB6154F47B6}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b>Table.

Multiple B-cell depleting therapies (e.g., BTK inhibitors, antibodies or CAR-Ts) are currently in active clinical trial investigation. Following therapeutic elimination of pathogenic B-cells, it is critical to monitor the productive regeneration of fully functional B-cells as they mediate innate and adaptive immune responses. To this end, we developed a multiparametric flow cytometry assay for exquisite monitoring of early stages of B cell development, maturation, and antibody production to correlate it with treatment outcomes and determine if continuous depletion of B-cells is necessary to maintain clinical benefits for patients.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Study Design<\/b> We designed a high throughput 12-parameter flow cytometry panel incorporating primary differentiation markers namely, CD45, CD3, CD38, CD10, CD27, CD19, CD20, IgD, Lambda &#38; Kappa Light Chains required for identification of different developmental stages of B-cells in peripheral blood using an in vitro diagnostic grade flow cytometry system (BD FACSLyric).

Although ramucirumab plus paclitaxel therapy is the standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer, biomarkers that can help predict therapeutic response are still lacking. This longitudinal study aimed to establish a liquid-biopsy assay that can predict response to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer.<br \/>Experimental Design: A prospective observational multicenter study (named the IVY study) enrolled 115 patients who received ramucirumab plus paclitaxel treatment. We collected serum specimens prior to the initiation of the treatment regimen. Patients were divided into responders and non-responders according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). We performed small RNA-sequencing (sRNA-Seq) in a subset of 28 patients with and without response to identify exosomal microRNA-based biomarkers that allowed risk stratification and response prediction in patients with advanced gastric cancer.<br \/>Results: The sRNA-Seq analysis and rigorous bioinformatic approaches using machine-learning algorithms allowed us to identify a panel of 10 exosomal microRNAs that robustly predicted resistance to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel treatment (AUC: 0.83). The panel of exosomal miRNAs was also shown to have a robust prognostic value for predicting survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients treated with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that patients classified as high risk on the panel of exosomal miRNAs independent poor prognostic factor (OS: HR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.56-4.81, P &#60; 0.01, RFS: HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.16-2.92, P &#60; 0.01). Following logistic regression and backward elimination, we trained a clinically feasible 5 exosomal miRNA signature by combining it with the Body Mass Index data, an independent clinical predictor (AUC: 0.84). We subsequently successfully validated the performance of this signature in the prospective clinical trial cohort (AUC: 0.87). Finally, we established a prognostic risk nomogram based on the circulating exosomal miRNA signature for a non-invasive and personalized pre-therapeutic selection approach.<br \/>Conclusions: We have developed a novel liquid biopsy-based assay that allows robust prediction of response to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel treatment in gastric cancer patients, and our assay provides a framework for a personalized medicine approach that can provide risk-based management and treatment for each patient prior to the initiation of therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Cancer therapy,Chemotherapy response,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Furthermore, investigations into the relationship between GMB and melanoma outcomes in the adjuvant setting are notably absent. This highlights the pressing need for a comprehensive, large-scale study spanning diverse geographic locations within a well-controlled clinical trial environment.<b> <\/b>In this study, we conducted shotgun sequencing on pre-treatment stool samples collected from 674 melanoma patients participating in an international, randomized, double-blind, phase III adjuvant trial evaluating clinical outcomes following adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab. Our recruitment encompassed three continents and five geographically distinct regions. Given the significant influence of geographic region on GMB composition, we employed three analytical approaches: (a) region-specific analyses, (b) combined meta-analyses across regions, and (c) sub-set paired analyses involving subjects closely matched for overall GMB. Additionally, we assessed GMB stability by examining samples collected serially prior to therapy and at weeks 7 and 29 of ICB treatment.<b> <\/b>Through region-specific and meta-analyses, we identified ten pre-treatment gut bacterial markers, including Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Firmicutes, which exhibited associations with melanoma recurrence in the adjuvant setting. The predictive capacity of these microbial markers was directly proportion to GMB similarity (Spearman correlation = 0.86, p&#60;0.001 for AUC vs. beta-diversity). Notably, for closely matched patients in terms of their GMB composition, the prediction of recurrence using the recurrence-associated markers, in conjunction with clinical characteristics, yielded an AUC of 0.917 (95% CI: 0.825-1.00). Furthermore, GMB remained largely stable across serial samples collected before and after treatment (PERMANOVA R2 = 0.867, p-val&#60;0.001, at baseline, week 7, and week 29). This study underscores the remarkable stability of GMB during adjuvant ICB therapy for melanoma and identifies specific bacterial biomarkers that hold promise for predicting melanoma recurrence within the adjuvant treatment setting.

An accurate evaluation of treatment response is critical before surgery. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and evaluate the use of non-invasive and clinical assessments to predict pathological response to NICT prior to surgery in these patients.<br \/>Methods: A total of 71 ESCC patients who received NICT between March 2020 and February 2022 were recruited in this study. Clinicopathological characteristics and PET\/CT assessment before and after NICT were evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prospectively collected for genomic and T cell receptor (TCR) profiling using targeted next-generation sequencing and multiplex PCR, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed to identify features associated with pathological complete response (pCR) of primary tumor. Optimal predictive features were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Subsequently, a prediction model was established using logistic regression, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and internal validation.<br \/>Results: Univariate analyses revealed significant associations between pCR and post-NICT features, including ctDNA, PET\/CT parameters, and TCR clonality and diversity. Optimal predictive features were identified as post-NICT SUVmax, ctDNA positivity, and TCR clonotype clonality, and their area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.784 (95%CI: 0.644-0.924), 0.739 (95%CI: 0.664-0.813), and 0.682 (95%CI: 0.535-0.829), respectively. The final prediction model integrating these three features achieved an AUC of 0.918 (95%CI: 0.849-0.986), an accuracy of 0.768 (95%CI: 0.661-0.875), a sensitivity of 1.000 (95%CI: 1.000-1.000), and a specificity of 0.705 (95%CI: 0.568-0.841), indicating excellent predictive performance.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of post-therapy ctDNA status, TCR clonality, and PET\/CT assessments showed robust predictive power for assessing pathological response to NICT in ESCC, suggesting the potential to inform clinical decision-making for these patients. Future large-scale studies are warranted to strengthen and verify the findings from our study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,ctDNA,Predictive biomarkers,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Weixiong Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zengli Fang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoyan Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Hui Luo<sup>2<\/sup>, Shuishen Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenguo Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenxuan Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Qiuxiang Ou<sup>3<\/sup>, Lingling Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Haimeng Tang<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Sai-Ching  J.

PEVOsq (NCT04357873) was an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, basket phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab (P) and the vorinostat (V) HDAC inhibitor in 112 patients (pts) with recurrent and\/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, head and neck, anus, vulva\/vagina, penis, and lung. Results showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 25%, the highest being in anal (31%) and cervical (39%) (ASCO #397612). We report here early biomarkers of response and progression to P+V.<br \/><b>Patients and Methods:&nbsp;<\/b> Pts had to undergo a tumor biopsy at baseline, and optional biopsies on-treatment (after cycle 2), and at progression for translational analyses. PD-L1 expression (n=102), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes quantification (n=39), HPV typing (n=111), WES (n=83), RNAseq (n=82) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantitative analysis of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) (n=44) were performed on baseline samples.SNVs, CNVs, TMB, MSI status (by MSI sensor), aneuploidy score (AS), mutational signatures, immune signatures, and histone modifications were correlated with response and progression.<br \/><b>Results:&nbsp;<\/b>Sixty-six pts were HPV+ (59%). Most frequently altered genes were <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (30%), <i>TP53 <\/i>(30%), <i>KMT2D\/C<\/i> (18 and 17%), and <i>FGF3\/4<\/i> (17%). MSI was detected in 4 pts (5%), and TMB-high (&#62;10mut\/Mb) in 13 pts (16%). High AS (&#62;10) was detected in 34 pts (40%), and was significantly associated with HPV- status (p=0.03). TMB high and MSI were associated with MMR mutational signatures (p&#60;0.01). TMB high was also associated with APOBEC (p=0.02) and DNA polymerase (POL) signatures (p &#60;0.01). Biomarkers associated with improved overall survival (OS) included HPV positivity (7.8 months versus 17.4 months, p&#60;0.01), high TMB (not reached versus 10.3 months, p=0.01), and high PD-L1 CPS score (13.2 months versus 7.0 months, p=0.06).Deconvolution of immune cell infiltration showed an expected trend for increased CD8 and decreased neutrophil infiltration in non progressor pts.Interestingly, LC-MS histone PTMs profiling showed a significant decrease in H4K5K8K12K16-4ac (p=0.05) and increase in H3K27me2K36me1 in non progressor pts (p=0.03). At the transcriptomic level, although not statistically significant, we observed modulation in the expression of genes associated with H3K36me1 (KDM2A, SETD3, SMYD2), and H3K27me3 (KDM6A) regulation, as well as HDAC genes.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> HPV+ status was associated with improved OS, together with a high TMB and PD-L1 expression. CD8, macrophages and neutrophil signatures at baseline were associated with response. Promising epigenetic biomarkers were identified using LC\/MS and will be correlated to transcriptomic and genomic data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Pembrolizumab and Vorinostat,Histone modifications,HPV,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

This study aims to identify the molecular features associated with a response to nCRT. We generated and collected genomic and transcriptomic data from 712 cancers prior to treatment from our own data and from publicly available data. A comprehensive integrated analysis was performed. We found that patients with a complete response have decreased risk of both local recurrence and future metastasis. We identified multiple molecular differences between complete and incomplete responders. Complete responders have a higher tumor mutation burden and more significant co-occurring mutations than the incomplete responders. In addition, mutations in DNA repair genes were enriched in complete responders and they also had lower expression of these genes indicating that defective DNA repair is associated with complete response to nCRT. Using logistic regression, we identified three significant predictors of complete response: tumor size, mutations within specific network genes, and the existence of three or more specific co-occurrent mutations. In incompletely responder tumors, abnormal cell-cell interaction and increased cancer associated fibroblasts were associated with recurrence. Additionally, gene expression analysis identified a subset of immune hot tumors with worse outcomes and upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins. \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Our study directly informs the clinical management of rectal cancer by elucidating the molecular differences between tumors with complete and incomplete responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), as well as the features of tumors prone to recurrence. We have pinpointed critical molecular markers and clinical indicators&#8212;such as tumor size, specific gene mutations, and particular mutation patterns&#8212;that are significant predictors of treatment response. These findings offer valuable biomarkers for personalizing treatment strategies. Additionally, the observed mutation enrichment in DNA repair genes among complete responders suggests new avenues for therapeutic innovation. By highlighting the distinct molecular and immune profiles of non-responder tumors at higher recurrence risk, our research supports the advancement of precision oncology approaches, enhancing prognosis and treatment customization in rectal cancer care, ultimately striving to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and clinical application. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009 \u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009 \u0009 \u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,rectal cancer,genomic and transcriptomic characteristics,Neoadjuvant therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) exhibits its advantage to evaluate more than one target on one FFPE section to provide the features of multiple target expression and co-expression signals. Here, based on our pathology controlled mIF detection system and AI based analysis data, we compared IHC PD-L1 TPS to mIF PD-L1 TPS, PD-L1 positive rate, and other target positive rates in one mIF panel, to evaluate their correlations. The correlations of IHC PD-L1 TPS, mIF PD-L1 TPS, mIF PD-L1 positive rate and other marker positive rate to anti PD-1 IMT response were further analyzed in this study. Thirty melanoma patient samples in this study have received PD-1 IMT. 13 cases exhibited partial response (PR) and 17 cases were progressive disease (PD). PFS of PR group and PD group was 27.3 and 4.8 months, respectively. Archived patient FFPE sections were examined utilizing mIF of PN 6-Plex Detection Kit (Beijing PhenoVision Bio Co., Itd) targeted CD68, CD3, CD20, S100, PD-L1 (CST, E1L3N) and PD-1. The staining images were scanned, tumor areas were labeled by pathologists and analyzed using PhenoVision mIF AI analysis system trained from Oncotopix Discovery system (Visopharm). Series sections were examined utilizing Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx and TPS was scored by one clinical pathologist. mIF TPS was calculated after AI data analysis, using PD-L1\/S100 co-positive cell number divided by S100 positive cell number. Data mining was performed using log-rank Mantel-Cox test, Cox regression analysis and binary logistic regression model in SPSS. In current study, the correlation between pathology scored TPS (pTPS) and mIF PD-L1 positive rate was observed (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)=0.447, p&#60;0.05). The consistency rate between pTPS and mIF TPS was 70% with no statistical significance. Moreover, the correlation between pTPS and mIF PD1\/CD3 copositive rate was detected (PCC=0.604, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Interestingly, mIF PD-1\/CD3 copositive rate predicted PR and PD groups (AUC=0.8, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01). Not pTPS nor mIF PD-L1 rate showed predictions here. Current results indicate that pTPS exhibited correlation to mIF PD-L1 positive rate instead of mIF PD-L1 TPS. CD3\/PD-1 copositive rate but not pTPS nor mIF PD-L1 positive rate, shows its potential to predict anti PD-1 IMT response through the pathology controlled mIF detection system and AI based analysis system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunohistochemistry,Fluorescence imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.

Recently, molecular classification systems originating from TCGA, evaluated in GOG-210 and PORTEC-3 defined four prognostic subtypes based on POLE, MSI-H\/MMR-D, and p53 alterations. Although valuable, this molecular approach still has significant limitations such as applicability to the majority of EEC patients categorized as no-specific molecular profile (NSMP) and the potential need to resolve pathogenic and prognostic heterogeneity within MMR-D, and TP53 subtypes. These unmet needs were key motivators for Tempus to develop a molecular classifier predicting distant recurrence risk in early-stage EEC with a focus on high intermediate-risk (HIR) patients.<br \/>The RNA-seq-based gene expression profiler (GEP) was trained using a machine-learning pipeline with TCGA data which resulted in a 24 gene signature that classifies EEC patients as molecular risk (MR) high or low (MR-high, MR-low). The GEP MR test was then evaluated on a de-identified cohort of EEC patients (N=1037) from Tempus to test associations with known pathologic or molecular prognostic features. The GEP-MR risk predictor showed significant enrichment of MR high-risk in G3 versus G1\/2 histology (p-value &#60; 5e-8). A high correlation was found between the MR score and copy number alteration score (t-test p-value &#60; 1e-5). Next, a clinical evaluation was performed in an early-stage EEC case-control cohort of patients with documented recurrence or no recurrence event at four years (N=109), from Stanford. In the entire cohort, the MR-high group had a significantly higher rate of distant recurrence in comparison to the MR-low group (HR=4.8, N=109). Next, we performed a subgroup analysis in the clinically important HIR patients. In this subgroup, the MR-high group had a significantly higher rate of distant recurrence in comparison to the MR-low group (HR=8.0, N=56). Lastly, given the significance of genomic biomarkers in the evolution of EEC FIGO staging, we stratified outcomes by the established TCGA subtypes as a reference standard and performed a subgroup analysis in patients classified as having no specific molecular profile (NSMP). Among patients who were NSMP, the MR-high group showed a significantly higher rate of distant recurrence in comparison to the MR-low group (HR=7.92, N=67).<br \/>These evaluation studies demonstrate the performance of the GEP MR test in early-stage EEC distant recurrence risk stratification, specifically HIR patients, necessitating further studies to validate the test for clinical use in informing adjuvant clinical management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Biomarkers,Prognosis,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

Although several biomarkers have demonstrated promise in patients with bladder cancer (BCa), only urine cytology is widely utilized. Increased availability of effective biomarkers may improve clinical decision making and reduce the need for more invasive imaging. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is upregulated in a number of cancers, including BCa, and promotes metabolic changes, including a shift to aerobic glycolysis. The aim of this study was to determine whether urine PKM2 levels are useful for detection and monitoring response to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with muscle invasive BCa.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Urine samples from patients enrolled in the University of Kanas Medical Center Bladder Cancer Biorepository were analyzed for levels of PKM2. Patients were included if they had both T2 stage disease and had received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and were compared to healthy controls. Patients were categorized based on their pathological response to treatment and recurrence of disease within two years of definitive surgery. Urinary PKM2 levels were measured and evaluated for their ability to predict response to treatment and two-year disease-free survival.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Immunohistochemistry revealed high levels of PKM2 within muscle invasive tumors compared to adjacent tissue. Patients with BCa had 150-fold increase in levels of urinary PKM2 compared to controls. However, there were no differences in urine PKM2 levels in patients with complete pathological response compared to those with no response. Urine PKM2 showed limited predictive value for disease recurrence (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.65).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Urine levels of PKM2 are significantly elevated in patients with muscle invasive BCa and may be useful for tumor detection.

However, as generally MYC and BCL2 are separately assessed on two different slides by immunohistochemistry (IHC), MYC+ and BCL2+ results are from different cells. With the WHO-recommended cutoffs, &#8805;40% for MYC and &#8805;50% for BCL2 (sum &#60; 100%), there is chance that the so-called DE comes from non-overlapping regions of the tumor (not single-cell DE). Moreover, tumor expression scores based on morphology assessment often vary among pathologists. In this study, we performed fluorescent multiplex IHC (fmIHC) using a MultiOmyx<sup>TM<\/sup> immunofluorescence platform (NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc.) to determine single-cell MYC and BCL2 co-expression for prognostic analysis in DLBCL.<br \/><b>Patients and Methods:<\/b> Co-expression of MYC, BCL2, and 11 immunophenotypic markers by fmIHC was digitally quantified for 547 patients with DLBCL. Percentage of cells with MYC\/BCL2 double or single expression was calculated for various cell types. Prognostic analysis was performed for de novo DLBCL cases, including 108 patients treated CHOP chemotherapy, and 356 patients treated with rituximab (R)-CHOP.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>First, although MYC and BCL2 were expressed in multiple cell types, the vast majority (&#62;90%) of MYC+BCL2+ DE cells were lymphoma cells. Frequencies of MYC and BCL2 co-expression were consistent with random distribution of independent MYC\/BCL2 expression in positive cases. The activated B-cell-like subtype compared with the germinal center B-cell-like subtype had a significantly higher mean percentage of MYC+BCL2+ DE, but not single BCL2 or MYC expression, in PAX5+ cells. Second, in both the R-CHOP and CHOP cohorts, high percentages of DE in PAX5+ cells and in all DAPI+ cells were associated with significantly poorer survival of DLBCL patients. Very high percentage of single BCL2 expression in PAX5+ cells was also associated with poorer survival, however, only in a small number of patients in both cohorts. Only in the R-CHOP cohort, high single MYC expression in PAX5+ cells (in a significant proportion of the cohort) was associated with significantly poorer overall survival. In the R-CHOP cohort, eight cases had <i>MYC<\/i>\/<i>BCL2<\/i> double hit by FISH, including 3 cases with MYC\/IGH fusions (DE) and 5 cases with MYC\/non-IGH rearrangements (only one DE). The exclusion of these double hit cases did not impact the significance of DE and single MYC+ expression.<br \/><b>Summary: <\/b>True MYC+BCL2+ double protein expression at the single cell level is predominantly in lymphoma cells, and associated with significantly poor survival of DLBCL patients. Our results suggest high cutoffs for common MYC\/BCL2 IHC to identify true double expressor lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Fluorescence imaging,Prognostic markers,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.
