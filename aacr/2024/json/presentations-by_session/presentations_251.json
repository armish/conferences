[{"Abstract":"Pediatric brain cancer is the leading cause of disease-related mortality in children. With a paucity of therapeutically targetable alterations, there is a pressing need to identify effective strategies for many of these tumors. In this study, we systematically examine aberrant alternative splicing in pediatric brain tumors from the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas, and additional tumors from the Children's Brain Tumor Network and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (n = 1831). Notably, high-grade gliomas (HGGs), including those with and without H3 histone mutations, were enriched in the upper quartile of all tumors with high splicing burden (SB). HGGs demonstrated the greatest SB heterogeneity of all tumor types and we identified a total of 19,229 aberrant splicing events in 8,577 genes in midline tumors compared to non-tumor brainstem controls (&#916;PSI &#62;= |.20|, p &#60; 0.05). We next integrated protein annotations from the UniProt Knowledgebase to assess and prioritize differential alternative splicing events affecting protein function. This approach led to the discovery of 3,754 splice variants in 5,036 genes resulting in the gain or ablation of functional sites. The protein kinase <i>CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1)<\/i>, a recognized master splicing factor and cell-cycle modulator, exhibited aberrant splicing of exon 4, whereby inclusion promoted the gain of two known phosphorylation sites. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between <i>CLK1<\/i> splicing, its own RNA expression and proteomic activity of the Serine\/Arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. The distribution of exon 4 splicing was significantly different (p = 0.019) between tumors with low vs high splicing burden; tumors with high splicing burden had increased exon 4 inclusion. Further, we performed experimental modulation of <i>CLK1<\/i> exon 4 aberrant splicing in the brain tumor cell line KNS42 and demonstrated that forced exon 4 skipping leads to reduced CLK1 protein abundance and significantly reduces cell proliferation (p &#60; 0.01 vs. control). Following bulk RNA-Seq analysis of these cell lines, we identified that forced <i>CLK1 <\/i>exon 4 skipping resulted in 4,518 dysregulated genes enriched for known cancer pathways such as mitotic spindle, E2F targets, and G2M checkpoint. Our data suggest a role for <i>CLK1<\/i> in driving transcriptional dysregulation in pediatric high-grade gliomas and uncover a potential therapeutic vulnerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Splice variants,Brain tumors,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We recently performed a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in recurrent pediatric EPN tumors from patients that were followed up for over 13 years. Integrative analysis between tumor DNA methylation and histone modification identified LSD1 as a druggable driver of PFA EPN recurrence. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of our newly developed LSD1 inhibitor SYC-836 in PDOX models of recurrent PFA EPN.<br \/>Methodology: To determine the <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-tumor activities of SYC-836, paired PFA EPN xenograft cell cultures (monolayer and 3D neurospheres) were treated with SYC-836 at 8 concentrations (0.02-25 &#181;M) and examined for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days through day 14. To validate the drug&#8217;s <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy, two established posterior fossa EPN PDOX models, ICb-4423EPN and ICb-2002EPN, were utilized. Forty 8-week old SCID mice of both genders received intra-cerebellar tumor cell implantation and were divided into 4 treatment groups (n=10 per group): 1) control, 2) radiation (2 Gy\/day x 5 days), 3) SYC-836 (15 mg\/kg, daily intra-peritoneal injection for 28 days), and 4) combination (radiation + SYC-836). Animal survival times were analyzed using log-rank analysis. Changes in LSD1 protein expression and histone lysine methylation were examined through western hybridization.<br \/>Results: SYC-836 strongly suppressed PFA EPN cell growth <i>in vitro, <\/i>in both, a time- and dose-dependent manner. While there was no survival benefit with either SYC-836 only (P=0.186) or XRT only (P=0.205); combining SYC-836 with XRT significantly (P=0.04) prolonged the median survival time of ICb-4423EPN, from 46 days in the untreated group to 59 days; and in ICb-2002EPN, even more prominent, from 136 days to 180 days (P=0.007). SYC-836 was well tolerated in mice with no loss of body weight or other toxicities. Changes in LSD1 protein expression and H3K4me2 were detected through western hybridization during and after SYC-836 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data support LSD1 as a druggable driver of PFA recurrence and highlights strong anti-tumor activities of SYC-836 in combination with radiation, a standard therapy of pediatric EPN. SYC-836 may have a role in the clinical setting by either reducing radiation dosages or be an adjuvant agent to other chemotherapy drugs in our treatment approach for ependymoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,LSD1,Radiation therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor, representing approximately 20% of all diagnoses. Of all four defined subgroups, MYC-amplified Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3 MB) tumors are the deadliest, with a &#60; 50% 5-year overall survival rate. High risk patients receive large doses of chemo- and radio- therapy (CT\/RT) with most survivors experiencing debilitating neurological and cognitive sequelae making the identification of novel targets of the utmost importance. Utilizing whole-genome CRISPR screening from the Pediatric Cancer Dependency Map, we identified the enzyme CTPS1 as a strong G3 MB-specific vulnerability. Recent studies corroborate our findings and suggest a dependence on the <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in MB. Targeted knockdown of CTPS1 restricts sphere formation and reduces proliferation of G3 MB tumor lines. We confirmed this genetic approach using a specific CTPS1 inhibitor, which also reduced proliferation but did not induce cell death, suggesting a cytostatic mechanism. Strikingly, we demonstrate that G3 MB is only dependent upon de novo pyrimidine synthesis and not de novo purine synthesis, despite regulation of both pathways by oncogenic MYC signaling. Previous work has shown that triggering an imbalance in pyrimidine and purine levels leads to replication stress and activation of the ATR\/CHK1 pathway. Both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CTPS1 leads to CHK phosphorylation, allowing for cell survival despite lack of dNTPs. Previously, the CHK1 inhibitor, prexasertib, demonstrated robust brain accumulation and targeting of G3 MB in pre-clinical models. Dual inhibition of CHK1 and CTPS1 synergizes<i> <\/i>to significantly reduce cell viability <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. We further demonstrated robust synergy of CHK1 inhibition with either glutamine antagonists or other inhibitors of the <i>de novo <\/i>pyrimidine synthesis pathway, prolonging <i>in vivo<\/i> survival in an orthotopic xenograft G3 MB model. The results of this investigation confirm CTPS1 as a novel target in G3 MB, pinpoint a dependency on <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine rather than purine biosynthesis, and identifies a novel rational combination for treatment in MYC-amplified MB patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Pediatric cancers,CTPS1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Despite multimodal therapy, prognosis is dismal with survival of &#60;1 year for DIPG and a 5-year overall survival &#60;10% for other pHGGs. Radiotherapy remains the only standard of care for DIPG that extends the survival by few months. In recent years, immunotherapy is emerging as a potential alternative treatment option. However, several factors have hindered the use of immunotherapy for pHGGs including &#8220;cold&#8221; immune environment with lack of immune cells infiltration, low tumor mutational burden, and lack of neo-antigen expression that prevents tumor recognition by the immune system. Therefore, novel therapies that activate the immune system while evading the tumor immunosuppression are highly needed. Here, we aim to demonstrate the immunomodulatory anti-tumor effects of THIO (6-thio-2&#8217;deoxyguanosine), a nucleoside analog and a telomerase-dependent telomere targeting agent, in DIPG mouse models. Our preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> data have demonstrated the efficacy of THIO in inducing telomeric damage, G<sub>2<\/sub>\/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in high-risk medulloblastoma and DIPG. Importantly, we have demonstrated that THIO crosses the blood-brain barrier and specifically targets tumor cells in an orthotopic mouse model of DIPG. THIO was shown to induce anti-tumor immunity through micronuclei formation leading to cGAS-STING pathway mediated activation of the innate and adaptive immune response in colon, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma tumor models. Our preliminary data demonstrate the THIO-dependent induction of micronuclei formation co-localizing with cGAS and leading to STAT1 activation in DIPG cell lines. We have also shown that THIO synergistically sensitizes DIPG cells to ionizing radiation (IR), significantly decreasing cell proliferation. We are currently testing the combination of THIO+IR in an orthotopic mouse model for DIPG. We will present results on the potential of THIO and IR treatments to stimulate anti-tumor immunity through the activation of STING pathway in a syngeneic mouse model of DIPG. These preclinical studies will support the potential use of THIO and IR to treat children with high-risk pediatric brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"U.

Illudins are a class of cytotoxic compounds with activity against pediatric solid tumors, including AT\/RT.

We tested LP-184 against a battery of AT\/RT cell lines including BT37, CHLA06, CHLA05, and CHLA266. LP-184 decreases viability at nanomolar concentrations with IC50s ranging from 9.91nM - 23.92nM. LP-184 decreased proliferation as measured by immunofluorescence and confirmed by western blots (BT37 p=0.0001, CHLA06 =0.0001, CHLA05=0.033).

The current course of treatment is focal radiation however, DMG continues to have a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 10 months. A major barrier for chemotherapeutic treatment of DMG is the blood brain barrier (BBB) which tightly controls access of molecules to the brain. This limits the efficacy of drugs to treat brain cancer and other diseases of the central nervous system. Previous studies from the Lawler lab and others have shown that the indirubin derivative, 6-bromoindirubin-3&#8242;-acetoxime(BIO-acetoxime\/BIA), has anti-invasive properties and can enhance survival in glioblastoma xenograft models. Here, we investigated the effects of BIA on pediatric glioma models using a range of relevant assays. In an <i>in vitro<\/i> collagen migration assay, BIA was observed to significantly slow cell migration at a concentration of 1&#181;M in DIPG 36 cells, over 72 hours. Furthermore, we have also shown that BIA modulates the tumor vasculature, which could limit tumor growth, and improves drug delivery to tumors by targeting tight junctions in tumor associated endothelium. The effect on BBB drug penetration was assessed in a multicellular 3D <i>in vitro <\/i>BBB model and effects of BIA on endothelial barrier functions was determined using trans-endothelial resistance assays (TEER). BIA treatment increased dextran uptake into 3D BBB models, and also lowered endothelial cell permeability <i>in vitro <\/i>via a reduction in the expression of tight junction proteins as shown by staining and a decrease in TEER values. In order to assess potential synergistic interactions, a drug screen was performed on a panel of distinct pediatric glioma cell lines (DIPG 36 and KNS42). This identified several FDA approved drugs that combine well with BIA. From this screen, BIA was shown to synergize with DNA damaging chemotherapy to enhance toxicity and in combination with cisplatin promote DNA damage in pediatric glioma cell lines.

MB is comprised of 4 groups, termed Wnt, Shh, Group 3 and Group 4, each characterized by distinct molecular and clinical profiles. <i>MYC<\/i>-amplified Group 3 MB is associated imminent fatal metastatic relapse following standard treatment approaches, which currently include surgery, craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy, highlighting an urgent need for identification of therapeutic vulnerabilities for these tumours. As such, using 4 novel patient-derived models of Group 3 MB that faithfully recapitulate the molecular and histological tumor characteristics, we characterised response to radiation of Group 3 MB <i>in vitro<\/i> to show that these tumors do not possess intrinsic radiation resistance. Furthermore, cumulative radiation experiments do not increase bulk radiation resistance in MB cells, highlighting the contribution of dynamic cell states to radiation response. In contrast, exposure to radiation leads to changes in cell clonogenic capacity as measured by limited dilution assays. Furthermore, RNA-seq data uncovered altered transcriptomic programs in response to cumulative radiation treatment. In particular, we observe differential regulation of genes encoding potassium ion channels and their regulators as well as genes encoding ECM and cell adhesion proteins. As part of our goal to evaluate the current multimodal treatment strategy of MB, we also show that a set of standard chemotherapeutic agents (etoposide, thiotepa and lomustine) currently used in the clinic do not produce a potent response at optimal doses <i>in vitro<\/i>, potentially accounting for abysmal survival outcomes seen in chemotherapy treated MB patients. As such, we conducted a screen of 144 FDA approved cancer drugs and identified therapeutics that selectively target Group 3 MB cells in contrast to normal tissue controls (foetal neural stem cells) in the low nanomolar dose range. In particular, topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan produces a potent response specific to MYC-amplified Group 3 MB, and sensitizes 2 patient-derived MB models to gamma irradiation. Altogether, our data characterizes Group 3 MB molecular and cellular responses to current treatment modalities and provides rationale for new clinical strategies to sensitize patients to radiation that will potentially allow to reduce the required radiation doses to treat these aggressive tumors, reduce the incidence of radiation treatment-related morbidity as well as improve cure rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Medulloblastoma,Radiosensitization,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

A subset of Group 3 MB tumors harbor focal amplifications of the <i>MYC<\/i> oncogene and are particularly prone to tumor recurrence and leptomeningeal spread which currently remains incurable. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of therapeutic modalities that can spare the vulnerable, developing brain while having potent antitumor efficacy against recurrent MB. Through proteomic profiling of cyclophosphamide-resistant patient-derived <i>MYC<\/i>-driven Group 3 MB cell line SU_MB002, we identified nuclear envelope (NE) proteins to be highly abundant and enriched in Group 3 MB compared to normal tissue. We discovered that LBR, an inner nuclear transmembrane protein, while present in all cells at the NE, is aberrantly presented to the cell surface in <i>MYC<\/i>-driven Group 3 MB cell lines. Immunohistochemistry analysis of LBR on MB patient tumor samples identified that positive LBR staining correlated with a significantly worse prognosis and was also identified to be enriched in recurrent tissue compared to their matched primary samples. Cell surface expression flow cytometry analysis identified highly abundant cell surface expression in all MYC-driven Group 3 MB cell lines with low to no expression in human neural stem cells and other MB subgroups. Mechanistically, high resolution microscopy of endogenously HALO-tagged LBR reveals LBR cell surface presentation to be linked to ER or ER-like vesicles that are directly trafficked to the cell surface. Transcriptomic analysis of LBR cell surface positive and negative cells identify that cell surface positivity is significantly linked to cell division and mitotic processes (cell cycle process, mitotic cell cycle process, chromosome segregation, cell division, nuclear division). LBR mislocalization stems from mitosis at the time of nuclear envelope dissolution and is enriched in the hyperproliferative, therapy-resistant subpopulation of MB cells following exposure to chemotherapy and radiation <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo <\/i>and may act as a marker for the brain tumor initiating cells that seed recurrence. Therefore, we demonstrate that LBR is an ideal therapeutic target for patients facing relapsed or treatment-refractory MB and have generated single domain antibodies in an effort to engineer LBR-specific CAR T cells. The development of therapies against NE proteins like LBR may provide patients a novel therapeutic opportunity that may be able to treat therapy-resistant, hyperproliferative <i>MYC<\/i>-driven Group 3 MB cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Target discovery,Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Despite the progress made in treating MB, the 5-year survival rate for high-risk tumors remains poor and risk of recurrence within 2 years of treatment is still high. Unfortunately, patients who do survive have reduced quality of life because of the highly toxic side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. Those facts underline the importance of identifying new drivers of MB and understanding the mechanism by which those drivers may promote MB. Using CRISPR-based dependency analysis, we discovered THO Complex Subunit 7 Homolog (THOC7) as one of the highly differentially expressed genes that may uniquely provide survival advantage to MB cells. THOC7 is a component of the THO subcomplex of the TREX complex, which is known to couple mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export associated with spliced mRNA.<br \/>Methods: To understand the role of THOC7 in MB, we silenced the expression of THOC7 using siRNAs in multiple MB cell lines. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by western blot and qPCR. The effect of THOC7 silencing on the viability of MB cells was assessed by short-term viability and long-term colony formation assays. The effect of THOC7 silencing on MB cell proliferation was measured using an IncuCyte. To assess whether THOC7 may affect MB progression, we performed Transwell migration assay. To understand the mechanism by which THOC7 may play a role in medulloblastomogenesis, we measured the effect of THOC7 silencing on the cell cycle progression and apoptosis. As presence of cancer stem cells is linked to relapse and makes MB refractory to radiation therapy, we asked whether THOC7 may support MB stem cell proliferation using neurosphere assay.<br \/>Results: Our analysis revealed that MB is highly addicted to THOC7. Importantly, higher expression of THOC7 is strongly correlated with lower overall survival of MB patients. We showed that depletion of THOC7 inhibited the short- and long-term viability as well as proliferation of MB cells. In addition, silencing of THOC7 inhibited migration\/invasion of MB cells. THOC7 depletion led to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis of MB cells. Furthermore, our neurosphere assay demonstrated that silencing of THOC7 blocked the MB stem cell proliferation.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that THOC7 may be a novel driver of MB growth and progression. Inhibition of MB stem cell proliferation in THOC7 depleted cells indicates that THOC7 inhibition may sensitize refractory MB to radiation therapy. Experiments are currently underway to understand the mechanism by which THOC7 may support MB growth and progression. In conclusion, our results showing no effect of THOC7 silencing on normal cell viability suggest that approaches aimed at silencing THOC7 may be a safe and viable approach for treating MB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Stemness,Targeted therapy,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite significant progress in the field, approximately 30% of children with MB will relapse. Recurrent MB is commonly metastatic and virtually none of these patients will live beyond the one-year hallmark. These sobering statistics highlight the significant unmet need for effective therapies for recurrent MB. The likely underlying cause of the constant failure of our current clinical approaches, which are based on data obtained from disease models recapitulating primary tumors, is the disparity in genomic and transcriptomic data between primary and relapsed disease. Because of these disparities, we hypothesize that by conducting mechanistic studies and drug screens in relapse disease models, we can improve the outcomes for children with recurrent MB. Our data, obtained through a bioinformatics mining approach to predict tumor response, enabled us to identify a clinically relevant candidate drug for the treatment of recurrent MB: Minnelide. This compound acted on MYC to reduce tumor growth and the metastatic dissemination of tumors with the genetic background often found in relapsed MB patients. Additionally, to further support the translational relevance of our data, Minnelide increased the efficacy of adjuvant therapeutics used in the clinical management of MB. Our findings not only highlight the potential for repurposing Minnelide to treat children with recurrent MB, but also the potential of our research approaches aimed at identifying novel therapeutics for relapsed cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Medulloblastoma,Recurrence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We previously reported that ALL cells are vulnerable to metabolic stress conditions following AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, leading to cell death. AMPK is the master metabolic regulator, and we and others have reported it interacts with chromatin-associated proteins to regulate gene expression in response to metabolic stress. To investigate AMPK&#8217;s mechanistic role in epigenetic gene regulation under metabolic stress, and identify new AMPK partners, we performed a comprehensive interactome analysis using TurboID-based proximity labeling proteomics. We generated HEK293T cells stably expressing TurboID fused to the AMPK&#945;1, AMPK&#945;2, AMPK&#946;1 or AMPK&#947;1. Following treatment with the allosteric AMPK activator PF-06409577 (PF064) for 1h, to mimic the cell&#8217;s rapid response to energy\/metabolic stress, the samples underwent mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Proteomics data analysis identified novel altered (enhanced or reduced) AMPK protein-protein interactions (PPI) following PF064 treatment. The GO analysis of proteins interacting with AMPK showed that metabolic stress enhances PPIs involved in regulating gene expression, cellular metabolic processes, DNA repair, chromatin organization, histone modifications, etc. More importantly, we identified that AMPK interacted with members of the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1) such as PCGF1, RING1, KDM2B, BCORL1, USP7. PRC1 is a known epigenetic regulator that monoubiquitinylates histone H2A at Lys119 (H2AK119ub) to control transcription and regulate gene expression. Using Co-IP, we confirmed these interactions in KASUMI-2 (Bp-ALL) and KE-37 (T-ALL) cells. When cells were treated with PF064 or 991 (another AMPK activator), we found that the interactions of AMPK with the catalytic core of PCR1.1 (PCGF1, RING1) were increased compared to untreated cells. To examine the effect of activated AMPK on PCR1.1 activity, we determined the level of H2AK119ub in ALL cells treated with PF064 and 991 for 1h. We found that the level of H2AK119ub protein expression was increased in ALL-treated cells indicating the PRC1.1 was activated. Together, these data suggest that stress-induced AMPK activation increased the catalytic activity of the PRC1.1 via PPI in ALL. Our findings are consistent with our previous published RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data indicating an epigenetic role for AMPK in altering gene expression examined under metabolic stress (two thirds exhibited downregulation), and provide insights into the AMPK-driven mechanism(s) involved. Further elucidation of the uncovered PPIs and its mechanistic role(s) may lead to potential epigenetic-based strategies to overcome resistance\/refractoriness in ALL and other malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AMPK,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Proteomics,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

High risk (HR) subgroups continue to result in significant mortality and morbidity of pediatric oncology patients. Pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a lethal disease, often associated with high-risk clinical features. T-ALL therapy has made less improvement than B ALL and continues to represent a significant number of high-risk outcomes. Novel treatment strategies are required to overcome chemotherapy resistance and improve morbidity for HR B ALL. The development of treatments that can overcome chemotherapy resistance is essential for improving survival in T-ALL. Deletions of <i>IKZF1,<\/i> resulting in decreased IKAROS function, are present in High-risk ALL patients. Casein kinase 2 (CK2), a protein kinase upregulated in ALL, phosphorylates IKAROS preventing DNA binding reducing transcriptional regulation in ALL patients. Past studies have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 with CX-4945 rescues IKAROS function as a transcriptional regulator. Receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT is transcriptionally regulated by IKAROS and is often upregulated in cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether restoration of IKAROS via CX-4945 would act in a synergistic manner with c-KIT inhibitor imatinib in ALL.Methods\/results B-ALL Nalm6 cells were treated with imatinib over 72-hours to establish the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>). The IC<sub>50<\/sub> was used to determine the concentration range of imatinib to be used in combination with CX-4945 in a 72-hour synergy analysis of cytotoxicity.. Cell viability was measured using WST-1 cell proliferation assay. The data were analyzed using Calcusyn and synergy was defined as a combination index below 0.85. The study was repeated to determine a more precise range of synergy. The cytotoxicity of single drug c-KIT inhibitor, Imatinib, in Nalm6 B-ALL yielded an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 25uM while CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 resulted in 4uM. When a combination was administered with a constant dose of CX-4945 at 4uM and varying concentrations of imatinib, synergy was observed at multiple dose combinations. Conclusion: The data shows that CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, and c-KIT inhibitor, imatinib, exhibit a synergistic therapeutic effect. Imatinib is indicated for use in Philadelphia positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia so future studies will include testing CX-4945\/imatinib synergy in Ph+ BALL where we expect to see more potent synergistic effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug synergy,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) are nanosized vesicles secreted by cancer cells, often enriched with glypicans. However, the presence of GPC2 on neuroblastoma TEVs and any interaction with GPC2 CAR T cells has not been explored.<br \/>High-levels of GPC2 were found on TEVs isolated from neuroblastoma preclinical models [7 cell lines, circulating EVs from 6 patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-bearing mice] and from the peripheral blood of 16 neuroblastoma patients, but not on circulating EVs from 7 non-tumor bearing mice or 12 healthy human donors. The level of circulating GPC2+ EVs isolated from the peripheral blood of PDX-bearing mice positively correlated with PDX size (R=0.96; P&#60;0.0001) and parent PDX GPC2 expression. To evaluate how GPC2 on EVs modulates CAR T cell functionality, we generated EVs with varied levels of GPC2 (Hi\/Lo\/Neg) and co-incubated each EV subset with GPC2 CAR T cells. Here using immunofluorescence and flow assays we found that EVs bind GPC2 CAR T cells proportional to the amount of GPC2 on their surface. Further, GPC2<sup>Hi<\/sup> EV-CAR T cell synapses induced potent T cell activation shown by CD69\/Granzyme B expression and release of IL-2\/IFN-&#947;. GPC2<sup>Hi<\/sup> EV pre-incubated CAR T cells also displayed enhanced target neuroblastoma cell cytotoxicity, inducing 4-fold more specific cytotoxicity than CAR T cells incubated with control GPC2<sup>Neg<\/sup> EVs. <i>In vivo<\/i> we observed that injection of GPC2<sup>Hi <\/sup>EVs into GPC2<sup>Lo<\/sup> neuroblastoma SK-N-AS xenografts genetically altered to have significantly decreased endogenous EV production (via <i>RAB27A <\/i>knock-out) greatly enhanced the efficacy of co-infused GPC2 CAR T cells (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Similarly, in an isogenic SK-N-AS-GPC2 xenograft murine model treated with a limiting number of GPC2 CAR T cells concurrently with the EV-inhibiting drug GW4869, GPC2 CAR efficacy was dependent on the presence of GPC2<sup>Hi<\/sup> EVs. Here, pharmacologic EV inhibition in mice decreased GPC2 CAR efficacy which could be rescued by intratumoral injection of GPC2<sup>Hi <\/sup>EVs. In both <i>in vivo<\/i> models, the presence of intratumoral GPC2<sup>Hi <\/sup>EVs resulted in a significantly enhanced tumor infiltration of activated (CD69+\/CD25+) GPC2 CAR T cells (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05).<br \/>Taken together, GPC2<sup>Hi<\/sup> EVs are selectively secreted from neuroblastomas and bind and activate GPC2 CAR T cells enhancing their anti-tumor cytotoxicity. To further capitalize on these findings, we engineered GPC2<sup>Hi<\/sup> EVs to have an extended circulation half-life through albumin binding or tumor targeting via GD2 binding that are currently being tested <i>in vivo<\/i> and results will be reported.

The transcription factor MYCN is the most studied oncogene in NB and automatically confers high-risk. MYCN drives numerous effects in the cell, including metabolic changes that are critical for oncogenesis. NB has also been demonstrated to be a highly methylated cancer, with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) largely responsible for these modifications. Epigenetics and metabolism are closely connected, with oncogene-driven metabolic rewiring modifying the epigenetic landscape through increases of metabolites that are critical for the activities of epigenetic enzymes, and conversely the enhanced epigenetic activity further regulating the activity of metabolic enzymes.<br \/><b>Aims:<\/b> As metabolism is believed to be a key regulator of the epigenome, the objective of this proposal is to understand the connection between MYCN-DNMT1-driven epigenetic alterations and dysregulated metabolism in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified NB.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses were performed to explore the MYCN-driven metabolome in NB and changes that occur with DNMT1 inhibition.

Expression of MYCN was linked to an increase in methionine and subsequently SAM, the universal methyl donor, further supporting reliance on DNMT1. Most importantly, we have found that treatment with DNMT1 inhibitors in vivo inhibited tumor growth, even after treatment had stopped.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We have found a correlation between MYCN and metabolism that supports DNMT1 activity.

High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous pediatric cancer with high mortality and relapse rates. The relapse of refractory cancer is shown to be driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are maintained by epigenetic malfunctions. In the present study, we determined the effects of inhibiting the COMPASS complex on NB CSCs and overall NB growth. A high-throughput shRNA screening of methyltransferases and demethylases reveals the role of COMPASS complex partners MLL1 and Menin in NB proliferation. We found that both MLL1 and Menin are overexpressed in our previously identified CD114+ NB CSCs. Further, <i>MEN1<\/i> (gene coding Menin) expression showed an inverse correlation with overall NB patient survival and cancer progression in a comprehensive analysis of 1235 primary NB patient data. Our ChIP results show that the <i>CSF3R <\/i>gene which codes for CD114 and maintains CD114+ NB CSCs, is regulated by the presence of high H3K4me3 activating marks. Further, we used MI-503 to inhibit MLL1-Menin interaction and also developed <i>MEN1 <\/i>stable knockdown and found that both strategies significantly inhibit H3K4me3 activity in NB, particularly at the <i>CSF3R<\/i> gene promoter. This led to decreased <i>CSF3R<\/i> expression and NB CSC levels. MI-503 significantly inhibits proliferation in different NB cell lines and primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines, with minimal effect on non-cancerous fibroblasts. MI-503 significantly inhibits NB cell cycle progression at the S phase, induces apoptosis, and inhibits NB 3D spheroid growth and development. Interestingly, we overserved differential selectivity of MI-503 in inducing apoptosis and in blocking the cell cycle in NB CSCs in contrast to non-CSCs. <i>MEN1<\/i> knockdown also inhibits NB proliferation and 3D spheroid growth. Furthermore, MI-503 in a dose-dependent manner synergistically sensitizes NB to chemotherapy doxorubicin and significantly inhibits NB proliferation and spheroid growth compared to either agent alone. Further, by using the NB xenograft <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor model, we established that MI-503 significantly inhibits NB tumor growth and tumor metastasis by directly inhibiting tumor NB CSCs, without any observed toxicities. Similar results of significantly reduced tumor growth, metastasis, and NB CSCs were shown by the <i>MEN1 <\/i>knockdown <i>in vivo<\/i>. Overall, our data show that the MLL1-Menin of the COMPASS complex directly activates the <i>CSF3R<\/i> gene to maintain NB CSCs and drive NB pathogenesis. Our data show that MI-503 or <i>MEN1<\/i> knockdown leads to significant inhibition of NB growth by directly inhibiting NB CSCs in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor models.

Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade has shown limited benefit in pediatric cancer. Despite this unmet need, there is a lack of reliable preclinical models to facilitate novel target discovery, validate therapeutic benefit, anticipate on- or off-target toxicity, and understand mechanisms of resistance.<br \/>Syngeneic murine model systems are a critical intermediate for preclinical translation, preserving the complex and heterogenous immune landscape and host-immunotherapy interactions. However, model interpretation and validity are limited as expression and function of murine targets and immune effector cells are not always conserved. We have developed a syngeneic immunocompetent C57BL\/6 neuroblastoma system to study CAR efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms of resistance, as well a variety of vaccination strategies. Specifically, we have built two murine CAR T constructs containing a 100% conserved antigen-directed scFv joined to orthologous murine TCR signaling machinery. In parallel, we engineered the murine neuroblastoma cell line 9464D to stably express surface antigen Gpc2 (Bosse, <i>Cancer Cell<\/i> 2017), or a novel chimeric single chain trimer of a 9mer peptide from intracellular oncoprotein PHOX2B discovered on HLA-A*24:02 (Yarmarkovich, <i>Nature<\/i> 2023) as Phox2b\/A24*02\/H2-k<sup>b<\/sup> to generate tumor-bearing B6 or B6-A24-Tg mice.

Anti-GD2 immunotherapy improves survival but not all responses are durable. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#946;) has been implicated in solid tumor immunoresistance. High-risk NBs harbor activated <i>MYC or MYCN<\/i> to coordinately expand intratumoral polyamines (PA), oncometabolites with immunomodulatory roles, to support tumor progression. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in PA synthesis, and has shown activity in preclinical NB models, including <i>TH-MYCN<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> transgenic mice, and is in clinical trials in children. We sought to augment anti-GD2 therapy using DFMO and the small molecule TGF&#946;-receptor inhibitor, galunisertib. We randomized <i>TH-MYCN<\/i><i><sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice in two experiments (10 therapy arms; n=6-10 mice\/arm) to receive combinations of DFMO, galunisertib, and anti-GD2 antibody m14G2a and to assess impact on survival. We measured 770 genes using nCounter Immuno-Oncology 360 (Nanostring), 36 cytokines using xMap bead-arrays (Luminex), and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes using flow cytometry in harvested tumors. Cell line TGF&#946; signaling was evaluated in tissue culture. In vitro, galunisertib consistently suppressed the upregulated TGF&#946;-Smad2\/3 signaling cascade in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo, DFMO alone extends mouse survival and increases intra-tumoral neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells. These NK cells increased surface expression of activation receptors like NKG2D (p&#60;0.05), while tumor cells increased surface expression of NK-ligands. Tumor cells also expressed increased latency-associated peptide (LAP; p&#60;0.05), a TGF&#946; precursor, suggesting NK cells were poised to kill but restrained by TGF&#946;. Cytotoxicity assays showed reversal of this inhibition with TGF&#946;R1 inhibitor galunisertib in vitro. In a proof-of-concept trial, DFMO and galunisertib (DFMO\/gal) demonstrated a clinical anti-tumor synergistic effect. DFMO\/gal<b> <\/b>treated<b> <\/b>tumors had upregulated NK cell activity genes and downregulated TGF&#946; signaling genes. Cytokine analysis confirmed DFMO induced upregulation of TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;2 (p&#60;0.01) that was modulated by galunisertib. IL6, GCSF, and GMCSF were markedly downregulated in tumors treated with both DFMO and galunisertib (p&#60;0.05). An expanded trial showed DFMO\/gal added to m14G2a showed no significant survival benefit over the DFMO and m14G2a combination. Ultimately, DFMO creates a pro-inflammatory cellular and cytokine milieu in <i>TH-MYCN<\/i><sup>+\/+<\/sup> NBs. DFMO and TGF&#946;R1 inhibition via galunisertib activate NK cells further and decrease the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL6. Ongoing studies are further characterizing the gene expression and cytokine levels of the NB TME under these treatment conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,DFMO,TGF-&#946;,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

However, the enormous number of possible drug combinations means discovering safe and effective combinations remains a significant challenge. To improve this process, we conduct large-scale targeted CRISPR knockout screens in drug-treated cells, creating a genetic map of druggable genes that sensitize cells to commonly used chemotherapeutics. We prioritize neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor, where ~50% of high-risk patients do not survive. Our screen examines all druggable gene knockouts in 18 cell lines (10 neuroblastoma, 8 others) treated with 8 widely used drugs, resulting in 94,320 unique combination-cell line perturbations, which is comparable to the largest existing drug combination screens. Using dense drug-drug rescreening, we find that the top CRISPR-nominated drug combinations are more synergistic than standard-of-care combinations, suggesting existing combinations could be improved. As proof of principle, we discover that inhibition of PRKDC, a component of the non-homologous end-joining pathway, sensitizes high-risk neuroblastoma cells to the standard-of-care drug doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Our findings provide a valuable resource and demonstrate the feasibility of using targeted CRISPR knockout to discover combinations with common chemotherapeutics, a methodology with application across all cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Therapeutic dosing, resistance, and combination therapy application,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,CRISPR,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.
