The structure and properties of ecDNA are markedly different from those of linear DNA, characterized by features like non-Mendelian inheritance and an altered epigenetic landscape. A prior pan-cancer analysis &#8203;&#8203;indicated patients with cancers harboring ecDNA have statistically worse overall survival when compared to cancer patients with other types of focal amplification. Moreover, its unique characteristics also make it a promising target for therapy. Recently, efforts have intensified to profile ecDNA across many cancer types, yet comprehensive studies of ecDNA in lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is lacking. Given that LCINS is partially driven by somatic copy number alterations, we hypothesized that ecDNA-driven focal amplifications significantly influence LCINS tumor evolution. As part of the Sherlock-Lung project (current data freeze, 1217 samples), we comprehensively profiled 871 treatment-naive samples using a robust computational pipeline that refined copy number segmentation by accounting for tumor purity and ploidy. ecDNA was present in 151 (17.3%) of tumor samples, with a third of ecDNA-positive samples harboring more than one distinct ecDNA amplicon. Consistent with prior reports, no ecDNA was found in bulk sequenced blood or matched normal lung tissues. These ecDNA often included genes (84%), frequently overlapping with known oncogenes like MDM2, TERT, and MYC, which showed higher expression levels compared to non-amplified or other amplified genes. Notably, most MDM2 amplifications (36\/45) were on ecDNA. ecDNA was significantly associated with whole genome doubling, tumor stage, and several endogenous mutational signatures, including APOBEC (SBS2 and SBS13), and clock-like signature (SBS1). Intriguingly, ecDNA-positive tumors were associated with significantly worse survival compared to tumors without any focal amplifications, though tumors with other amplification types (e.g. breakage-fusion-bridge, linear amplification, or complex events) had similar survival impacts. The unprecedented size of our cohort and the integration of clinical, epidemiologic, and multi-omics data allowed us to perform the first in-depth characterization of ecDNA in LCINS. We reconstructed the genomic regions involved in ecDNA and revealed the full spectrum of simple and complex ecDNAs across cancer histologies as well as the clinical and functional impact of ecDNA on LCINS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Cancer genomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The reason for this gap in understanding is two-fold: 1) Structural variants (SVs) are particularly challenging to detect using shotgun or long read-based approaches, particularly in heterogenous samples; and 2) It is increasingly accepted that epigenetic dysregulation may be a driver of disease state through mechanisms such as enhancer hijacking or changes to 3D genome organization. To address this gap in understanding, we developed VariLink: a dual-purpose proximity ligation library protocol that yields high-quality, high-resolution, unbiased Hi-C libraries capable of sensitive detection of structural variants and chromatin topological features from a single data set. Importantly, the VariLink protocol can be performed in under 8 hours&#8212;less than half of the time required for conventional Hi-C protocols. In the current study, we demonstrate the performance of VariLink for the detection of variants within the primary sequence (such as SVs, SNVs\/Indels, and CNVs) in addition to high-resolution reporting of 3D chromatin conformation. We performed benchmarking analyses for both genetic variant detection and chromatin topology in two well-characterized lymphoblast cell lines (GM12878 and K562). We demonstrate the capability of VariLink data to detect interchromosomal translocations with 10-fold higher sensitivity over shotgun. Furthermore, using hybridization capture to detect the BCR-ABL1 fusion in K562 cells, we show that fewer than 100k read pairs is sufficient to detect this fusion with high confidence in VariLink libraries. We find that the shotgun-like, uniform coverage of VariLink data also enables detection of SNVs\/Indels with improved sensitivity and precision over conventional Hi-C methods. Importantly, we demonstrate that VariLink libraries maintain topological features consistent with biologically relevant topologically-associated domains (TADs) and chromatin loops, providing insight into novel epigenetic cancer drivers. VariLink enables higher-resolution assessments of chromatin topology over conventional multi-RE-based Hi-C approaches, as demonstrated by 50% more TADs and loops called at 5-kb resolution. Taken together, our data demonstrate that VariLink is a next-generation Hi-C method that enables sensitive detection of clinically relevant structural variants and high-resolution chromatin topology in a single, rapid workflow.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Epigenomics,Chromatin topology,Gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

OSCC ranks among the deadliest cancers globally, with a 5-year survival rate of ~65%. In previous studies, we have shown that pharmacological blockade of Wnt\/&#946;-catenin\/CBP activity with small molecule inhibitors effectively abolished oncogenic cell phenotypes in OSCC. However, the underlying mechanisms promoting changes in OSCC cell identities remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we used an immunocompetent mouse model of OSCC induced by a tobacco-derived carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), to interrogate cell states by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of tongue tissues from healthy mice (n=2), 4NQO-derived mouse tongue OSCC (n=2), and from 4NQO-derived mouse tongue tissues treated with an inhibitor of &#946;-catenin\/CBP (n=4), and generated a high-quality dataset comprising ~50K cells across all conditions. We performed multiple analyses of the generated data to catalogue the cell type repertoire and its changes among conditions. We observed significant changes in cellular composition between the 4NQO-induced and inhibitor-treated groups. The proportion of epithelial cells decreased upon treatment consistent with greatly diminished tumor volumes, while endothelial and fibroblast populations increased compared to the 4NQO control group. Epithelial sub-typing using known markers revealed a decrease in basal cancer stem-like cells (Krt5+, Krt14+) concomitant with an increase in cycling cells (Top2a+, Cdc20+). In addition, we identified a decrease in a stress cell phenotype associated with the AP-1 complex (Jun+, Fos+). The latter subgroup exhibited a positive enrichment for the &#8220;stress&#8221; module (n=100 genes) derived from human HNSCC patients described by Puram et al. To further validate the relationship between the stress subtype with &#946;-catenin\/CBP activity and its relation to the AP-1 complex, we projected the Puram stress module and the down-regulated signature from the &#946;-catenin\/CBP inhibitor-treated group compared with the 4NQO-control group onto independent cohorts of human subjects with HPV-negative HNSCC. We used both the bulk TCGA RNA-seq subset (n=367 patients) and a previously published scRNAseq dataset from Choi et al., specifically profiling the epithelial compartment (3K cells, n = 16 patients). We observed highly significant positive association of the stress program and &#946;-catenin\/CBP activity in both datasets (pearson &#961; = 0.74 and 0.70, respectively), indicating that inhibition of &#946;-catenin\/CBP activity reduces the stress response. Our results suggest that mitigation of tumorigenic profiles in 4NQO-induced tumors upon inhibition of &#946;-catenin\/CBP signaling in OSCC may serve as an effective treatment strategy for the benefit of human patients and shed further light into the molecular mechanisms driving treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Single cell,Mouse models,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, these genetic screens are usually coupled to rather simplistic read-outs such as cell fitness. In contrast, CROP-Seq (or &#8220;CRISPR Droplet&#8221; Sequencing) screens combine CRISPR perturbation with single-cell transcriptomics, enabling high-content phenotyping at single-cell resolution. Briefly, cells are perturbed with a pooled sgRNA library and transcriptomic profiles of each cell are recorded using conventional single-cell RNA sequencing platforms. Currently, the scale of these screens is limited to the perturbation of a couple of hundred genes, possibly up to 1.000 genes, because of increased costs for single-cell library preparation and next generation sequencing (NGS). At Myllia, we have built a platform allowing high-content CROP-Seq screens in both CRISPR-ready cancer cell lines as well as primary immune cells, e.g., human T cells. Using CRISPR KO, CRISPR interference or CRISPR activation workflows, we can help accelerate the identification of target genes and regulatory networks involved in immuno-oncology. Primary T cells are of great interest in the immunotherapy community as they are key players in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Engineered T-lymphocytes such as CAR-T cells are currently developed as novel cellular medicines, yet many T cell-intrinsic features involved in CAR-T potency remain elusive. To enable the discovery of novel targets, we have performed multiple customized CROP-Seq CRISPR KO screens in primary human T cells investigating T cell stemness and effector phenotypes as well as CD4+ T helper cell differentiation towards Th1, Th2, or Th17 subsets. Here, we present screens for regulators of functional T cell plasticity and Th2 commitment in which we aimed to identify genes determining critical T cell fate decisions, potentially linking gene (dys)function to either autoimmune\/inflammatory disease or functional persistence of cytotoxic T cells for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, the advanced CROP-Seq platform combining large-scale perturbations and targeted sequencing (TA) read-outs will catalyse a paradigm shift for CROP-Seq enabling high-throughput functional genomic screens that support the validation of drug targets in autoimmunity, inflammation and immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,T cell,Transcription,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"N.

With the Indian subcontinent as its capital, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), also dubbed as &#8216;poor man&#8217;s cancer', constitutes 90% of all head and neck cancers and is the highest incidence cancer found in Pakistani males. Backed by a bio-repository of clinical samples as well as a catalogue of primary cell clines, PML takes a multi-omic approach to discovering new, actionable biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications.<br \/>With all necessary ethical approvals obtained from IRBs at each site along with written informed consent from each patient, treatment-naive biopsy-confirmed patients of OSCC were recruited in two main tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan. Our cohort was predominantly older with 37.84% between 41-60 years, late-stage with 78.46% presenting in stage IV and self-reportedly non-alcohol consuming (96.9%). About 44.6% reported the use of smokeless tobacco while 30.8% reported the use of both smoked and smokeless tobacco. Majority of the tumours were located in the buccal mucosa (29.2%), alveolar region (27.7%) or the vestibular region (24.6%). We obtained blood and tumour samples for matched-pair whole exome sequencing, transcriptomics and metabolomics as well as generation of primary cell lines. We also obtained saliva samples for oral microbiome analysis. Combined with the patient&#8217;s clinical history and digital histopathology images, this helps us create a multi-omic stack that we intend to make available for integrated machine learning experiments.<br \/>With our whole exome sequencing now complete, we undertook a preliminary analysis for this late breaking abstract. Raw reads were aligned to the GRCh38.p14 reference genome and were called for germline and somatic SNPs and INDELs using GATK (v4.5). Mutational analysis was conducted using the maftools (v2.18.0) package in R (v4.3) by comparing against the COSMIC SBS Signature database (v3.2). We report MUC12 (100%), ZNF717 (100%), FOLR3 (86%), EPPK1 (79%) and SPATA31A6 (79%) as the top mutated genes in the subset of exomes analysed thus far for our cohort. Genes reported previously including TP53, NOTCH1 and PIK3CA appear to rank lower on the list.

Due to the harsh fixation and permeabilization required for intracellular (IC) antibody staining, only a few studies have recovered mRNA expression profiles alongside IC protein detection.<br \/>This experiment utilized a novel IC CITE-Seq assay that enables robust profiling of multiple IC protein targets in combination with mRNA and high-plex surface proteins. In this study, we stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) alongside a resting control. After stimulation, we stained the surface proteins with a 40-plex BD&#174; AbSeq Panel, including the Immune Discovery Panel and human Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit (SMK). Resting and stimulated cells were pooled, and a portion of the sample pool immediately underwent cell capture as a live control using a BD Rhapsody&#8482; single-cell microwell system. The other portion of the pool was stored in BD&#174; OMICS-Guard Sample Preservation Buffer for either 5 minutes or 24 hours followed by permeabilization, IC staining with a 10-plex IC AbSeq Panel (50-plex total, surface and IC), and cells captured on the the same system. We show IC protein detection for the expected positive targets, including pH2AX, actCaspase-3, and cPARP in the stimulated population, as well as T-Bet, Granzyme B and Helios in the resting lymphocytes. Analysis shows excellent correspondence between IC CITE-Seq protein and transcriptome for T-Bet, Granzyme B and Helios. The gene expression correlation for surface antigen and mRNA between the IC and live control each had R2 values &#62; 0.9. The mRNA sensitivity for the IC sample compared to live control was within whole transcriptome analysis (WTA) assay variation at 86&#8211;89% and 95&#8211;97% median molecules and genes per cell.<br \/>Our data showed that the new IC CITE-Seq assay can provide rich single-cell multiomics information including mRNA and surface and intracellular proteins.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

As a result, GSH levels are associated with protection from stress-related conditions, such as aging and cancer. Given this rationale, antioxidants are routinely consumed by the public, mainly because they are viewed as &#8220;cure-alls&#8221; and almost uniformly beneficial to a range of diseases. This is an oversimplification, as the relationship between antioxidants and diseases is much more complex. Recent evidence has implicated GSH in protecting cancer cells from oxidative stress and promoting their survival. Therefore, understanding GSH metabolism in vivo and its intricate crosstalk with other cellular pathways is vital to improving the efficacy of therapies for diseases, including cancer. To interrogate this, we developed a series of <i>in vivo<\/i> models to induce <i>Gclc<\/i> deletion in adult animals. We find that GSH is essential to lipid abundance <i>in vivo<\/i>. GSH levels are reported to be highest in liver tissue, which is also a hub for lipid production. While the loss of GSH did not cause liver failure, it decreased lipogenic enzyme expression, circulating triglyceride levels, and fat stores. Mechanistically, we found that GSH promotes lipid abundance via the LXR\/SREBP signaling pathway, as well as by repressing NRF2, a transcription factor induced by oxidative stress. Overall, these findings suggest an essential function for GSH in maintaining circulating lipids levels and lipid depots, possibly as a mechanism to prevent lipid peroxidation and redox imbalances. Notably, the accumulation of oxidized lipids propagates oxidative stress and associated cell death phenotypes (i.e., ferroptosis). This also highlights a potentially novel mechanism by which GSH regulates lipid production and suggests a possible link between oxidative stress (caused by GSH deficiency) and cachexia (commonly characterized by loss of fat and lean mass), a disorder linked to cancer but poorly understood. Consequently, by elucidating the contributions of GSH to lipid homeostasis, we can better understand the basic biology surrounding GSH and obtain critical insight into potentially improving the treatment of cancer-related cachexia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutathione,Nrf2,Lipid metabolism,Liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an active histone mark, might enable slow cycling drug tolerant persisters (DTP) to regain proliferative capacity. This study aimed to determine H3K4me3 transcriptionally active sites identifying a key regulator of DTPPs in melanoma. Deploying a model of adaptive cancer drug tolerance H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data of DTPPs guided identification of top transcription factor binding motifs. These suggested involvement of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which was confirmed by metabolomics analysis and biochemical assays. OGT impact on DTPPs and adaptive resistance was explored in vitro and in vivo. H3K4me3 remodeling was widespread in CPG island regions and DNA binding motifs associated with O-GlcNAc marked chromatin. Accordingly, we observed an upregulation of OGT, O-GlcNAc and its binding partner TET1 in chronically treated cancer cells. Inhibition of OGT led to loss of H3K4me3 and downregulation of genes contributing to drug resistance. Genetic ablation of OGT prevented acquired drug resistance in vivo. Our findings uncover a fundamental mechanism of adaptive drug resistance that governs cancer cell reprogramming towards acquired drug resistance, a process that can be exploited to improve response duration and patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Histone methylation,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"D.

More recently, cyclic FMD has been shown to be safe and associated with promising metabolic and immunomodulatory effects in cancer patients. However, cyclic fasting and FMD only retard tumor progression, but they do not result in tumor cure when used alone. Here, we hypothesized that tumor cells exposed to STV activate Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) as an alternative metabolic pathway that could be responsible for primary or acquired tumor cell resistance to STV.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We investigated the effects of FAO inhibition (FAOi) in combination with STV on the proliferation and survival of human or murine cell lines of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (n=16), HR+HER2- breast cancer (n=3), colorectal (n=1), pancreatic (n=1) and lung cancer (n=1), as well as of non-transformed human epithelial cells (n=3). STV consisted of a 50% reduction of extracellular glucose and serum in cell growth media. To inhibit FAO, we used the Carnitine Palmitoyl transferase 1 inhibitor Etomoxir or ST1326.<br \/><b>Results <\/b><b><\/b>STV+FAOi resulted in cooperative or highly synergistic antiproliferative effects in all cancer models tested, but not in normal cells. At longer time points, STV+FAOi enhanced tumor cell death through the activation of apoptosis. Depending on the specific tumor type, the cooperative effects of STV and FAOi were mostly mediated by glucose or fatty acid restriction in the STV medium. On the other hand, the reduction of extracellular growth factors did not affect cell proliferation upon STV+FAOi combination. Intracellular ATP levels were reduced upon cell exposure to the combined treatment at later time points. However, the supplementation of several sources of ATP, such as glutamine or TCA cycle intermediates, to tumor cells did not rescue the antitumor effects of STV+FAOi, thus excluding the strong impact of this combination on tumor cell bioenergetics. On the other hand, STV+FAOi caused an excessive intracellular antioxidant response, which in part mediated the synergistic effects of STV+FAOi. Indeed, Etomoxir alone mildly increased the NADPH\/NADP+ ratio, whereas its combination with STV resulted in a remarkable increase of this ratio. In parallel, combining the antioxidant molecules n-acetylcysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) with FAOi caused antitumor effects that recapitulate those produced by STV+FAOi treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>FAO is a potential resistance mechanism to nutrient starvation, with broad antitumor activity in different models of murine and human malignancies, but not in normal cells. In cancer cells, FAOi synergizes with STV by strongly affecting intracellular redox balance. FAOi is a new strategy that should be explored in future preclinical <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments and in clinical studies to potentiate the antitumor effects of nutrient starvation in solid malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acids,Solid tumors,Metabolism,Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

While the role of glucose metabolism in cancer has been extensively studied, relatively little has been done to understand the role of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in cancer biology. To gain insight into their contribution to cancer progression we determined the expression patterns and outcome associations of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis (UFAS) genes in pediatric neuroblastoma (NB), and fatty acid levels in NB cell lines derived from high-risk tumors. <i>MYCN<\/i> amplification and disruption of tumor suppressor miRNAs (TSmiR) function are central drivers of poor outcomes in NB. MYC, MYCN, and TSmiRs regulate glucose metabolism; however, their role in UFAS remains poorly understood. Using complementary analysis of publicly available genomic datasets and cultured NB cell measurements we examined the potential regulation of UFAS genes through MYCN and MYC activity and posttranscriptional regulation by TSmiRs. Here we show that de novo and UFAS pathway genes FASN, ELOVL6, SCD, FADS2, and <i>FADS1<\/i> are upregulated in high-risk NB and are associated with poor prognosis. RNA-Seq analysis of eight human NB cell lines revealed parallel UFAS gene expression patterns. Consistent with this, we found that NB-related TSmiRs were predicted to extensively target these genes. Additionally, we observed that both MYC and MYCN upregulated UFAS pathway genes while suppressing TSmiR host gene expression, thereby creating a possible UFAS regulatory network between MYCN and TSmiRs in NB. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry analysis we found NB cells to be high in de novo synthesized omega 9 (&#969;9) unsaturated fatty acids and low in both &#969;6 and &#969;3.

To identify the unknown molecular mechanism for cancer progression induced by CYP1B1, we studied the role of CYP1B1 in human tumor cells, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Suppression of CYP1B1 by shRNA significantly reduced cancer cell viability and invasion. Clinical data from cancer patients showed that high level of CYP1B1 expression resulted in relatively lower survival rate. Interestingly, overexpression of CYP1B1 markedly activated Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling and EMT process, and suppression of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) by siRNA, an well-known transcription factor, demolished the promoting effects of CYP1B1 on cancer progression. To investigate the correlation between CYP1B1 and Sp1, we analyzed the clinical data from breast and cervical cancer patients and the results showed the positive correlation between two genes. Furthermore, TMS (tetramethoxystilbene), a specific CYP1B1 inhibitor, diminished the induction of Sp1 by CYP1B1, and 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub> exceedingly promoted the expression level of Sp1. Surprisingly, miR-375, known as an oncogenic microRNA, substantially decreased by 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub> and CYP1B1 overexpression in CYP1B1-transgenic (TG) mice. Methylation specific assay revealed that CYP1B1 suppressed miR-375 expression through induction of hyper-methylation on pre-miR-375. In addition, epigenetic regulation of miR-375 by CYP1B1 was executed via induction of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT1, 3a, and 3b. Enhanced expression level of Sp1 by 4-OHE<sub>2<\/sub> was significantly deteriorated by 5-aza-dC, a DNMT inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that CYP1B1 enhances cancer progression through induction of cancer cell proliferation and invasion via DNMT-mediated epigenetic regulation of miR-375 and further promotion of Sp1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-01 Epigenetic control of miRNA expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer progression,Cytochrome P450 1B1,Sp1,MicroRNA -375,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Young-Jin Chun<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yeo-Jung Kwon<sup><\/sup>, Tae-Uk Kwon<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chung-Ang Univ.

MiRs are frequently dys-regulated in human cancers and orchestrate the biology of the disease, and its resistance to chemotherapy. Increasing evidence supports a role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in promoting cancer growth and resistance to treatments. Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are a predominant cellular component of the TME of several types of cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB), the most frequent pediatric extra-cranial solid tumor. NB cells secrete miRs within small extracellular vesicles called exosomes, and these miR are shuttled to surrounding TAMs. Our lab was the first to show that cancer-derived exosomal miRs bind to Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) in TAMs, triggering an NF-&#954;B-dependent production of TAM-derived miRs, that are then shuttled back to NB cells. Following up on that discovery, we identified a signature of miRs that are up\/down-regulated in NB cells when co-cultured with TAMs expressing TLR8 or in which the TLR8 had been deleted with CRISPR\/Cas9 engineering. We identified miR-192-5p as significantly down-regulated in NB cells when co-cultured with wild-type TAMs, however miR-192-5p expression was significantly increased in NB cells when co-cultured with TLR8-knock out TAMs, supporting a TLR8-mediated modulation of miR-192-5p in the NB TME. Additionally, we found that over-expression of miR-192-5p in NB cells increased sensitivity of NB cells to temozolomide and cisplatin, two commonly used drugs in the treatment of this malignancy. Overall, these findings support the use of TLR8 inhibitors to up-regulate miR-192-5p and increase sensitivity of NB cells to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-03 miRNA regulation of cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Tumor associated macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Tumor-supportive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is educated by tumor cells through immune editing is not properly primed for the treatment. Targeted reprogramming of both tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is expected to prime the tumor cells and the immunosuppressive TME. Tumor suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as the most suitable therapeutic target to perform the tumor reprogramming role. We recently identified miR-138 as a putative tumor suppressive miRNA that can reprogram GBM tumor. However, achieving the simultaneous targeted reprogramming of two distinct cell types is a complex challenge, demanding a selective delivery system to minimize adverse side effects. Previously, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can serve as carriers for the selective delivery of small noncoding therapeutic RNAs into cancer cells through the EV surface labeling with cancer-targeting ligands. Here, we report that the trypsin digestion of EV surface can enhance their surface labeling efficiency with cancer targeting ligands, such as folate, with favorable bio-distribution and pharmacokinetic profiles in GBM mice model. The folate-labeled trypsinized EVs demonstrated a potential to selectively target folate receptor (FR) positive GBM cells and TAMs both in vitro and in vivo. The selective targeting of folate-labeled trypsinized EVs led to the targeted delivery of miR-138 into both GBM tumor cells and TAMs, achieving anti-tumor efficacy. Mechanism of action studies revealed that the ectopically delivered miR-138 inhibits its previously identified known target genes to reprogram tumor cell proliferation and macrophage polarization. To our knowledge, this is the first preclinical study attempting to simultaneously modulate tumor cells and innate immunity by delivering tumor suppressive miR-138 using the trypsinized EV-based RNA delivery system for the GBM treatment. Our study results can be rapidly translated into human clinical trials in combination with current immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-05 miRNA-based therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Glioblastoma,Gene therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

High expression of dihydrouridine synthase 2 (DUS2) predicts poor patient outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) for reasons that are not yet clear. Here, we show in human cells and mouse xenografts that DUS2 suppresses ferroptosis, a metal-dependent non-apoptotic form of cell death that is emerging as a therapeutic target in lung cancer. Elevated DUS2 correlates with resistance to ferroptosis inducers and loss of DUS2 causes increased sensitivity with concomitant accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. Mechanistically, DUS2 is required to maintain tRNA CysGCA levels, supporting translation of cysteine-rich proteins including metallothioneins, key regulators of metal and redox homeostasis Notably, DUS2 KO cells cannot sustain normal levels of metallothioneins, a class of very cysteine rich proteins that serve as key regulators of both metal and redox homeostasis. Accordingly, DUS2 knockout cells are more susceptible to zinc intoxication and have lower levels of reduced glutathione, which partially explains their sensitivity to ferroptosis. Our findings demonstrate that DUS2 is required to support tRNACys levels and fend off ferroptosis in lung cancer cells. This highlights that individual tRNA substrates can play an outsized role in the biological functions of tRNA modifying enzymes, and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting DUS2 in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In this study, a novel, uncharacterized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) (ENSG00000267053) located on chromosome 19p13.12 was found overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with a wild-type and active CDKN2A gene. The expression of this Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A-regulated lncRNA (CyKILR) was also associated with the expression of the tumor suppressor, Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a product of the STK11 gene. Characterization of CyKILR identified distinct RNA splicing variants classified into two groups based on their exon 3 inclusion\/exclusion status, CyKILRa (exon 3 included) and CyKILRb (exon 3 excluded). The CDKN2A and STK11 gene products not only regulated the expression of CyKILR mRNA in non-transformed cells, but also the interplay between these genes synergistically regulated inclusion of exon 3 into the mature CyKILR RNA as shown by dramatic loss of exon 3 inclusion when mRNAs from both tumor suppressor genes were downregulated by siRNA. Functionally, CyKILRa predominantly localized to the nucleus, and targeted downregulation of the CyKILRa using antisense RNA oligonucleotides (ASOs) significantly enhanced cellular proliferation, migration, and clonogenic survival in mechanistic studies. In contrast, CyKILRb predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, and downregulation of CyKILRb using siRNA significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration, and clonogenic survival. Additionally, downregulation of CyKILRb, in stark contrast to CyKILRa, reduced tumor growth in vivo. Interrogation of cell signaling pathways by transcriptomics analyses demonstrated that CyKILRa suppressed key mitogenic pathways further demonstrating the tumor suppressive role of this CyKILR variant. On the other hand, CyKILRb induced key survival pathways further corroborating the oncogenic nature of this variant. Taken together, our findings shed light on the complexity of lncRNA expression and the alternative RNA splicing of lncRNAs as well as their roles in cell signaling and tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB10-07 Noncoding RNAs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,RNAi,Antisense oligonucleotides,Splice variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

We previously reported that circIPO7 (circBase ID: hsa_-circ_0005092) was positively associated with postoperative recurrence of gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we aimed to explore the biological function of circIPO7 in GC development. Methods: CCK-8, clone formation, Edu proliferation assay and xenograft model were used to analyze the effects of circIPO7 and caprin-1 on the cell proliferation and tumor growth in <i>vivo<\/i> and in <i>vitro<\/i>. Mass spectrometry, RNA pull down, RIP and RNA-FISH experiments were used to identify the co-localization and interaction between caprin-1 and circIPO7. RIP sequencing was used to analyze the mRNAs binding with caprin-1. Rescue experiment was conducted to evaluate the translational regulation of circIPO7 on caprin-1 downstream effector molecule.Results: circIPO7 was downregulated in GC tissues and cells compared to paracarcinoma tissues and normal epithelial cells. circIPO7 overexpression significantly suppressed GC cell proliferation in <i>vitro<\/i> and in <i>vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, circIPO7 directly binds with caprin-1, an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA translation, sharing overlapping binding sites with G3BP1. Thus, the complex containing overexpressed circIPO7 blocked the caprin-1-G3BP1 interaction and dissociated caprin-1 and its target mRNAs (EGFR and mTOR) from ribosomes, resulting in their translational inhibition, followed by PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway inactivation.Conclusion: We demonstrate that circIPO7 serves as an RBP sponge for caprin-1, inhibits the translation of downstream proliferation-related mRNAs, and ultimately suppresses malignant cell proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that circIPO7 may be a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,circRNA,Proliferation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Most of these mutations are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53, causing loss of wild-type p53 (wtp53) transcriptional activity. Missense mutant p53 (mutp53) also enhances cancer malignancy in a manner independent of wtp53. Hence, mutp53 is an ideal therapeutic target due to its uniqueness and high expression levels in cancers; however, directly targeting mutp53 protein itself has been challenging. To better understand the mechanism of oncogenic function of mutp53, we performed in silico TCGA database analysis and found that patients with missense mutp53-carrying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but not other types of cancer, had unexpectedly better overall survival than patients with p53-null HCC. Since sorafenib (SOR) has historically been used as a single agent chemotherapy for HCC, unlike other cancer types, we hypothesized that SOR treatment may have yet unappreciated advantages for treating mutp53-expressing tumors. Indeed, knockdown of mutp53 rendered HCC cells and xenografts more resistant to SOR. Consistent with a report showing that SOR induces ER stress-mediated pro-survival stress granule (SG) formation, mutp53-expressing HCC cells, treated with SOR or other ER stress inducers, formed significantly fewer SGs with increased apoptosis, as compared with mutp53-knockdown cells. This result was partly due to mutp53&#8217;s ability to interact with an eIF2&#945; kinase PERK and a key SG core protein, G3BP1. Moreover, the oligomerization domain of mutp53 was required for the interaction of mutp53 with G3BP1 and subsequent suppression of ER-stress-mediated SG formation and survival. These results suggest that inhibition of SG formation is a novel vulnerability imposed by mutp53, leading to sensitization of cancer cells to ER stress. Our results also emphasize the use of ER stress inducers to treat mutp53-expressing tumors and mutp53 as a biomarker of SOR sensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Stress response,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
