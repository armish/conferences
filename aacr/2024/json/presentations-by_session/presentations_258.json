[{"Abstract":"Circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA, also known as double minutes, dm) has emerged as a driver of oncogenic copy number amplification, intratumoral heterogeneity, tumor evolution and therapy resistance. We recently screened the whole genomes of 481 medulloblatomas for ecDNA and concluded that medulloblastoma tumors harboring ecDNA are more than twice as likely to progress within 5 years of diagnosis. To evaluate the frequency and clincical impact of ecDNA across the spectrum of childhood cancers, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1671 tumors from 1482 patients across 47 pediatric tumor types from two large cloud pediatric cancer genomics resources, the Children&#8217;s Brain Tumor Network and St. Jude Cloud. ecDNA was detected in 15 pediatric tumor types, including ETMR (100%, n=4), osteosarcoma (47%, n=57), rhabdomyosarcoma (40%, n=35), neuroblastoma (30%, n=106), high-grade glioma (20%, n=157), and retinoblastoma (19%, n=32). Patients with tumors containing ecDNA had significantly poorer 5-year overall survival. In sequential samples from the same tumor at diagnosis and relapse, we observe evidence of ecDNA evolution including sequence instability and generation of new high-copy ecDNA amplification not detected at initial diagnosis. These results comprise the most detailed survey to date of the landscape of extrachromosomal amplifications across childhood cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Genomic instability,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

The PurIST algorithm is a gene signature (Rashid et al. Clin. Cancer Res., 2020) that categorizes PDAC tumors into basal or classical molecular subtypes and has been previously validated in a patient cohort of advanced PDAC (N=258). In this post-hoc analysis study, we examine whether the PurIST subtypes can distinguish patients likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX (FFX) versus Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (GnP).<br \/>Methods: A cohort of de-identified PDAC patients was selected from the Tempus Oncology Database following an IRB-approved protocol. Inclusion criteria required no prior systemic treatment, a surgically unresectable\/metastatic status, available RNA-sequencing data from primary or metastatic tissue, and the use of FFX or GnP as 1L systemic therapy with documented outcomes. RNA-sequencing was generated by the CAP\/CLIA validated Tempus xR assay. The PurIST gene signature was applied to normalized gene expression values to classify samples into basal or classical subtypes. Univariate and multivariate Cox PH analyzes comparing overall survival (OS) with adjustment for delayed entry, between two common 1L treatment regimens, FFX and GnP, were performed for classical patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.<br \/>Results: Application of the PurIST model to the PDAC cohort (N=258) resulted in 67% (N=173) labeled as classical, 23% (N=59) as basal, and the remainder as no-call. Amongst classical patients, 35% (N=61) had a known ECOG score of 0 or 1 and were retained for subsequent analysis. Within this subset, 37 were treated with FFX and 24 with GnP as 1L, with an overall median OS of 11.4 months (95% CI: 9.5-16.5) and a 12-month survival rate of 47.2%. A univariate Cox PH analysis showed that classical patients treated with FFX had a significantly longer OS time (HR (95% CI) = 2.32 (1.29-4.17)). This result remained significant in a multivariate Cox PH, adjusting for age and ECOG, (HR=2.5 (1.15-5.44)).<br \/>Conclusion: In this real-world cohort of advanced PDAC patients, we showed that classical patients with low ECOG scores had superior OS with 1L FFX treatment compared to 1L GnP. These findings demonstrate the potential for PurIST to aid in optimal treatment selection for patients with advanced PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,RNA sequencing,Survival,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Therapeutic developments have shifted first-line (1L) therapy in the metastatic setting to immunotherapy (IO)-based regimens, albeit with heterogeneity in response. Patients harboring KEAP1 and STK11 mutations have been reported to exhibit both poorer outcomes and IO treatment resistance. Recent work suggests gene expression signatures which characterize mutant phenotypes may better identify those with compromised IO response. Leveraging a molecular real-world dataset of metastatic NSCLC patients treated with 1L IO, we aimed to evaluate gene expression signatures representing KEAP1 and STK11-mutated phenotypes and their impact on real-world outcomes.<br \/>Methods: Metastatic NSCLC patients who received 1L anti-PD(L)1 as a monotherapy or in combination were identified from the multimodal real-world database of Tempus Labs, Inc. All patients in the analytical cohort had tissue biopsies sequenced on Tempus targeted DNA and whole transcriptome RNA assays within 90 days prior to the start of the 1L IO regimen. Patients were negative for actionable mutations with record duration of at least 30 days from 1L initiation. KEAP1 and STK11 mutants were identified with likely pathogenic and\/or pathogenic mutations as annotated by Tempus bioinformatic pipelines. Gene expression signatures related to these mutations were obtained from recently published literature. Evaluation of mutations or signatures as genomic markers for IO non-response were conducted using real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival (rwOS).<br \/>Results: A total of 332 patients were included in the study (45% IO monotherapy, 55% IO combination therapy). Previously validated biomarkers, including tumor mutation burden, T-cell inflamed GEP signature, and PD(L)1 expression, were associated with prolonged rwPFS. KEAP1 mutations were observed in 9% of analytical cohort with a higher proportion in non-squamous (11%) compared with squamous (4%) samples. For STK11, 10% were identified as mutants with a similar histology distribution (12% vs. 3%). Neither KEAP1 mutations nor related gene signatures evaluated in this study were significantly associated with real-world survival outcomes. Patients harboring STK11 mutations trended towards poor outcomes; furthermore, those with higher STK11 inactivation signature score were associated with shorter rwPFS and rwOS.<br \/>Conclusions: STK11 inactivation phenotype described by a gene expression signature was able to distinguish patients with significantly poorer survival outcomes. This finding would need validation in independent cohorts. This real-world cohort study adds supporting evidence for the utility of gene expression signatures encompassing mutant phenotypes for patient stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Anti-PD-1,Molecular markers,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, not all patients benefit similarly from these therapies even after selection based on the currently approved biomarker PD-L1 expression. Previous studies have shown that mutations in certain genes like <i>STK11<\/i> and <i>KEAP1<\/i> may predict non-response to these therapies. Mutations in <i>STK11<\/i> occur in 25-30% of aNSCLC patients. We have used a real-world clinico-genomics dataset to investigate how this <i>STK11<\/i>+ aNSCLC patient population responds to ICIs in the context of other underlying co-mutations and whether some beneficial co-mutations may help patients overcome resistance due to their <i>STK11<\/i> status.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The ConcertAI Genome360<sup>TM<\/sup> NSCLC dataset (N=14193) was used in this retrospective study. aNSCLC patients who tested positive for <i>STK11<\/i> mutations and received ICIs were considered (N=377). Based on their response to ICIs, the patients were divided into responder (N= 192) and non-responder (N=185) cohorts. Other genes with pathogenic mutations, fusions, and copy number changes were identified in both cohorts, and enrichment analysis was performed to identify co-mutations significantly enriched in one cohort vs the other. Once significant co-mutations were identified, pathway analysis was performed, taking into account the immune signaling network to help rationalise and validate the results.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> One potential mechanism by which STK11 mutations influence the response to ICIs is through downregulation of the cGas-Sting pathway, which has been shown to play an important role in ICI response. Our co-mutational analysis also strongly supported this theory. We found that additional mutations that can nullify the effect of <i>STK11<\/i> mutations on the cGas-Sting pathway led to a positive response (p=0.002) within the <i>STK11<\/i>+ cohort.

We have previously shown that our flow cytometry-based predictive precision medicine platform (PPMP) predicts patient outcomes for standard-of-care (SOC) AML treatments using fresh blood or bone marrow samples with high precision. Here, we wanted to test the feasibility and efficacy of the PPMP on cryopreserved patient-derived leukemic samples. However, cryopreserved leukemic samples are known for exhibiting low viability and cell recovery, rendering their practical utilization often challenging. In this study, we adapt an existing methodology for cryopreservation for patient-derived leukemic cells to investigate the potential of cryopreserved samples as an alternative to fresh samples for ex vivo prediction of treatment outcomes on our PPMP.<br \/>Methods: We screened freshly isolated white blood cells from AML patients on the PPMP to assess their response to multiple SOC single agents and combinations. The assay was also run without drug treatments immediately after receiving the fresh sample (&#8804; 2 days from draw) to establish a phenotype baseline. The cryopreserved samples were processed using a similar protocol, with post-thaw culture times of either 24 or 48 hours in two types of cytokine-containing media. A comparative analysis between untreated fresh and cryopreserved samples determined the optimal post-thaw culture time for cryopreserved samples. Once culture time was optimized, we screened cryopreserved samples on the PPMP with identical SOC drug conditions as the fresh samples and compared the response of leukemic blasts to drug treatment as well as impacts on other phenotypic markers.<br \/>Results: Based on our preliminary data, we found that culturing cryopreserved cells for 24 hours post-thaw was sufficient to maintain a minimum cell viability of 80% while closely maintaining a phenotype that recapitulated that of the corresponding fresh samples. In response to drug treatments within the ex vivo assays, preliminary data support a correlation (Decitabine single agent, R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.81) between the response profiles of cryopreserved and fresh patient samples as gauged from AUC calculations.<br \/>Conclusion: While the preferred method for screening is to use fresh patient samples, many practical constraints make it challenging or unfeasible. The ability of Notable Lab&#8217;s high-throughput platform to use cryopreserved samples opens the doors to enhanced retrospective studies leveraging clinically annotated data from biobanks or clinical trials. These retrospective studies provide a substantial reduction in the time needed to conclude such investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biobank,Acute myeloid leukemia,Chemotherapy,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Altered expression patterns of Glutathione Peroxidases (GPX1-8) have been connected to the outcome of many cancers. Still, GPX expression patterns and their use as prognostic biomarkers in UCEC have yet to be explored. This project aimed to evaluate the potential utility of GPX1-8 as prognostic biomarkers for UCEC.<br \/>Methods: To identify GPX1-8 expression alterations in UCEC tumors, the UCEC tissue samples (n=543) from the Cancer Genome Atlas Database (TCGA) dataset were analyzed using the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis portal (UALCAN) software to statistically compare mRNA levels between UCEC tumor samples and non-tumorigenic uterine tissue. To determine the impacts of GPX1-8 expression on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), the UCEC TCGA dataset was analyzed using the pan-cancer RNA seq platform using Kaplan-Meier Plotter (KM plotter). The patient cohort was split into groups according to high GPX expression status and low GPX expression status using the trichotomization function in KM plotter. Hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and log-rank P value were calculated using the KM plotter platform.<br \/>Results: GPX1, GPX2, GPX4, GPX7, and GPX8 were differentially expressed in UCEC tumor tissue compared to non-cancerous uterine tissue. However, unfavorable OS in patients associated with low GPX4 expression in UCEC tumor samples (P=0.0043, HR=0.39, 95% CI=0.2-0.76) only. Unfavorable RFS in UCEC patients only correlated with low GPX1 expression (P=0.019, HR=0.43, 95% CI=0.21-0.89) or high GPX6 expression (P=0.0032, HR=2.37, 95% CI=1.31-4.27) in UCEC tumor samples.<br \/>Conclusion: Low GPX1 and GPX4 expression and high GPX6 expression may be novel unfavorable UCEC prognostic markers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Prognostic markers,Glutathione,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Real-world-data (RWD), collected from larger and more varied patient populations, can address inherent limitations of RCTs and aid in clinical trial design and drug approval. However, with the challenges of RWD, unlocking its full potential for tumor target and biomarker identification and validation demands innovative analytical approaches. Here we present RWD analyses of ConcertAI<sup>&#174;<\/sup> electronic health records (EHR) linked with Caris Lab data for 2,659 lung cancer patients. Comprehensive genomics analyses incorporate WES and RNA-seq data, coupled with rich clinical EHR data. By integrating clinical and genomics data, we showcase the potential of harnessing RWD as follows: (1) we investigated genomic alterations across five histology groups (adenocarcinoma, squamous, large cell, small cell lung cancer [SCLC], neuroendocrine [NE] lung cancer). Notably, TP53 and LRP1B mutations were prevalent across all groups. LRP1B mutations correlated with higher tumor mutation burden, indicative of a favorable response to immunotherapy. Biallelic TP53 and RB1 inactivation was predominant in SCLC and NE lung tumors. The five histological groups exhibit distinct expression profiles, reflecting tumor intrinsic characteristics. Most immune gene signature scores were significantly lower in SCLC and NE tumors, aligned with that they are cold tumors with immune resistance, except CD56-centered NK and neuroendocrine gene signatures; (2) we analyzed patient treatment patterns and persistence by line of therapy. Among the 206 NSCLC patients with clinically actionable EGFR mutations, 143 received targeted therapy during their treatment courses (69.4%). Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) was used as a surrogate clinical outcome endpoint. TTD was significantly longer when TKI was the first line treatment compared to later lines (<i>p<\/i> = 0.01), while the trend is opposite for ICI where TTD is significantly shorter in the 1<sup>st<\/sup> line setting (<i>p<\/i> = 0.025); (3) we highlight the unique potential of leveraging H&#38;E imaging modality in such RWD. In summary, we successfully identified unique molecular signatures among various lung cancer histological groups, pinpointed distinct subpopulations within lung adenocarcinoma and squamous tumors linked to their immune phenotypes, and investigated the different patient treatment patterns and outcomes, facilitating personalized medicine.

In nonsquamous mNSCLC, detecting biomarkers where targeted therapies exist (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600E variant, MET exon 14 skipping variant, RET and PD-L1) has become essential for adequate clinical care. This study investigated real-world use of these biomarker tests, their characteristics, and associated use of targeted therapies in mNSCLC patients in the US.<br \/>Methods: Adults &#8805;18 years old with stage IV mNSCLC from the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived de identified database (01\/2011 - 04\/2023). The proportion of patients receiving biomarker tests, timing, characteristics, test type (single, multiple or next-generation sequencing), and proportion of patients receiving guideline recommended associated targeted therapies (i.e. actionable treatment) was assessed. Actionable treatment was defined in study years where at least one actionable therapy was FDA approved (biomarker, therapy, date: ALK, crizotinib, Aug 2011; BRAF V600E, dabrafenib+trametinib, Jul 2015; EGFR, afatinib, Jul 2013; MET exon 14 skipping, capmatinib, May 2020; PD-L1, pembrolizumab, Oct 2015; RET, pralsetinib, Sep 2020; ROS-1, crizotinib, Mar 2016).<br \/>Results: In 42,037 patients with mNSCLC, the proportion of patients receiving each test were: ALK: 71.6%, BRAF: 48.8%, EGFR: 74.9%, MET: 41.4%, PD-L1: 49.3%, RET: 42.3%, and ROS1: 54.2%. Median (Q1, Q3) time from mNSCLC diagnosis to first biomarker result was 21 (12, 37) days. Tissue was the most common sample type for biomarker testing, although sampling by blood has increased in recent years. Multiple testing methods were more common in ALK and PD-L1 (48.1% and 50.3%, respectively) and next generation sequencing was more common in the other biomarkers (BRAF: 77.7%, EGFR: 57.1%, MET: 74.1%, RET: 70.7%, ROS1: 54.0%). Testing rates increased from 2011 through 2023 for each biomarker, with the highest rates in 2023: ALK (87.7%), BRAF (85.2%), EGFR (88.7%), MET (85.7%), PDL1 (78.7%), RET (84.8%), and ROS1 (86.9%). Testing rates were similar when timing was restricted to a 1-year window from mNSCLC diagnosis. Receipt of actionable treatment varied by biomarker, in order of increasing frequency: RET+ (23.0%), MET+ (34.0%), BRAF+ (42.7%), PDL1+ (56.3%), ROS1+ (59.8%), EGFR+ (70.6%), and ALK+ (89.0%). Generally, across all biomarkers, receipt of actionable therapy increased in more recent years.<br \/>Conclusion: Current real-world biomarker testing rates and use of actionable treatments may reflect increased adoption of clinical guideline recommendations. Despite increased testing, use of actionable therapy remains low for certain biomarkers. Further improvements in the implementation of robust biomarker testing to use appropriate therapies are needed, which can lead to better patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Targeted therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

FPM offers personalized treatment by utilizing high-throughput screening of 10-100 compounds on patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs), assessing both efficacy and relative sensitivity, with results reported to the molecular tumor board within 2 weeks. The focus of this study is the cross-laboratory validity of this approach in glioblastoma, an essential step towards confirming FPM's consistency and potential as a game-changing tool in personalized cancer treatment.<br \/>Methods: Patient-derived tumor cells from glioblastoma cases were cultured for 3-7 days followed by automated high-throughput screening. The drug library contained ~80 compounds, including specific numbers of cytotoxic and targeted drugs. Drug response curves informed the calculation of sensitivity scores, which were compared to the AimedBio reference library to identify potentially effective drug candidates for a given patient. Additionally, corresponding tumor tissues were analyzed through panel sequencing of 50 glioma-related genes.<br \/>Results: A total of &#62;50 patients with glioblastoma were included, with subgroups from CBmed, Austria, and AimedBio, South Korea. PDC cultures were successful in over 90% of cases, and informative high-throughput drug screening results were obtained. Integration of drug response with genetic tumor profiles yielded testable treatment candidates. Additionally, transcontinental shipping and re-screening of PDCs yielded comparable results, affirming the robustness of the method.<br \/>Conclusion: This study establishes and validates high-throughput drug screening platforms specifically tailored for functional precision medicine, utilizing glioblastoma as a model. The findings reveal a high degree of validity in the drug screening results, reinforced by the excellent performance of both technical and biological replicates. Such success not only lays a solid foundation for further academic and pharmaceutical collaborations but also opens the path for regulatory approval, bringing the platforms one step closer to clinical implementation.

However, a persistent challenge for treating oncologists lies in selecting the most effective patient-specific therapeutic strategy due to the molecular rationale, disease relevance, and patient-specific issues. To address this challenge, we have developed an algorithm that incorporates both molecular and clinical evidence-based criteria to rank therapeutic strategies in order to deliver optimal care and improve outcomes in patients with malignancy. The purpose of this part of our studies was to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of our novel algorithm.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>History of present illness and comprehensive genomic profiling results of 306 patients with malignant tumors were reviewed by Avera Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) from June 2021 to February 2023. Therapeutic recommendations were provided with the Matching Score that we used in the I-PREDICT study based on molecular matching only as well as with the Ranking Score calculated by our novel algorithm with the criteria not only focusing on molecular matching, but also including disease relevance, patient-specific clinical considerations and treatment availability as weighting factors (Cohort 2). The other 50 patients with previously treated solid tumors reviewed by MTB (before 2018) and treatment recommendations provided with Matching Score only, were used as a control group (Cohort 1). The matching rates from recommendations and treatment outcomes of the patients were then assessed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In Cohort 1, of the 50 patients, 33 patients (66%) received matched therapeutic plans recommended by our MTB.

Multiple studies have shown that plasma CGP tests can result in genomically matched treatment for cancer patients, especially in gastrointestinal cancer. However, data for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain limited.<br \/>Methods: We searched the database of the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT), which comprised 99.7% of the CGP data under insurance coverage in Japan. NSCLC patients analyzed with FoundationOne Liquid CDx (F1LCDx) between August 1 2021 to July 31 2023 were included, all of whom were previously treated.<br \/>Result: 694 patients with NSCLC underwent liquid biopsy. Among them, 572 cases were adenocarcinoma, and 71 were squamous cell carcinoma. The median age was 68 years (range: 24-93), and 423 patients were male. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations, <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements, <i>ROS1<\/i> rearrangements, <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutations, <i>BRAF<\/i> V600E, <i>RET<\/i> fusions, <i>ERBB2<\/i> mutations, and <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C were detected in 174 cases (25.1%), 18 cases (2.6%), 2 cases (0.3%), 9 cases (1.3%), 3 cases (0.4%), 7 cases (1.0%), 26 cases (3.7%) and 17 cases (2.4%), respectively. Among the 499 patients without known driver mutations, driver mutations were detected by F1LCDx in 60 patients (12.0%). The detection rate of each driver oncogene is shown in Table 1. Conversely, among the 174, 20, 9 and 3 patients with known <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, or BRAF V600E alterations, F1LCDx showed false negative results in 48 (27.6%), 10(50.0%), 8 (88.9%), and 3 cases (100%) (<i>EGFR\/BRAF<\/i> vs. <i>ALK\/ROS1<\/i>, p = 0.001), respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: In patients without known driver oncogenes, mutations associated with approved therapeutic implications were detected in 12.0%.

We investigated genomic changes in a large cohort of patients with clinically directed DNA sequencing of multiple LUAD samples.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed longitudinal genomic data from 524 patients with at least two LUAD samples sequenced with MSK-IMPACT- a targeted panel that identifies somatic mutations, copy number alterations and gene fusions in 341-505 genes. Our analysis of 1084 tumors (634 primaries [P] and 450 metastases [M]) included 189 matched P-P pairs, 99 M-M pairs and 271 P-M pairs. Pairs were required to share an identical somatic mutation to confirm relatedness. Additional criteria included: excision of primary tumor prior to excision of the metastasis in P-M pairs collected over 90 days apart and collection of M-M pairs from the same anatomic site. Intra-pulmonary metastases were removed from P-P pairs.<br \/>Results: Tumor mutational burden was correlated in paired specimens from the same patient, irrespectively of P-P (R= 0.75, p&#60;0.001; Spearman correlation), P-M (R=0.72, p&#60;0.001) or M-M (R=0.6, p&#60;0.001) status. Chromosomal instability, measured as the fraction of genome altered by copy number changes (FGA), was also correlated in P-P (R=0.69, p&#60;0.001) and M-M (R=0.57, p&#60;0.001) pairs, but tended to increase in metastases with respect to matched primaries (median 0.58 vs. 0.72, p&#60;0.001; Wilcoxon test). In M-M pairs, changes in FGA differed by anatomic site. Liver pairs had the strongest correlation (n=17 pairs, R=0.86, p &#60;0.01), whereas brain pairs had the weakest (n=35 pairs, R=0.085, p=0.71). Most somatic mutations were shared between paired samples (P-P: 639\/1055, 60%, P-M: 1563\/2877, 54%, M-M: 550\/958, 57%), including those in LUAD drivers- <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, and <i>EGFR<\/i>. Conversely, most oncogenic copy number alterations - including <i>CDKN2A<\/i> deletions and <i>MET<\/i> amplifications - were private to one specimen (P-P: 183\/276, 66%, P-M: 880\/1148, 76%, M-M: 430\/601, 71%), most often in the later sample (P-P: 113\/183, 61%, P-M: 636\/880, 72%, M-M: 212\/430, 49%). Clinically targetable alterations (OncoKB Level 1) tended to be shared by tumor pairs from the same patient (93% shared vs. 6% private in P-P, p&#60;0.01; 85% vs. 14% in P-M, p&#60;0.01; 78% vs. 21% in M-M, p &#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: In LUAD, metastatic specimens exhibit increased chromosomal instability in relation to their matched primaries. This translates into unique copy number alterations detected only in the metastasis. By contrast, driver mutations - which account for most of the clinically targetable alterations with currently approved FDA drugs - are more often shared between paired samples from the same patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Metastasis,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Although druggable alterations are identified in a large fraction of pediatric cancer patients, the extent to which point-of-care genomic testing directly impacts therapeutic outcomes of individual patients in real-world settings is less well-known. A review of patients sequenced through the Precision in Pediatric Sequencing (PIPseq) program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) was conducted to describe outcomes of patients treated with a molecularly matched targeted therapy (MTT).<br \/>Methods: Matched tumor-normal whole exome and tumor transcriptome sequencing was conducted in a CLIA-certified laboratory at CUIMC between January 2013 and March 2023 on samples from 373 high risk pediatric cancer patients including those with &#60;50% survival, rare cancers lacking standard therapies, and relapsed\/refractory disease. All cases were reviewed at a multi-disciplinary molecular tumor board and reports were transmitted to the electronic health record (EHR). EHR data were reviewed to identify patients who received a MTT. Tumor-specific response and progression-free survival (PFS) among the MTT cohort were investigated. Clinical benefit was further assessed using the Growth Modulation Index (GMI) whereby patients served as their own control. GMI is the ratio of PFS on the MTT therapy to the PFS on the most recent prior therapy. A ratio of &#62;\/=1.3 indicates meaningful clinical activity.<br \/>Results: Thirty pediatric patients (solid tumors, n=5; CNS tumors, n=15; hematologic malignancies, n=10) received a MTT. Median age at sequencing was 11 years, range 10 months-23 years. Median time to MTT from sequencing was 4.5 months, range 7 days to 19.2 months. Best overall response included 7 complete responses (23%), 6 partial responses (20%), 5 with stable disease (17%), 10 with progressive disease (33%), and 2 indeterminate due to early death or lack of follow-up during therapy (7%). GMI was calculated for 19\/30 patients (63%); median GMI=1.1. 11 patients were excluded due to lack of prior therapy, early death, insufficient follow-up, or lack of progression between prior and targeted therapies. GMI ratios indicated clinical benefit from MTT for 12\/19 patients (63%), median GMI=1.5.<br \/>Conclusions: Clinical comprehensive molecular profiling for pediatric patients with high risk cancers identified patients who are candidates for MTT. Overall, MTT led to stable disease, partial or complete response, for 60% of patients. Utilizing GMI ratios as an indicator of clinical benefit for select patients provided additional information beyond traditional endpoints. Twelve patients with GMI &#62;\/=1.3 experienced improved PFS compared to their most recent prior therapy. These results demonstrate real-world clinical benefit from MTT, supporting molecular profiling of pediatric high risk tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Precision medicine,Molecular profiling,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The type of <i>VHL<\/i> alteration has been shown to impact downstream VHL expression and clinical phenotype. However, current screening practices do not differ based on VHL genetic subtype. We aim to define the genotype-phenotype association among an institutional cohort of VHL patients.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 69 patients (27 families) with von Hippel-Lindau at the Huntsman Cancer Institute from 1998-2023. 55% (38\/69) patients have documented VHL variants for review. We evaluated the association of VHL type with risk of pheochromocytoma (Pheo), renal cancer (RCC), and hemangioblastoma (HB). <i>t<\/i> test and Fisher&#8217;s exact test were used to assess differences in clinicopathologic characteristics by VHL Type. P-value &#60; 0.05 was considered significant.<br \/>Results: We identified 24 unique <i>VHL <\/i>alterations among 38 patients. 66% (25\/38) of patients had missense mutations, 10% (4\/38) nonsense mutations, 21% (8\/38) splice mutations, and 3% (1\/38) deletion\/duplication (Table 1). The median age at VHL diagnosis was 31 years old (range 4-76). VHL Type 2 was more common, 87% (33\/38). All VHL Type 1 patients (5\/5) developed RCC and HB. No patients with VHL Type 1 developed PheoPara. Of the VHL Type 2 patients, 39% (13\/33) have not developed any VHL-associated clinical manifestations. Of the 33 patients diagnosed with VHL Type 2, 18% (6\/33) were diagnosed with PheoPara, 30% (10\/33) with RCC, and 48% (16\/33) with HB.<br \/>Conclusion: VHL type 2 comprised the majority of VHL diagnoses in our cohort with a notable absence of PheoPara phenotype. VHL Type 1 had higher penetrance and a higher prevalence for RCC and hemangioblastoma. With validation in larger cohorts, this cohort supports utilizing VHL genetic subtypes to personalize surveillance. Additional VHL testing for the remainder of the cohort is ongoing.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B4BE0931-22C3-4A1E-B14F-52030235845E}\"><caption>Clinicopathologic characteristics of von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome cohort with known genetic mutations<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All (n=38)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Type 1 (n=5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Type 2 (n=33)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">p-value<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age<div>Mean (Median)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;

Even with ADTi, 20% of these pts progress within a year and experience poor overall survival (OS). Identifying baseline genomic biomarkers predicting poor survival outcomes in pts receiving ADTi remains an unmet need.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this IRB-approved retrospective study, pts with a new diagnosis of mCSPC who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling of primary prostate tissue or metastatic site or cell-free DNA and treated with ADTi (ADT with ARPI or docetaxel) were included. Genomic alterations with an incidence &#62; 5% were included in the analysis. Study endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from the start of therapy for mCSPC to progression (per PCWG-2) or death from any cause. OS was defined from the start of therapy for mCSPC to the date of death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up. A multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model was used, adjusting for age at mCSPC diagnosis, disease volume (high vs. low), Gleason score (&#8805; 8 vs. &#60; 8), Log<sub>2<\/sub>PSA at baseline, and initial timing of metastasis (de novo vs. non de novo). A subgroup analysis by intensification treatment received (ARPI vs. docetaxel) was also performed. Missing baseline characteristics such as volume of disease, Gleason score, and Log<sub>2<\/sub>PSA were multiply imputed on 50 chained equations using &#8220;mice&#8221; package in R. All the analyses were done using R version 4.3.1.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 289 pts were included in the study. The baseline characteristics of the cohort will be presented in the meeting.

Recently, tumors with IHC 1+ or 2+\/negative FISH have been classified as &#8216;HER2-low&#8217;. The development of novel HER2 agents has shown clinical benefit in this subset of patients. Information on the clinical characteristics of these patients which could be prognostic, and which could impact therapeutic options is limited.<br \/>Methods: This was an IRB-approved study. Relevant patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment details of patients with metastatic breast cancer seen at our center from 2018 to 2021 were collected by chart review. All data analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1, and a p-value &#8804; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: A total of 102 patients with metastatic breast cancer were included. Patients were divided as HER2+, HER-, HER2 low ER+ and HER2 low ER -. 66.6% of patients had HER2 low disease. Patients with HER2 low ER- disease were more likely to have tumors that were of higher grade (grade 3, 71.4%, p=0.003), higher mean Ki67 (60%, p&#60;0.001), and of ductal histology (100%, p=0.006). There was a statistically significant difference in PFS among the four groups (p=0.001). Median survival was longer in patients with HER2 low ER+ compared to the HER2- group. (1.42 vs 0.58, p&#60;0.001, Table 1). Amongst HER2 low ER+ patients, there was a significant PFS difference in those treated with CDK4\/6 inhibitors compared to chemotherapy (2.83 vs. 0.67, p=0.009). We found no difference in PFS between patients who were HER2 1+ ER+ and HER2 2+ ER+. In multivariate analysis, there was no significant association of race, grade, menopausal status, Ki67, histologic subtype, and metastatic sites with PFS.<br \/>Conclusion: In this small single-center retrospective study, patients with metastatic HER2 low ER- breast cancer had higher-grade tumors. HER2 low ER+ patients had a better PFS compared to HER2- patients. This seems to suggest that the HER2 low group may have some inherent biologic differences.

Treatment approaches vary based on disease severity. Despite established therapies, assessing treatment response, particularly regarding peripheral blood monocytes, lacks comprehensive markers.<br \/>Methods: We studied 76 LCH patients, collecting data on demographics, diagnostic methods, and treatment responses. Peripheral blood absolute monocyte counts were analyzed at key time points, including disease onset, progression, and post-therapy reinstatement, using statistical tests for comparison.<br \/>Results: Analyzing data from 76 patients (average age: 38), we found diverse disease presentations, with common imaging modalities being CT (37), PET (29), and MRI (22).

Our finding of increased monocyte count during disease progression may suggest elevated circulating LCH or heightened monocyte production for subsequent differentiation, potentially contributing to MHC Class 1 upregulation. This phenomena mirrors published findings from our own group in patients with Rosai Dorfman and Erdheim Chester Disease. To further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of LCH and explore the etiology of this monocyte trend, genetic sequencing analysis is in progress. Ultimately, monitoring peripheral blood monocyte dynamics could offer valuable insights into LCH progression and treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monocyte,Metastasis,S100A4,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

In recent years, the importance of vitamin D metabolism in immune system regulation and cancer prevention has been studied with increased focus. With the advent of cancer immunotherapies this has become more important. Multiple recent publications document that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in cancer patients. This has also been observed specifically in prostate cancer patients, with a high percentage of these deficient patients being of African- American ancestry. It has been theorized that high levels of vitamin D deficiency among African American prostate cancer patients could contribute to worse cancer outcomes and increased health disparities. However, routine vitamin D testing has not been commonly performed in the oncologic community. We hypothesized that deficient levels of vitamin D could lead to inferior prostate cancer outcomes in men with a wide range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. In this project we recorded vitamin D levels in prostate cancer patients at a large community oncology group and evaluated them by stage, pathologic data, survival, race\/ethnicity, and other clinical features.<br \/>Methods: This study is a retrospective, observational study of the data from the electronic medical records of patients with prostate cancer who received vitamin D level testing at Florida Cancer Specialists &#38; Research Institute from 2008- 2023, throughout the state of Florida. All data used in this study will constitute secondary data, it will have been collected originally for clinical use in the general oncology practice setting. No date parameters or patient limits will be applied to this study, and all eligible patients are included.<br \/>Results: 451 patients with prostate cancer had determination of vitamin D levels, out of a total of 27,772 prostate cancer patients in the database. 38% of the prostate cancer patients analyzed had low 25-OH vitamin D levels (&#60;32 ng\/ml). Patients with low vitamin D levels had an average Gleason score of 7.46. Patients with low vitamin D levels who died had an average survival of 144 months. Patients with low vitamin D levels who presented with localized disease had a 35% chance of eventually developing castrate-resistant disease. 45% of the low vitamin D group developed metastatic disease during their course of treatment. Further comparisons of vitamin D levels with pathologic data, survival\/longevity, race\/ethnicity, and clinical course will be evaluated and presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vitamin D,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

It is more common on the right side of the colon but can occur anywhere within the colon. Although other BRAF mutations existed, current research primarily focused on BRAF V600E. Most clinical data sets were centered on advanced colorectal cancer. There was limited understanding of the molecular characteristics of early-stage colorectal cancer patients with BRAF mutations, which impacted postoperative prognosis management, including refining adjuvant therapy regimens. Therefore, we analyzed the molecular characteristics of early-stage CRC surgical patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tumor tissue from 767 early-stage CRC patients diagnosed between 2021 to 2022 in China were analyzed using NGS (panel on 733 gene) to validate the mutation characteristics. Tumor specimens were tested for the BRAF mutation and MSI status.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Among 767 early CRC cases tested, BRAF mutations accounted for 6.52% (50\/767), with 62% (31\/50) being BRAF V600E, followed by 14% (7\/50) for BRAF D594G. Notably, there were two cases of fusion variations, TRIM24-BRAF, and one case of BRAF copy gain. Among the BRAF mutation population, 11 cases were MSI-H, with 8 of them being BRAF V600E\/MSI-H. Only one MSH-H patient had a germline mutation in the MLH1 gene, with a concurrent mutation in BRAF K601T.Interestingly, when comparing the mutation profiles of the BRAF V600E population with those of the non-V600E BRAF mutation population, we found distinct co-mutated genes despite both being BRAF mutations. In the BRAF V600E group, the top three frequently mutated genes were TP53 (52%), RNF43 (32%), and SMAD4 (32%). Additionally, the BRAF V600E\/MSI-H subgroup presented a distinct<br \/>mutation profile, with minimal occurrences of TP53 and SMAD4 mutations. In the non-V600E BRAF mutation group, the top three frequently mutated genes were TP53 (84%), APC (63%), and KRAS (32%).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In examining the mutation profile characteristics of early colorectal cancer with BRAF mutations, the proportion of BRAF V600E\/MSI-H appeared to have been lower than that reported in advanced cases. Furthermore, in terms of the frequency of co-mutated genes, it seemed that BRAF V600E had exhibited a higher malignant driving mutation effect as a single gene, while non-V600E mutations had required more cooperative tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Analyzing the molecular characteristics of early colorectal cancer patients with V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations could help improve postoperative management and further our understanding of tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,BRAF,Microsatellite instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Due to constitutive activation, PIM1 is regulated at transcription and degradation. We have previously shown PIM1 protein levels are elevated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) compared to normal kidney and that PIM1 inhibition induces tumor regression in pre-clinical models. Current approved therapies for ccRCC do not inhibit PIM1. We hypothesized that high PIM1 expression will adversely affect clinical outcomes in ccRCC.<br \/>Methods: Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data in the Caris Life Sciences database were examined for PIM1expression and overall survival (OS; defined as time from diagnosis to last contact or death). We assessed PIM1 in primary and metastatic ccRCC, and the impact on survival in ccRCC and papillary RCC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with high PIM1 were also determined.<br \/>Results: PIM1, in the highest quintile, was associated with a shorter OS (869 vs 1738 days; HR 2.629; CI 1.495 - 4.611; p&#38;lt;0.001; N=147) in ccRCC. PIM1 is enriched in metastatic (median 7.62 transcripts per million (TPM), CI 6.35 - 9.26) vs primary (median 5.07 TPM; CI 4.28 - 6.45; p=0.0025) RCC. Upregulated DEGs associated with high PIM1 are involved in the extracellular matrix. IL-6 expression, known to correlate with worse outcomes, was 6.5-fold higher in PIM1 high vs PIM1 low (13.2 vs 2.1 TPM, p&#38;lt;0.0001) RCC. High PIM1 was associated with poor survival following checkpoint inhibition (HR 3.714, 95% CI 1.339 - 10.303, p=0.007) and a trend towards poorer survival following mTOR inhibition and VEGF inhibition. PIM1 did not affect survival in papillary RCC.<br \/>Conclusions: Real-word data show that high PIM1 correlates with poorer survival in ccRCC but not in papillary RCC. This effect likely persists independent of treatment received. PIM1 enrichment in metastatic ccRCC, and associated DEGs, suggest that PIM1 influences the extracellular matrix to promote metastases. The correlation between IL-6expression and PIM1 supports our prior data that an IL-6\/JAK\/STAT\/PIM1 pathway is involved in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,PIM1 kinase,Interleukin-6,JAK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
