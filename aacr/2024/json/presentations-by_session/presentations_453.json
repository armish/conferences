[{"Abstract":"Background: Recent studies indicate a correlation between increased stromal composition in tumors and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across various cancer types. Specifically, the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the stromal compartment significantly influence the tumor microenvironment, affecting cancer cell proliferation and immune cell recruitment. However, identifying and quantifying the ECM at the collagen fiber level in whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to its inherent heterogeneity and complexity. In this work, we utilized statistical analysis and a deep learning (DL)-based approach to identify and assess collagen in the ECM, examining its characteristics in relation to the ICIs treatment response in gastric cancer.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed 116 WSIs of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained slides before ICIs treatment from three institutions. Responders were defined as those with a complete response or partial response (N=18); those with stable disease (SD) (N=34) or progressive disease (PD) (N=64) were considered non-responders (N=98). For non-responders, post-treatment H&#38;E slides were available for 21 patients; SD (N=5) and PD (N=16). We applied a DL-based second harmonic generation (SHG) synthesis algorithm to tumor regions identified by a tumor detection model. We then calculated various collagen properties, including volume, fiber orientation and alignment, waviness, straightness, and fiber thickness, based on collagen fiber centerlines extracted from the generated SHG images. An attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) model was trained to automatically predict the treatment response solely based on collagen features. The dataset of 116 pre-treatment slides was divided into training and validation subsets using stratified 3-fold cross-validation. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the trained models.<br \/>Results: Collagen fiber features were significantly associated with ICIs response. Notably, ICIs responders have a decrease in collagen waviness and fiber orientation variation (p-value&#60;0.05, by Mann-Whitney U test). Among non-responders, the PD group showed a statistical decrease in waviness after treatment (p-value&#60;0.05, by Mann-Whitney U test). The ABMIL model achieved a mean AUC score of 0.823, with a standard deviation of 0.023.<br \/>Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of collagen in the ECM, and its properties in relation to gastric cancer ICIs response within Tumor Immune Microenvironment. We also developed a model using collagen features and demonstrated high accuracy in predicting treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Immune response,Tumor microenvironment,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Here, we describe a novel pathway of cancer cell-monocyte communication mediated by sEVs. Since sEVs carry cargoes that alter recipient cell phenotypes, we analyzed via proteomic analysis sEVs released from PC3 PrCa cells. Using CRISPR Cas9 methods, we downregulated IFIT3 (Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats-3, member of the interferon-stimulated gene family) in PC3 PrCa cell (IFIT3KO). We then isolated sEVs from PC3 or IFIT3KO cells by using differential ultracentrifugation followed by iodixanol density gradient. Our proteomic analysis of IFIT3KO sEVs compared to PC3 sEVs shows that IFIT3 downregulation results in a significant upregulation of a metalloreductase, STEAP4 (six-transmembrane-epithelial antigen of the prostate 4), which is increased in PrCa cells and promotes PrCa cell proliferation and survival. STEAP4 is also known to promote an anti-inflammatory response in monocytes and macrophages. We then, investigated whether PrCa sEVs enriched in STEAP4 have a causal effect on monocyte functions and phenotype by using adhesion and migration assays as well as flow cytometry. Our results show that while all PrCa sEVs stimulate the adhesion of healthy donor or non-metastatic PrCa patient monocytes, only PrCa sEVs expressing STEAP4 increase their migration. In parallel, we provide evidence that all PrCa sEVs affect some of the M2 (CD163 or CD204) and M1 (CD80 or HLA DR) polarization markers analyzed in healthy donor monocytes. We show that there is a transitional state induced by PrCa sEVs in healthy donor monocytes, which occurs in a STEAP4-independent manner. This state mimics the non-metastatic PrCa patient monocyte phenotype. In conclusion, we describe a unique pathway whereby PrCa cell sEVs expressing STEAP4 promote monocyte migration with partial changes to their polarization.<br \/>Funding: This study was supported by NCI P01-CA140043, R01-CA224769, Pennsylvania DOH - Cure award to L.R.L","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Interferons,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Research supports the notion that tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a subpopulation of drug resistant stem-like tumor cells, are responsible for facilitating relapse and therapies targeting these fecund cells may prolong remission. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in therapy resistance, and tumor relapse. Cytotoxic chemotherapies have been shown to modify the stroma of the TME which may favor the survival of TICs displaying specific adhesion proteins. We and others have shown that NF-kB transcription factors RelA and RelB respond to signals from the ovarian TME to promote proliferation, chemoresistance, and survival. Our results further show that RelA and RelB regulate expression of specific integrins. Recently we found that TNF-like inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), a cytokine involved in tissue repair, and its only known receptor Fn14, are enriched following chemotherapy, leading to enhanced chemoresistance and survival of TICs. TWEAK also induces expression of specific integrins in ovarian TICs. Therefore, we hypothesize that NF-kB mediated integrin expression enables adhesion and survival of TICs to a chemotherapy modified extracellular matrix (ECM) to facilitate tumor repopulation and relapse. Using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) for CD117+ TICs, we found that a significant majority are enriched for integrin AVB3. Supporting a role for TWEAK-Fn14-NF-kB in mediating integrin expression we further show that integrin AVB3, but not AVB5 or A5B1, was significantly increased in CD117+ TICs in the presence of TWEAK and was dependent on Fn14 as demonstrated through knockdown experiments. RNA-sequencing analysis of tumor cells grown in spheroid conditions with RelA or RelB shRNA knockdown relative to control, show ITGAV is dependent on RelA while ITGB3 expression is dependent on RelB. Taken together, our findings suggest CD117+ TICs have enhanced expression of AVB3 and is further induced by TWEAK mediated NF-kB activity for adaptation to a stressful post-chemotherapy environment. Ongoing in vitro and in vivo studies are investigating the therapeutic benefit of targeting AVB3 or TWEAK in CD117+ TICs for prevention of adhesion and tumor repopulation following chemotherapy. These studies will uncover interactions between TICs and ECM through their unique expression of integrins and clarifies the role of NF-kB transcription factors RelA and RelB in regulating TIC survival in the post-chemotherapy TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Integrins,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

However, the mechanism of how the hyaluronic network is formed by cancer cells and regulates cancer progression and metastasis has not been known in detail. Therefore, we investigated the role of the hyaluronan network built-up by cancer cells in regulating cancer progression and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. Our study demonstrated that ZEB1, an EMT-inducing transcription factor, reconstructs the hyaluronan network to induce the expression of ITIH2, a hyaluronan-binding protein, and hyaluronic acid synthase-2 (HAS2), ZEB1 was also shown to control the isoform switching of CD44, a hyaluronan receptor. ITIH2 knockdown and HAS inhibition reduced the formation of hyaluronan cables and inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, the treatment of a specific ITIH2 inhibitor identified through deep learning-based screening suppressed the formation of hyaluronan cables, cell migration, and metastasis. These findings suggest that targeting the hyaluronan network could be a novel strategy for suppressing lung cancer progression and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hyaluronan,Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,Zinc finger proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Integrins (ITGs) are a diverse class of heterodimeric, transmembrane receptors that bind extracellularly to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and intracellularly to the cytoskeleton to integrate signals bi-directionally between the extracellular environment and cell interior. One of 18 &#945; subunits is paired with one of 6 &#946; subunits to create the 24 known &#945;&#946; ITGs in mammals. ITGs are expressed at low levels in normal tissue and can be upregulated in cancer cells in response to stress signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Altered expression of ITGs is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion. Targeting of the diverse ITG family members by inhibitors not specific to individual isoforms has obscured understanding of potentially distinct functions of each heterodimer. Through data mining of a genome wide CRISPR screening publicly available at the DepMap portal, we have identified a novel cancer dependency to ITG &#945;v&#946;5 in approximately 40% of NSCLC cell lines. Using small molecule ITG &#945;v inhibitors, we have mirrored sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines to their ITG &#945;v&#946;5 CRISPR scores, suggesting that these inhibitors function specifically through ITG &#945;v&#946;5 in cell lines. RNA sequencing analysis following &#945;v&#946;5 inhibition in human NSCLC cell lines revealed downregulation of YAP and E2F1 target genes with alterations in gene ontologies associated with cell cycling and cell death in sensitive, but not resistant, lines. This is consistent with the known function of YAP driving gene transcription promoting cell proliferation and survival, and of E2F1 being implicated in regulating the proliferation and self-renewal of cancer stem cell (CSC). Additional changes to immune processes, specifically perturbations to interferon (IFN) pathways, were identified in response to ITG &#945;v&#946;5 inhibition, suggesting that ITG &#945;v&#946;5 may play a role in host anti-tumor immune responses. Pharmacological inhibition of ITG &#945;v&#946;5 also led to a reduction of tumor growth in NSCLC murine models accompanied with increased CD8 T cell activation. These findings support ITG &#945;v&#946;5 as a unique target of cancer dependency in NSCLC whose inhibition promotes anti-tumor responses through both tumor intrinsic and host immune regulatory mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Integrins,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Here, we leveraged an in vivo model in which mice with pancreas-specific expression of mutant Kras progress from pre-malignant intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) following caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. During the transition from PanINs to PDAC, we observe two classes of neoplastic lesions: classically-described PanIN tubular structures that are highly organized and previously uncharacterized atypical highly disorganized lesions that are marked by robust integrin &#945;v&#946;3 expression, observations which are consistent with human pancreatitis and PDAC. In vitro, we report that immune-, stroma-, and tumor cell-derived inflammatory cytokines induce &#946;3 expression in a STAT3-dependent manner leading to increased integrin &#945;v&#946;3. Considering that we previously established &#945;v&#946;3 as a driver of cancer cell stress tolerance, drug resistance, and a stem-like phenotype, the acquisition of &#945;v&#946;3 during chronic inflammation may promote tumorigenesis. Indeed, using the spontaneous tumor mouse model and xenograft models of human PDAC, we find that cells with an inability to upregulate &#946;3 during tumor initiation fail to form tumors. These findings implicate integrin &#945;v&#946;3 as a critical driver of inflammation-mediated pancreatic tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor initiating cells,Inflammation,Integrins,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ECM stiffening is associated with metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence in the esophagus. This underscores a compelling need to develop a physiologically-relevant 3D culture model to enable the study of the independent contribution of matrix stiffness to the initiation and progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Such a model will then serve as a platform for pre-clinical drug screening in the context of matrix properties. In this context, we have engineered a hyaluronic acid-based 3D hydrogel platform that supports the growth and differentiation of patient-derived Barrett&#8217;s esophagus (BE) organoids, a precursor to EAC, as well as patient-derived EAC organoids. The engineered biomaterial 3D platform allows control over matrix stiffness to better recapitulate the mechanically dynamic esophageal cancer microenvironment and help identify therapeutic targets in EAC.Our data demonstrates that BE and EAC organoid density, growth and proliferation can be controlled by matrix stiffness. RNA sequencing data show that increased matrix stiffness promotes changes in the transcriptional profiles of BE and EAC organoids, revealing enrichment of pathways associated with tumorigenesis and disease progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate through molecular and functional assays that increased matrix stiffness endows stem-like properties to the EAC organoids via Yap-Sox9 mechano-activation. Finally, targeted therapy studies in our in vitro and in vivo engineered environments revealed that Yap inhibition regressed the effects of increased matrix stiffness in EAC organoids. In summary, our data suggest that matrix mechanics have a significant role in activation of EAC-associated signaling pathways in patient-derived BE and EAC organoids. We also demonstrate that the engineered hydrogel serves as a platform to identify potential therapeutic targets to disrupt the contribution of pro-tumorigenic matrix mechanics in EAC. Together, these studies establish an engineered patient-derived organoid culture platform that can be used to elucidate underlying matrix-mediated mechanisms of the metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence and inform the development of novel therapeutics that target ECM stiffness in EAC.

Different features between the two subtypes could guide the use of distinct treatment approaches. We discovered that FNRMS exhibited enrichment of gene sets related to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction than FPRMS. ECM, providing physical support as a scaffold, regulates cancer development. We hypothesize that a distinct molecular feature, P3F, may cause the difference in cell-ECM interaction between FPRMS and FNRMS.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>To confirm the higher cell-ECM interaction of FNRMS vs. FPRMS, we used confocal reflection microscopy (CRM), enabling us to monitor the fibrous structures of ECM. We generated the spheroids with FNRMS and FPRMS cell lines by hanging drop method and embedded them into collagen type I. Then, we assessed orientation and dynamic changes in the structure of collagen fibers surrounding spheroids. Also, we analyze the transcriptome of FPRMS cells with P3F knockdown to confirm if P3F regulates cell-ECM interaction negatively via RNA seq. Additionally, we examined ECM surrounding spheroids of P3F knockdown FPRMS cells if P3F modulates fibrous structures of ECM, indicating cell-ECM interaction.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> We showed that collagen fibers are oriented more perpendicular to the FNRMS spheroid surface, indicating the strong pulling and pushing effect of cells. However, fibers surrounding FPRMS spheroids showed parallel alignment to their surfaces, reflecting passively pushed by the spheroids. Additionally, fibers near FNRMS spheroids showed greater displacement than those near FNRMS spheroids, which suggests stronger cell-ECM interaction in FNRMS than in FPRMS. Furthermore, P3F knockdown FPRMS cells exhibited significant enrichment of gene sets related to cell-ECM interaction. Their CRM results showed that collagen fiber orientation was significantly perpendicular to the surfaces of spheroids of P3F knockdown FPRMS cells than those of control cells. P3F knockdown cell spheroids also displayed enhanced displacement of ECM fibers than control cells. These results suggest that P3F suppresses cell-ECM interaction, consistent with higher cell-ECM interaction of FNRMS than FPRMS.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> The PAX3-FOXO1 gene may regulate cell-ECM interaction negatively, causing distinct features between FPRMS and FNRMS, which is crucial for various cellular functions and suggest different treatment between the two RMS subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Extracellular matrix,Spheroids,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

These sEVs are being investigated as powerful biomarkers and possible therapeutic agents for prostate cancer (PrCa), which remains the leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. We have previously reported that sEVs expressing the &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, a protein upregulated in aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPrCa), contribute to neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in recipient cells. sEVs used in this study were isolated by iodixanol density gradient and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting, and single vesicle analysis. Our proteomic profile of sEVs containing &#945;V&#946;3, when compared to control sEVs, shows a downregulation of typical effectors involved in apoptosis and necrosis, and an upregulation of tumor cell survival factors. This subset also contains an &#945;V&#946;3 downstream effector, NgR2, a member of the Nogo receptor family and a novel marker for NEPrCa. We have previously shown that NgR2 promotes NED and cell motility, and upregulates RhoA, a protein associated with aggressive phenotypes of PrCa. In this study, we show that the expression of NgR2 increases tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. We also show that the downregulation of NgR2 inhibits tumor growth and NED. Furthermore, we report that sEVs containing &#945;V&#946;3 are loaded with higher amounts of NgR2 as compared to sEVs that do not express &#945;V&#946;3. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sEVs containing NgR2 do not affect the sEV marker profile, but, when injected <i>in vivo<\/i> intratumorally, they promote tumor growth and induce NED. We confirm that the transfer of NgR2 into recipient cells is sufficient to promote tumor growth and show that NgR2 mimics the effect of sEVs containing &#945;V&#946;3 since it displays increased growth of NgR2 transfectants <i>in vivo,<\/i> as compared to control cells.

The KPC cell line, known as Hy15549, was established from KPC mouse model (Ptf1-Cre; LSL-KRAS-G12D; Trp53 Lox\/+). Using CRISPR-Cas9, we conducted targeted deletions for either ITGA2(CD49b) or ITGB1(CD29), as well as generating double knockouts for both CD49b and CD29.

The biosynthesis and catabolism of hyaluronan has multiple roles in tissue architecture and cell signaling. Dysregulation of these mechanisms is crucial in pathological processes such as cancer, inflammation or tissue remodeling. The role of HA is believed to be strongly dependent on its size (molecular weight), location, and cell receptor density and activity. HA is produced intracellularly by HA synthases (HAS1-3) and can also be catabolized endogenously by hyaluronidases (HYAL1-3).The fabrication of controlled microenvironments provided by three dimensional (3D) models helps to elucidate the role of HA signaling in GBM tumors. We exploit here the advantages of these models to understand the role of hyaluronan in the local behavior of GBM after radiation therapy and selected targeted inhibitors. We have established engineered brain tumor biomaterials based on functionalized hydrogels to monitor the response of patient-derived xenograft cell populations with different molecular signatures in combination with microfluidic devices. We have analyzed shifts in metabolism, hyaluronan secretion, as well as hyaluronan synthetic enzymes (HAS) and hyaluronidases (HYAL) activity in an array of patient derived GBM cells. We reveal that endogenous HA plays a role in mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation in a tumor subtype dependent manner. We also show that HA fragments can enhance tumor metabolism and growth through ligand dependent and independent mechanisms. We provide bioengineered platforms and strategies to predict and stratify tumors in order to achieve more efficient combinatorial treatments targeting endogenous hyaluronan production. This work emphasizes the potential of these preclinical models to predict and accelerate cancer treatments, more relevant in malignancies with limited treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Hyaluronan,Extracellular matrix,Tumor models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

However, little is known about how to modulate the ECM for therapeutic benefit effectively. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a polysaccharide component of the ECM with increased deposition during tissue injury or inflammation. HA in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been linked to aggressive cancer progression. We have found enhanced ECM remodeling behavior linked to pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic progression. To remodel this ECM-enriched microenvironment, we developed HA-targeting genetically engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (GEMesys) expressing hyaluronidase (Hyal), the enzyme responsible for HA degradation. We examined the impact of Hyal-GEMesys in osteosarcoma (F42010), rhabdomyosarcoma (M-3-9M), and pancreatic cancer (Panc02) syngeneic murine models. Hyal-GEMesys delivered to tumor-bearing mice homed to primary tumor sites and successfully degraded HA in the TME. The degradation of HA also resulted in a significant remodeling of collagen. T cells in Hyal-GEMesy treated tumors display an activated CD4+CD44+ phenotype with a reduction of LAG3+PD1+ exhaustion markers. Additionally, Hyal-GEMesy treatment results in a significant decrease in hypoxic regions within tumors and reorganization of the tumor vasculature to a more normalized phenotype, marked by diminished CD31 expression. Hyal-GEMesy treatment reduces tumor volumes in osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer models and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy. These findings suggest that reorganizing the tumor ECM with Hyal-GEMesys holds the potential to dismantle the protective stroma of the tumor, which often shields malignant cells from therapeutic reach, and combining anti-cancer and anti-stroma agents can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hyaluronan,Extracellular matrix,Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Among the constituents of the tumor stroma, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a significant component. CAFs are actively involved in tumor progression by modulating the architecture of the TME through increased deposition of various collagens resulting in tumor fibrosis. Several studies have shown that CAFs have heterogeneity within, and between, individual tissues. TGF-&#946; is thought to be the main driver of tumor fibrosis, however, the field lacks a characterization of the specific collagen deposition of CAFs from different tissues. In this study, we investigated the fibrotic activity of CAFs from various tissues by measuring the production of three specific collagen peptides in vitro by use of non-invasive clinically validated biomarkers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Primary human CAFs from pancreas (pCAF), colon (cCAF), breast (bCAF) and lung (lCAF) were cultured over a 12-day period in ficoll-based media under both unstimulated conditions and TGF-&#946; stimulation. Additionally, cells were subjected to treatment with the ALK5\/TGF-&#946;1 receptor kinase inhibitor (ALK5i). The assessment of collagen I (PRO-C1), collagen III (PRO-C3), and collagen VI (PRO-C6) formation was conducted in the cell supernatant at day 3, day 6, day 9, and day 12 using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> For lCAFs, cCAFs, and pCAFs, the addition of TGF-&#946; led to a notable elevation in the levels of PRO-C1, PRO-C3, and PRO-C6 within the supernatant. Conversely, in the case of bCAFs, stimulation with TGF-&#946; did not elicit remarkable alterations in the levels of PRO-C1 and PRO-C3 compared to unstimulated cells. Notably, bCAFs exhibit elevated intrinsic activity (high PRO-C3) even in the absence of TGF-&#946; stimulation whereas lCAFs and cCAFs exhibited relatively low level of PRO-C3. Additionally, across all different CAFs, the introduction of ALK5 inhibitor (ALK5i) to the culture medium resulted in a considerable reduction in PRO-C1, PRO-C3, and PRO-C6 levels, returning them to the baseline of the unstimulated control or even lower. Distinct collagen formation patterns were observed among the various CAFs. CAFs derived from breast cancer exhibited the highest release of PRO-C1 and PRO-C3, while CAFs isolated from colon cancer displayed the highest levels of PRO-C6.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> These findings underscore the heterogeneity in collagen production among different CAFs, providing valuable insights into the extracellular matrix dynamics within distinct tumor microenvironments.<b> <\/b>Moreover, non-invasive biomarkers demonstrate the capability to differentiate between different CAF subtypes. Lastly, our model proves to be a valuable tool for anti-fibrotic drug screening, as evidenced by the consistent suppression of TGF-&#946;1 signaling and reduced levels of PRO-C1, PRO-C3, and PRO-C6 upon treatment with ALK5i across all cases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Collagen,Biomarkers,Molecular subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Metastatic dissemination of cancer cells remains the leading cause of mortality in BCa. Therefore, determination of the mechanisms that promote metastasis is important for development of new therapeutic strategies. The extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the main non-cellular component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays an important role in BCa progression and metastasis. The cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the principal cell types that together with BCa cells drive the modification of ECM during cancer development. Lysine deficient receptor protein kinase 1 (WNK1), a widely expressed serine threonine kinase that regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance in the body, and is highly overexpressed in BCa microenvironment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of WNK1 in modification of ECM in BCa.<br \/>Methods: The clinical relevance of WNK1 overexpression in BCa was determined by immunohistochemically staining human BCa sections, analyzing data from publicly available databases and creating orthotopic mouse models of BCa using 4T1 mouse BCa cells followed by treatment of the tumor bearing mice with WNK1 inhibitors, WNK-IN-11 and WNK463 (10 mg\/kg , oral for 10 days). <i>In vitro<\/i> assays were conducted using 4T1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to determine the regulatory role of WNK1 on cancer cells and fibroblasts.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: Our results indicated that WNK1 is strongly expressed in BCa cells and fibroblasts, the two most abundant cell types in the BCa microenvironment. Furthermore, WNK1 expression strongly correlated with expressions of matrix regulatory and cross-linking genes. Our results demonstrated that WNK1 inhibitors significantly reduced orthotopic 4T1 growth and metastasis. WNK1 inhibition also significantly inhibited collagen deposition in tumor tissues, which is a negative prognostic indicator in BCa. <i>In vitro<\/i> proliferation and migration assays using 4T1 cells and MEFs identified that WNK1 inhibitors (1-100nM) can significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of 4T1 cells and MEFs. Results from co-culture studies with 4T1 cells and MEFs further indicated that WNK1 inhibition in MEFs could significantly reduce the invasive properties of 4T1 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that blocking the actions of WNK1 in BCa may be a promising therapeutic approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Fibroblasts,Extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

The extracellular matrix of the skin has well-documented changes with age, such as the loss of HAPLN1, which can lead to differential metastasis in aged individuals. The aged microenvironment can contribute to the phenotype switch, where aged individuals have smaller primary tumors but more metastases, i.e., going instead of growing. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has been shown to modulate the immune response either through direct binding of ECM proteins or through mechanotransduction, but it is unclear how aging affects this crosstalk. Our hypothesis<b> <\/b>is that the ECM can modulate immune response to melanoma and affect response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Melanoma cells cultured on cell derived matrices (CDMs) from young and aged human fibroblasts show differential levels of expression of PD-L1, a ligand that binds to PD-1 on T cells to induce T cell exhaustion. Antibodies targeting PD-1\/PD-L1 are one of the main ICB treatments available to melanoma. We are also investigating T cell motility on young and aged CDMs, as well as correlating T cell infiltration in murine tumors with ECM signatures as identified by second harmonic generation microscopy. Therefore, we have compiled evidence that aging affects the crosstalk between the extracellular matrix and the immune system, providing a new horizon for therapeutic improvement of response in older patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Extracellular matrix,Immune response,Aging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Mass Spectrometry proteomic analysis was employed to identify NAMPT to be enriched in metastatic HCC-sEV. The glycolytic effect of NAMPT-sEV was analyzed by seahorse glycolytic assay.<br \/>Result: Mass spectrometry protein analysis revealed nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) to be upregulated in metastatic HCC-sEV. NAMPT is a rate-limiting enzyme essential for maintaining cellular level of nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+). However, the underlying pathway of sEV-NAMPT-induced metabolic consequence in HCC remains largely unknown. This study elucidated sEV-NAMPT&#8217;s carcinogenic role by establishing NAMPT-knockdown (NAMPT-KD) stable clone in metastatic HCC cell lines, which significantly hampered the promoting effect of HCC-sEV in glycolysis. sEV-mediated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth was also inhibited. Through sEV treatment, we found that sEV-NAMPT significantly elevate SLC27A4 in both transcription and protein level of recipient cells. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that SLC27A4 expression was enhanced by NF-&#954;B transcription factor, which is activated upon binding of sEV-NAMPT to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). SLC27A4 mainly function as a long-chain fatty acid transporter or acyl-CoA synthetase. Lipidomic and metabolomic analysis unveiled SLC27A4 to be positively correlated with intracellular triacylglycerol (TG) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level. Elevation of TG aggravates lipolysis by hepatic lipase and promotes conversion of glycerol-3-P to DHAP, which is an intermediate metabolite that transit between lipid metabolism and glycolysis. This study uncovers a regulatory axis of sEV-NAMPT-mediated SLC27A4 in glycolysis, apart from conventional fatty acid-related metabolisms. Clinically, we explored the therapeutic potential of targeting sEV-NAMPT by inhibitor FK866. Treatment of NAMPT-inhibitor significantly hampered tumor growth in various HCC <i>in vivo <\/i>models, which suggested an alternative therapeutic strategy for HCC.<br \/>Conclusion: NAMPT is enriched in metastatic HCC sEV. sEV-NAMPT regulates the promoting effect of HCC-sEV in glycolysis and oncogenesis. SLC27A4 function as the downstream target that promotes HCC progression via glycolysis. NAMPT inhibitor FK866 are proven to reduce <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo <\/i>tumorigenic ability of metastatic HCC-sEV, which may serve as potential HCC treatment option.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Glycolysis,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

However, how these macrophages acquire their phenotype remains largely unexplored. To understand the mechanism driving pro-tumorigenic phenotype in macrophages, we studied the role of tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the cross-talk with macrophages in OvCa. We found that EVs from ovarian cancer cells contain eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1). eIF4A1 containing EVs from ovarian cells enhanced macrophage translational activity and PD-L1 expression. However, the detailed mechanism that explains how eIF4A1-packaged EVs induce immunosuppressive phenotype in macrophages is necessary to develop novel immunotherapy strategies for advanced OvCa treatment.<br \/>Methods- We performed SUnSET assay (surface sensing of translation) to determine whether eIF4E-EVs affect global translation in macrophages. SILAC (Stable isotope labeling by amino acids) based mass spectrometry was used to identify the downstream targets of eIF4A1 in macrophages. We isolated murine peritoneal macrophages from na&#239;ve C57BL\/6 female mice and co-cultured the macrophages with EVs derived from ovarian cancer cell lines. The expression of PD-L1, CD206, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and other inflammatory cytokines on EVs treated macrophages was evaluated using flow cytometry and a cytokine array kit. Further, we created a Rab27aKO ovarian cancer in vivo model to study the effect of eIF4A1 packaged EVs on the immune suppressive ability of macrophages and tumor progression.<br \/>Results- Our study shows that tumor cells employ EVs to deliver eIF4A1 to the tumor microenvironment, facilitating the release of cytokines such as IL-6 and the expression of PD-L1 on macrophages and supporting tumor growth. In addition, our data shows that eIF4A1-EVs enhance protein synthesis in macrophages. Our data show that in the Rab27aKO ovarian cancer in vivo mouse model, intravenous injection of eIF4A1-packaged EVs increased the tumor burden, metastasis, and ascites accumulation as compared to PBS control. eIF4A1-EVs treatment increased the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in ascites.

This includes factors such as oxygen and nutrient gradients, extracellular matrix stiffness, and cell-cell interactions. Depending on the complexity of system, TOCs are miniature tumor models in a microfluidic chip allowing researchers to gain a better understanding and controlled cancer environment to effectively test potential drug treatments and study immune cell co-cultures. Champions&#8217;TumorGraft3D (CTG3D), established from patient-derived xenografts, is the essential component used to recapitulate tumor microenvironment in the TOC platform which provides an even more powerful tool to gain more insight on the efficacy of various therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate the value in combining microfluidic devices with well characterized CTG3D models at Champions Oncology focused on indications including colorectal, breast, gastric and lung cancer. In brief, we optimized cell seeding conditions in both top (seeded with CTG3Ds) and bottom (seeded with endothelial cells) channels to develop TOCs interfacing epithelial-endothelial cells. These established systems may be applied as a baseline for introducing additional cell types such as autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and studying their effect in the presence and absence of additional treatments. With an initial focus on colorectal cancer, we successfully developed TOC epithelial-endothelial interface using CTG3Ds originated from patients with various clinical backgrounds. We measured the permeability as an initial read-out to prove that although tumor cells do not inherently form a tight barrier, they can still form a non-leaky barrier with distinct organoid-like structures. Next, we extended our study to additional indications featuring unique characteristics and proved the feasibility of applying TOCs as a preclinical tool regardless of the tissue-of-origin. In all cases, the endothelial cells formed mature microvascular structures and to confirm the consistency of formed epithelial-endothelial interface among the replicates of each experimental group, we did Luminex studies to prove high consistency in secreted proteins. Regarding the functionality of TOCs, we investigated the effect of relevant test agents to each indication and showed that that the combination of DRAQ7 dye and high-content imaging may be a reliable read-out to detect the response and viability of cancer cells pre- and post-treatment. In summary, our established tumor-on-chip system proves to be a robust and powerful tool for studying the effect of microenvironmental factors in drug testing and immune cells in cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,MPS,Tumor-on-a-chip,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

BIGH3 is known to bind multiple collagens and are often embedded in the matrix where it seems to function as a linker between ECM and cell surfaces. The increased proteolytic activity found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may degrade BIGH3 that affect this interaction as well as generate small peptide fragments that can serve as novel non-invasive biomarker targets if released to circulation. The aim of this study is to develop a tool to quantify degraded BIGH3 non-invasively and explore its potential as a biomarker in NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: An ELISA, named nordicBIGH3M-N targeting a cleaved fragment of BIGH3 was developed to reflect BIGH3 degradation and enable serological quantification. We incubated recombinant BIGH3 with and without collagenase to confirm that nordicBIGH3M-N only measured degraded BIGH3. In addition, we generated matrixes from normal fibroblasts and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) grown with or without tgf-b. These matrixes were cleaved with collagenase to confirm that NordicBIGH3M-N could be generated from degradation of matrix. nordicBIGH3M-N was also measured in serum from 39 patients with NSCLC (18 patients with adenocarcinoma and 21 patients with squamous cell carcinoma) and 35 healthy controls. BIGH3M-N levels in serum from patients with the two subtypes of NSCLC and healthy controls was compared using Dunn&#8217;s multiple comparison test and area under receiver operation characteristic curves (AUROC).<br \/>Results: BIGH3M-N was only detectable after incubating recombinant BIGH3 and fibroblasts matrices with collagenase. A 7-fold increase of BIGH3M-N levels was seen between the collagenase degraded matrix from tgf-b treated fibroblasts compared to the degraded matrix from untreated fibroblasts. No difference in BIGH3M-N levels was observed between degraded matrix from tgf-b treated or untreated CAFs. BIGH3M-N was significantly elevated in patients with squamous cell carcinoma compared to healthy controls (p = 0.006, AUROC = 0.73) and patients with adenocarcinoma (p = 0.022, AUROC = 0.78). However, there was no significant difference between BIGH3M-N levels in serum from patients with adenocarcinoma and healthy controls (p&#62;0.99, AUROC = 0.51).<br \/>Conclusion: Degradation of BIGH3 can be reflected by non-invasive quantification of the cleaved fragment of BIGH3, BIGH3M-N, in serum. BIGH3M-N is a promising biomarker in NSCLC with potential for discriminating between subtypes. Moreover, BIGH3M-N is connected to fibroblast matrix biology so the optimal use for this biomarker might be in combination with other ECM biomarkers.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular matrix,Matrix metalloprotease,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.
