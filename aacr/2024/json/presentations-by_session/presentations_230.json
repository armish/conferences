[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GB), IDH-wildtype, is the most common and aggressive high-grade primary malignant brain tumor with extremely poor outcome. Although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in GB has shown disappointing results, the identification of a small subgroup of responders underpins the role of the intratumoral immune contexture, in particular tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in determining disease outcome. This study aims to define the features of TIL subpopulations correlating with GB prognosis, and to establish in parallel the predictive roles of peripheral T cell subsets. A single cohort observational study, including patients undergoing GB resection and standard therapeutic and follow-up approaches in Neuro-Oncology, was conducted. Of the 45 patients, histologically confirmed WHO grade 4, 26 had MGMT promoter methylation (60.0%), 24 were male (53.3%) and the median age of young patients (&#8804;63 years) vs elderly patients (&#62;63 years) was 57 vs 71, respectively. Predictors of OS were KPS (&#8805;70 vs &#60;70: 14.7 vs 7.5 months, p=0.0007) and GTR (GTR vs non-GRT: 15 vs 9 months, p=0.004) whereas patients with methylated MGMT promoter had non-significant longer median OS compared to those with unmethylated promoter (14.5 vs 10.5 months). Patients were characterized for the expression of lineage, differentiation, memory, activation, and inhibition markers on intratumoral and peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, and the correlation of an array of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets with OS or PFS was evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry and uni\/multivariate analyses. Intratumoral immune infiltrate was positively associated with CD8+CD103+ tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm), and in particular with CD8+CD103+ Trm expressing PD1 and TIM3 rather than CD4+ Trm. Low CD8+CD103+PD1+ Trm resulted significantly associated with better OS and PFS (p=0.02 and 0.0031, respectively) and even higher significant was the correlation with better OS and PFS of low CD8+CD103+TIM3+ Trm (p=0.0002 and 0.0033, respectively) and CD8+CD103+PD1+TIM3+ Trm (p&#60;0.0001, both). On multivariate analysis, low CD8+CD103+PD1+TIM3+ Trm and KPS &#8805;70 were confirmed to be the most predictive independent factors associated with longer OS (hazard ratios - HR [95%CI]: 0.14 [0.04 - 0.52] p&#706;0.001, 0.39 [0.16<br \/>- 0.96] p=0.04, respectively). Moreover, CD8+CD103+ Trm subpopulations resulted age-related predictors for GB survival. Consistent with this finding, in vitro PD1 and TIM3 blockade released the capability of intratumoral T cells to produce the effector cytokines IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945;, and the cytotoxic factor GrzB. Conversely, T cells expressing PD1 and TIM3 of peripheral blood did not show any prognostic significance. In conclusion, low frequency of Trm expressing PD1 or TIM3 or both markers defined TIL subsets as independent positive prognostic factors for patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

In this study, we adopt a novel approach of identifying a network of proteins\/mRNA-circRNA-miRNA axes. We hypothesize that mutation of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes during pre-oncogenic stage result in aligned change in levels of circular RNAs-derived genes, as well as, reciprocally, in corresponding sponged miRNAs. These epigenetic risk predictive proteins\/mRNA-circRNA-miRNA axes serve as potential tool for early detection of changes leading to breast cancer (BC) and can be further used as non-invasive screening biomarkers of patients&#8217; blood in populations susceptible to cancer. BC patients in GDC Data Portal, TCGA-BRCA project are selected based on several criteria such as their age at diagnosis (20-50 years old), early clinical stage of cancer (stage I) and disease type (ductal and lobular neoplasms). Differentially expressed genes are acquired from mRNA sequencing data by comparing Stage I Breast cancer versus normal primary tissues using R Studio. Then, mRNAs whose expression is aligned with the differentially expressed circRNAs and their host genes acquired from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE182471, Triple Negative Breast cancer tissues versus normal tissues) are selected. Differentially expressed miRNAs, in reciprocal expression with circRNAs, are defined using miRNA sequencing data of the same previously chosen TCGA BRCA patients. Selected miRNAs are hypothesized to be sponged with high confidence by selected circRNAs based on a context percentile binding score in CircInteractome. Using KM Plotter, the survival analysis of corresponding miRNAs in grade I BC patients is examined. The predicted miRNA expression was correlated with lower survival rates among stage I BC patients in KM Plotter. MiRNA-enrichment analysis is used to further validate the involvement of selected miRNAs in early tumorigenic events through exploring in which molecular pathways their downstream genes are enriched. We have constructed more than 20 potential proteins\/mRNA-circRNA-miRNA axes for non-invasive screening of patients&#8217; body fluid (i.e. Blood) in populations susceptible to BC using RNA and miRNA sequencing data available in online databases and further validate the proposed axes using in-silico tools. The described axes, once validated in clinical samples could provide a potential tool for early-stage BC prediction and prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Early detection,Epigenetics,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Given the mutagenic potential of LINE-1, benign cells restrict its expression, although the molecular mechanisms involved are usually impaired in cancer. Clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) accounts for ~5-10% of ovarian cancers and is believed to arise from endometriosis. Women have a poor prognosis when it presents at an advanced stage, which emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the disease. In the present study, we found that ~85% of CCOC tumors express ORF1p, one of two proteins encoded by LINE-1. We show that CCOC cell lines retain ORF1p expression and release it into the extracellular media. By using single molecule array (Simoa) assays, we detected ORF1p in patient plasma, proposing ORF1p as a non-invasive biomarker for this disease. Finally, we found that LINE-1 retrotransposon de-repression is an early event in CCOC, as ORF1p is enhanced during the transition from typical to atypical endometriosis and that is retained in the invasive cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Biomarkers,Early detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Antibodies against tumor (neo)antigens are thought to arise early in cancer development and might serve as a more sensitive biomarker for RCC than tumor-derived biomolecules. Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA) of human serum\/plasma uses a random bacterial peptide display library and next generation sequencing to allow for unbiased highly multiplexed profiling of B cell epitopes. In combination with bioinformatic methods and machine learning, a classifier was trained to predict the presence of RCC using a cohort of 163 treatment-na&#239;ve patients (median age 62, stage: I 35%, II 5%, III 20%, IV 40%) with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and 438 age-matched healthy controls (median age 61). Classifier performance was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operator curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis in an independent validation cohort of 43 treatment-na&#239;ve patients with ccRCC (age 22-86, median 63, stage: I 33%, II 2%, III 26%, IV 39%) and 1,759 healthy controls (age 18-89, median 40). A total of 1,465 individual B cell epitope features were discovered and enriched in ccRCC vs. controls and included in a random forest model. In the validation cohort, the ROC-AUC was 0.65, and sensitivities of 9%, 16%, 30%, and 36% were achieved at specificities of 99%, 98%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. Performance was better in both early stage ccRCC and low tumor grade (grade 1 or 2). For stage I, the ROC-AUC was 0.88, and sensitivities of 7%, 14%, 36%, and 57% were achieved at specificities of 99%, 98%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. For low tumor grade, the ROC-AUC was 0.86, and sensitivities of 10%, 20%, 50%, and 60% of were achieved at specificities of 99%, 98%, 95%, and 90%, respectively. The classifier did not miscategorize benign renal lesions as ccRCC (Mann-Whitney p-value 0.52, ROC-AUC 0.54) in a separate cohort of 23 patients with benign renal tumors vs. the 1,759 healthy controls. This preliminary performance for a B cell epitope-based classifier is promising: the better performance in early stage ccRCC suggests that B cell epitope biomarkers may complement the lower sensitivity of cell-free DNA for detecting early-stage cancer (2). Future work will further validate these results in larger multi-institutional cohorts to improve classification performance and explore if B cell epitope biomarkers can be combined with existing assays to develop an early detection composite biomarker for RCC and tumor grade.<br \/>(1)Siegel RL, Miller KD, Wagle NS, Jemal A.

However, most studies only exploit a single aspect of cancer hallmarks, which is challenging for the biological reasons as cancer is a heterogenous disease with a wide spectrum of pathological and clinical behaviors. Here we report a multi-omics MCED assay named SeekInCare, a CE-IVD Mark blood test, which incorporates genomic hallmarks: copy number aberrations, fragment size, end motifs and oncogenic viruses via shallow whole genome sequencing from cfDNA, and seven plasma protein tumor markers in 8 ml blood.<br \/>Methods: SeekInCare was developed using several retrospective cohorts and the method has been described in a publication (DOI: 10.1016\/j.jmoldx.2021.06.003) IF: 4.1 Q2 .<br \/>Results: We present the validation in a retrospective cohort consisting of 584 non-cancer individuals and 617 cancer patients covering 27 cancer types. SeekInCare achieved 65.5% sensitivity at 97.9% specificity, resulting in an AUC of 0.936. The sensitivities were 46.9%, 60.0%, 68.9%, 81.8% in stage I, II, III, IV patients. The sensitivities of 10 common cancer types are as the following: breast (46.2%), stomach (46.4%), colorectum (56.5%), gallbladder (60.0%), lung (62.8%), pancreas (64.7%), lymphoma (68.5%), esophagus (70.0%), liver (77.5%), and leukemia (86.7%). These cancer types account for 73.5% of cancer incidence and 81.8% of cancer-related mortality in China. We prospectively evaluated SeekInCare in a real-world cohort consisting of 1203 individuals who received the test as a laboratory developed test (median follow-up time: 753 days) in which it achieved 60.0% sensitivity, 96.1% specificity, 11.5% PPV and 99.7% NPV.<br \/>Conclusion: The performances of SeekInCare in both retrospective and prospective studies demonstrate that SeekInCare is an effective blood-based MCED test with similar performance as Grail&#8217;s Galleri test, which paves the way for clinical utility as a cancer screening test in average-risk populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,multi-omics,shallow whole genome sequencing,cfDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

A &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor immune micro-environment (TIME) is predictive of survival and immunotherapy benefit in multiple tumor types. We have previously identified the ratio of CD8+\/CD68+ cells as well as a 53-gene melanoma immune panel (MIP) as indicative of a favorable &#8220;hot&#8221; TIME. CD8\/CD68 ratio and MIP were evaluated in specimens from 213 previously untreated patients including 164 from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) and 49 from Geisinger Health Systems (GHS, n=36). Tumors were stained with Sox10, CD8, CD68, MPO, PDL1 and HLA-DR using the MOTiF workflow (Akoya Biosciences, AB). Image analysis was completed using inForm software (AB). RNA was extracted and NanoString analysis performed using published methods. Receiving Operator Curves (ROC) were generated and KM curves using cutoffs selected using maximally selected log-rank statistics to quantify survival benefit. We tested whether the CD8\/CD68 ratio correlated with disease specific survival (DSS) and distant metastatic recurrence (DMR). In the RPCCC cohort (n=164), 138 specimens were evaluated by a pathologist and stained of which 15 were excluded based on tissue quality, and inForm analysis was completed on 80. Of these 80, 16 had DMR of whom 8 had died. ROC showed CD8\/CD68 ratio to correlate with DMR (p=0.0397). KM analysis showed high CD8\/CD68 ratio correlated with DMR free survival (p=0.00079). Within the GHS samples, 36 of 49 patients had sufficient quality tissue, of whom 13 had died. DMR data was not available. A high CD8\/CD68 ratio correlated with DSS by ROC curve (p=0.027) and KM analysis (p=0.0009). MIP was run on 166 patients of whom 147 passed quality control for analysis. MIP correlated with DSS in the RPCCC cohort by ROC analysis (p=0.025) and cutoff defined based on prior cohort showed correlation with DSS (p=0.01) and trend towards correlation with DMRFS (p=0.065). To include diverse samples in the training set, MIP was retrained with the addition of 81 patients from Columbia University (CUMC). KM analysis performed using the retrained signature showed a favorable signature correlated with DSS (p=0.032) and DMRFS (p=0.00077). Immune based biomarkers including CD8\/CD68 ratio and immune gene signature have potential to assist clinicians in selecting early-stage melanoma patients for more intensive immunotherapy regimens. Full analysis of the data from the RPCCC and GHS cohorts will be presented at the conference.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor microenvironment,Image analysis,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Gerardo  A.

EVT801 has shown compelling activity in a wide range of cancer models showing a decrease of tumor hypoxia and an increase of CD8<sup>pos<\/sup> T-cells infiltration into the tumor micro-environment. EVT801 was well-tolerated in preclinical toxicology studies. A phase I study is underway focusing primarily on understanding the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of EVT801 across a range of doses (NCT05114668).<br \/>Methods: The first stage of the phase I trial aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for EVT801. Clinical samples from enrolled patients have been collected to explore preliminary signals of the biological activity of the drug and characterize tumor phenotypes. Patient characterization includes histology and mRNA signature in archival biopsies. Target engagement and pharmacodynamics effects are investigated by immunomonitoring as well as assessment of a defined set of proteins as markers of inflammation and angiogenesis as identified in preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Conclusion: Our first biomarkers analyses on a subpopulation of patients with High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGS-OC) enrolled in the first stage of the study showed that levels of VEGFR3 expression had a negative correlation with CD8 positive T-cells infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and a tendency to positive correlation with a PD1 mAb resistance signature. VEGFR3 expression also tends to be correlated with higher levels of hypoxia (CAIX labelling). Our working hypothesis is that patients with hypoxic HGS-OC tumors with high VEGFR3 expression may benefit from EVT801 treatment; this will need to be reinforced by inclusion of additional patients in dedicated PD biomarkers cohorts during stage 2 of the clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Ovarian cancer,Antiangiogenic therapy,Patient characterization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"L.

Lung cancer (LC) patients, despite innovative cancer treatments such as target and immune-therapies, still have the poorest five-year survival rate. In this context the possibility of an early detection can anticipate therapeutic intervention, avoiding aggressive therapies thus prolonging disease-free and overall survival. Therefore, the identification of new circulating early biomarkers still represents a relevant clinical need.<br \/>Methods. Lung cancer (LC) patients (n=63) and heavy smokers (HS) cancer free-subjects (n=52) were evaluated for the enrichment of specific subtypes of myeloid cells. Circulating early myeloid derived suppressor cells (eMDSCs) and low-density neutrophils (LDNs) were assessed by flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Early MDSCs were defined as CD11b+CD33+CD15-CD14- cells among Lineage negative (Lin-) HLA-DR- PBMCs, whereas LDNs were defined as CD66b+CD15+ cells within the gate of CD11b+ PBMCs. Mature and immature subtypes were discriminated according to the expression of CD10.<br \/>Results. Performing a sex- and smoking -matched case-control analysis in 39 LC and 39 HS subjects we were able to compare the capacity of specific myeloid population to discriminate lung cancer patients from heavy smokers. The analysis showed significantly higher values of eMDSC (OR=1.12; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.03-1.21), total LDN (CD66b+CD15+; OR=1.23; 95%CI 1.04-1.45) and of mature CD10+ LDN (OR=1.30; 95%CI 1.05-1.61). Moreover, within the overall cohort of 63 LC patients, we analyzed the distributions of the different myeloid populations according to stage (I-II vs III-IV). In this comparison, total LDN (CD66b+CD15+; Kruskal-Wallis (KW) Test p-value=0.014), and mature CD10+ LDN (KW test p-value=0.006) showed significant different distributions according to tumor stage, observing higher values in patients with advanced stage. On the contrary, no difference among stages was observed for the eMDSC population.<br \/>Conclusions. These findings point to eMDSCs as an early marker for lung cancer detection whereas LDN could be as well associated with disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"O.

The mechanism of CRC development is a complex multistage process from hyperplastic lesions to the formation of adenomas, followed by the progression into malignancy. Hence, early detection during hyperplastic and adenomatous stages warrants new screening tests for effective interception of malignancy progression. Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a biomarker characterized by its overexpression in several GI cancers, but restricted expression in intestinal mucosal epithelium of normal tissues. We have developed a blood immunoassay using a panel of RUO grade antibodies that unveiled CDH17 as a potential marker with high detection sensitivity and specificity for detecting adenomas. Our immunoassay is useful in identifying high-risk individuals with adenomas that may develop into CRC, which can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of colonoscopy that is currently lacking.<br \/>Methods: The study recruited 66 patients (54 adenoma and 12 hyperplasia) and 39 normal samples (no abnormality by colonoscopy). CDH17 level in plasma samples were measured using the CDH17 immunoassay.<br \/>Results: The novel CDH17 diagnostic assay showed an operating dynamic range from 90ng to 123pg. We observed a progressive and significant increase in the circulating CDH17 level from normal samples to the hyperplasia group, followed by the adenoma group (mean: 1.66ng\/mL, 3.20ng\/mL, 4.93ng\/mL, respectively P&#60;0.0001). The assay performance by ROC curve demonstrated an AUC of &#62;0.9, with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 86%. NPV and PPV were 84% and 87%, respectively. The assay outperforms two market available FIT-DNA tests at predicting adenomas (Table. 1).<br \/>Conclusion: The novel CDH17 immunoassay is potentially a powerful tool for the detection of aberrant plasma CDH17 expression, improving the surveillance and the detection of high-risk individuals for CRC.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{52BD3232-A427-4554-83FA-42B825FA9041}\"><caption>CDH17 immunoassay outperforms market availalble FIT-DNA tests at detecting hyperplasia and adenoma<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">FIT-DNA test 1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">FIT-DNA test 2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CDH17 blood immunoassay<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age 40-74<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age 50-84<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age 45-93<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Advanced adenoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">85.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Non-advanced adenoma (i.e Hyperplasia)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Specificity (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Normal control (no abnormality by colonoscopy)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">89.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">86.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">NPV (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Advanced adenoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">83.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Non-advanced adenoma (i.e Hyperplasia)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">86.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">PPV (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Advanced adenoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Non-advanced adenoma (i.e Hyperplasia)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unavailable<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58.3<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cancer biomarker,Cadherin-17,Colorectal adenoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"N.

Integrating routine blood draws into lung cancer screening could boost participation, mirroring the success of non-invasive tests in colorectal screening. Numerous proof-of-concept studies indicate that analyzing genome-wide cfDNA fragmentation patterns can effectively distinguish between individuals with and without lung cancer. We conducted a multi-institutional case-control study to train and validate a fragmentome based cfDNA classifier for lung cancer early detection.<br \/>METHODS: The DELFI-L101 study (NCT04825834) is a prospective, multi-site, observational case-control study designed to develop and validate an early detection test for lung cancer. The DELFI (DNA Evaluation of Fragments for Early Interception) method utilizes low-pass whole genome sequencing, a cost-effective approach that examines cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation patterns associated with lung cancer. Enrolled participants were aged &#8805;50 y, smoking history of &#8805;20 pack-years, and had undergone or had planned chest CT imaging. Medical histories were documented, and blood samples were collected for DELFI analysis. A classifier, developed through supervised machine learning, was created to distinguish between samples from individuals with lung cancer and those without. Performance was assessed through repeated 10-fold cross-validation in the training set and then subsequently assessed in an independent split-study clinical validation set. The classifier was optimized for the sensitivity detection of lung cancer in the screening-eligible population. Performance was evaluated across patient and tumor characteristics, adjusting the stage distribution to match that of LDCT screening populations.<br \/>RESULTS: In an analysis of 958 participants from both the lung cancer and non-cancer control groups, the sensitivity of the test remained consistent across various participant demographics, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics, increasing with higher group, T, and N stages. The stage weighted sensitivity for the screening population was 80% (95% CI: 75%-86%), with a specificity of 53% (95% CI: 43%-64%). At a prevalence of 0.7%, the negative predictive value was 99.7%.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical validation of the DELFI-based blood test demonstrates its potential to detect lung cancer within the screening eligible population. A negative result is associated with a high negative predictive value. Given the limited adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, especially among socio-economically disadvantaged individuals, this clinically validated, blood-based cfDNA test could significantly increase LDCT screening participation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Cancer detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"P.

The latest research has also demonstrated that isomiRs (isoform miRNAs) can serve as superior markers, displaying enhanced diagnostic performance in cancer diagnosis. However, the low detection sensitivities of miRNA\/isomiRs in previous methods in plasma have limited their broad implementations for screening purpose. In this study, we propose a new isomiRs feature of isomiR relative proportion (IRP), which was validated with high performance in Colorectal Cancer (CRC) early diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: A total of 1036 participants were enrolled from the National Colorectal Cancer Cohort (NCRCC), and 836 participants were eligible for plasma collection, including 238 controls, 373 CRC patients, 41 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 5 intramucosal carcinoma (Tis) and 179 advanced precancerous lesions (APL). Total circulating small RNA was extracted, followed by library preparation using UMI-based approach. Subsequently, small RNA sequencing was conducted using DNB-seq, and bioinformatic analysis was performed thereafter. The samples were randomly assigned into training (49%), test (30%) and validation (21%) sets. Models based on isomiR relative proportion (IRP), isomiR relative expression (IRE) or both features were constructed by beam search and random forest algorithms in training and test sets, and results were verified in validation set.<br \/>Results: Differential IRP or IRE features were identified between cancer and controls. IRP identified 132 specific differential expressed isomiRs. Models constructed using either IRP or IRE features showed high performance (both AUC &#62; 0.9). However, there was improvement in IRP feature model in the validation set (sensitivity of IRP: 0.923, sensitivity of IRE: 0.859) compared with IRE model. We then found that there may be complementarities between IRP and IRE features, and the combination model (34 IRP+IRE features) improved cancer detection performance (AUC: 0.953). Finally, the risk scores predicted by this combination model increased gradually across CRC progression (R=0.921), and the sensitivity of APL was 0.626.<br \/>Conclusion: We improved the small-RNA sequencing method and developed an IRP method, and present that IRP as a new feature not only demonstrate the ability of CRC early detection, but also revealed the CRC progressing process. Besides, the combination of IRP and IRE improved the performance of diagnosis. These results highlight the potential value of the IRP feature in early cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Early detection,Biomarkers,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

Recent technology based on platelet RNA aids in detection of tumors at the early stages. Also, for population screening of low-prevalence diseases like cancer, accurate detection with high specificity is essential to improve diagnostic methods. Thus, we proposed platelet RNA-based early ovarian cancer detection with great specificity. It is a two-step method for detecting ovarian tumors with more than 99% specificity using exon-exon junction features and sampling invariant normalization and finding their malignancy with more than 99% negative predictive value using exon-exon junction and hematology parameters. First, we downloaded public platelet transcriptome data of gynecological cancer including ovarian cancer (n=151), benign tumor (n=30), and healthy counterparts (n=218) from GEO (GSE158508, 89843, and 183635). Second, we prospectively enrolled patients with gynecological cancer (n=31), benign tumors (n=20), and healthy women (n=18) at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Boaz Medical Center and obtained platelet transcriptome data (FMH data). Feature selection and model development were conducted using public training set (n=243), public validation set (n=156), and FMH training\/validation set (n=47). The batch-invariant normalization was performed, and 198 splice junctions were selected as features from training\/validation set for the bootstrap aggregation of the SVM model diagnosing the existence of an ovarian tumor. The model performance was assessed from a separate test set only composed of FMH data (n=22). Our model that demonstrated 96.8% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, with a predetermined cut-off value. Next, FMH training\/validation set was used for model development of following malignancy test. 10 splice junctions and 19 hematology parameters were selected and SVM models were separately developed for splice junctions and hematology parameters using 5-fold cross validation. The predictions were combined using a logical OR operation to obtain the final prediction result. The result showed its diagnostic performance with 100% sensitivity or NPV, and 50.0% specificity in the test data set with a predetermined cut-off value. We proposed a two-step method to operationally improve the existing protocol for ovarian cancer screening. Our model initially excludes most healthy individuals who do not have ovarian tumors and excludes patients with benign ovarian tumors who do not necessitate medical testing. To conclude, our model allows physicians to identify a subset of ovarian tumor patients with a higher risk of malignancy even at early stages; it exhibits potential in enhancing early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, leading to increase of treatment effectiveness and ultimately augmenting the survival of patients with ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Early detection,Liquid biopsies,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Our blood based Ovarian Cancer Test (OC Test) is composed of 5 cancer-associated biomarkers (BST-2, FOLR1, MUC-1, MUC-16, and sialylated Thomsen-nouveau antigen (sTn)) known to be overexpressed in ovarian cancer relative to healthy tissues. The test employs these 5 biomarkers in 3 combinations to capture and detect EVs from human plasma to distinguish high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) from both benign ovarian tumors and normal samples. Using super-resolution microscopy on ovarian cancer cell lines and EVs and multiplex immunohistochemistry of ovarian benign and tumor tissue, our study aimed to show that the 5 ovarian cancer biomarkers show 1) colocalization on ovarian cancer cells, 2) colocalization on the surface of EVs, and 3) colocalization on cancer cells within ovarian tumor biopsies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Super-resolution microscopy was employed to visualize stained biomarkers on the cell surface of a collection of ovarian cancer cell lines as well as on the surface of extracellular vesicles released by these cell lines. 58 HGSC (17 Stage I, 30 Stage II, and 10 Stage III) and 17 benign ovarian tumor K<sub>2<\/sub>EDTA plasma samples and paired FFPE tissue were sourced from the Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OVCARE, Vancouver BC, Canada). A tumor microarray from identical tissue samples was stained with an Opal multiplex-IHC (mIHC) assay comprised of antibodies to BST2, MUC1, sTn, and pan-cytokeratin and a DAPI counterstain. Machine learning based image analysis was utilized to determine colocalization of the biomarkers at the cellular level within benign and tumor tissue. RNA sequencing was carried out to assess expression levels of the biomarkers in each FFPE tissue sample. OC Tests were run on each plasma sample.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Super-resolution microscopy showed colocalization of OC Test combination biomarkers on ovarian cancer cells and EVs derived therefrom. Machine learning-based image analysis of tumor and benign tissue microarrays stained for BST2\/MUC1\/sTn using mIHC, showed strong evidence for colocalization of these biomarkers on single cells within ovarian tumor tissue, particularly in early-stage tumors, but not on benign tissue. RNA sequencing analysis showed good correlation of biomarker RNA expression levels and with the OC Test results.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The results presented here demonstrate that the OC Test biomarkers are colocalized on tumor tissue, ovarian cancer cells, and EVs from ovarian cancer cell lines.

Multi-omics approaches, while promising, are high in cost and complexity, low throughput, slow, and require large sample volumes, thus are impractical for many stages of clinical care. Raman spectroscopy (RS) addresses many of these needs: it requires little to no sample preparation, is non-destructive, does not need exogenous dyes or labelling agents, and can be performed directly in aqueous solutions. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers further improvements in terms of sensitivity but increases complexity. In this study we carried out comprehensive RS and SERS measurements on a &#62;100-person cohort of blood and saliva from head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and benign controls. Analyses were carried out on whole biofluids, in addition to extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the biofluids to investigate the added value.

More than half of the patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage for which the 5-year survival is below 10%. Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scan reduced lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers. However, no standard screening method exists for non-smokers. Up to 35% and 90% of male and female lung cancer patients in Southeast Asia, respectively, do not smoke. Half of NSCLC patients in this region harbor EGFR mutations, which is common in women and non-smokers. Thus, we sought to explore novel biomarkers that help to identify lung cancer patients and those who have EGFR mutation. Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer. It leads to changes in metabolite levels in the blood. Hence, we conducted plasma metabolomic analysis to identify potential metabolite biomarkers in lung cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Plasma samples were collected from 69 lung cancer patients at Siriraj hospital and 10 healthy individuals during 2018-2022. Plasma metabolites from 29 treatment-na&#239;ve EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, 30 treatment-na&#239;ve EGFR-wild-type NSCLC patients, 10 treatment-resistant EGFR T790M-mutated NSCLC patients, and 10 healthy individuals were profiled using GC-MS and untargeted LC-MS with Metlin database matching. EGFR mutation was detected from plasma ctDNA using real-time PCR. Negative plasma EGFR mutation results were confirmed with corresponding tumor tissues. Metabolomics data were processed by the metabox R package.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among 114 candidate metabolites that passed the variable importance in projection (VIP) cutoff of 1.5, the top ten metabolites that differentiate NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation from those without were shown in Table 1.

Despite recent advances in cancer diagnostics, it is a cancer that is often detected late and the vast majority of patients are diagnosed at Stage III and Stage IV. After treatment with debulking surgery and chemotherapy, 80% of patients have tumor relapse with increasing resistance. Early detection efforts have been largely unsuccessful and the only effective prevention strategy in high risk patients is surgical removal of the fallopian tube and ovaries. Careful pathologic studies of prophylactic risk reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) has demonstrated that HGSC originates in the fallopian tube. Within the fallopian tube, secretory cells within the fimbriae are believed to be the origin of HGSC based on numerous lines of correlative evidence including the identification of histologically and molecularly abnormal regions in the fallopian tube called serous tubal intraepithelial cancer (STIC) in 3-5% of patients undergoing RRSO, and the presence of STIC in approximately half of patients undergoing debulking surgeries for HGSC. Finally, p53 mutations have been found to be identical in STIC and in the concurrent invasive disease indicating that HGSC and the STIC likely arise from the same clone. TCGA analysis has demonstrated that HCSC is a disease characterized by genomic and chromosomal instability harboring copy number alteration, including amplifications, deletions and more complex chromosomal rearrangements which impact multiple genes and pathways. Aberrantly segregating chromosomes that lag behind the spindle apparatus fail to become part of the primary nucleus (PN) and are instead enclosed by a self-assembled nuclear membrane, creating a structure called the micronucleus (MN). Spontaneous breakdown of the MN causes cytoplasmic DNA sensing and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, an important innate cellular defense mechanism to foreign cytoplasmic DNA. To better understand the early genomic and signaling events in the development of HGSC, we are interrogating tissue from our archives from MSKCC patients who have undergone RRSO, hormone ablation surgeries or surgical debulking and were found to have benign fallopian tube, STIC lesions or invasive HGSC with STIC. We have performed a pilot experiment of 20 patient samples of different germline genetic backgrounds. Intriguingly, cGAS signaling was observed only rarely in the STICs indicating low rates of CIN in STICs we have evaluated, however we note that even in early invasive disease, we observe cGAS positivity. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model where CIN and subsequent cGAS\/STING pathway activation drives the transition from pre-invasive to invasive disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer initiating cells,Chromosomal instability,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Many biomarkers have been proposed; however, none have been shown to improve detection at an early stage in this patient population. The purpose of this study is to assess whether there are unique extracellular vesicle (EV) protein signatures of early-stage HGSOC that could serve as early detection biomarkers.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>250 serum samples were obtained from a multi-institutional retrospective cohort of patients with all stages of HGSOC and healthy controls. LC-MS\/MS and PEA of serum samples from patients with early-stage HGSOC identified differentially expressed EVs proteins in HGSOC versus controls. Tob candidate proteins are validated by ELISA.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We have identified the top 10 EVs candidate proteins based on their fold change and statistical significance. When comparing early-stage HGSOC and controls using ELISA, CFH, PCP, and CCNE1 exhibited the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.94, 0.91, and 0.83, respectively. In contrast, MUC16 (also known as CA-125) exhibited an AUC of only 0.42 in whole serum. Furthermore, MUC16 distinguished between controls and both early and advanced-stage HGSOC in EVs, while in whole serum, it was only differentially expressed between controls and advanced-stage disease. Our results demonstrate that the predictive performance of the combined biomarkers surpasses that of any individual biomarker. Further, we integrated the ten aforementioned biomarkers, deriving the optimal combination biomarker by maximizing the corresponding Sum of Harmonic Means (SHUM) function by utilizing data from all 70 patients, results showed the optimal coefficients of the biomarkers, which maximize the diagnostic accuracy for early-stage HGSOC. The overall true positive rate (TPR) of 0.943, false positive rate (FPR) of 0.000, and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) were presented for both the combined biomarker approach and individual biomarkers.

However, this method of screening remains imperfect. High rates of false positive scans expose patients to additional morbidity as they pursue subsequent diagnostic evaluation. Real-world application of screening LDCT remains low. Finally, current screening guidelines exclude those without smoking histories, a population which comprises up to a quarter of lung cancer patients. We sought to explore the utility of liquid biopsy (LBx) in lung cancer patients and its use in early cancer screening and diagnosis. Using the third generation High-Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow, we analyzed 99 peripheral blood samples divided into three cohorts: Normal Donors (ND, n=50) who were healthy volunteers with no known pathology, Screening CT patients (CT, n=25) who underwent standard LDCT screening with resultant Lung-RADS 1-2, Biopsy patients (BX, n=24) who had abnormal CT scans requiring tissue biopsy. The ND group was used to characterize baseline epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and immune cells, alongside acellular events (oncosomes). For the CT and BX patients, demographic information including age, gender, and average BMI was roughly equivalent, however average pack-years smoked differed owing to 10 (42%) patients in the BX group who had no prior smoking history. A total of 14 (58%) BX patients were diagnosed with primary lung cancer (BX+), of which 11(75%) were adenocarcinoma, 2 (19%) were squamous cell carcinoma and 1 (6%) was small cell. Across the cohorts we observed intra- and interpatient heterogeneity of rare events including multiple phenotypic rare cell populations and oncosomes. The comparison of the rare event enumerations between the ND, CT, BX+, and BX- cohorts revealed a greater incidence of total events, total rare cells and oncosomes, as well as specific cellular phenotypes in the CT and BX cohorts compared to the ND cohort. LBx analytes were detected at a significant elevation in the BX samples compared to the CT samples, but there was no significant difference between BX+ and BX- samples. The data supports the utility of the LBx in distinguishing patients with an alveolar mass lesion from those without, providing a mechanism for screening prior to LDCT to better inform clinical workup and avoid unnecessary radiation exposure and biopsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The goal of this retrospective study is to assess the role miRNAs isolated from extracellular vesicles (EV-miRNAs) as possible early biomarkers for identifying patients with higher risk of developing BC, in order to personalize their screening programme. To this goal, EV-miRNAs from cyst fluid derived from women with Gross Cyst Disease of the Breast (GCDB - a benign disease of the mammary gland associated with a 2-4-fold increase in the risk of developing BC) have been analysed.<br \/>Methodology: Cyst fluids have been selected among samples from a cohort of 600 patients diagnosed with GCDB between 1985 and 1993, some of whom developed BC during follow-up. EV-miRNAs have been extracted from cyst fluid using the exoRNeasy midi kit (Qiagen), qualitatively evaluated by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantified by Qubit&#8482; using the microRNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MiRNome profiles have been assessed by microarray using an optimised protocol on Agilent platform (labelling and hybridization on SurePrint Human miR Microarrays 8&#215;60 K and images acquisition by G2565CA scanner).<br \/>Results: A total of 117 samples (58 cases and 59 controls, paired on the bases of clinical and pathological variables) have been analysed. Single variable logistic regression analysis on the most expressed EV-miRNAs (logFC &#62;= 6 (n=329)), selected six EV-miRNAs (miR-6076, miR-202-3p, miR-6872-3p, miR-769-3p, miR-5195-3p, miR-4443) and one (miR-4713-3p) negatively and positively associated with BC development, respectively (raw p-value &#60;0.05). A risk score combining the seven EV-miRNAs was derived by multivariable logistic regression modelling and reported an AUC=0.73 (95% [CI] 0.6427-0.8231). The model was refined including clinical variables and applying step-wise logistic regression analysis. The combination of 3 EV-miRNAs (miR-6076, miR-6872-3p, miR-5195-3p) with menopausal status, familiarity and type of cyst yielded an AUC of 0.8 (95% [CI] 0.7015-0.8847). Logistic regression was also performed on Type I cysts (n=78), that are correlated with a higher risk of developing BC, pointing in evidence 3 EV-miRNAs with a negative (miR-6076, miR-6872-3p) or positive (miR-4515) correlation with BC development risk (AUC = 0.74, 95% [CI] 0.6278-0.8475). In the model comprehensive of clinical variables, two of those EV-miRNAs (miR-6872-3p, miR-4515) together with familiarity and menopausal status were selected, giving an AUC of 0.8 (95% [CI] 0.6961-0.8991).<br \/>Conclusion: This study allowed the identification of a EV-miRNA-based BC risk signature obtained by liquid biopsy on cyst fluid. The final purpose of this project is to transfer this signature in the clinic by testing it prospectively on plasma samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,MicroRNA,Extracellular vesicles,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The current clinical problem in UCC management is the high interobserver variability of tissue UCC grading and the low sensitivity of urine cytology for early detection of recurrences and progression. We hypothesize that assessing urine samples and UCC tissues with detailed quantitative image analysis based on artificial intelligence has strong potential in both urine-based early detection of tumor recurrence and progression as well as tissue-based pathological grading.<br \/>Methods: Here, we utilized the Deepcell&#174; Human Foundation Model (HFM), a self-supervised deep learning model, to assess a cohort of urine samples from 54 normal healthy cases, 19 atypical cases, and 4 UCC cases. High resolution images of label-free single cells were captured and analyzed using the HFM to identify distinct morphological characteristics of cells from different urine origins. The urine samples were loaded onto a single-use microfluidic cartridge as part of the Deepcell&#174; REM-I platform and brightfield images of single cells were captured in real-time. For data analysis, images of all cells run through the REM-I instrument are automatically sent to the Deepcell&#174; Axon Suite, which provides an analysis platform to visualize cell images from specific runs, generate UMAPs of the embedding space, and run additional deep neural network models on samples in silico.<br \/>Results: High-dimensional analysis of 115 deep learning and morphometric features reveals 12 morphotypes among the pooled urine samples, as represented by morphology UMAP plots. Morphology analysis reveals distinct morphotypes in normal compared to pathological urine samples. Confusion matrix showed deep learning model performance in classifying atypical versus UCC with 89.1% (Atypical (n = 8642), UCC (n = 12637)). This indicates high model performance accuracy for AI prediction of atypical versus UCC samples at the single cell level.<br \/>Conclusions: The Deepcell&#174; REM-I platform performs well with urine samples and identified numerous cell clusters among normal and pathological urines. AI-assisted high-dimensional morphology analysis distinguishes atypical urine samples from UCC cases with 89.1% accuracy at the single cell level. Future applications of this study include early detection or monitoring of UCC cases using non-invasive patient samples such as urine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Urine,Machine learning,Image analysis,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

Biopsies for pancreatic cancer are known to be particularly difficult to perform because of the location of the pancreas and low volume of primary tumors that metastasize aggressively. Currently, there is no blood test or other screening modality in use, for stratification of individuals with higher-than-average risk (5-8-fold) of developing PDAC in their lifetime. Given this existing void in the US and worldwide, an FDA-compliant, minimally invasive, quantitative biomarker test for the early detection of PDAC would be critical for screening subpopulations with, a) inherent genetic or familial predisposition; history of chronic pancreatitis; c) precursor lesions of pancreas; and d) older patients (&#62;50 years) with new onset diabetes or sudden weight loss. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are shed by normal and cancer cells and carry a rich molecular cargo that can be leveraged for biomarker discovery. Whereas molecular profiling of bio-fluids poses intrinsic limitations for detection of low abundant, disease-specific biomarkers due to matrix effects; EVs, on the other hand, offer promise as a robust and minimally invasive biomarker resource. Mass spectrometry data were developed in our laboratory, based on multi-omics (proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics) analyses of plasma EVs derived from patients diagnosed with early-stage PC (N=60), pancreatitis (N=39), precursor lesions of pancreas (N=45) as well as normal controls (N=50). These clinically annotated samples were made available by the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) repository. Feature selection using a training-validation design allowed the development of a multiplexed biomarker panel comprising of 12-analytes (5-lipids, 2-metabolites and 5-proteins) that can robustly stratify early-stage PC from normal controls with high accuracy (AUC&#62;95%). Availability of a FDA compliant, multi-analyte-based classification algorithm that can stratify patients with precursor lesions of the pancreas that are at potential risk of progression to PC with &#62; 90% specificity and sensitivity is a critical clinical need. Refinement of panel to improve positive predictive value as well as identification of markers predictive of progression of precursor lesions to malignant transformation is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biomarkers,Extracellular vesicles,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

However, current prediction methods that rely on self-reported lifestyle information lack accuracy. We previously demonstrated that driver-mutated clones remodel the esophageal epithelium with age and that this remodeling is accelerated in heavy drinkers and smokers. Nonetheless, predicting cancer from clonal expansion in normal tissues remains challenging, due to limited sample availability beyond the blood. The squamous epithelium continuously covers the esophagus, throat, and oral cavity. Therefore, we evaluated buccal mucosal remodeling by mutant clones and its potential as a predictive biomarker of ESCC. A total of 387 buccal mucosa samples were collected from 110 subjects, including 62 with ESCC and 48 without, using swabs of three different sizes, followed by error-corrected sequencing targeting 26 driver genes that showed positive selection in samples from ESCC and physiologically normal esophageal tissues, as well as <i>ALDH2<\/i> and <i>ADH1B<\/i>. Somatic mutations were detected in all samples (median, 27 (1-134)). In total, 13,235 mutations, including 12,085 nonsynonymous and 1,150 synonymous mutations, with VAFs ranging from 0.0016-0.12 (median, 0.0025), were detected. Ten of the 26 genes, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>NOTCH1<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>NOTCH2<\/i>, <i>FAT1<\/i>, <i>AJUBA<\/i>, <i>PPM1D<\/i>, <i>ARID1A<\/i>, and <i>ZNF750<\/i> showed positive selection (dN\/dS &#62;1, q&#60;0.1). Correlation analysis demonstrated that driver mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>FAT1<\/i>, and <i>PPM1D<\/i> were positively correlated with not only germline risk variants of ALDH2 but also alcohol consumption. The impact of alcohol consumption on the number and sum of VAFs of mutations in each of the three genes was analyzed and stratified by the presence or absence of the germline risk variant of <i>ALDH2<\/i>, and positive correlations were observed only among subjects with risk variants. Compared to subjects without ESCC, patients with early-stage or advanced ESCC displayed significantly higher numbers and sums of VAFs of driver mutations (p&#60;0.05). These results indicated that buccal mucosal remodeling driven by positively selected mutations is associated with lifestyle and germline risk factors for ESCC, thus motivating the establishment of a predictive model for ESCC using genetic swab data. The prediction model for ESCC using sequencing data outperformed a model using self-reported lifestyle and alcohol flushing reaction and a model using lifestyle and germline risk variants (AUC of 0.94, 0.72, and 0.88, respectively). In conclusion, this is the first study to use clonal expansion in normal tissues to predict the presence of solid organ cancer, and our study successfully established a prediction model for ESCC based on buccal mucosal remodeling and germline variants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Alcohol,Mutations,Oral cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In this study, we performed single nucleus RNA-seq on three human salivary gland samples to clarify the gene expression profile of each complex cellular component of the salivary glands and related these expression patterns to expression found in salivary gland cancers (SGC) to infer cell of origin. By single nucleus RNA-seq, total 13,643 salivary gland cells were stratified into four clusters: acinar cells, ductal cells 1, ductal cells 2, and myoepithelial cells\/stromal cells, with differentially expressed genes of each group. The localization of each cell group was anatomically validated by IHC of each cluster marker gene, and one group of ductal cells was found to represent intercalated ductal cells labeled with HES1. Gene ontology analysis for this group included &#8220;epithelial cell differentiation&#8221; confirming the intercalated duct. Furthermore, to elucidate the potential etiologic relationship between normal salivary glands cell type and salivary gland carcinoma histology, we compared the expression of each cluster marker to SGC public RNA-seq data. In comparison between AciCC and ACC, we used normalized RNA-seq data of 54 ACC and 21 AciCC. ACC had significantly less expression of acinar cells markers (STATH, CST2, and LPO) compared to other markers expression<i>(<\/i><b>***<\/b><i>P <\/i>= 4x10<sup>-51<\/sup>), unlike AciCC<i> (P <\/i>= 0.54), suggesting a possible contribution of acinar cells to the carcinogenesis of AciCC. In another cohort, we compared 16 SDC, and 38 MECA with publicly available RNA-seq data. Remarkably, HES1 and ELF3, each of two different ductal cell markers, were significantly upregulated in SDC consistent with origin of SDC from ductal cells (<i>P<\/i>=0.001, <i>P<\/i>=0.0007, respectively). Consistent with bulk RNA-seq results, expression of HES1 in IHC using clinical human SDC and MECA samples was higher in SDC than MECA, suggesting that the expression of the derived cells is involved in salivary gland carcinogenesis. Cell type expressions in specific SGC histology are similar to those found in normal salivary gland populations, indicating a potential etiologic relationship. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in myoepithelial marker ACTA2 expression between SDC and MECA, suggesting that the markers of origin are not always highly expressed, depending on cancer subtypes. Although publicly available SGC RNA-seq data used in this study are limited, the results remarkably reflect the diverse modes of carcinogenesis of SGC. These findings might provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of SGC and treatment strategies for SGC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Head and neck cancers,Saliva,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
