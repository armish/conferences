Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptors are present in nearly 70% of breast cancers. Estrogen receptor and estrogens in breast cancer has been extensively studied and targeted effectively through endocrine therapy, however the impact of progesterone and the progesterone receptor (PR) independent of estrogen is not well understood. We have previously demonstrated that PR promotes tumor growth and drives an immune suppressive environment, therefore understanding the biology of PR in breast cancer is critical. We demonstrated that PR attenuates type 1 interferon signaling via inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and increased degradation of STAT2. In this study we investigated the mechanism of PR regulation of IFN signaling. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation can influence PR target gene promoter selectivity thereby altering its function. We have identified that PR is modified by O-GlcNAc, a single N-acetyl-glucosamine sugar that cycles on and off and serine or threonine amino acids in nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. Levels of total O-GlcNAc staining are higher in breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Active O-GlcNAcylation, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry staining of O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT), is elevated in patients with PR+ tumors compared to PR-. Using T47D breast cancer cells (an ER\/PR-positive tumor line), mass spectrometry analysis revealed an O-GlcNAc site at S499, S733 and S735 on PR. Using a naturally occurring PR-negative variant of T47D cells, we introduced stable expression of a mutant PR with serine to alanine substitution at the O-GlcNAc sites (S499A, S733A, S75A), thereby blocking O-GlcNAc flux, in addition to wt PR as a control. RNA-Seq analysis of these cells following treatment with progesterone revealed ligand dependent PR gene regulation, however major differences were observed in gene expression of the two cell lines independent of ligand. These results indicate ligand independent PR suppression of IFN signaling requires O-GlcNAc at these three sites. Additionally, T47D-mutant PR cell lines implanted into immune deficient mice had significantly decreased growth compared to WT-PR control tumors. Together these findings indicate O-GlcNAcylation of PR contributes to PR driven breast cancer tumor growth and immune evasion via modulation of IFN signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-10 Steroid hormone receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Progesterone receptor,Interferons,Breast cancer,Tumor growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Development of a new therapeutic strategy is urgently needed. SCLC can be classified into subtypes based on the expression levels of four transcription factors: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, SCLC-P, and SCLC-Y, respectively). SCLC-A and SCLC-N are neuroendocrine (NE)-type tumors that secrete neurotransmitters and express their receptors. Recently, neural activity has been noted as a key regulator of cancer growth that affects cancer and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that neurotransmitters that regulate the biology of NE-type SCLC (SCLC-A, SCLC-N) can be therapeutic targets. To explore this, we created a drug library consisting of 560 drugs known to target neural signaling including various G protein-coupled receptors and examined their growth-inhibitory effects in SCLC cell lines. When three NE-type SCLC cell lines (NCI-H146, SHP-77, and NCI-H446) were treated with 10 &#956;M of the drugs as the first screening, 56 drugs in the library exhibited more than 50% inhibition of cell growth. After excluding drugs with possible nonspecific effects, the IC50 values of 24 drugs were examined in an expanded panel of 20 SCLC cell lines (7 of SCLC-A, 5 of SCLC-N, 3 of SCLC-P, and 5 of SCLC-Y cell lines) as the second screening. Sograzepide, a cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) inhibitor exhibited distinctly lower IC50s in NE-type SCLC cells relative to non-NE-type cells, suggesting that CCKBR is potentially a specific therapeutic target for NE-type SCLC. CCK plays roles both as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system and as a peptide hormone in the gut. In our <i>in silico<\/i> analysis, CCKBR expression was high in the brain and the stomach, but not detectable in the lung when normal tissues were analyzed with NCBI database. Interestingly, when cancer cells were analyzed with CCLE database, CCKBR expression was substantially high in NE-type SCLC cells, compared with other cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that the growth-inhibitory effects of sograzepide examined in the drug screening were correlated with CCKBR expression levels. Then, we conducted functional analysis of CCKBR in NE-type SCLC cell lines with high CCKBR expression: NCI-H146 (SCLC-A), H209 (SCLC-A), and H524 (SCLC-N) cells. Knockdown of CCKBR by siRNAs inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. When treated with sograzepide, apoptosis was induced dose-dependently, and cell cycle assays showed increase in sub G1 phase in these cells. Collectively, we identified CCKBR as a potential therapeutic target in NE-type SCLC through screening of drug library targeting neural signaling. Further studies are warranted to reveal the mechanism for antineoplastic effects of antagonizing this neuropeptide receptor in SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-06 Neuroendocrine and other endocrine factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,neural signaling,cholecystokinin B receptor,sograzepide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

First-line therapy (adrenolytic agent mitotane in combination with chemotherapy) for recurrent and metastatic ACC has limited efficacy and there are no approved second-line therapies. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging immunotherapeutic class in which a cytotoxic payload is directed to tumor cells via antibodies to cell surface proteins. As Notch ligands, such as DLL3, are ADC targets in neuroendocrine cancers, we screened for expression of Notch ligands in ACC. Among Notch ligands (DLL1, DLL3, DLK1, JAG1, JAG2), DLK1 (delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1) was the most highly expressed. Moreover, ACC had the near highest expression of DLK1 across all TCGA tumors likely because this ligand is of adrenal origin (with limited expression in other normal tissues apart from the pituitary gland and ovaries). By immunohistochemistry, we verified DLK1 to be expressed, at variable levels, in 97% of ACC tumors (n=30\/31). We then tested a DLK1-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADCT-701; DLK1-PBD), consisting of a humanized anti-DLK1 monoclonal antibody coupled to DNA damaging pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (SG3199; drug-to-antibody ratio~1.8) via a cleavable linker in ACC pre-clinical models. ADCT-701 exhibited potent, nanomolar cytotoxicity in DLK1-expressing ACC cell lines and ACC patient-derived short-term organoid cultures. ADCT-701 cytotoxicity was dependent on <i>DLK1<\/i> expression as <i>DLK1<\/i> knockout and <i>DLK1<\/i> overexpression abrogated and facilitated cytotoxicity, respectively. Mechanistically, ADCT-701 induced cytotoxicity through DLK1 dependent receptor-mediated internalization and DNA damage (&#947;H2AX) as well as apoptosis (annexin V\/PI positive cells, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3). <i>In vivo<\/i> studies showed that ADCT-701 was highly effective against DLK1-positive ACC xenografts and PDX models with durable anti-tumor activity. Our pre-clinical data demonstrate DLK1 as an important therapeutic target in ACC and support an upcoming phase I clinical trial of ADCT-701 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors including ACC (NCT06041516).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Preclinical testing,Thyroid\/endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.-Y.

Due to the poor clinical outcome of patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas, there is a critical need to identify new drivers, therapeutic targets, and effective therapeutic strategies for these malignancies. Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a protease that has a dual function in regulating protein stability. We demonstrated that UCHL1 is significantly elevated in tissues from patients with NEPC, SCLC, and neuroblastoma. Loss of UCHL1 decreases tumor growth and inhibits metastasis of these malignancies. UCHL1 maintains neuroendocrine differentiation and promotes cancer progression by regulating nucleoporin, POM121, and p53. UCHL1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes POM121 to regulate POM121-associated nuclear transport of key transcriptional factors, E2F1 and c-MYC. Conversely, UCHL1 binds p53 and promotes p53 degradation. Importantly, treatment with UCHL1 inhibitors significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis of neuroendocrine carcinomas. The combination of UCHL1 inhibitors with cisplatin, the standard of care used for neuroendocrine carcinomas, halts tumor growth in pre-clinical settings. Our study reveals new mechanisms of UCHL1 function in neuroendocrine carcinomas tumorigenesis and identifies UCHL1 as a therapeutic target and potential molecular indicator for diagnosis and monitoring treatment responses in neuroendocrine carcinomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-06 Neuroendocrine and other endocrine factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine differentiation,Ubiquitination,p53,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

New treatment options are urgently needed. TGF-&#946; promotes stromal cell reprogramming, immunosuppression, and fibrinogenesis in cancers, including PDA. Integrins &#945;V&#946;8 and &#945;V&#946;1 are important activators of TGF-&#946; signalling. Selective integrin blockade has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to address TGF-&#946;-mediated immunotherapy resistance and improve anti-tumour response across cancer models. The purpose of this study was to assess the in vivo efficacy of small molecule inhibitor PLN-104, a selective inhibitor of &#945;V&#946;1, and PLN-101095, a dual inhibitor of &#945;V&#946;8 and &#945;V&#946;1, in well-annotated models of advanced PDA.<br \/>We determined the preclinical efficacy and detailed anti-stromal effect of PLN-101095 inhibitor in genetically defined and patient-derived PDA models, including clinically relevant combinations with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy and anti-programmed death receptor-1 antibody (anti-mPD-1). Mechanistic assessment of alterations in tumour cell-stromal cell crosstalk was performed using comprehensive transcriptomics and immunofluorescence approaches.<br \/>Dual targeting of &#945;V&#946;8 and &#945;V&#946;1 with PLN-101095 in the syngeneic LSL-KrasG12D\/+;LSL-Trp53R172H\/+;Pdx1-Cre (KPC) model effectively reduced tumour growth by 45% in comparison to the vehicle, and significantly delayed disease progression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Single-cell analysis of PLN-101095-treated KPC pancreatic tumours revealed a positive reprogramming of malignant cells from a mesenchymal to a more epithelial-like state. This effect was further associated with an upregulation of MHC type I\/II markers and corresponding downregulation of pro-metastatic factors across diverse cancer sub-populations. Additionally, combining PLN-101095 with anti-mPD-1 antibody further improved survival in this aggressive model of metastatic PDA. In a second syngeneic model, Pan02, PLN-101095 in combination with anti-mPD-1 antibody significantly reduced tumour growth, while increasing CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration. The combination of PLN-101095 with Anti-PD1 increased MHC and IFN gene expression. Finally, utilizing patient-derived models of metastatic PDA revealed that both PLN-104 and PLN-101095 significantly blocked tumour growth, improved the response to SoC chemotherapy Gemcitabine\/Abraxane, and reduced metastatic spread to distant sites. In conclusion, these data provide scientific rationale for the design of future PLN-101095 and SoC chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy combinations in pancreatic cancer, with Phase I first-in-human oncology studies with PLN-101095 plus ICB already underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Therapeutics,Integrins,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Clinical studies have shown that <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations are frequently observed in metastatic ER-positive breast cancer patients and are associated with poor survival. It is well appreciated that activ&#173;at&#173;ing <i>ESR1 <\/i>somatic mutations, especially Y537S and D538G, can drive estrogen-independent activities. In addition, these <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations diminish the potency of the current standard-of-care agents (tamoxifen and fulvestrant) that bind ER&#945; directly. Therefore, it is an unmet need to develop next-generation antiestrogens that inhibit ER&#945; mutant signaling in breast cancer to improve patient survival. Here, we search for small molecule inhibitors against ER&#945; mutants Y537S and D538G using DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL).<br \/>Methods: ER&#945; ligand binding domain (LBD) proteins corresponding to wild type (WT), Y537S and D538G mutants were expressed in <i>E. coli<\/i> and purified by Ni-NTA, anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. The ability of these purified proteins to bind ligands was tested in biochemical assays to validate their use in DEL selections. We conducted a DEL affinity selection using our in-house collection of 6 billion small molecule compounds against WT, Y537S and D538G mutants ER LBD proteins in the presence and absence of estradiol. Selection hits that enriched with these targets were resynthesized off-DNA and tested in biochemical and functional studies using CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in Y537S or D538G mutant breast cancer cells.<br \/>Results: We have successfully purified microgram amounts of ER&#945; LBD for WT, Y537S, and D538G proteins. In our biochemical assay, the SRC3 peptide binds to the WT ER&#945; LBD in the presence of estradiol, whereas Y537S and D538G LBDs bind the SRC3 peptide in the absence of estradiol, consistent with these mutants constitutively binding to SRC3. Our multibillion small molecule collections of DELs can screen and identify several hits in WT and mutant ER&#945; LBDs. To confirm the selection output, we synthesized off-DNA compounds and validated these in biochemical and cell-based studies. Compounds CDD-1274 and CDD-1802 dramatically decrease the WT and mutant ER&#945; protein levels in multiple ER+ breast cancer cells. These compounds greatly reduce protein levels for GREB1, TFF1, c-MYC, E2F1, and survivin in wildtype<i> <\/i>and<i> <\/i>mutant breast cancer cells, and they increase levels of cleaved PARP, a marker for apoptosis in wildtype and mutant ER+ breast cancer cells but not in ER-negative breast cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study rapidly identified potent and novel small molecule drugs to target estrogen receptor mutants using our DNA-encoded chemical library platform.<br \/>Acknowledgments: Funding sources (NIH\/NCI R03 CA259664 and CPRIT RP220524 to MP).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-01 Endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Endocrine resistance,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Global proteomic analysis unveiled off-target protein degradation of progesterone receptor (PR) and phosphodiesterase 6D (PDE6D) by ER targeted PROTACs, but not selective ER degraders (SERDs). PR and PDE6D have previously been implicated as targets in cancer treatment. Protein degradation is rescued in CRBN- or VHL-knockout cells. Co-treating ER+ breast cancer cells with ligands for PR or PDE6D outcompeted PROTAC-mediated degradation and stabilized the respective protein, demonstrating the PROTACs are targeting the PR and PDE6D ligand-binding domains. Competition assays in ER-negative cell lines confirmed PR and PDE6D protein degradation is ER-independent. These findings underscore the importance of understanding off-target effects for developing more selective and effective therapeutics in ER+ breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Endocrine resistance,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.
