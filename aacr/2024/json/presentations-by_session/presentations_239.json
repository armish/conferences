[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide, and is responsible for the second largest number of cancer related deaths, warranting the need for new treatments. The successful use of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells against B-cell malignancies has inspired the search for CAR-T cell therapies against solid tumours such as colorectal cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a small population of cells within a tumour with the capacity to self-renew, differentiate, and initiate new tumours. CSC are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are enriched in residual disease. Targeting CSC is a strategy to reduce the tumours&#8217; ability to generate new cells. Leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a marker of CSC and LGR5<sup>+<\/sup> cancer cells are implicated in tumour progression and metastasis in colorectal cancer. We designed and tested a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the extracellular domain of LGR5. LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells showed significant antigen-specific cytotoxicity and IFN&#947; release against colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines <i>in vitro,<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in a CRC xenograft mouse model. We confirmed the specificity and safety of the LGR5 targeting CAR-T cells by testing against normal human tissues. A GMP ready protocol for clinical scale manufacture of LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells have been developed using CD3+ T-cells from healthy donors. We have successfully tested this protocol using CRC patient-derived CD3+ T-cells and were able to generate clinically relevant cell numbers (80-fold expansion) with high CAR expression. Cells manufactured using this GMP protocol expressed markers of self-renewing na&#239;ve-like and central memory phenotype and showed very low percentage of cells that were triple-positive for PD1, TIM3 and LAG3. This protocol has been successfully tested and validated in a GMP manufacturing facility for the production of LGR5 targeting CAR-T cells, in preparation for an FDA approved first in man clinical trial against metastatic colorectal cancer, starting in 2023 (NCT05759728).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Colorectal cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

However, prominent barriers, including limited proliferation, CAR T cell persistence, and poor T cell effector function, hinder its potential, especially in solid tumors. Various engineering approaches attempt to address these issues by armoring CAR T cells with factors that enhance the function and maintenance of T cells in the anti-tumor response. We previously described a human orthogonal IL-2\/IL-2R system consisting of a pegylated, IL-2 mutein (STK- 009) that does not significantly activate the wild type receptor and a mutated IL-2 Receptor Beta (oR&#946;) that does not significantly respond to its native ligand, wild type IL-2. This system provides a &#8220;private IL-2 signal&#8221; in engineered oR&#946;-expressing cells while avoiding signaling in bystander immune cells, reducing toxicities. We have demonstrated STK-009\/oR&#946;&#8217;s ability to selectively expand oR&#946;-expressing CAR T cells (SYNCAR T cells) targeting heme (SYNCAR-001, CD19) and solid tumor (SYNCAR-002, GPC3) targets at will. Importantly, the system enhanced anti-tumor control driving deep and durable responses in both bulky lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor models. Additionally, in a non-human primate model, STK-009 did not potentiate wild type T or NK cells and exhibited no evidence of toxicity. Currently, the combination of STK-009 + SYNCAR-001 is undergoing Phase I clinical trials (NCT05665062).<br \/>Here, we conducted a direct comparison of several armoring approaches including the SYNCAR platform, the overexpression of c-Jun, an IL-15\/IL-15R&#945; fusion, and IL-18 in human CAR T cells targeting GPC3. To assess their effects in overcoming CAR T cell dysfunction, cells were subjected to continuous antigen exposure <i>in vitro<\/i>. STK-009 treated SYNCAR-002 T cells displayed an enhanced proliferative capacity, sustained effector cytokine secretion, and an increased activation state when compared to other armoring technologies and PBS treatment. In a HCC tumor model, treatment with STK-009\/SYNCAR-002 demonstrated superior tumor control with minimal toxicities. Interestingly, IL-18 overexpression also controlled tumors, but was accompanied by uncontrolled CAR T cell expansion and toxicity resembling severe GVHD.<br \/>scRNAseq analyses revealed STK-009-treated SYNCAR-002 T cells simultaneously activated effector genes and repressed an exhaustion gene signature. This analysis also identified a novel mechanism by which STK-009\/oR&#946; signaling induces a superior synthetic effector state via transcriptional repression of the stress response\/proteosome.<br \/>These findings support the advantages of an orthogonal platform that selectively drives and sustains potent T cell effector function without safety concerns associated with constitutively expressed armored approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,T cell,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Ethan Jung<sup><\/sup>, Helena Silva<sup><\/sup>, Marie Semana<sup><\/sup>, Ivan Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Somya Singh<sup><\/sup>, Michele Bauer<sup><\/sup>, Mohammed Ali<sup><\/sup>, Henry Rosas<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Burgess<sup><\/sup>, George Zeng<sup><\/sup>, Woei Chang<sup><\/sup>, Navneet Ratti<sup><\/sup>, Deepti Rokkam<sup><\/sup>, Patrick  J.

Despite negative margin resections and subsequent systemic therapy, PDAC often recurs. Additionally, most patients present with locally advanced and unresectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) and form a biophysical barrier, limiting immune cell infiltration. Moreover, CAF-secreted factors suppress the anti-tumor activity of T cells and shift cancer cells toward invasive proliferative and mesenchymal phenotypes. Therefore, targeting CAFs can enhance T-cell infiltration and improve the efficacy of T-cell based immunotherapeutic strategies. B7-H3 is an immune checkpoint molecule highly expressed on PDAC cells and CAFs. In this study, we investigate the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B7-H3 to eliminate metastatic PDAC in a preclinical mouse model in three different settings: I. Adjuvant II. Neoadjuvant III. CAR T cell monotherapy. Our CART-B7-H3 construct includes an inducible caspase 9 (iC9) suicide gene, which allows for the controlled elimination of the CAR T cells in the event of overwhelming cytokine release syndrome.<br \/>Methods: To validate the therapeutic potential of iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>, NSG mice were orthotopically engrafted with 1x10<sup>5 <\/sup>patient-derived PDAC6 cells and 9x10<sup>5<\/sup> hCAF1 cells at a ratio of 1:9, reflecting a clinically relevant model. In the adjuvant group, mice underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor (distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy) after 25 days. On days 30 and 60, they received systemic iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cell treatment (5x10<sup>6<\/sup>). In the neoadjuvant group, mice were systemically treated with iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells on day 19 and underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor on day 25, following another systemic CAR T cell dose on day 60. In the CAR T monotherapy group, mice received systemic iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells on days 19 and 60.<br \/>Results: <i>In vivo<\/i>, iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells in the neoadjuvant group effectively eradicated both local and distant PDAC metastases for the length of the experiment (180 days) and significantly increased the survival (P=0.0018), indicating long-term efficacy in the treatment of PDAC metastases with no adverse side effects. In the adjuvant and CAR T monotherapy groups, iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells effectively control tumor growth, eliminate metastases, and significantly increase survival (P&#60;0.0001 and P=0.0007, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: These data suggest that the neoadjuvant application of iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells may demonstrate persistent efficacy in eradicating both local and distant PDAC metastases. iC9.B7-H3 CAR T cells adjuvantly and as monotherapy achieved significant tumor control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Adjuvant,Pancreatic cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, on follow-up assessment, a notable fraction of the patients with significant initial clinical response eventually experienced relapse. CAR T cell therapies targeting solid tumors have shown an even lower rate of clinical response as well as shorter remission periods. A prior study has shown that re-injection of the anti-HER2 CAR T cells was effective in a rhabdomyosarcoma relapse patient (Cancer Res 79, LB147 (2019)), but the repeated production of CAR T cells is costly, thus raising questions about its feasibility in practice. Previously, we developed a cotinine-based CAR T cell system (zCART) comprised of a tumor antigen-specific affibody conjugated with cotinine and an anti-cotinine scFv CAR, and demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of an anti-HER2 zCART treatment in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>settings. In this study, we tested the efficacy of anti-HER2 zCART treatment <i>in vivo<\/i> using an intraperitoneal (IP) tumor model with a single infusion of zCART cells. The anti-HER2 switch was injected daily for 7 days. When the HER2 positive tumor relapsed, the mice were re-treated with the same dose of anti-HER2 switch treatment for an additional 7 days. We observed that re-injection of only the anti-HER2 switch and not combined with zCART cells effectively and potently inhibited relapse of HER2 positive tumors. Furthermore, the efficacy of the anti-HER2 switch re-injection treatment was maintained in one additional relapse. In summary, the zCART system has potential to treat cancer relapse following CAR T cell therapy without the need for an additional production round of CAR T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Solid tumors,Antitumor activity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"K.

Here in this study, we dynamically collected peripheral blood and ascites samples from 5 patients in this clinical trial before and at 3 and 7 days after the infusion of CT041, respectively. Utilizing single-cell sequencing analysis, we found that patients with a high proportion of naive-like T cells were more likely to benefit from CT041. Furthermore, we discovered that the high expression of CLDN18 in the ascites epithelial cells was correlated with a favorable prognosis, while ascites epithelial cells showing high MYC expression and the strong interaction between tumor cells and T cells were identified as adverse prognostic factors for CT041 treatment.

Additionally, camelid VHH\/nanobodies provide greater flexibility for dual-targeting CAR-T cell therapies. However, camelid VHH\/nanobodies require laborious and costly humanization and still have a significant risk of inducing anti-drug antibodies when administered to patients. Transgenic mice exclusively harboring the most stable human VH genes (HCAb Harbour Mice&#174;) provide one of the best solutions to get fully human heavy chain only antibodies (HCAbs). To efficiently identify lead HCAb VHs for Claudin-18.2-targeting CAR-T cells, we developed an innovative direct CAR-function based HCAb library screening platform. From Claudin-18.2-immunized HCAb Harbour Mice&#174;, we constructed a total VH library in a CAR lentiviral vector that we developed in-house. After producing the lentiviral particle library, we transduced a Jurkat-NFAT-GFP reporter cell line and stimulated with Claudin-18.2 overexpression cell line. Subsequently, GFP positive reporter cells, representing Claudin-18.2-specific CARs, were isolated through FACS sorting, expanded, and further stimulated with Claudin-18.2-positive NUGC-4 tumor cells. Then, Next Generation Sequencing and abundance ranking was performed on VHs recovered from sorted CAR-reporter cells. Lead VH candidates were cloned into the CAR-P2A-RFP lentiviral vector, and many of these VH clones exhibited superior Claudin-18.2-specific functionality compared to a clinically-validated reference scFv in both reporter and primary CAR-T cells. Many lead VH clones also exhibited excellent developability as soluble HCAbs. These data suggest that this innovative method of combining our fully human HCAb and CAR-based library screening platform will provide new avenues for CAR-T cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Human monoclonal antibodies,Screening,Tumor antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Jason Noon<sup><\/sup>, Yao Lu<sup><\/sup>, Itishree Kaushik<sup><\/sup>, Oyku Ay<sup><\/sup>, Adam Luk<sup><\/sup>, Bradley Delaney<sup><\/sup>, David DeMeritt<sup><\/sup>, <b>Musheng Bao<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NONA BIOSCIENCES, Natick, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"79b3c5cd-2e80-4af5-a4bf-3dbf52e55956","ControlNumber":"6801","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

We constructed a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CAR lentiviral vector expressing a unique anti-PD-L1 scFv with moderate affinity (VaxCAR001) in order to compare scFvs derived from Avelumab or Atezolizumab. This project focused on the efficacy and safety of PD-L1 CAR-Ts, which are affected by their binding affinity and dissociation with the target protein, PD-L1 during the treatment period.<br \/>Methods and Results: The findings of this study revealed significant differences among PD-L1-targeting CAR-T cells with different affinities and dissociations. VaxCAR001 cells, showing intermediate affinity, demonstrated a higher CD8 ratio (up to 78% compared to 58% in Avelumab-derived and 45% in Atezolizumab-derived CAR-T), reduced expression of inhibitory markers including Tim-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT, (8%, 39% and 13% in VaxCAR001 vs 35%, 55% and 42 % in Avelumab, 19%, 51% and 34% in Atezolizumab scFv-derived CAR-T, respectively) and more sustained cytotoxicity. Notably, it maintained strong cytotoxicity even one month after production, while the Avelumab or Atezolizumab ScFv-derived CAR-T cells did not. In multicellular spheroid 3D co-culture with CAR T cells, VaxCAR001 exhibited superior infiltration into the core of spheroid and induced higher CAR-T-mediated killing for 3D tumor spheroids as indicated by LDH assay (68%, 800% increased than Avelumab or Atezolizumab scFv-derived CAR-T). Moreover, in an MSI-high AGC mouse model, treatment with VaxCAR001 cells resulted in a significant reduction in tumor size and prolonged survival until the end of the study period. On the other hand, treatment with the Avelumab or Atezolizumab scFv-derived CAR-T cells led to high mortality, with most mice succumbing within three weeks after CAR-T cell injection, suggesting an on-target off-tumor effect.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrates that VaxCAR001 cells bearing intermediate affinity and high dissociation rate for target PD-L1 showed the superior killing of PD-L expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo and manifested better safety profiles, as compared to CAR-T cells bearing scFv derived from commercial anti-PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibodies such as avelumab and atezolizumab. VaxCAR001 revealed extended cytotoxicity, enhanced infiltration into tumor spheroids, and greater tumor size reduction in <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Importantly, it also demonstrated superior safety profiles, as evidenced by reduced expression of inhibitory markers and fewer off-tumor adverse effects. These findings would accelerate the clinical stage developments as an effective and safer treatment strategy against AGC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Gastric cancer,PD-L1,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

To address this obstacle, AB-1015 contains an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic gate, consisting of a priming receptor (PrimeR) and an inducible chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is upregulated by PrimeR activation. The AB-1015 logic gate targets ALPG\/P and MSLN, which are coexpressed in ovarian tumors but not normal tissues. AB-1015 CAR induction within the tumor is expected to be a dynamic process influenced by multiple factors, including antigen density, target cell abundance, as well as tumor microenvironmental factors. To characterize CAR induction and receptor turnover, we developed an in vitro assay with plate-bound ALPG to induce CAR. CAR induction occurred quickly in response to ALPG priming, with most ICT cells expressing CAR within 24 hrs, and plateaued by 72 hrs. Once removed from ALPG, CAR expression returned to baseline within 96 hrs. Similar to conventional CAR T cells, the presence of the cytolytic target antigen (MSLN) was expected to increase the rate of CAR turnover on AB-1015. To assess this, we measured the CAR functional half-life of AB-1015 cells once removed from ALPG priming. The cytotoxic activity of AB-1015 cells rapidly decreased in the absence of ALPG, reaching baseline within 24 hrs. Of note, our in vitro assay did not result in 100% CAR induction from all PrimeR+ AB-1015 cells. To understand whether this reflected biology versus a limitation of our in vitro assay, we conducted a CAR induction, sorted the CAR- cells, then performed a second induction. ICT cells that did not express CAR after the first induction were shown to be able to induce CAR during the second induction assay, thereby demonstrating that all PrimeR+ ICT cells have the potential to induce CAR. To assess the sensitivity of AB-1015 for low density ALPG\/P and MSLN, isogenic cell lines were engineered to express each antigen at variable levels. In co-culture, AB-1015 was able to prime and kill targets expressing ALPG and MSLN at or below the limit of detection using immunohistochemistry. In light of these observations, the specificity of AB-1015 was verified using a dual flank in vivo model where one tumor expressed both ALPG and MSLN, and the contralateral tumor expressed MSLN alone. While robust anti-tumor activity was observed against the ALPG+\/MSLN+ tumor, no activity was detected against the MSLN+ tumor. In summary, AB-1015 CAR induction and receptor turnover kinetics is a dynamic process. A reductionist in vitro model system was developed, enabling analysis of CAR induction and receptor turnover. Importantly, we demonstrated that all PrimeR+ ICT cells have the potential to induce CAR. Finally, the in vivo specificity of AB-1015 for ALPG+\/MSLN+ tumors was established using a dual flank specificity model. Together, these data support the continued development of AB-1015 in a phase I clinical trial (NCT05617755).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

To combat this, strategies pairing CAR T cells with safety systems, for example, suicide switches engineered to induce cell death are being actively pursued. However, existing designs have limited performance characteristics and generally use unapproved small molecule controllers or non-human sequences. To overcome these issues, we have developed a novel suicide switch leveraging the well-tolerated, FDA-approved anti-cancer drug lenalidomide, as a controller of the stability of fusion proteins tagged with a &#8220;degron&#8221; sequence. Specifically, we engineered a stoichiometric pair of transgenes using the apoptotic DNase pair, caspase activating DNase (CAD) and its degron tagged inhibitor (ICAD-degron). We hypothesized that the overexpressed ICAD-degron could restrain CAD, until lenalidomide treatment degrades ICAD to unleash CAD for apoptosis. We found that our system was stably overexpressed and rapidly induced cell death even at sub-nanomolar concentrations of lenalidomide. A comparison of our design with the frontline safety switch, inducible Caspase 9 in primary human T cells revealed that the lenalidomide-induced suicide switch enabled more complete depletion of engineered cells. We tested the effects of our suicide switch on CAR T cell function and found comparable proliferation and tumor cell cytolysis with fast depletion upon lenalidomide addition. In vivo, lenalidomide suicide switch CAR T cells exhibited similar anti-tumor function as control CAR T cells and were rapidly depleted after drug treatment. In summary, utilizing all human sequences and a clinically approved drug controller, we developed a suicide switch that is well tolerated and can rapidly induce cell death even at sub-therapeutic concentrations of lenalidomide. More broadly, chemogenetic regulation of stoichiometric protein pairs is a generalizable strategy for post-translational control of highly active transgenic elements.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Molecular glue,Targeted Protein degradation,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Novel approaches are urgently needed. CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies. However, its application in AML has been hampered by the absence of highly AML-specific antigens, making current CAR T-cell AML therapies under development poorly tolerated and effective. This pre-clinical study introduces a novel CAR T-cell therapy, CCTx-001, specifically designed to target IL-1RAP, a 78-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. IL-1RAP, is highly expressed on AML cells but not on healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CD34+ HSPC). Additionally, transcriptomic analyses reveal a correlation between high IL-1RAP expression and poor prognosis in AML patients. IL-1RAP's predominant presence on myeloid leukemia cells, coupled with their dependence to IL-1RAP-related pathways for their survival, presents a promising avenue for CAR T-cell therapy without the risk of treatment-induced antigen loss. CCTx-001, an autologous CAR T-cell therapy, was developed to target IL-1RAP on AML cells. It comprises CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells transduced with a highly specific anti-IL-1RAP Single-Chain Variable Fragment (scFv), an IgG1 hinge region, CD28, 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains, and a CD3&#950; activation domain. In vitro experiments confirmed CCTx-001's efficacy in killing AML cell lines and primary AML cells of varying IL-1RAP expression levels, also demonstrating cytotoxicity and cytokine release that was dependent on the (E:T) ratio and target expression. Furthermore, in vivo studies using immunocompromised NCG mice confirmed CCTx-001's ability to target IL-1RAP and inhibit the growth of IL-1RAP-positive human AML tumor xenografts, leading to increased survival time. Biodistribution analyses confirmed the successful adoptive transfer, expansion and persistence of CCTx-001 CAR T-cells in vivo, only when injected into IL-1RAP-expressing tumor-bearing mice, which correlated with reduced levels of circulating AML cells. The promising preclinical data presented herein warrant the evaluation of CCTx-001 CAR T-cell therapy in clinical trials for r\/r AML patients. CCTx-001 CAR T-cell therapy offers a potential breakthrough in addressing the unmet medical needs of AML patients with resistant or refractory disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Acute myeloid leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

CB-012 was engineered with a next-generation Cas12a CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) genome-editing technology and leverages both checkpoint disruption and immune cloaking armoring strategies to potentially improve antitumor activity. The CB-012 anti-CLL-1 CAR was developed with a fully human scFv and the CD28 costimulatory domain and is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML (r\/r AML). Here we describe preclinical studies that supported the CB-012 IND clearance by the FDA in October 2023.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Cas12a chRDNA guides were implemented to generate five genome edits in the manufacture of CB-012. A multiplex genome-editing strategy was designed to enhance the antitumor activity of CB-012 through prevention of GvHD, PD-1 checkpoint disruption, and suppression of allograft rejection. <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies evaluated the specificity of antigen binding, antigen-dependent activity, and toxicologic potential.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>CB-012 demonstrated potent antigen-dependent expansion and cytotoxic activity against CLL-1<sup>+<\/sup> human AML cell lines and patient-derived cells in co-cultures.

CB-012 co-culture with multiple CLL-1-negative cell types representing vital tissues demonstrated that the anti-CLL-1 scFv does not exhibit tissue cross-reactivity. In an unbiased cell surface protein microarray, the anti-CLL-1 scFv demonstrated highly specific interaction with human CLL-1, with no detectable non-specific interactions.

However, the rarity of cell surface protein targets that are specific to cancerous but not vital healthy tissue has hindered its broad application to solid tumor treatment. While new logic-gated CAR designs have shown reduced toxicity against healthy tissues, the generalizability of such approaches across tumors remains unclear. Here, we harness a universal characteristic of endogenous T cell receptors (TCRs), their ability to discriminate between self and non-self ligands through inhibition of response against self (weak) antigens, to develop a broadly applicable method of enhancing immunotherapeutic precision. We hypothesized that this discriminatory mechanism, known as antagonism, would apply across receptors, allowing for a transfer of specificity<b> <\/b>from TCRs onto CARs. We therefore systematically mapped out the responses of CAR T cells to joint TCR and CAR stimulations. We first engineered murine T cells with an ovalbumin-specific TCR to express a CAR targeting murine CD19 and discovered that the expression of a strong TCR antigen on CD19<sup>+ <\/sup>leukemia enhanced CAR T killing. Importantly though, the presence of a weak TCR antigen antagonized CAR T responses, assessed by <i>in vitro<\/i> multiplexed dynamic profiling as well as<i> in vivo<\/i> cytotoxicity. We developed a mathematical model based on cross-receptor inhibitory coupling that accurately predicted the extent of TCR\/CAR antagonism across a wide range of immunological settings. This model was validated in a CD19<sup>+<\/sup> B16 mouse melanoma model showing that TCR\/CAR antagonism decreased the infiltration of a tumor-reactive T cell cluster, while TCR\/CAR agonism enhanced infiltration of this T cell cluster. We then applied our quantitative knowledge of TCR\/CAR crosstalk to design an Antagonism-Enforced Braking System (AEBS) for CAR T cell therapy. This was assessed in a model system using a CAR targeting the tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) together with a hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) peptide-specific TCR that binds strongly to mutated tumor neoantigen while retaining weak affinity for the wild-type self-antigen on healthy tissue. We established a humanized <i>in vivo<\/i> model of CAR T function and found that AEBS CAR T cells maintained high anti-tumor activity against a human lung adenocarcinoma (PC9) but notably, their anti-tissue cytotoxicity against human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was minimized. AEBS CAR T cells therefore sharpen the discriminatory power of synthetic anti-tumor lymphocytes. Our work highlights a novel mechanism by which TCRs can enforce CAR T cell specificity, with practical implications for the rational design of future anti-leukemia immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Systems biology,HER2,CD19,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Here, we sought to understand key T cell intrinsic factors impacting efficacy: CAR T cell expansion, persistence, and homing to the tumor. Using an endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) sequence as a &#8216;barcode&#8217;, we followed individual T cell clonotypes at the single-cell level from pre-manufacture apheresis and infusion products to tumor-involved lymph nodes and blood at peak and late expansion in 22 adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, an FDA-approved CD19-CAR T cell therapy, or bispecific CD19\/CD22-CAR T cells on an investigator-initiated trial (NCT03233854). The resulting CAR T cell atlas comprises matched transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and surface protein expression (CITE-seq) for 846,344 cells from 97 samples, with 251,175 unique TCR clonotypes identified, including 17,479 clonotypes that could be traced across &#8805;2 timepoints in CAR<sup>+<\/sup> cells, enabling lineage tracing at scale for the first time. We found that T cells present in apheresis that preferentially expand during manufacturing primarily comprise T central memory (T<sub>cm<\/sub>) cells and are enriched for predicted specificity to common viruses, including influenza, but also include a subset of T regulatory (T<sub>reg<\/sub>) cells. In infusion products, CAR T conventional (non-T<sub>reg<\/sub>) cells with superior abilities to home to the tumor, expand, and persist post-infusion share features of activated T effector memory (T<sub>em<\/sub>) phenotype enriched for expression of BATF3 and high TCF4 transcription factor activity. Baseline apheresis and infusion products were enriched for cells classified as T<sub>regs<\/sub> in patients with poor response. This observation aligned with our recent work linking post-infusion CAR T<sub>regs<\/sub> to progression following CD19-CAR T cell therapy. We therefore performed lineage tracing and methylation analysis of the T<sub>reg<\/sub>-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in the <i>FOXP3<\/i> gene and found that post-infusion CAR T<sub>regs<\/sub> are primarily derived from pre-existing T<sub>regs<\/sub>. Of interest, flow cytometry analysis of baseline blood from a cohort of 53 patients treated with CD19-CAR for LBCL showed that T<sub>regs<\/sub> are elevated in baseline blood relative to healthy donors. Removing T<sub>regs<\/sub> from healthy donor T cells prior to manufacturing enhanced CAR T cell expansion and anti-tumor activity against JeKo-1 human lymphoma cell line, whereas adding 5% T<sub>regs<\/sub> to mimic patient T cells rendered the resulting CAR T cells less active. These analyses pinpoint the identities of apheresis T cells and infusion CAR T cells with properties impacting efficacy, and also identify pre-existing T<sub>regs<\/sub> as limiting efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Multiomics,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

A key failure mechanism is the rapid terminal differentiation and exhaustion of CAR T cells, driven by persistent antigen exposure <i>in vitro <\/i>during manufacturing and <i>in vivo<\/i> in the DLBCL environment, which culminates in poor persistence and short-term effector functions. Recent studies have identified the transcriptional repressor PR\/SET domain 1 (<i>PRDM1<\/i>) as a key regulator that drives differentiation of T cells toward these unwanted fates. Further, single cell transcriptomic profiling of r\/r DLBCL biopsies has revealed <i>PRDM1<\/i> enrichment in a cluster of exhausted-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> CAR T cells. These observations indicate that targeting <i>PRDM1<\/i> could prevent or delay terminal differentiation\/exhaustion in CAR T cells, thereby enhancing their persistence for lasting anti-tumor activity. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 targeting, we have demonstrated that <i>PRDM1<\/i>-deficient CAR T cells exhibit enhanced proliferative capacity, memory characteristics, and resilience against exhaustion upon repeated stimulation. Moreover, genetic ablation of <i>PRDM1<\/i> also promoted the <i>in vivo<\/i> expansion and persistence of CAR T cells, which led to significantly improved survival of lymphoma-bearing mice. Mechanistically, loss of <i>PRDM1<\/i> leads to de-repression of PPARGC1A (PGC1&#945;), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant activity. This confers elevated tolerance to oxidative damage in CAR T cells lacking <i>PRDM1<\/i>, which showed increased capacity to buffer oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial uncouplers and constant stimulation. These findings suggest that <i>PRDM1<\/i> loss may improve CAR T cell fitness through PGC1&#945; upregulation and mitochondrial activation. From a translational perspective, we assessed the potential synergistic effects of PGC1&#945; agonist, bezafibrate, with CAR T cells. Dual therapy with bezafibrate and CAR T cells mediated more robust expansion and anti-tumor immunity of CAR T cells without causing discernible adverse events. Importantly, bezafibrate alone had no direct tumoricidal effects, which indicates that bezafibrate suppressed tumor growth through modulating CAR T cell functions. Moving forward, we will uncover the previously uncharted role of <i>PRDM1<\/i> in orchestrating the mitochondrial and metabolic activity of CAR T cells. Building upon a correlation between <i>PRDM1<\/i> expression and CAR T cell dysfunction, we aim to pioneer the use of <i>PRDM1<\/i> and\/or its target genes as novel biomarkers for predicting clinical responses of r\/r DLBCL patients to CAR T cell therapy. Our endeavors will shed light on the long-standing conundrum of CAR T cell dysfunction and offer solutions that may be applicable for improving T cell-based therapy against cancer in general.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Differentiation,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite restrictions on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use in registration clinical trials due to potential worsening of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), G-CSF is often prescribed for neutrophil recovery post-CAR-T in clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective study to assess the association between G-CSF use and the safety and efficacy of CAR-T.<br \/>Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval, we retrospectively analyzed NHL patients receiving commercial CD19-targeted CAR-T across Mayo Clinic sites (Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota) between October 2017 and May 2023. Demographics, labs, and post CAR-T events were collected. Electronic medical records were reviewed for G-CSF exposure within Day 1 - 100 post-CAR T. Differences by G-CSF status were examined using a Chi-square test and Kruskal Wallis tests. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) were calculated using Cox model.<br \/>Results: Among 270 CAR-T patients; 106 received G-CSF within 30 days and 164 did not. Median age was 56.9 with G-CSF and 58.3 without G-CSF. Most were male (75.2% G-CSF, 62.6% no G-CSF). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma was the predominant NHL subtype (67.0% G-CSF, 65.2% no G-CSF).<br \/>G-CSF within 30 days was not associated with reduced incidence of neutropenic fever (11.7% G-CSF vs 9.9% no G-CSF, p = 0.6593) or documented infection (22.1% vs 18.3%, p = 0.4439). G-CSF correlated with decreased profound neutropenia duration (ANC &#60; 100 &#956;L, 0 vs 2 days, p &#60; 0.0001) and incidence within 30 days ( 31.7% vs 60.4%, p &#60; 0.0001) as well as incidence of protracted profound neutropenia (&#62; 7 days, 3.8% vs 22.8%, p &#60; 0.0001). G-CSF was associated with a higher incidence of cytopenias between days 30 -100: severe neutropenia (ANC &#60; 500\/uL, 28.8% vs 15.2%, p = 0.0075), severe anemia (Hb &#60; 8 g\/dL, 21% vs 9.7%, p = 0.0114), and severe thrombocytopenia (Plt &#60; 50 g\/L, 35.2% vs 20.9%, p = 0.0099). Logistic regression analysis showed that none of the examined covariates, including prior autologous stem cell transplant, ECOG PS score, and receipt of bridging therapy, were associated with severe neutropenia likelihood.<br \/>G-CSF was associated with a higher CRS incidence (89.6% vs 79.9%, p = 0.0343), but grade 3 CRS or higher (4.7% vs 3.7%, p = 0.6675) was no different. No difference in complete response rates (66% vs 61.1%, p = 0.4707) or 2-year OS (p = 0.523) was observed between the 2 groups.<br \/>Conclusion: G-CSF within 30 days was associated with reduced duration and incidence of profound neutropenia without a significant impact on incidence of neutropenic fever or documented infections. There was a signal of association between G-CSF and increased incidence of low-grade CRS and delayed cytopenias (day 30-100) that warrants confirmation in larger studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Neutropenia,G-CSF,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Lay She Ng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Claire I.

We have developed a novel investigational medicinal product, consisting of CAR T cells directed against ganglioside GD2 along with CAR-inducible secretion of IL-18, to enforce their activation response and effector functions in the microenvironment of solid cancers. Our lentiviral all-in-one vector combines constitutive expression of a 14.G2a antibody-derived GD2-specific, 4-1BB-costimulated CAR with inducible nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-driven expression of the human IL-18 transgene. A control construct contains EGFP in the place of IL-18 (GD2EGFPCART). Lentiviral transduction of T cells from various individual donors with both preclinical and clinical batches of virus resulted in CAR surface expression in &#62;40% of T cells. GD2IL18CART contained effector memory and central memory T cell phenotypes at similar frequencies as the control. CAR engagement by immobilized anti-idiotype antibody or by GD2-positive tumor cells selectively induced IL-18 release, with production of IL-18 strictly depending on GD2 antigen engagement. GD2IL18CART responded to interaction with GD2-positive tumor cells with superior IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and IL-2 cytokine release and superior target cytolysis compared to the control CAR T cells without inducible IL-18, whereas IL-6 was secreted at similar concentrations. In an NSG xenograft model of disseminated GD2-positive tumors, GD2IL18CART had superior<i> in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity than GD2EGFPCART, with eradication of GD2-positive tumor xenografts as detected by bioluminescence imaging while the control achieved only limited extension of progression-free survival. Finally, we established GMP-compliant manufacturing of GD2IL18CART that is feasible and efficient at clinical scale, using an automated protocol and device. Three validation runs confirmed robust expansion of CAR+ T cells to final cell numbers of 3.5x10<sup>9<\/sup> CAR+ cells (median; range 3.4 to 3.7x10<sup>9<\/sup>), with consistent transduction efficiencies of &#62;54% at the in-process control time-point and at harvest. GD2IL18CART from clinical-scale manufacturing runs responded to interaction with GD2 with strictly antigen-dependent secretion of both IL-18 and IFN-&#947; and efficiently lysed various GD2-positive tumor targets. In conclusion, we assembled all prerequisites for clinical evaluation of an IL-18 cytokine enhanced, GD2-specific CAR T cell product for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors, recruited on the basis of GD2 immunofluorescence pre-screening (EU CT 2022-501725-21-00). Besides addressing the safety of GD2IL18CART therapy in pediatric and adult patients as the primary endpoint, the study will allow to gain substantial knowledge on the biological effects of IL-18 in the TME of the individual solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,Ganglioside,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"L.

Pooled CAR screens (e.g. CAR-POOLING) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for testing many designs for improving CAR T cell performance. However, these screens are typically restricted to univariate readouts (e.g. abundance) and cannot measure the cell-cell and cell-TME interactions that are critical for CAR T success in solid tumors. Here, we present a platform for performing pooled screens <i>in vivo<\/i> using spatial biology, facilitating simultaneous measurement of cell autonomous phenotypes, cell-cell interactions, and cell-environment interactions for hundreds of distinct cell therapy designs in a single mouse.<br \/>Methods: We developed a custom spatial biology workflow to determine the identity of specific CAR constructs, armorings, or combinations in specific individual cells from a microscope image (&#8220;design deconvolution&#8221;). We combined this design deconvolution with simultaneous multiplexed spatial biology phenotyping in the same cells &#38; samples, followed by computer vision interpretation to quantify each design&#8217;s performance across functional categories important for efficacy in solid tumors such as: tumor infiltration, tumor cell killing, proliferation, response to antigen heterogeneity &#38; escape, exhaustion, persistence, and activity in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. In multiple mouse cancer models, we quantified the performance of hundreds of different cell therapy designs.<br \/>Results: Using our pooled screens, we identified designs with superior performance in solid tumors across one or more key functional categories (e.g. infiltration, activity in immunosuppressive TMEs, etc.). We also mapped the landscape of cell therapy design principles by comparing dozens of existing designs derived from the literature head-to-head in the same animal, and we compared these benchmarked designs to novel cell therapies designed to improve CAR T function. We used these data to identify common rules that govern the design-phenotype relationship for CAR Ts in solid tumors and to identify CAR T designs with desired properties in solid tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Using a pooled <i>in vivo<\/i> screening platform, we discovered cell therapies that outperform existing designs across a variety of clinically-relevant metrics. Our spatial multi-omics measurements are critical for identifying designs that can effectively traffic to, infiltrate, and function in the solid tumor microenvironment. We are now using our pooled <i>in vivo<\/i> screens to identify highly efficacious designs in multiple solid tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Genomics,Immuno-oncology,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Cassandra Kontur<sup><\/sup>, Gundula Povysil<sup><\/sup>, Megha Sah<sup><\/sup>, Mariya London<sup><\/sup>, Nan Chen<sup><\/sup>, Annie Dyatel<sup><\/sup>, Stephen Pu<sup><\/sup>, David  V.

As this treatment modality continues to evolve toward the targeting of novel tumor antigens and engineering of CAR constructs that enhance cell persistence, there is a need for reagents that can be leveraged to selectively interrogate multiple aspects of CAR-T cell biology. Here, we report on a novel and highly versatile recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibody raised against the Gly4Ser peptide linker, which is commonly integrated into single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-based CARs. This antibody can be leveraged for flow cytometry-based CAR detection, bead-based CAR-T cell enrichment, and selective activation of CAR transduced cells.<br \/>Methods: The recombinant monoclonal antibody, E7O2V, was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide containing multiple repeats of the Gly4Ser core pentapeptide. E7O2V was directly conjugated to a panel of fluorophores and validated for specificity in a live cell flow cytometry assay using non-transduced and CAR-transduced primary human T cells. To assess its utility in cell enrichment using bead-based sorting, a biotinylated conjugate of E7O2V was used in combination with streptavidin releasable magnetic meads to immunoaffinity purify CAR transduced cells from a mixed population. Finally, a plate-bound antibody stimulation assay was leveraged to assess the ability of E7O2V to selectively activate CAR transduced cells.<br \/>Results: Live cell flow cytometric analysis of CAR-transduced primary human T cells revealed that E7O2V could detect surface expressed CARs, independent of scFv specificity. No specific staining was observed on non-transduced cells. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of bead-free, purified cells revealed that biotinylated E7O2V could enrich CAR transduced cells to a high degree of purity and viability. E7O2V was found to selectively activate CAR transduced cells, but not non-transduced cells, as demonstrated by upregulation of cell surface activation markers, including CD69 and CD25.<br \/>Conclusions: Exploiting the commonly used Gly4Ser linker of scFv-based CARs for antibody discovery, we identified a novel and highly versatile monoclonal antibody, E7O2V. This antibody binds to CARs of varying antigen specificity and can be leveraged in multiple assay formats to interrogate various attributes of CAR transduced cells, including CAR expression, CAR signaling, and transcriptome profiling enabled by bead-based enrichment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This rapid process provides great promise in cost reduction of CAR T therapy and opportunity to have cells manufactured in close-to-patient settings. CART cell manufacturing process involves: (1) collection of peripheral blood; (2) isolation of T cells; (3) performing transduction via viral vector; (4) washing CAR T cells to remove viral vector, and (5) harvesting CAR T cells in IV fluid. Conventional process uses magnetic separation and serial centrifugation technologies on multiple platforms with manual operations. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid manufacturing CAR T cells on an automated platform with closed fluidics without centrifugation steps. The platform, MARS&#174; Atlas, is built with innovative technologies in immune-magnetic cell isolation and acoustic cell washing and implemented as a modular system. In this feasibility test, T cells were isolated from peripheral blood from a healthy donoron MARS&#174; magnetic module. eGFP expressing lentivirus were added to the enriched T cells. After short incubation, cells and virus were washed with fresh medium on the MARS&#174; acoustic module and cells were incubated with virus overnight without activation. Infected cells were washed on the acoustic module to remove free virus. Product CAR T cells were harvested in saline solution and ready for QC analysis. Starting from 20mL of peripheral blood, magnetic T cell separation was done 2mL\/min achieving 90% T cell purity, 90% recovery. In the first acoustic wash, medium exchange of the mixture of cells and virus took place at 0.9mL\/min flow rate. As a result, 90% removal of contaminating molecule and 99.6% recovery of T cells were achieved. The second acoustic wash completed medium exchange of transfected cells at 0.9mL\/min with 96.7% removal of virus and 90% CAR T cell recovery. As a result, 18 million GFP expressing T cells were produced.<br \/>In this study we have demonstrated the feasibility of rapidly manufacturing CAR-T cells on an automated platform MARS&#174; Atlas. This result indicates the MARS&#174; Atlas being a potential CAR T manufacturing platform to be used in close-to-patient settings to enable low-cost cell therapy.<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup> Saba Ghassemi, Reducing Ex Vivo Culture Improves the Antileukemic Activity of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, Cancer Immunol Res; 6(9) September 2018<sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>2 <\/sup>Saba Ghassemi, Rapid manufacturing of non-activated potent CAR T cells, Nature Biomedical Engineering | VOL 6 | February 2022 | 118-128","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S. sa, E.

Importantly, all four FDA-approved CD3&#950;-based CAR T cell therapies use the same FMC63-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to target CD19+ tumors. Although response rates are high in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, only ~40% of pts achieve durable, long-term remissions. Improved CAR T cell therapies are therefore needed. We have previously shown that a novel killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR)-based CAR expressed in T cells as a multichain receptor with DAP12 (KIR-CAR T) has enhanced anti-tumor activity in several preclinical solid tumor models suggesting that this platform may show better activity in lymphoma. Some recent studies report that lower-affinity CD19 binders compared to the benchmark FMC63-scFv yield equivalent or increased anti-tumor activity of CAR T in pts, raising the question of optimal affinity for a KIR-based CAR. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship of affinity, functional avidity, and in vivo potency of CD19 binders in a KIR-based CAR T cell. Using a highly-diverse 40-billion member canine scFv phage display library, we generated 19 unique human CD19-specific binders that compete with FMC63 binder supporting a similar binding epitope. Different KIR-CAR T cells were generated, and relative affinities were compared via binding to a recombinant (rec) CD19 protein. We found that although CAR receptor expression was similarly expressed, the concentration of soluble rec CD19 protein required to saturate the surface CAR varied more than 2-log among the different scFv binders suggesting a range of affinities relative to FMC63. We selected several scFvs with lower, and equivalent CD19 binding MFI compared to the FMC63-scFv and found that all scFvs could mediate similarly robust in vitro potency. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was next assessed using the NSG xenograft mouse model of B-cell leukemia NALM6 cells. Interestingly, despite their comparable in vitro functions, some binders with relatively similar binding MFI failed to control the tumors. In contrast, two binders with an ~30-fold apparent affinity relative to FMC63 exhibited robust anti-tumor activity comparable to the benchmark scFv. These preliminary data suggest that the in vivo functional activity of chimeric KIR-based immunoreceptors is insensitive to binder affinity over a wide range of affinities. The failure of some scFvs with comparable affinity and binding epitope suggest that other, yet to be characterized attributes of the binder may be critical for optimal function. Further characterization of these binders is being conducted to understand the relationship between affinity, functional avidity, antigen density, and in vivo potency. This study paves the way for developing an improved CD19-specific KIR-CAR T cell therapy for treating pts with B-cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,T cell,Chimeric antigen receptor,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

This information is crucial for advancing CAR T cell therapies and improving their effectiveness in treating cancer.<br \/>To address the need for deep immunoprofiling at all stages of CAR T cell therapy, we created a robust and comprehensive mass cytometry panel of antibodies against 44 cell surface and intracellular markers. This assay allows for comprehensive characterization of CAR T cell features including surface marker expression, activation state, cytokine production, and differentiation status. These data will provide researchers with a better understanding of the phenotype of the CAR T cells used in therapy and can guide optimization efforts to enhance expansion, persistence, and self-renewal.

This is due, in part, to immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which include reduced oxygen tension, high interstitial pressure, and an abundance of immunosuppressive proteins, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, exhaustion, and depletion of adoptively transferred cells. Metabolic manipulation of therapeutic cells could overcome these barriers to enable cell therapy success in solid tumors. To this end, we have employed AVATAR technology (Xcellbio, San Francisco, CA), an incubation system that enables precise control of oxygen tension and hyperbaric pressure on cells in culture to improve the manufacture of adoptive T cell therapies. Using a CD19 CAR T model system, we have shown that transduction and expansion of CAR T cells under reduced oxygen and hyperbaric pressure conditions yield greater percentages and total numbers of lentiviral-transduced cells. While cells transduced in a standard CO<sub>2<\/sub> incubator yielded 10-20% CD19 CAR+ cells, transduction in the AVATAR system with increased pressure yielded 15-40% CD19 CAR+ cells. Similarly, T cell cultures performed under pressurized AVATAR conditions generated ~2X more viable cells after 10 days. Furthermore, these metabolically reprogrammed cells exhibit enhanced potency, with improved anti-tumor cytotoxic activity in vitro. We have extended these studies to measure the ability of AVATAR-expanded CD19 CAR T cells to control the growth of CD19-expressing NALM6-Luc tumor cells in vivo compared to CAR T cells grown in a conventional CO<sub>2<\/sub> incubator. Mice (female NOD.Cg-<i>Prkdc<sup>scid<\/sup> Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjl<\/sup><\/i>\/SzJ, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) dosed with the AVATAR-expanded cells exhibited good tumor control and increased persistence of CAR T cells in relevant organs, along with alterations in cell trafficking to the bone marrow and spleen. The transferred cells maintained a less differentiated phenotype, with central memory and effector memory populations, as measured by expression of the markers CD45RA and CD62L, dominating the T cell compartment. This work showcases the benefits of metabolic reprogramming to improve the yield and functional potency of CAR T cells, which has direct applications to reducing the cost and improving the efficacy of these lifesaving treatments. The AVATAR technology is currently being translated into a closed system bioreactor for use in GMP cell therapy manufacturing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of CAR-T in treating solid tumors remains unsatisfactory due to a range of factors, including CAR-T cell infiltration and heterogeneity. The efficacy of CAR-T therapy is substantially influenced by the tumor microenvironment. This is particularly evident when PD-L1 is activated through CAR-T, leading to the inhibition of CAR-T cell activity via the PD-1 pathway. In this study, we engineered a CAR-T therapy that targets mesothelin and concurrently expresses a membrane-bound PD-1 receptor. This design blocks the PD-1 on CAR-T cells, effectively counteracting the suppression of CAR-T function mediated by PD-L1. We observed a substantial upregulation of PD-L1 on AsPC-1 tumor cells after 4 hours of IFN-&#947; stimulation in vitro. CAR-T cells engineered to co-express PD-1 antibody (aMSLN-28BBZ-mPD-1) exhibited similar short-term cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion profiles to those of the traditional third-generation CAR-T (aMSLN-28BBZ). Notably, aMSLN-28BBZ-mPD-1 displayed significantly improved long-term target cell killing. Furthermore, in an <i>in vivo <\/i>model of pancreatic cancer, aMSLN-28BBZ-mPD-1 demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity when compared to the traditional aMSLN-28BBZ, as supported by RNAscope analysis and immunofluorescence assays of tumor tissues. These analyses revealed a marked upregulation of PD-L1 expression and enhanced CAR-T cell infiltration in the aMSLN-28BBZ-mPD-1 treatment group. In summary, our study demonstrates that co-expression of a membrane-bound PD-1 antibody overcomes PD-L1 mediated CAR-T suppression, as observed in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. This innovative strategy underscores its therapeutic potential and value in treating solid tumors.

Unleashing CAR T cell therapy against poorly immunogenic cancers requires new technologies that activate the tumor microenvironment (TME), while inducing CAR T cell migration, proliferation, and persistence into tumor to sustain tumor-specific immunity. We have developed tumor RNA-loaded nanoparticle (CD70-encoding RNA-NP) vaccines to overcome CD70-specific CAR T cell limitations in OSA.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Using two murine solid tumor models (K7M2 osteosarcoma and B16F0 melanoma, in Balb\/c and C57Bl\/6 background) highly metastatic to lungs, we implant K7M2 and B16F0 intravenously (i.v.). We subsequently generated NPs complexed with RNA encoding for CD70 antigen and control vaccine (GFP RNA). RNA-NPs are administered intravenously beginning on day 5 post-tumor implantation and day 7, 14 &#38; 21. Mouse CD70-specific CAR T cells are manufactured after activation of T cells with CD3 and CD28 antibodies for 2 days. CAR T cells are ready for use in downstream experiments 2 days after pMSGV8-mCAR transduction and cells were injected (i.v.) on day 6.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In preliminary data, we show that intravenous administration of CD70-encoding RNA-NPs rapidly recruit CD70-directed CAR T cells into tumor stroma unlocking their activity in two immunocompetent aggressive lung metastatic tumor models. Interestingly, regression of CD70-expressing tumors associates with CAR T cell mobilization out of peripheral blood and into reticuloendothelial (RES) tissues (i.e., lung, and spleen), a phenomenon that correlates with upregulation of vaccine-induced type I interferon (IFN) and activation of CCR2 pathway. In addition to the CAR T-mediated antitumor killing, an antigen spreading phenomenon was observed. The long-term survival benefit (150 days) provided by this approach reached 70-80% in both models compared with 0-10% of control groups.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Based on these findings, we hypothesize that tumor trafficking and persistence of CD70 CAR T cells depend on coordinated cytokine\/chemokine signaling that can be ignited through intravenous RNA-NP vaccination. RNA-NPs in combination with CAR T cells prolong long-term survival of mice bearing these aggressive tumor models which was not only mediated by CAR T cells but also by activation of endogenous adaptive immunity.
