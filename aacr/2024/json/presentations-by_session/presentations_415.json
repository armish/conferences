[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>The existing literature on colorectal cancer-related inequities among Hispanic\/Latino men may be poorly descried as most outcome data to date for this ethnic group are reported in aggregate.<b> <\/b>This study explored how masculine beliefs may influence colorectal cancer screening participation among ethnic subgroups of Hispanic\/Latino men aged 45-75 years.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Utilizing a consumer panel, self-identified Hispanic\/Latino men that were age-eligible for colorectal cancer screening and fluent in either English or Spanish were recruited from Florida, New York, and Texas (February-March 2022). The Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care (MBMC) scale, comprising six theoretically derived subscales, was assessed masculinity. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to estimate the association between MBMC and colorectal cancer screening participation, adjusting for Hispanic\/Latino subgroup, marital status, survey language, age, and health insurance status. Next, to explore differences by Hispanic\/Latino subgroups (Mexican\/Mexican American\/Chicano; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Other Hispanic\/Latino), results were stratified by subgroup and adjusted for confounding.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> There were 611 male participants, with roughly 31% identifying as Puerto Rican, 30% a different Hispanic ethnic background (&#8220;Other Hispanic\/Latino&#8221;), 26% Mexican, and 14% Cuban. More than half (63%) of whom had ever been screened for colorectal cancer. No variations in screening rates were observed across Hispanic\/Latino subgroups. Stool-based tests were more commonly used for screening compared to exam-based tests (60% vs. 49%). After adjusting for confounding, masculinity barriers reduced the odds of the screening participation. Differences were observed by Hispanic\/Latino subgroup for a few MBMC scale items. Specifically, Cuban men were most likely to report trust in healthcare professionals, but least likely to report receiving quality medical care. Latino men of other Hispanic ethnicity were more likely to report taking risks with their own health if it benefits their family. Among Puerto Rican men, higher scores on the restrictive emotionality subscale were associated with a lower likelihood of screening participation. Conversely, higher scores on the health-related self-reliance subscale were associated with a greater likelihood of screening participation among men of other Hispanic\/Latino ethnicity.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Differences in colorectal cancer screening participation by Hispanic\/Latino ethnicity were not observed, suggesting barriers to screening may be similar among subgroups. Masculinity barriers to colorectal cancer screening may exist among Latino men, particularly among Puerto Rican men. Intervening on these masculinity-related barriers masculinity may improve colorectal cancer screening uptake among Latino men.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Hispanic,Screening,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Prior ecological studies have shown an association between living in rural or disadvantaged areas and higher cancer morbidity or mortality, but research on the association between neighborhood of residence and cancer patients&#8217; healthcare utilization, health status, or quality of life has been limited.<br \/>Method: We used survey and electronic health records data on cancer patients aged &#8805;18 years (N=16,606) from All of US Controlled Tier Dataset v7 (summer 2017-July 1, 2022). Area deprivation index (ADI) was based on six items, including 3-digit zip code-level median household income, proportions of high school graduation, vacant housing, recipients of public assistance income, and individual without health insurance or with incomes below the poverty level. Rural-urban status was defined at the 3-digit zip code-level as urban (100% urban), mostly urban (&#8805;50%-&#60;100% urban), and rural (&#62;50% rural). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between ADI or rurality and health care utilization (general doctor, specialist, mental health, or nurse practitioner\/physical assistant [NP\/PA] visits) or health outcome (fair\/poor physical and mental health status, quality of life), controlling for various covariates.<br \/>Results: Cancer patients living in the most deprived areas (ADI 5<sup>th<\/sup> quintile) were less likely to have general doctor visits (OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.54-0.85), NA\/PA visits (OR=0.87; 95% CI=0.77-0.99), or mental health professional visits (OR=0.85; 95% CI=0.74-0.98), and more likely to have fair or poor quality of life (OR=1.31; 95% CI=1.06-1.62), compared to those living in the least deprived areas (ADI 1<sup>st<\/sup> quintile), controlling for all covariates. Similarly, rural cancer patients were less likely to have general doctor visits (OR=0.58; 95% CI=0.42-0.79) or mental health professional visits (OR=0.53; 95% CI=0.41-0.67), and more likely to have fair\/poor physical health (OR=1.27; 95% CI=1.03-1.57), compared with urban cancer patients. However, rural cancer patients were more likely to have NA\/PA visits (OR=1.29; 95% CI=1.04-1.58) and less likely to have fair\/poor mental health (OR=0.66; 95% CI=0.48-0.92). Cancer patients in mostly urban areas showed similar patterns to those in rural areas but the magnitudes of associations were smaller.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, cancer patients living in deprived or rural areas were less likely to have general doctor or mental health professional visits and more likely to have poor physical health compared to patients in the least deprived or urban area. Community-level interventions in deprived or rural areas are required to mitigate disparities in healthcare and health among cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Risk factors,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Compared to foreign-born Latino women, US-born Latino women have a higher incidence of BC. While prior studies have suggested this difference in incidence may be explained by risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, reproductive history, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, it is unclear how the risk of BC has changed over generations among Latinos women. In this study, we investigated the association between generational status and BC incidence among Mexican American women within the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).<br \/>Methods: The study population included 15,303 self-reported Mexican Americans from the MEC. Generational status was categorized as: 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation (Mexico-born, n = 6,347), 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation (US-born with one or two parents born in Mexico, n = 6,390), or 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation (US-born with both parents born in the US, n = 2,566). Multivariable Cox models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of BC incidence by generational status. All models were adjusted for relevant risk factors including age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, education, body mass index, diet, family history of BC, menopausal status, age at menarche, parity, mammography history, hormone use, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and Hispanic ethnic enclave.<br \/>Results: During an average 21.5-year follow-up, 815 incident BC cases were identified. The age-adjusted incidence rate (per 100,000) of BC increased by generation (1<sup>st<\/sup>: 191.9; 2<sup>nd<\/sup>: 265.3; 3<sup>rd<\/sup>: 284.0). Third (70.4%) and 2<sup>nd<\/sup> (66.5%) generations had a larger proportion of localized disease at diagnosis compared to 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation women (59.7%). Compared to 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation Mexican Americans, 2<sup>nd <\/sup>(HR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03-1.49) and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.02-1.60) had elevated risks of BC (p-trend: 0.02) The positive association with generational status remained significant when restricting to women who reported mammogram use (HR 2<sup>nd<\/sup> vs. 1<sup>st<\/sup> = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.55; HR 3<sup>rd<\/sup> vs. 1<sup>st <\/sup>= 1.34, 95% CI: 1.06-1.70) (p-trend: 0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that generational status among Mexican American women is associated with risk of BC, after adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, neighborhood, and reproductive risk factors. Further studies are warranted to discover the potential factors that contribute to this increased risk and elucidate the underlying etiology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hispanic,Cancer risk,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"X.

However, the effects of SED on lung cancer outcomes in an integrated, single-payer healthcare system, such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), remains unknown. We sought to examine the impact of area-level SED on access to care and outcomes in veterans with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with clinical stage I NSCLC receiving definitive surgical treatment in the VHA from 2006-2016. Patients were assigned an area deprivation index (ADI) score, a ZIP code-level measure of SED incorporating multiple poverty, education, housing, and employment indicators from the United States Census. Using multivariable analysis, we evaluated the relationship between ADI and guideline-concordant quality metrics (QMs) that stage I NSCLC patients should routinely meet in the preoperative (positron emission tomography [PET] imaging, smoking cessation support [SCS], pulmonary function testing [PFT], and timely surgery) and postoperative (cancer surveillance imaging, SCS, and appropriate oncology referral) periods. We also assessed the association between ADI and various cancer-specific outcomes including overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: The study included 9,704 patients. High ADI was associated with lower likelihood of receiving PET imaging (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.592, 95% CI 0.502-0.698) and PFT (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 0.816, 95% CI 0.694-0.959) before surgery. High ADI was also associated with delayed surgery (&#62;12 weeks after diagnosis; ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 1.202, 95% CI 1.058-1.366). ADI was associated with 30-day readmission after surgery (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 1.380, 95% CI 1.103-1.726) but not with 30-day mortality (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 1.221, 95% CI 0.816-1.826), major complications (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 0.927, 95% CI 0.780-1.101), prolonged hospital length of stay (&#8805;14 days; ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 0.893, 95% CI 0.755-1.056), or 90-day mortality (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 0.876, 95% CI 0.645-1.190). ADI was not associated with adherence to postoperative QMs (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aOR 0.888, 95% CI 0.764-1.032), OS (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aHR 0.984, 95% CI 0.911-1.062), or cumulative incidence of cancer recurrence (ADI &#8805;76 vs. &#8804;50: aHR 1.047, 95% CI 0.930-1.179).<br \/>Conclusions: Area-level SED is associated with inadequate adherence to preoperative QMs and increased readmission after surgery for stage I NSCLC. Our data suggests that veterans with high SED experience inadequate access to quality preoperative care for early-stage NSCLC but do not have inferior long-term outcomes after resection. Future VHA policies should focus on providing more equitable guideline-concordant preoperative care and preventing postoperative readmission for stage I NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Surgical resection,Mortality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Spatial medical accessibility is a component of healthcare access that captures the proximity and availability of healthcare resources in the area.<br \/>Methods: Ovarian cancer cases were identified through the KPNC Cancer Registry. Demographic and clinical information was extracted from KPNC databases. Neighborhood characteristics from the California Neighborhoods Data System were linked to the residential addresses of cases at the time of diagnosis. Spatial medical accessibility was measured using the 2-step floating catchment area method based on the location of the infusion centers where KPNC gynecologic oncologists practice and the residence location of cohort members. We used generalized estimating equations with independent correlation structure and robust standard errors to examine the association between spatial accessibility of gynecologic oncologists and time to ovarian cancer surgery, adjusting for year and age at diagnosis, stage, histotype, race, ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), and receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/>Results: The cohort comprised 4,910 women with ovarian cancer, of whom 3,304 had surgery at KPNC. Of this group, 13% were Hispanic, 14% were non-Hispanic (NH) Asian American women, 5% NH Black women, and 67% NH White women. The proportion of women residing in areas of the lowest spatial accessibility of gynecologic oncologists was highest among NH White women (26%) and women residing in the highest quintile of nSES (29%). The median time from diagnosis to surgery was 4 days (interquartile range 22 days). In adjusted analyses, not including the information on spatial accessibility, the time from diagnosis to surgery was 5.1 days longer (95% CI 1.5, 8.7) for NH Black women than NH White women. After adding information on spatial accessibility, this time did not considerably change, resulting in a 5.3-day (95% CI 1.7, 8.9) difference. In this model, the lowest quintile of spatial accessibility of gynecologic oncologists was associated with a longer time from diagnosis to surgery, but this association was not statistically significant (0.4 days difference, 95% CI -1.3, 2.0).<br \/>Summary: In our preliminary analyses, spatial accessibility of gynecologic oncologists was not found to be a contributing factor to the disparity in time from diagnosis to surgery between NH Black and NH White women. Further analyses will examine time from diagnosis to chemotherapy overall and stratified by racial and ethnic groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Race,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Medicaid expansion has been suggested to improve housing financial stability by reducing health care costs and improving access to preventative care. However, the role of expanded access to Medicaid on the relationship between housing cost burden and cancer mortality remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between county-level severe housing cost burden and premature cancer mortality by state Medicaid expansion status for all cancers and leading sites.<br \/>Methods: This ecological study used county-level data from 2016-2020 American Community Survey linked with county-level mortality data. Severe housing cost burden measured by percentage of households within a county that spend &#8805;50% of their income on housing categorized into quintiles (1=lowest, 5=highest) and state Medicaid expansion status (expanded and non-expanded). Age-adjusted cancer mortality rates and adjusted-mortality rate ratio (aRR) were estimated by sex.<br \/>Results: Across quintiles of county-level severe housing cost burden, age-adjusted cancer mortality rates were largely greater in non-Medicaid expanded states than Medicaid expanded states among women and men. Among counties in the lowest quintile of severe housing cost burden, rates for overall cancer mortality in women were 9% (aRR=1.09; 95%CI 1.05-1.14) higher in non-Medicaid expanded states compared with expanded states. Additionally, among the third quintile of severe housing cost burden, colorectal cancer mortality rate was 8% higher (aRR=1.08; 95%CI 1.02-1.14) in non-Medicaid expanded states. Among men in the lowest quintile of severe housing cost burden, overall cancer mortality rates were 5% (aRR=1.05; 95%CI 1.02-1.09) higher in non-Medicaid expanded states than Medicaid expanded states. Further, among men in counties in the highest quintile of severe housing cost burden, colorectal cancer mortality rate was 8% higher (aRR=1.08; 95%CI 1.05-1.12) and lung cancer mortality was 13% higher (aRR=1.13; 95%CI 1.10-1.15) in non-Medicaid expanded states compared with expanded states.<br \/>Conclusions: Counties with a lower fraction of households experiencing severe housing cost burden had greater premature cancer death rates within non-Medicaid expanded states than Medicaid expanded states. However, among men rates were also elevated in non-Medicaid expanded states in counties with the greatest severe housing cost burden.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,State Medicaid Expansion ,Premature Cancer Mortality,Housing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

The incidence and mortality rates of GC differ dramatically between racial\/ethnic groupings. In the United States (U.S.), Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Asian or Pacific Islanders are more likely to be diagnosed with GC and have a higher mortality rate than non-Hispanic Whites. Among the Hispanic population living in Puerto Rico (PRH), GC ranks among the top ten leading causes of cancer death, whereas this malignancy is not a major cause of cancer mortality in the mainland U.S. Tumor profiling approaches have resulted in the discovery of actionable gene alterations, which serve as a guide for treatment strategies and ultimately enhance the overall survival rates of individuals diagnosed with cancer. However, descriptive information regarding the genetic mutational landscape of GC tumors from PRH is limited. This study aims to describe the genomic profile of GC tumors in PRH and to identify the most prevalent genetic mutations. We retrospectively examined GC tumor mutational profiles from 106 PRH that underwent NGS testing from 2015 to 2022 (provided by CARIS Life Sciences and the Precision Oncology Alliance). We compared PRH GC tumor somatic mutation prevalence to TCGA and the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE), both available through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the database. Among the top mutated genes for GC tumors in PRH were <i>TP53<\/i> (54.1%, n=85), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (34.2%, n=73), <i>KMT2D<\/i> (30.5%, n=82), <i>CDH1<\/i> (29.4%, n=85) and <i>ZFHX3<\/i> (27.3%, n=55). The most frequent gene amplifications were <i>ERBB2 <\/i>(7.1%, n=84), <i>KRAS<\/i> (6.0%, n=84), and <i>CCNE1<\/i> (4.9%, n=81). Compared to other datasets, PRH had significantly different mutational frequencies of GC driver genes like <i>TP53, ARID1A, CDH1<\/i>, and <i>KMT2D<\/i>. This study is the first to report PRH GC tumor mutational profiles and compare the mutational frequencies to other non-Hispanic and U.S. mainland Hispanic populations using TCGA and GENIE data sets. Furthermore, our study provides data on the specific mutational landscape for Hispanics with GC and the implications on therapeutic options and clinical outcomes. Developing new treatments for genomically diverse populations requires understanding the most common carcinogenic molecular pathways that affect Hispanics with GC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Hispanic,Gene profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

The aim was to analyze overall trends along with two pivotal LC risk factors associated trends&#8212;tobacco use and air pollution&#8212;across ten most populous nations as of 2023 population census. Joinpoint analysis was employed to analyze trends.<br \/>Results: Globally, TBLC mortality has decreased by 8%, with reductions observed in both tobacco and air pollution-associated mortality. Despite a decrease in male mortality (-17%) and increase in female mortality (+15%), males have exhibited higher mortality for past three decades with M:F ratio of 2.5 in 2019. Similarly, male mortality was higher across all countries. Globally, although tobacco and air pollution-associated mortality has decreased for males and increased for females, both risk factors are linked to significantly higher mortality in males, with M:F ratios of 4.4 and 2.6 for tobacco and air pollution, respectively, in 2019. For tobacco-associated ASMR, China and Indonesia have shown an increase, while China, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria have shown an increase for Air pollution-associated ASMR. On evaluating proportional ASMR, tobacco and air pollution have overall shown a reduction, indicating an increase in other or non-risk factor-related mortality.<br \/>Conclusion: The fluctuating trends in tobacco-associated and the concerning rise in air pollution-associated in specific countries underscore the complex interplay of societal and environmental factors in LC mortality. The decline in ASMR associated with established risk factors emphasizes the necessity for focused interventions to tackle the changing molecular characteristics of lung cancer and its associated risk

We assessed temporal patterns of treatment initiation among women diagnosed with advanced HR+ BC and examined disparities in treatment initiation by race and ethnicity.<br \/>Methods: Women aged &#8805;65 years diagnosed with stage IV or metastatic HR+ BC between 2010-2019 were identified in SEER-Medicare. Poisson models were used to estimate age-adjusted annual incidence rates (IR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for treatment initiation within 12 months of BC diagnosis independently by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs were estimated to compare rates of initiation among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic patients with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients.<br \/>Results: Among 3,476 eligible patients with a mean age of 76.7 (SD: 7.5) years at diagnosis, 79.6% were NHW, 9.5% were NHB, and 6.0% were Hispanic. Among 2,668 women with HR+\/HER2- BC, most initiated on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) alone (56.7%), followed by AIs with palbociclib (12.6%). There was a temporal increase in rates of initiation of AIs with palbociclib (IR [95% CI] per 1000 person-years: 252.8 [240.8, 265.4] in 2015 and 343.9 [330.8, 357.7] in 2019. We did not observe significant differences in rates of initiation of AIs alone or with palbociclib by race and ethnicity. Among 537 HR+\/HER2+ patients, 25.0% initiated on AIs alone, 24.6% on pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy, 14.3% on trastuzumab with chemotherapy, and 9.1% on AIs and trastuzumab with chemotherapy. IRs (95% CI) for initiation of pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy increased from 175.6 (146.3, 210.9) in 2013 to 756.5 (698.3, 819.5) in 2019, while rates for trastuzumab with chemotherapy declined from 963.1 (809.4, 1146.0) in 2010 to 88.4 (72.6, 107.5) in 2019. Rates of initiation of AIs and trastuzumab with chemotherapy remained constant over time. Compared to NHW, NHB and Hispanic women were less likely to initiate pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy (IRR [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.27, 1.00] and 0.54 [0.24, 1.23] respectively) and more likely to initiate AIs alone (IRR [95% CI]: 2.23 [1.39, 3.55] and 2.98 [1.69, 5.24] respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: We observed a temporal increase in the initiation of AIs with palbociclib among patients with advanced HR+\/HER2- BC. Among patients with HR+\/HER2+ BC, rates of initiating pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy increased while rates of trastuzumab with chemotherapy declined. The observed differential management of NHB and Hispanic compared with NHW patients with HR+\/HER2+ BC using pertuzumab and trastuzumab with chemotherapy and AIs alone requires further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hormone-related cancer,Targeted therapy,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

This longitudinal, observational study aims to better identify whether race, household income (&#60; or &#8805; 300% the U.S. poverty line), or work-related factors may place some men with prostate cancer at greater risk for experiencing negative employment impacts from cancer treatment and its side effects. Here we report on individual and employment-related factors by race and income prior to treatment initiation.<br \/>Methods: AA and white men who were expected to undergo primary curative treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy) in the near future for prostate cancer were recruited through the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base (UG1CA189824, NCT03963739) between 2019 and 2023. Participants were AA or white, recently employed, expecting to be working in 6 months, and willing to disclose income status. Participants answered questions prior to treatment initiation related to employment and working conditions, work ability, and demographic characteristics. Differences in outcomes by race and income were analyzed with Fisher's exact test or t-test.<br \/>Results: The baseline questionnaire was completed by 244 men; 48% AA\/52% white and 64% higher\/36% lower Income. Most planned treatments included radiation therapy (60%) and\/or prostatectomy (41%), with no statistical differences by income or race. Higher income men were significantly more likely than lower income men to be married, have attained higher education, have a management or professional job, work full-time, be a permanent employee, salaried, eligible to retain their job under FMLA, work in an office\/home, have a psychologically demanding job, and <u>less<\/u> likely to hold a physically demanding job. AA men were significantly <u>less<\/u> likely than white men to be married, have attained higher education, have a management or professional job, or work in an office\/home. AA men were more continuously hopeful about the future (69%) compared to white men (52%; p=0.0079). There were no significant differences across categories in age, perceived current work ability in relation to physical (69% very good) or mental (71% very good) demands, or number of jobs held. Prior to treatment, participants reported almost optimal current work ability (mean 9.0, SD 1.2) with a range of 0 to 10 with 10 as best possible work ability.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, income category is a greater predictor than race of job characteristics that may impact employment following definitive prostate cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"African American,Race,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Joanne C.

While survival rates have improved, disparities exist among racial\/ethnic groups and socioeconomic factors. Our objective was to explore the connection between survival rates of cutaneous melanoma and demographic\/socioeconomic factors in New Mexico's varied population, particularly in rural vs. urban settings.<br \/>Methods<br \/>This retrospective study utilized data from the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR) within the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. A total of 3,979 cases of cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 among New Mexico residents were analyzed based on specific ICDO-3 criteria. The impact of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and stage at diagnosis on melanoma-specific mortality was investigated. Cases with incomplete data or where melanoma was not the primary cancer were excluded. Survival differences were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and the Cox Proportional Hazards Model, with analyses conducted with a significance threshold set at P=0.05. Only histologically confirmed melanoma cases were included in the study.<br \/>Results<br \/>In our analysis of 3,979 melanoma cases spanning 2010 to 2017, non-Hispanic whites (NHW) displayed the highest incidence (n = 3,617, P &#60; 0.001). Conversely, Hispanic Whites (HW) and American Indians (AI) exhibited a higher likelihood of later-stage diagnoses, with 19.2% of American Indians diagnosed at stage 3, in contrast to 3.9% of NHW and 10.3% of Hispanic Whites (P &#60; 0.001). Rural areas showed a propensity for advanced-stage diagnoses (P &#60; 0.001), and diagnosis stage exhibited an inverse relationship with per capita income (P &#60; 0.001). Increased mortality was observed among males, individuals over 50, and American Indians (all P &#60;0.05). Rural American Indian or Hispanic patients had a hazard ratio of mortality at 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15-0.89). An overall decline in melanoma mortality post-2012, with a notable reduction after mid-2015 (P &#60; 0.001), despite a slight increase in diagnoses from 529 in 2010 to 569 in 2017 (P = 0.034) was observed. Sensitivity analyses revealed that rural residence among AI\/Hispanic individuals was associated with a lower risk of melanoma-specific mortality (HR 0.37, p = 0.026 in the inclusive analysis; HR 0.36, p = 0.025 in the exclusion of in-situ cases).<br \/>Conclusions<br \/>Our study indicates rural residency is associated with more advanced melanoma diagnoses and lower income correlates with later-stage diagnoses. However, rural living may offer a protective effect against mortality for American Indian\/Hispanic populations. Overall mortality has declined since 2012, contrasting with a slight rise in diagnoses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Race,Risk factors,Malignant melanoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Here, we have used an ethnographic-phenomenology approach to study the disparity in breast cancer care in Assam by using retrospective database of a rural cancer care non-profit clinic, the KaviKrishna Telemedicine Care (KTC), set up 1994 to develop a CBPR based cancer care (Abstract 3342, AACR 2019). Methodology: For one and half years, the doctors, researchers, nurses, caregivers, and physician assistants of KaviKrishna Laboratory and KaviKrishna Telemedicine Care were interviewed (total number: 15), and plus literature of the lab and the clinic were studied. Then, the breast cancer patients (n=10) and the families were subjected to ethnographies-phenomenology study to find their experiences of treatment and suffering. Next, thematic analysis and grounded theory were applied to come up with novel approaches to reduce breast cancer disparity. For comparison, 5 patients from rich urban families were interviewed. Results: We found that 10\/10 patients found it extremely difficult to navigate the complexity of care in urban hospitals, but found the KTC approachable and comfortable. Importantly, these 10 breast cancer patients were positively responding to our KTC based care services\/focussed group discussion (https:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/8062404). They revealed positive experiences in emotionally and psychologically dealing with diagnostic, surgery, and chemotherapy processes. Next, our analysis of the last 25 years of the care data at KTC showed that in rural population, the loweconomic status, inadequate access to breast cancer detection clinics, lack of awareness,indecisive treatment protocols and social stigma are the main reasons for breast cancer disparity. Grounded theory-based analysis indicates that cancer biomarker study in rural populations can be a suitable method for early detection. Whole genome sequencing of cancer tissue frombiopsy samples shall provide landscape of mutation in the entire coding as well as noncodingregions. Mutation profiling along with correlation studies from patients can lead to discoveryof novel marker(s). Primary health care clinics in rural areas can be trained to collect patientsamples, isolate genomic DNA and perform PCR for the markers (a similar model asfollowed during Covid-19). The PCR samples can be sent to non-profit advanced diagnostic center such as KaviKrishna Lab to perform sequencing to study mutation markers. The method is also cost effective to both thecare givers and the patients as compared to setting up advanced diagnostic lab in every part ofrural area. Conclusion: The community based participatory research based model developed by KTC can be an effective strategy to reduce breast cancer disparity in the rural population since the primary health clinics shall act as a bridge between geologically isolated areas and modern technology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Combination therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"D.

In response, the Inclusive Cancer Care Research Equity (iCCaRE) Consortium was created to advance health equity and reduce disparities in prostate cancer. Addressing the unique needs of Black men require a genuine bidirectional relationship between scientist and the community. In the Black community, faith-based organizations are respected institutions advocating for health equity and justice. Given their vital role as community health gatekeepers, the iCCaRE Consortium partners with faith-based organizations. Rooted in community engaged research (CER), we conducted an environmental scan through stakeholder meetings to discuss the prevailing challenges and opportunities to meet the needs of the Black community along the prostate cancer care continuum. iCCaRE investigators including Partnership Engagement Services (PES) core partnered with faith-based organizations to ensure and advance community responsive cancer prevention. Together, with our faith-based leaders (N=18), we identified gaps including issues associated with the care continuum from screening to diagnosis and from treatment to survivorship; disparities according to health coverage and social determinants of health, and best practices to assist patients including care coordination, patient navigation, digital innovations, and programs offered by patient advocacy organizations. In response to the needs of the community and the strengths of faith-based organization, we prioritized our initial focus on increasing community prostate cancer literacy and activation using co-design educational infographics for both traditional and technology-based communication platforms. The infographics provided evidence-based facts about prostate cancer burden in the Black community; and using a call to action approach, we emphasized the importance of taking action for life saving screening, prevention and healthy lifestyle. Taking action in prostate cancer symptom recognition, survivorship care, and quality care. Also, co-designed infographics were created for clinical studies and biospecimen awareness and participation and the importance of advocacy and equitable care. Another component incorporated face to face trainings and presentations to enhance their knowledge of cancer screening tools, epidemiology of prostate cancer, and pathways to care. This presentation highlighted the first step towards community based intervention development, implementation and dissemination towards equity and justice for prostate cancer prevention and patient\/survivor improvements for Black men. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Screening,Cancer detection,Survivorship ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Some literature has identified connections between neighborhood disadvantage and aggressive PC, and AA men may be more likely to experience these factors than EA men. However, it is unclear if these associations may vary by race. We tested associations of two neighborhood disadvantage measures (neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and racial segregation) with prostate tumor aggressiveness, overall and separately by race. We hypothesized that they would be positively associated and that associations would be stronger among AA men.<br \/>Methods: We leveraged data from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Registry for AA and EA men who were diagnosed with PC from 2004-2021. We geocoded participants&#8217; addresses at diagnosis to determine census tract-based Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and Racial Isolation Index (RI) values. ADI analyses included men diagnosed in 2005 or later (778 AA men and 687 EA men), and RI analyses included men diagnosed in 2009 or later (606 AA men and 454 EA men) based on data availability. We used logistic regression to model the odds of aggressive PC, defined as a Gleason pattern of 4+3 or a total Gleason score &#62;=8, overall and by race. We fit models with scaled ADI or RI as the exposure variable, adjusting for race, age at diagnosis, and year of diagnosis. We also assessed an interaction between each neighborhood measure and race.<br \/>Results: Median (interquartile range) ADI scores were 118 (101-137) for AA men and 92 (83-102) for EA men, and RI scores were 0.68 (0.35-0.87) for AA men and 0.11 (0.06-0.20) for EA men, indicating greater neighborhood deprivation and AA residential segregation among AA participants. The greatest values for these scores were concentrated in central and west Baltimore. A one-standard deviation (SD) increase in ADI was associated with significantly greater odds of aggressive tumors for AA men (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.49; p&#60;0.01), but not for EA men (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.08; p=0.19), and the p-value for interaction (p&#60;0.01) was statistically significant. Similarly, a one-SD increase in RI was significantly associated with aggressive tumors for AA men (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.49; p=0.03), but not for EA men (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.80; p=0.29), although the p-value for interaction was not statistically significant.<br \/>Conclusions: Neighborhood disadvantage was significantly associated with higher odds of aggressive PC. The association of neighborhood deprivation and tumor aggressiveness was stronger among AA men. Additional analyses will consider other measures, including historical redlining, to further evaluate the relationship of neighborhood disadvantage with prostate tumor aggressiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Race,African American,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In LA, a total of 20,868 individuals have been diagnosed with HPV-related cancers from 2009 to 2019. HPV infection knowledge and interpersonal barriers contribute to HPV vaccine delay and refusal. Similarly, Latinos\/as continue to also have low participation in clinical trials research. To address the low knowledge, attitudes, and intentions towards HPV vaccination and participation in clinical trials (CT), we have adopted the NCI National Outreach Network framework and have used community health educators to deliver bilingual-culturally appropriate workshops on HPV and CT.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Individuals, 18 and over and parents with eligible age children (in respect to the HPV initiative) were recruited through community outreach and local community partnerships to participate in the bilingual (English and Spanish) health education workshops. A baseline assessment was administered before each educational workshop and a follow-up assessment was administered after to evaluate change in HPV and CT knowledge, intentions to vaccinate, and likelihood to participate in CT. Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess distribution of demographic variables of interest and a paired T-test was used to explore matched pre-post differences in knowledge scores and intentions.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>290 (HPV) 272 (CT) individuals participated in the workshops.

Even after federal- and state-wide initiatives to boost access to health insurance such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid Expansion to all individuals earning &#8804;138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and nationwide individual health insurance marketplaces, Latino populations continue to have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group in the US, with 17% of Latinos remaining uninsured compared to 5% of non-Hispanic white peers. In 2021, California and Oregon states amended their respective Medicaid program to expand eligibility to adults regardless of immigration status; which could reduce access disparities for patients from Latino communities. This study shows preliminary results of changes in health insurance status among Latina patients (who have multiple cancer prevention services recommended in middle age) receiving care in community health centers.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective cohort study of Latina, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic white women ages 50-64 years receiving primary care from 382 community health clinics in California and Oregon. Using 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 electronic health record data, we estimated monthly rates of insured-type visits per 100 visits. We compared rates pre- and post-Medicaid eligibility expansion, both within and between race and ethnicity groups. Reported estimates were derived from generalized estimating equations Poisson regression, clustered on clinic, and adjusted for clinic-level demographics.<br \/>Results: Of 41,960 patients, over half (53%) were Latina, most of whom (83%) preferred Spanish language communication. Latina patients had more uninsured visits pre-Medicaid eligibility expansion than did non-Hispanic Black and white patients (Rate: 27% versus 5% and 4%, respectively). All racial and ethnic groups experienced a decrease in uninsured visit rates, and this change was similar for all groups [Difference-in-difference Latina versus Black patients: 0.77 (95% CI 0.55, 10.7) and versus white patients: 1.02 (95% CI 0.89, 1.17)]. Overall rates of Medicaid-insured visits increased only for Latina patients [pre-to-post Relative Rate=1.06 (95% CI: 1.03-1.10)]. Both non-Hispanic Black and white patients experienced a drop in Medicaid-insured visits. Only Black patients experienced a significant decline in private-insured visits [pre-to-post RR=0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.89)].<br \/>Conclusion: These early results suggest an uptake of Medicaid-paid visits among Latina patients. This increase in healthcare coverage for Latina patients could significantly reduce disparities in access to primary care and especially in cancer preventive care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-12 Health services and comparative effectiveness research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,Health Insurance,Medicaid,Healthcare disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Furthermore, it affects Black women more adversely than their White counterparts, who experience an early disease onset, diagnosed more often with aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) molecular subtype, and face greater mortality. The reasons for these disparities; however, are largely unknown. Here, using a retrospective dataset, we examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with BC early onset and diagnosis with specific molecular subtype in race-based distributions. Study cohort included 1085 BC patients, who visited University of South Alabama Health clinics between October, 2017 and March, 2022. Patients were divided into three BMI [(normal weight, NW (&#60;24.9), overweight, OW (25-29.9), and obese, Ob (&#62;30.0)], three age (&#60;45 years, 45-65 years, &#62;65 years), and four molecular subtypes [Luminal A (HR+, HER2-), Luminal B (HR+, HER2+), HER2 enriched (HR-, HER2+), and TNBC (HR-, HER2-) categories. The data show a higher prevalence of BC in Ob women (46%) than OW (27%) and NW (27%) women of all age groups and its incidence was much greater in Ob Black women (61%) than Ob White women (39%). Further, Black women had nearly twice higher diagnosis at an early age than White women. Moreover, Ob Black women had over 7- and 1.5-folds higher incidence of early onset BC than NW and OW Black women, respectively, whereas, early onset BC did not exhibit a correlative pattern in White women. Luminal A and TNBC subtypes were the most common in women with early onset BC and Black women exhibited more than twice incidence of TNBC (32%) compared to the White women (14%) of all ages. In contrast, incidence of luminal A subtype was less prevalent in Black (57.4%) than in White (72.6%) women. Interestingly, both luminal A and TNBC subtypes were also more prevalent in Ob women; however, the risk of being diagnosed with TNBC increased dramatically in Ob Black women compared to Ob White women. Together, these findings establish obesity as a major underlying cause of early onset BC and TNBC diagnosis in Black women, which could be targeted to diminish the BC disparity gaps.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Obesity,Race,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared between ethnic groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare OS between populations. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching was performed with adjustment for age, stage, co-morbidity score, and insurance status, type of facility and great circle distance.<br \/>RESULTS: Among 132 PCGDTCL patients studied (5% HI, 92% NH), the HI group was younger at diagnosis than NH (49.5y vs. 60y) (p=0.384); The majority of HI (50%) was diagnosed between 2010-2012 vs 2017-2019 for NH (45%) (p=0.673). Most of HI and NH were white (67% vs 79%).<br \/>Private insurance was the most prevalent type in HI (67%) vs government sponsored for NH (49%). The most non-Insured group was NH (3%) vs HI (0%).<br \/>The most prevalent bracket for Census Median Income (2008-2012) was $63,000+ for both HI (50%) and NH (31%). 17% HI vs 13%.

Informal caregivers, who often serve as primary advocates for those at risk, play a pivotal role in supporting behavioral and medical decisions based on genetic testing information. Assessing caregivers&#8217; knowledge of genetic testing can guide future interventions supporting informed decision-making to ensure that all groups benefit equally from advances in genetic testing. We examined the association between caregiving and knowledge of genetic testing as well as other individual and socioeconomic factors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5 Cycle 4). HINTS is a nationally representative survey of adults in the civilian non-institutionalized US population. Exposure variable was caregiving (yes\/no) assessed with the question &#8220;Are you currently caring for or making health care decisions for someone with a medical, behavioral, disability, or other condition?&#8221;. The outcome variable was genetic testing knowledge (yes\/no) assessed with the question &#8220;have you heard of high-risk cancer genetic testing - e.g., BRCA 1\/2\". Weighted, multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between caregiving and genetic testing knowledge adjusting for age, gender, race\/ethnicity, marital status, education level, having a regular provider, rural-urban residence, and self-reported general health status.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 3,136 participants aged &#8805;18 were included in the study, of whom 16.4% were caregivers and 35.9% had heard of genetic testing.

Responses increased from 30 in January to 399 in October. Respondent mean age was 67 years [standard deviation (SD) 12.3] with 87.8% identifying as male. Roughly 13% screened positive for at least one social need (one positive 8.1%, two positive 3.4%, three positive 1.2%) with variations by domain [transportation 3.6%, food insecurity 5.4%, 10.2%] and race and ethnicity (Figure 1, p&#60;0.001 for all).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: By leveraging the existing clinical workflow, rapid uptake of social needs screening demonstrates variations by social needs domains and race and ethnicity within a urologic oncology patient population. These efforts represent institutional action towards characterizing the burdens faced by our patient population and inform the design of interventions to address social needs within the catchment area, to improve clinical care and clinical trial participation.<br \/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-13 Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate,Genitourinary cancers: bladder,Genitourinary cancers: kidney,Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Samuel  L.

However, disparities exist in those who received routine screenings and variability in clinic screening protocol. Working with community-based clinics on quality improvement as well as systematically screening all eligible patients can result in increased equity in screening and thus early detection. Be Well Communities&#8482; is MD Anderson&#8217;s place-based approach for cancer prevention and control, working with communities to promote wellness and address modifiable risk factors for cancer. The first several years of the initiative in Baytown focused on healthy eating and active living interventions for cancer prevention, over time the community&#8217;s trust and appetite increased which allowed for additional and more traditional cancer prevention interventions (e.g., human papilloma virus vaccination, screening). In this project, three evidence-based interventions for cancer screening were implemented in collaboration with Chambers Health, a local FQHC in Baytown, Texas, to work toward addressing the disparities in screening outcomes experienced by community residents. Chambers Health compliance rates have increased since the beginning of the Cancer Screening Navigation program, supported by Be Well Communities. Two full-time patient navigators are supported to facilitate increased screening through patient education, increased clinic compliance and development of standard operating procedures for navigation related operations. In addition, one full-time Outreach Coordinator is supported to engage with patients and provide education on cancer screenings. Compared to 2022, there was a 39% increase in colon cancer screening compliance rates, a 25% increase in cervical cancer screening compliance rates, and a 47% increase in breast cancer screening compliance rates. Compliance refers to any patient who is up-to-date in their cancer screenings. The Be Well Communities team supported Chambers Health through funding, technical assistance, and capacity building. They were then able to provide culturally relevant and high-quality care to enhance community capacity to address low rates of cancer screening in Baytown. Furthermore, Chambers Health has since integrated the patient navigators and Outreach Coordinator into their operational budget, a notable systems change for the organization and demonstration of commitment to the project and continued clinic quality improvement and more so dedication to the patients served.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prevention,Screening,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, Africans are underrepresented in their contribution to global science and within the African countries, access to adequate funding and infrastructure to do high quality science is limited. These inequities contribute to the 10\/90 gap in which only an estimated 10% of global health research funding is used to address health problems in Africa. Thus, it is not surprising that today, Africa contributes just about 2 percent of world research output, 1.3 percent of research spending, and 0.1 percent of all patents. To bridge the aforementioned gaps, mitigate the effect of brain drain and structural constraints and improve support for the next generation scientists, the Nigerian Government recently established the National Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (NICRAT). It is worthy to note that cancer incidence and mortality rates in Africa are increasing 1.1 million new cases, with 711,000 deaths reported in 2020. This indicate a mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) of 0.64. These cancer challenges in Africa necessitates a concerted approach towards effective cancer control and management. Here, we show in detail how the NICRAT support improving science while integrating with Nigerian national development plans and strategies. We also show how the NICRAT is establishing a mechanism for domestic funding, while fostering national and international collaborations for African scientists and encouraging women into careers in cancer research. Currently, the NICRAT&#8217;s key task also includes centralizing cancer control efforts, mobilizing funding from different sources for cancer research, and coordinating cancer treatment activities across Nigeria. In addition, the institute facilitates collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and patients, and provides guidance for cancer policy formulation and implementation. The establishment of NICRAT by Nigeria&#8217;s government as well as similar centers elsewhere in Africa may improve active participation of African scientists in scientific practice, discourse, and decision making and spotlight their intellectual contributions towards solving science-associated global problems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-25 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>U.

The reason for this disparity is multifaceted, including the barriers that they face at the individual, provider, and health system levels. To address these challenges the iCCaRE for Black Men Consortium uses a multi-level approach to disseminating CaP information. This approach is rooted in research which shows that Black men prefer to receive information through multi-media channels tailored to their needs. In addition, studies have reported that CaP survivors were viewed as credible sources of information. This presentation reports on how iCCaRE Consortium is bridging the digital divide in minoritized communities to disseminate CaP information in a way that is meaningful to the community.<br \/>Methodology: iCCaRE uses a multimedia method to reach Black men. This includes twitter post, Facebook, YouTube, ecancer and community lunch and learns. In addition to social media, we have partnered with LitTV Network, a locally owned digital TV platform, on which we have iCCaRE TV. On Lit TV network we have the ability to reach 11,000 homes in our catchment area. Furthermore, the consortium has produced informational flyers that are disseminated at outreach events and at the American Legion Post 197. On the twitter page the consortium post: (1) 2 scientific publications per day authored by members of the consortium, (2) 2 weekly &#8220;Did You Know&#8221; facts about prostate cancer with sources attached, (3) 2 weekly url post sharing a link to a video from the iCCaRE consortium YouTube page and (4) clips of CaP survivors sharing their experiences. On the YouTube page we currently have: videos series of a CaP survivor who is also a physician scientist, interview series with MPIs and members of the consortium, CaP survivor series including a barbershop interview with a survivor.<br \/>Results: The iCCaRE Consortium multimedia efforts have a global reach, in less than a year we have gained 102 twitter followers. On average the twitter page receives 8,700 impressions during the CaP awareness month in September the twitter page garnered over 14,000 impressions. Our videos on the ecancer platform have a combined global view of 341 representing countries such as the United States, Nigeria, Cameroon, United Kingdom, Macedonia, and Mexico. The American Legion Post 197 in North Jacksonville has served a cumulative of 229 people through outreach and educational event called lunch and learns. Our YouTube channel has had almost 100 views in its first month of being active.<br \/>Conclusion: Using a multi-level approach to reduce the burden of CaP for Black men is vitally important; without such efforts the disparate thread in mortality will continue to persist. Meeting Black men through the mediums they use for gathering health information removes barriers, increases access and will aid in the fight against CaP for Black Men.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Black Men,Multi media dissemination,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Meeting patients where they are and offering treatment in or closer to their homes reduce psychological distress and increase treatment compliance, especially for disadvantaged patients in rural areas, those on low incomes, with poor access to transport, elderly and people with disabilities. In 2023, Mayo Clinic has developed the Cancer Care Beyond Walls (CCBW) program, a cancer care delivery model that integrates virtual with in facility treatment and provides a package of care to support administration of cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy) and\/or supportive care in the patients&#8217; homes. Our study will assess if patients and families are comfortable with cancer therapy at home, what factors influences their decision, and use this data to inform our understanding of the proportion of the black men with advanced CaP who would be willing to receive and would benefit from this level of care at home. Patients with advanced CaP from our practice requiring active anti-cancer therapy are administered a brief questionnaire regarding preference for location of therapy at the infusion center or in the home, with perceived difficulties and advantages of each approach. A focus group session with prostate cancer survivor advocates is also conducted to capture patients&#8217; thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and questions towards cancer treatments being administered at home versus a hospital setting. In addition, we are conducting an observational study of 20 patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving supportive care\/symptom management and\/or anti-cancer therapy in the home as part of the Mayo Clinic CCBW Program to assess the safety of cancer directed therapy when administered at home by a home health provider with remote patient monitoring and command center support, and establish the impact of home cancer treatment administration on patient-reported function and global health\/quality of life, patient-reported symptoms, clinical outcomes, and cost of care. Successful completion of the project will deliver data on patient understanding and acceptability of cancer care at home, strategies for overcoming barriers to care for underserved communities, and the foundation from which we discover, translate and apply new knowledge in administering personalized care to vulnerable populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Cancer therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Administrative forms specify that White includes Middle-Eastern but SWANA persons may also self-identify as Black, Asian, and Other. With the rise of Islamophobia and increased US intervention in the Middle Eastern region, SWANA Americans face unique challenges that require a deeper understanding of their health status.One methodology to obtain cancer statistics on SWANA is using naming algorithms. Similar to SWANA, the Latine population was invisible in administrative data prior to the 1970&#8217;s.<sup> <\/sup>Grassroots efforts and advocacy from the Latine community led to the development of validated Latine surname algorithms which have been implemented by the National Cancer Institute. Similarly, SWANA activists have advocated for the creation of a federal identification category for over 50 years arguing that SWANA communities are not perceived as White due, in large part, to a long-standing history of political racism in the United States.The purpose of this study was to develop a SWANA Surname Algorithm (SSA) to inclusively identify SWANA in cancer health data. We used surnames by country of descent to leverage interpretable decision trees to effectively distinguish SWANA from non-SWANA individuals by iteratively selecting the best surname roots at which to split the data to maximize the separation of SWANA individuals from others based on their surname. We integrated these patterns into our SSA so that when presented with a new surname, the algorithm simply follows the decision patterns down to the leaf nodes, otherwise known as the predicted class (SWANA vs non-SWANA).We developed a preliminary SWANA Surname List (SSL) using publicly available naming databases by country of origin (N=71,300). We cross-referenced the SSL against the VCU Massey Cancer Center data repository and found 4.9% of all cancer patients from 2016 to 2020 matched as SWANA. Notably, the prevalence of SWANA patients has been increasing over the last few decades, 3.8% in 1991-1995, to 4.2% in 2001-2005, and then most recently 4.9% in 2016-2020. We will use our SSA to validate these findings. These preliminary findings underscore the valuable insights that naming algorithms can provide in elucidating the true demographic composition of cancer patients. Lack of racial\/ethnic disaggregation perpetuates existing inequities in access to essential health resources among SWANA communities. The inclusion of SWANA in cancer disparities research would allow researchers to better examine the cancer health status of this underrepresented but growing community while also aligning with the true racialization of SWANA in the United States.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Race,Databases,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Guleer Shahab<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Preston<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Health Behavior and Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University - VCU, Richmond, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6d5c1d8b-60da-4782-b37f-b20b036e03c8","ControlNumber":"5106","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Of those screened, 3240 (97%) tested negative, 78 (2.3%) had positive results while 24 (0.7%) had suspicious lesions.<br \/>Conclusion: Our analysis shows low uptake of cervical cancer screening services with only 28.36% of the targeted women being screened in 2022. The only available testing method (VIA) is less robust as compared to cytology and HPV testing. We also found a gap in reporting of HPV testing in the county. We thus recommend implementation science research examining the systemic barriers to HPV testing and reporting to better inform best practice HPV-related cancer prevention and control policy and practice to reduce cancer-related morbidity and mortality among WLHIV.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Mortality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Studies report that the incidence of, and mortality from HCC vary significantly by age, sex, and race\/ethnicity; however, disparities in the expression level of tumor biomarkers, liver functions, lipid profiles, and comorbidities have not been thoroughly investigated among subpopulations of patient with HCC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A retrospective study was conducted to review 247 serial HCC cases enrolled in the University of Mississippi Medical Center during June 2000 to May 2023. The entire HCC population was stratified into subpopulations by race, gender, age and BMI. Then comparisons were performed between two corresponding subpopulations in the expression level of HCC-related biomarkers including Alpha-FP, liver functions including albumin, ALT, AST, and ALP, plasma lipid profiles including cholesterol, and comorbidity conditions including cirrhosis in benign liver tissues, smoking, alcohol using, and illness with viral hepatitis. Two-tailed Student&#8217;s T-test was used to calculate the difference in mean values, and Chi-Square Test was used to compare the difference in rates or percentages. The significant p value was set at p&#60;0.05.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In total 247 HCC cases, males were 178 (72.1%) and females were 69 (27.9%) with a male to female ratio of 2.6:1; black patients were 108 (43.7%), white patients were 127 (51.4%), and others were 4.9%. The mean age was 59.6 years and mean BMI was 27.04. AFP was the only one of detected tumor biomarkers showing disparities: it was significantly higher in patients of male (p=0.026), younger age (p&#60;0.0001), lower BMI (p=0.039), smokers (p=0.0325) and illness with viral hepatitis (p=0.0007). Disparities in liver functions included: 1) AST was significantly higher in Black HCC patients (p=0.027); 2) no statistical difference of liver functions in gender; 3) younger HCC patients had significantly lower level of Albumin<br \/>(p=0.006), and higher levels of ALT (p=0.014) and AST (p=0.0032); 4) HCC patients with lower BMI also had lower level of Albumin (p=0.015), and higher levels of AST (p=0.0480 and ALP (p=0.0057). There was no statistical difference of plasma lipid profiles between subpopulations, Black HCC patients except that Black HCC patients had significantly higher levels of cholesterol (p=0.0006) and HDL (p=0.048). In comorbidity, Black HCC patients had higher rates of alcohol using and existence of cirrhosis; and male HCC patients had higher rates of smoking, alcohol usage and viral hepatitis.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> HCC patients are greatly disparate in the expression level of tumor biomarkers, liver functions, plasma lipid profiles and comorbidity conditions between subpopulations stratified by race, gender, age and BMI.

Few studies in pediatric oncology have investigated the communication experiences of families who speak LOE, particularly for languages other than Spanish. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the experiences of parents of children with cancer who speak LOE.<br \/>Methods: Parents of children recently diagnosed with cancer who spoke LOE were enrolled concurrently in two cohorts, Spanish speaking and non-English\/non-Spanish speaking. Semi-structured interviews were conducted about parent perceptions of medical care, communication and support from the medical team within 3 months of a new cancer diagnosis and 6-12 months post-diagnosis. Inductive content analysis was performed, with iterative transcript review and memo-writing informing the development of codes.

All parents completed first interviews and 14 have completed second interviews to date. All parents described challenges with interpretation, but difficulties were reported more often by non-Spanish speakers: 67% of non-Spanish speakers encountered interpreters who spoke a different dialect (vs. 35% of Spanish speakers), 33% had interactions where no interpreter was available via any modality (vs. 0%), and 75% of their children were asked to interpret by the medical team (vs. 12%). Additionally, non-Spanish speakers lacked access to written educational materials or hospital documents in their language and they were unable to build rapport with interpreters, whereas Spanish speakers described regular access to these resources. Spanish speakers also frequently reported incorrect interpretation that was recognized by providers who understood some Spanish. This was never reported by non-Spanish speakers as no medical team members spoke their languages.<br \/>Conclusion: Nearly 40% of the United States population speaks a language other than English or Spanish at home, yet their needs are significantly underrecognized and understudied. Our findings demonstrated that challenges related to interpretation are pervasive, and non-English\/non-Spanish speakers may face greater difficulties. Overall, parents who speak LOE report receiving disparate care and deficient resources. An urgent need exists to provide equitable communication and resources, particularly for non-Spanish speakers who report significant obstacles in receipt of high-quality pediatric cancer care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Depression is experienced by 25% of cancer survivors in the US. While previous studies have examined the associations between ACEs and depression in the general population, studies on cancer survivors are lacking. We aimed to examine the predictors of depression with a primary focus on ACEs among cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: Using a cross-sectional data from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 19,241 cancer survivors aged 18 and above, we categorized ACEs based on severity. The ACE categories (zero, one, two-three, &#8805;four) included questions assessing exposure to eight types of ACEs before age 18 years. The outcome is self-reported history of depression diagnosis (yes\/no). Weighted multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds of depression by ACEs as the primary variable and covariates were age, gender, smoking status, income, education, marital status, body mass index, health status and race.<br \/>Results: In this sample of cancer survivors, 41%, 22%, 21% and 16% reported having experienced zero, one, two-three, and <u>&#62;<\/u>4 ACEs respectively. Personal history of depression was reported by 21% of survey respondents. In the adjusted model, survivors with 1 ACE (aOR: 1.6, 95% CI. 1.2- 2.0), 2-3 ACEs (aOR: 1.7, 95% CI. 1.3- 2.1), or &#62;=4 ACES (aOR: 4.4, 95% CI. 3.4- 5.7) had higher odds of depression compared with those with zero ACEs. Additional notable predictors of higher odds of depression are younger age, 18-39 (aOR: 2.7, 95% CI. 1.8- 4.0), middle age, 40-64 (aOR: 1.6, 95% CI. 1.3- 1.9) compared with those aged 65 and older; females (aOR: 2.1, 95% CI. 1.7- 2.5) compared with males; obese respondents (aOR: 1.5, 95% CI. 1.2- 1.9) compared with respondents with normal body mass index; current smokers (aOR: 1.5, 95% CI. 1.2- 2.0) compared with respondents who never smoked; and poor or fair health status (aOR: 3.2, 95% CI. 2.6- 3.9) compared with respondents with excellent\/good health status.<br \/>Conclusion: Adult cancer survivors who experience ACEs as children represent an important targeted prevention group to reduce risk of depression. Variation by age, obesity, female gender, current smoking status, and poor health associated factors that may reduce the risk of depression warrants additional studies regarding potential for identification of resilient factors; and this may inform future selective prevention strategies, as well as identify a pathway between ACE and depression among cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-05 Psycho-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Adverse Childhood Experiences,Depression,Cancer survivors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.
