[{"Abstract":"RAS is the one of the most frequently altered genes in human cancer and contributes to the growth of tumors. Recently, KRAS G12C inhibitors were approved as the first molecular targeting agents for RAS, but there are still huge unmet medical needs in RAS-mutated cancers because drugs targeting non-KRAS G12C tumors have not yet been approved and efficacy by even approved KRAS G12C inhibitors is not satisfactory. LUNA18 is the cyclic peptide that binds to RAS mutants and wildtype, including KRAS, NRAS and HRAS, thereby inhibiting protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the inactive form of RAS and GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors). LUNA18 decreased the active form of KRAS and phosphorylated ERK and AKT, and cell proliferation in RAS-mutated cancer cells with nM order of cellular IC50s irrespective of tumor types and amino acid substitutions except for Q61 mutants. On the other hand, LUNA18 did not inhibit proliferation of cells with active mutations downstream of RAS (BRAF and MEK), suggesting LUNA18 selectively inhibited growth of RAS-dependent cells. Consistent with in vitro cellular activity, oral administration of LUNA18 showed durable RAS signal inhibition up to 24-48 hours and tumor regression in RAS-mutated xenograft models. In addition to KRAS-mutated cells, LUNA18 also showed in vitro and in vivo robust efficacy in KRAS-amplified cells. These data indicated LUNA18 is the versatile compound that selectively suppressed cellular signaling from RAS G12\/G13 mutants as well as RAS wildtype amplification through inhibition of PPI between the inactive form of RAS and GEFs, and it can be applicable to a wide range of RAS-altered tumors. Rebound of the MAPK pathway is reported to be the one of the cause for attenuating efficacy of KRAS G12C inhibitors. We also observed the rebound of ERK activation 24-72 hours after the treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor in cells with the KRAS G12C mutation though suppression of KRAS activity was maintained. On the other hand, LUNA18 persistently suppressed ERK activity as well as KRAS activity up to 72 hours. The combination of the KRAS G12C inhibitor with siRNA for RAS wildtype showed durable inhibition of ERK activity, suggesting that RAS wildtype plays a key role for the rebound of ERK activity and inhibitory activity to RAS wildtype by LUNA18 contribute to the persistent inhibition of RAS signaling by LUNA18. We orally administered LUNA18 and a KRAS G12C inhibitor to a xenograft model, which showed temporal response and then acquired resistance to a KRAS G12C inhibitor, and found that LUNA18 significantly suppressed emergence of resistance to a KRAS G12C inhibitor. These results supported that the combination of the KRAS G12C inhibitor with LUNA18 could be a promising option to patients with KRAS G12C mutation by suppressing resistance to a KRAS G12C inhibitor through the suppression of rebound of the MAPK pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Molecular targets,Drug discovery,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Recently approved inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib specifically target KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, a minor mutation in pancreatic cancer. Further, patients developed acquired resistance by generating secondary KRAS mutations, posing an added obstacle for allele specific inhibitors, warranting alternative strategies to tackle KRAS-dependent cancers. KRAS forms proteolipid signaling platforms on plasma membrane (PM) termed nanoclusters. We have shown mutant KRAS nanoclusters selectively enrich phosphatidylserine (PS) lipid, being particularly receptive to unsaturated PS, suggesting lipid acyl chain metabolism is crucial for KRAS function. In cells, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases 3 (LPCAT3) preferentially catalyzes synthesis of unsaturated PS. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of LPCAT3 depletes unsaturated PS in the PM, perturbs the PS-dependent PM interactions and oncogenic functions of KRAS.<br \/>Methods: LPCAT3 knockdown (KD) mediated by siRNA in doxycycline (Dox) inducible KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> murine cells (iKRAS) and CRISPR-Cas9 in human pancreatic tumor line (MiaPaCa-2). LPCAT3 inhibition achieved using small molecule inhibitors (SMIs): HTS3 and HTS4. Shotgun lipidomics characterized re-modeling of PS lipidomes. PM distribution and nanoclustering of KRAS was evaluated by super-resolution electron microscopy (EM). Anti-tumor effect of LPCAT3 inhibition was examined<i> in vitro<\/i> by proliferation, colony formation and soft agar assays and cellular signaling by western blot.<br \/>Results: LPCAT3KD decreased polyunsaturated PS levels in MiaPaCa-2 and mislocalized mutant KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> on the PM with a 4-fold reduction in KRAS PM distribution (p&#60;0.0013) and disrupted KRAS nanoclustering, without affecting that of HRAS<sup>G12V <\/sup>in transformed MiaPaCa-2. LPCAT3KD reduced colony formation ability in MiaPaCa-2. LPCAT3 siRNA reduced KRAS-dependent MAPK signaling, and significantly reduced colony formation only upon Dox-induced expression of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, while having no effect in uninduced iKRAS. An integrated knowledgebase tool canSAR.ai generated a druggability score of 77% suggesting LPCAT3 is highly druggable by chemistry-based assessment. Indeed, recently discovered LPCAT3 inhibitors, significantly reduced MAPK signaling, proliferation and colony formation in mutant KRAS-dependent tumor cells while having no significant effect in WT KRAS cells corroborating mutant KRAS specificity of LPCAT3.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate targeting unsaturated PS lipid metabolism by inhibiting LPCAT3 disrupts KRAS signaling platform and perturbs its oncogenic functions in pancreatic cancer cells.<b> <\/b>Since various KRAS mutants require unsaturated PS to propagate signaling, our approach targets diverse KRAS mutants, uniquely addressing drug resistance issue. Further, we will optimize the LPCAT3 inhibitors and study their efficacy in xenograft mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Lipid metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Genetic alterations of Hippo pathway regulators, such as NF2 or LATS1\/2, have been shown to induce YAP\/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional activity, promoting initiation and progression of many solid tumors. In addition, many studies have shown that YAP\/TAZ-TEAD activation mediates resistance to multiple targeted therapies, particularly EGFR-KRas-MAPK pathway inhibitors. The TEAD family of transcription factors (TEAD1\/2\/3\/4) share structural similarity and have overlapping functions in tumor development and TEAD auto-palmitoylation is critical for its interaction with YAP\/TAZ and its transcriptional function. Therefore, blocking TEAD palmitoylation and allosterically disrupting YAP\/TAZ-TEAD-mediated transcriptional regulation, is emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of tumors with Hippo pathway dysregulation.<br \/>In this work, ISM6331, a novel and potent TEAD inhibitor with excellent inhibition against TEAD1\/2\/3\/4 was identified leveraging an AI generative model. ISM6331 reversibly binds to the TEAD palmitoylation site and significantly suppresses TEAD transcriptional activity. ISM6331 potently and selectively inhibited the growth of many Hippo pathway-dysregulated tumor cells and dose-dependently suppressed the expression of TEAD target genes <i>in vitro<\/i>. In NF2-deficient or LATS1\/2-mutant <i>in vivo<\/i> mesothelioma models, ISM6331 exhibited promising anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy in a dose-dependent manner from 3 to 30mg\/kg. ISM6331 also showed synergism with EGFR or KRasG12C inhibitors in inhibiting tumor cell growth and overcame drug resistance in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>models. In addition, ISM6331 showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties in multiple preclinical species and was well-tolerated in GLP-toxicity studies. In summary, ISM6331 has promising potential to treat Hippo pathway-dysregulated tumors as monotherapy as well as in combination with targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,Solid tumor,KRAS,EGFR TKI resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Q.

One such mechanism occurs in cells expressing the EML4-ALK fusion protein. This fusion, found in about 4% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a result of an inversion within chromosome 2, placing the 3&#8217; end of the <i>ALK<\/i> (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene downstream of the 5&#8217; end of the <i>EML4<\/i> (echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4) gene. The resulting fusion protein contains the oligomerization domain and additional disordered sequence elements of EML4 upstream of a functional ALK kinase domain. EML4-ALK is a critical driver for these tumors, promoting aberrant ALK-dependent oncogenic signaling. While tumors harboring the EML4-ALK fusion initially respond to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resistance remains a significant clinical challenge requiring new therapeutic approaches. Recently, it has come to be understood that rather than responding through extracellular proliferative cues, the EML4-ALK fusion protein elicits constitutive ALK signaling through the formation of cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates. These condensates are the result of phase separation and have been shown to be causal for disease phenotypes in cell and animal models driven by EML4-ALK, establishing condensate modulation as a novel means by which to treat TKI-resistant tumors. Here, we have developed a novel proprietary microfluidics-based high throughput screening platform (termed PhaseScan<sup>TM<\/sup>) to identify small-molecule modulators of EML4-ALK condensates. Using this technology, we identified compounds that disrupt EML4-ALK condensates <i>in vitro<\/i> and in cells through a novel mechanism, distinct from that of known ALK TKIs, providing utility in both TKI-resistant as well as TKI-na&#239;ve tumors. Further profiling of the mechanism of action (MoA) revealed specific modification within the disordered region of EML4, disruption of EML4 oligomerization, and defective ALK signaling in cancer cells. Thus, our PhaseScan<sup>TM<\/sup> methodology enabled the identification of novel, functionally active chemical matter that would have otherwise been challenging to identify utilizing any conventional hit identification methodology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Drug resistance,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Currently approved BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) are selective for BRAF V600X mutant proteins and are typically used in combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in melanoma and NSCLC, or anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab in CRC. However, their activity is limited by primary or acquired resistance often mediated by RAF dimer-inducing mechanisms. Furthermore, progression of BRAF V600X melanoma after BRAFi\/MEKi treatment frequently involves brain metastasis, and currently approved BRAFi have relatively poor brain penetration. CFT1946 is a potent, orally bioavailable, cereblon-based BiDAC<sup>TM<\/sup> degrader that selectively degrades BRAF V600X mutant protein and is currently under investigation in a Phase I clinical trial. CFT1946 has the potential to overcome limitations of clinically approved BRAFi, as degradation of BRAF V600X should abrogate RAF dimer-driven resistance and paradoxical activation. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that CFT1946 is efficacious in an A375 BRAF V600E\/NRAS Q61K xenograft model of BRAFi resistant melanoma. Here we substantially expand our preclinical characterization of CFT1946 across multiple models of BRAF V600X-driven cancers including BRAF V600X-driven CRC and NSCLC, additional BRAFi-resistant melanoma models, and a brain metastatic melanoma model. Single agent CFT1946 outperformed the SOC encorafenib + cetuximab combination in a panel of BRAF-V600X CRC xenograft models. Pathway analysis in BRAF V600X CRC models revealed that CFT1946 suppresses EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway reactivation, a mechanism known to diminish the impact of approved BRAF inhibitors in this indication. CFT1946 also demonstrated regression in a BRAF-V600X NSCLC PDX model where the SOC dabrafenib + trametinib showed only modest tumor growth inhibition. Consistent with our previous results in the A375 melanoma model, single agent CFT1946 showed superior activity versus the SOC dabrafenib + trametinib combination in all additional melanoma models tested, with complete regression achieved using a CFT1946 + trametinib combination in a PDX model bearing a BRAF-V600E kinase duplication that showed minimal response to dabrafenib + trametinib. Finally, using an A375 intracranial model, treatment with CFT1946 gave robust, dose dependent efficacy and survival advantage over encorafenib. The promising activity of CFT1946 in a broad range of BRAF V600X preclinical models supports its ongoing clinical investigation in BRAF V600 mutant solid tumors (NCT05668585).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Brain metastasis,Resistance,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The major effectors of the Hippo pathway are the TEAD transcription factors, which are deregulated in several cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VT03989, a highly potent TEAD inhibitor, in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM.<br \/>Methods: Mice with intracranial PDX GBM tumors were randomized into two cohorts to receive 10 mg\/kg (oral) VT03989 or placebo for 4 days. VT03989 levels in plasma, tumor, and contralateral brain tissue were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) at 2, 6, and 12 hours after the last treatment of VT03989. Unbound fractions were determined by equilibrium dialysis. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess levels of TEAD target genes, CTGF and CYR61. Immunohistochemistry of Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) was performed.<br \/>Results: The median unbound concentrations of VT3989 were 27 nM in plasma and 26 nmol\/kg in the tumor. The median brain-to-plasma and tumor-to-plasma partition coefficients of unbound VT03989 were 0.65 and 0.99, respectively - indicating favorable brain and tumor penetration ability of VT03989.

Several studies have shown that reactivation of MAPK signaling is the main basis to compromise the efficacy. Thus, co-inhibition of ERK, the terminal master kinase of MAPK pathway, and the upstream targets may effectively shut down the MAPK signaling cascade and induce deeper and more durable anti-tumor activities. Herein, we present the preclinical characterization of HMPL-295, a potent and selective ERK 1\/2 inhibitor, discovered and being currently developed in phase I clinical trial (NCT04908046) by HUTCHMED.<br \/>Methods: The inhibition on ERK 1\/2 kinase was determined using Z-LYTE&#8482; kinase assay. The selectivity of HMPL-295 was evaluated against 394 kinases (KinaseProfiler<sup>TM<\/sup>) and 86 safety-related proteins (SafetyScreen87<sup>TM<\/sup>) by Eurofins. Cellular target inhibition on phosphorylation of RSK (p-RSK) was detected by ELISA. <i>In vitro<\/i> anti-proliferation activity of HMPL-295 as a single agent was measured by CCK-8 or CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay. Colony formation assay was used to evaluate the combination effect of HMPL-295 with targeted therapy. Multiple tumor models with RAS\/RAF\/MAPK pathway activation were applied in immune-deficient mice to investigate the anti-tumor activity of HMPL-295 as a single agent or in combination with either chemotherapy or targeted therapy.<br \/>Results: HMPL-295 strongly inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 kinase activities with equal IC<sub>50<\/sub> at 4 nM. In human colon cancer cell line COLO 205 harboring <i>BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i> mutation, HMPL-295 inhibited p-RSK, a direct substrate of ERK1\/2, with an average IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 180 nM from 3 independent experiments. With the inhibition of ERK and its downstream substrates, HMPL-295 treatment induced tumor cells arresting at G0\/G1 phase via down-regulation of cyclin D1\/p-RB signaling and consequently attenuated cell growth in a panel of MAPK pathway dysregulated tumor cell lines, but barely affected the growth of normal cells. Furthermore, HMPL-295 demonstrated favorable selectivity in the kinase and safety pharmacology profiling, indicating a low off-target risk. For <i>in vivo <\/i>studies, oral administration of HMPL-295 induced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of p-RSK and resulted in dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in several tumor models harboring <i>KRAS<\/i> or <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations. Moreover, HMPL-295 significantly improved the anti-tumor activity of standard-of-care chemotherapy as well as targeted agents in <i>KRAS-<\/i> or <i>BRAF-<\/i>mutant tumor models both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion: HMPL-295 is a potent and selective ERK1\/2 inhibitor which demonstrates strong anti-tumor activity in preclinical models, supporting further clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Hence, there is an unmet need for targeted inhibition therapy and biomarkers that predict vulnerability to targeted therapies in aggressive meningioma patients. Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be dysregulated in meningioma, resulting in activation of its target TEAD as a transcriptional factor. We hypothesize that targeted inhibition of TEAD in recurrent high-grade meningioma with <i>NF2<\/i> loss will lead to increased inhibition of tumor growth. Here, we investigated the effect of VT3989, a potent TEAD inhibitor, in meningioma cell lines with <i>NF2<\/i> wild-type or <i>NF2<\/i> loss genotype<i>.<br \/><\/i> Methods: Two meningioma cell-lines: IOMM-Lee (<i>NF2 <\/i>wild-type) and MG309, a grade III meningioma patient-derived cell line with <i>NF2 <\/i>loss were treated with various doses of VT3989 and cell viability was assessed. Relative expression of direct targets of TEAD including CTGF and CYR61 was determined with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to ensure target engagement. Global transcriptomic changes were examined via RNAseq analysis on RNA isolated from MG309 cells treated with VT03989 compared to vehicle treated cells.<br \/>Results: VT3989 treatment significantly decreased viability of both IOMM-Lee and MG309 cells. Canonical downstream targets of TEAD such as CTGF, CYR61, BIRC5, BCL-2 were downregulated in VT3989 treated cells compared to control. Furthermore, VT03989 treatment resulted in downregulation in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes. Ongoing work is focused on combining VT3989 with agents targeting cell cycle and DDR pathways.<br \/>Conclusion: VT3989 treatment led to downregulation of TEAD direct targets CTGF and CYR61 and inhibited cell viability of both IOMM-Lee cell and MG309 meningioma lines.

However, the rapid development of clinical resistance to current Ras G12C inhibitors is common. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of cancer cells facilitate drug resistance but the mechanistic basis of this heterogenous response is not well understood. Here, we utilized recently developed Ras sensors to profile the environment of active Ras and to measure the activity of endogenous Ras to pair structure (Ras signalosome) to function (Ras activity), respectively, at a single-cell level. With this approach, we found that a subpopulation of KRasG12C cells treated with RasG12C-GDP inhibitors underwent oncogenic signaling and metabolic changes driven by WT Ras at the golgi and mutant Ras at mitochondria, respectively. Our Ras sensors identified Major Vault Protein (MVP) as a mediator of Ras activation at both subcellular locations by scaffolding Ras signaling pathway components and metabolite channels. We found that recently developed RasG12C-GTP inhibitors also led to MVP-mediated WT Ras signaling at the golgi, demonstrating that this a general mechanism of RasG12C inhibitor resistance. Overall, single-cell analyses enabled the discovery of a RasG12C inhibitor-resistant subpopulation driven by MVP, providing insight into the complex and heterogenous rewiring that confers drug resistance in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Single cell,Drug resistance,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

KRAS G12C inhibitors were the first FDA-approved RAS targeting agent, but their efficacy of monotherapy is limited. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway is reported to be the one of the causes for attenuating efficacy of KRAS G12C inhibitors. LUNA18 is the cyclic peptide that binds to RAS mutants and wildtype, including KRAS, NRAS and HRAS, thereby inhibiting protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the inactive form of RAS and GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors).We observed the rebound of ERK activation 24-72 hours after the treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor in cells with the KRAS G12C mutation though suppression of KRAS activity was maintained. This rebound was not suppressed by the KRAS G12C inhibitor retreatment. On the other hand, LUNA18 persistently suppressed ERK activity as well as KRAS activity up to 72 hours. LUNA18 also suppressed ERK reactivation caused by long-term treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor. The combination of the KRAS G12C inhibitor with siRNA for RAS wildtype showed durable inhibition of ERK activity, suggesting that RAS wildtype plays a key role for the rebound of ERK activity and inhibitory activity to RAS wildtype by LUNA18 contribute to the persistent inhibition of RAS signaling by LUNA18. In the experiment model that with strong RAS wildtype activation by stimulation with GFs (growth factors), the KRAS G12C inhibitor also did not suppress ERK activation. Conversely, LUNA18 suppressed it. Cell proliferation induced by GF stimulation was more strongly inhibited by LUNA18 than by the KRAS G12C inhibitors. Our data indicates that MAPK pathway reactivation via WT-RAS activation leads to resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors and that the combination of LUNA18 and KRAS G12C inhibitors has the potential to overcome this resistance mechanism. In the in vitro cell growth assay, combination of LUNA18 and the KRAS G12C inhibitor showed more potent cell growth inhibition than single agents. We orally administered LUNA18 and the KRAS G12C inhibitor to a xenograft model, which showed temporal response and then acquired resistance to the KRAS G12C inhibitor, and found that LUNA18 significantly suppressed emergence of resistance to the KRAS G12C inhibitor. These results suggest that LUNA18 could be a promising candidate for combination therapy with KRAS G12C inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Molecular targets,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The signaling scaffold protein, Daple (CCDC88C), has been found to undergo gene fusion to the receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3. Specifically, a fragment of the coiled-coil domain from Daple and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FLT3 are found fused together. How the gene product from this gene fusion functions in rewiring the signaling network in cells and whether this gene product can be targeted though pharmacological inhibitions remain unclear. Cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), activate cell signaling and genetic mutations that lead to constitutive receptor activation can promote unregulated cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Leukemia patients with hyperactive RTKs are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib and Sorafenib. Here we demonstrate how TKIs can directly block the activation of Daple-FLT3 and prevent hyperactivation of its downstream pathways. Our studies unveil a strategy to identify other compounds which may serve as an additive, or alternative, approach to treating patients with Daple gene fusion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinase inhibitors,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

AKT has been shown to be both upregulated and mutated in cancer cells allowing it to serve as a driver of cancer cell growth and progression. Inhibition of AKT activation and activity are both attractive targets for effective cancer drug discovery.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: We developed continuous, homogeneous assays for unactive AKTs. A peptide substrate, modified with a sulfonamido-oxine fluorophore (Sox), utilizes chelation-enhanced fluorescence to enable a real-time readout of AKT-driven phosphorylation. First, a subset of 30,000 Sox-containing sequences were evaluated for AKT substrate candidates, selecting for assay robustness and specificity. A physiologically relevant peptide substrate was identified and used to develop a kinetic assay to monitor AKT1 activation and activity. Unactive AKT1 was incubated with DOPS\/DOPC and PIP3, which mimics the plasma membrane, allowing the PH domain of AKT to bind, leading to a conformational change that enables full activation of AKT by PDK1 and MK2. Upon assay initiation, active AKT phosphorylates the sensor peptide, and the resulting signal is read in kinetic mode using a fluorescence intensity readout. First derivative plots for each progress curve were generated; the slope of the linear regions of each plot, representing acceleration towards a steady-state, were used to determine relative rates of activation for each AKT.<br \/>Results: We developed a novel assay for AKT activation and substrate phosphorylation utilizing AQT0076, DOPS\/DOPC, PIP3, PDK1, and MK2. With a mix of classical AKT inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors that rely on an inactive &#8220;PH-in&#8221; conformation, we demonstrated inhibition and quantified inhibitor potency of both active &#8220;PH-out&#8221; AKT activity and inactive &#8220;PH-in&#8221; AKT activation via dose-response measurements of steady-state rate and rate acceleration, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: A robust, homogeneous assay was developed to simultaneously monitor AKT activation and substrate phosphorylation kinetically over time. Through a continuous assay, we captured both steady-state rates and rate acceleration as a function of inhibitor concentration, allowing for accurate quantitation of both classes of AKT inhibitors in a single experimental format. With some inhibitors, we observed potencies that matched reported literature values, while with others we observed marked differences that may reflect a more physiological context that could translate through to higher efficacy in the clinic. This novel assay format provides a new tool that can be used in drug discovery to generate more effective next generation inhibitors of both AKT activation and subsequent substrate phosphorylation to prevent cancer cell growth and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AKT\/PKB activation,Akt,Assay development,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Therefore, initially, it had an impression that targeting mutant K-RAS could be an ideal strategy to treat PDAC. However, after decades of studies, no effective RAS inhibitors reached the clinic, indicating that RAS-oncoprotein is an undruggable target in PDAC. Thus, identifying a new target linked with K-RAS signaling was most needed. Using genetically engineered cell lines and K-RAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models (KC or KPC) with or without pancreas-specific CCN1 conditional knockout background, we identified a positive feedback circuit between CCN1 and mutant K-RAS expression. Moreover, blocking this feedback via conditional knockout of CCN1 in the pancreas significantly reduced invasive phenotypes, PDAC growth, and metastasis in the lung in KC and KPC mice. Mechanistically, we found that the K-RAS-CCN1 feedback circuit is regulated by microRNA miR-145 via a feedforward mechanism. Collectively, these studies highlight the clinical potential of targeting CCN1 in PDAC.

It is associated with abnormal activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT pathway, which is implicated in regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The present study investigated the effects of AKT loss on stem cell-like phenotype in immortalized mouse hepatocytes.<br \/>Methods: Immortalized hepatocytes were established from mice with <i>Akt1 <\/i>(<i>Akt1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>; <i>Akt1<\/i>-null) or <i>Akt2<\/i> (<i>Akt2<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>; <i>Akt2<\/i>-null) whole-body deletion.

The ability of cells to<br \/>Results: When compared to WT cells, which exhibited cuboidal epithelial-like features, <i>Akt1&#173;<\/i>-null and <i>Akt2<\/i>-null cells demonstrated elongated mesenchymal-like morphology. Loss of either isoform was associated with a significantly decreased cell growth (p&#60;0.05). <i>Akt1<\/i>-null cells migrated faster towards a chemoattractant in the transwell assay, were significantly more resistant to sorafenib, and formed a significantly higher number of spheres in the sphere formation assay (p&#60;0.01). Proteomic analysis revealed that both <i>Akt1&#173;<\/i>-null and <i>Akt2<\/i>-null cells exhibited increased expression of CSC marker CD44, along with other proteins associated with liver cancer, including PDGFRA, CDH2, MMP14, and COX2 (p&#60;0.05). Additionally, <i>Akt1<\/i>-null cells exhibited elevated levels of ANXA1 and ANXA3 (p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Loss of both AKT isoforms resulted in decreased cell proliferation and elevated expression of proteins with a previously reported role in liver cancer invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. AKT1 loss correlated with an enhanced stem cell-like phenotype, including increased migration towards a chemoattractant, higher resistance to chemotherapy, and enhanced ability to form spheres. These results contribute to the understanding of the role of AKT isoforms in regulating stemness in liver cancer and may serve as a basis for investigation into isoform specific inhibitors.

Activating KRAS mutants cause increased cell proliferation through direct binding and overactivation of effector proteins. Effector activation preference is driver mutation specific, as KRAS G12D and G12C purportedly bind both RAF and PI3K, whereas G12R has been reported to bind RAF but not PI3K. The mechanisms of effector binding of G12S action are under-investigated. Furthermore, most KRAS mutations remain clinically untreatable, as clinically approved KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) are currently limited to specifically targeting G12C. While experimental non-G12C inhibitors are being developed, resistance mechanisms to non-G12C mutations&#8212;including G12D\/R\/S\/V&#8212;remain relatively understudied.<br \/>We set out to characterize the binding efficiency of KRAS to RAF1 and the PI3K subunit p110&#945;, and to understand how isoforms differ in inhibitor resistance strategies. Our findings suggest that significant variances in KRAS mutation-specific effector binding preference exist and are cell line dependent. We performed proximity ligation based immunofluorescence assays (PLA) on an isogenic panel of human colorectal SW48 KRAS cells with G12C\/D\/R\/S\/V or wildtype. SW48 cells with G12S significantly prefer the KRAS-RAF1 mode of binding over otherwise isogenic WT cells, and G12V homologs prefer PI3K. Our findings suggest that in this model, G12R cells have no specific preference of one binding mode over the other. We hypothesize that G12 chemistry drives effector binding preference and that G12X inhibitor resistant cell cultures will demonstrate variant mechanisms of resistance in line with their preferred binding partner. Ongoing studies will further characterize understudied RAS isoform biology and evaluate the links between isoform chemistry and mechanisms of inhibitor resistance. These studies will expand our mechanistic knowledge of the interplay between G12X chemistry and adaptive resistance in human cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,PI3K,Raf,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Activation of mTOR signaling is common and is an attractive therapeutic target with mechanistically different mTOR inhibitors in clinical use. One consequence of exposure to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is an alteration of gene expression through a global increase in alternative exon inclusion (Cheng et al. 2022, doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms232012416). To examine the mechanisms underlying this effect, we utilized the TempO-Seq targeted sequencing platform to profile both the whole transcriptome and a selection of alternatively spliced RNA targets in the rapamycin sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 following exposure to 13 mTOR inhibitors, some closely related and some from distinct chemical classes. Recent publications have demonstrated that high quality dose response data can be obtained using this sequencing platform (Harrill et al. 2021, doi: 10.1093\/toxsci\/kfab009; Ramaiahgari et al. 2019, doi: 10.1093\/toxsci\/kfz065) and TempO-Seq has been widely adopted in toxicology for deriving compound-specific expression signatures to identify mechanisms of action and long-term toxicity. Treated cells were also profiled using TempO-LINC, a novel high-throughput single-cell assay based on the same platform. We observed that certain mTOR inhibitors induced both common and cell-specific differential expression as well as widespread alternative exon inclusion, as expected. Intriguingly, transcripts with the most significant changes in splicing upon treatment were those encoding members of the SR family of splicing factors, often overexpressed or amplified in breast cancers (Park, et al. 2019, doi: 10.1016\/j.celrep.2019.10.110). This is significant because SR protein expression is autoregulated by alternative inclusion of an exon containing a premature stop codon in a feedback loop leading to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and lowered protein levels. Indeed, NMD is known to be inhibited by rapamycin (Martinez-Nunez, et al. 2017, doi: 10.1093\/nar\/gkw1109), which would lead to the observed accumulation of these transcripts. Thus, monitoring a targeted selection of alternative splicing events and regulators revealed mTOR regulation of mRNA isoform abundance consistent with regulation of the NMD RNA turnover process and with overexpression of SR proteins in breast cancers. Importantly, targeted bulk and single-cell TempO-Seq assays enable efficient sequencing and simplified data analysis without the expense and bioinformatic burden of RNAseq, making them particularly well-suited for drug discovery. These results support the use of this approach for further characterization of cell-specific effects of mTOR inhibitors and their mechanisms of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Sequencing,Single cell,Splice variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

KRAS is an oncogene mutated in 90% of PDAC patients. Oncogenic KRAS leads to aberrant cell proliferation and survival. KRAS is considered hard to target because resistance mechanisms to KRAS inhibitors are common highlighting the need to understand alternative strategies. PDAC tumor microenvironment evolves with cancer cell progression leading to vascular remodeling and blood vessel collapse. This makes the tumors nutrient deplete. To circumvent this, cells employ KRAS-dependent macropinocytosis- a nutrient scavenging pathway. Macropinocytosis is the process by which cells take up extracellular material by membrane ruffling to form vesicles which then fuse with lysosomes to release nutrients. Targeting KRAS-driven macropinocytosis can be crucial to limiting nutrients to the cell to prevent tumor growth. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric Serine\/Threonine phosphatase, is a downstream regulator of KRAS. Its activity is repressed by mutated KRAS. We have seen that the activation of PP2A with small molecular activator, DT061, prevents macropinosomes from fusing with lysosomes which leads to cell death. But how DT061 regulated PP2A activity affects the macropinocytosis pathway is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanism of cell death brough upon by the activation of PP2A with DT061. Membrane ruffling is critical for the initiation of macropinocytosis. Rac is a GTPase usually involved with membrane ruffling. To show that Rac is needed for DT061 mediated macropinocytosis, we used EHT 1864, a Rac family inhibitor. Cells were treated with EHT 1864 before being treated with DT061 and stained with crystal violet. The inhibition of Rac prevented DT061 driven cell death, indicating that Rac is crucial to DT061 driven cell death. High molecular weight TMR-Dextran can only be taken up by the cells through macropinocytosis. Cells were treated with TMR-Dextran and EHT 1864. Cells with Rac inhibition showed lower uptake of TMR-Dextran than cells that were treated with DT061. Together these findings indicate to us that Rac plays a crucial role in the initiation of macropinocytosis and the regulation of cell death caused by the activation of PP2A. Understanding the pathway of DT061 mediated cell death can be vital to developing this concept as a therapeutic method of treatment for PDAC patients who currently have the lowest 5-year survival rate (12%) of all cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Pancreatic cancer,Phosphorylation,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Current treatment options are limited to radiation therapy, surgical resection, and chemotherapy, which are extremely invasive. This underscores the need for more targeted and effective therapeutic treatments to improve patient outcomes. The following study will focus on exploring the PKC-&#953; specific inhibitor 5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA-1S) and its effects on medulloblastoma cell lines Daoy and ONS-76. Our <i>in-vitro<\/i> treatments showed that PKC-&#953; functions an oncogenic protein that is necessary for Daoy and ONS-76 cell proliferation and that ICA-1S was found to be cytostatic to both Daoy and ONS-76 cells. The inhibition of PKC-&#953; in both cell lines resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of PKC-&#953; as well as downregulation of 14-3-3 and crucial components of the c-Raf\/Erk pathway including total and phosphorylated levels of c-Raf, Mek1\/2, and Erk1\/2. This comes as a result of ICA-1S blocking the association of PKC-&#953; with 14-3-3 while PKC-&#953; and c-Raf were not found to directly associate with each other, indicating indirect modulation of c-Raf by PKC-&#953;. Additionally, PKC-&#953; inhibition decreased its association with Stat3. Expression levels of Stat1, Stat3, c-Fos, and c-Myc transcription factors were significantly downregulated, which is likely the result of reduced transcriptional activation due to upstream inhibition of PKC-&#953; and Erk signaling. Treatment with ICA-1S was also shown to substantially decrease cellular invasion of Daoy and ONS-76 cells and induce apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that PKC-&#953; likely plays a critical role in the regulation of the c-Raf\/Erk pathway, which controls the proliferation and invasion of human medulloblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,ERK,Protein kinase C,Raf,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Activating mutations of oncogenic RAS pathway genes are frequently detected in human cancers. The role of KRAS in tumor formation is not questionable. It&#8217;s implication in tumor maintenance is less well validated. The KRAS dependency is a key question to answer before to develop KRAS inhibitor. Targeted genome editing using CRISPR\/Cas9 is a relatively new, revolutionary technology allowing for efficient and directed alterations of the genome. CRISPR is a genome-editing platform that makes use of the bacterially-derived endonuclease Cas9 to introduce DNA double-strand breaks at precise locations in the genome using complementary guide RNAs. These double strand breaks can be repaired by homologous recombination DNA repair mechanisms thank to a donor DNA template. By this way mutations can be introduced at desired loci, DNA fragment can be deleted or introduce at the desired location. We aimed at investigating the KRAS dependence and we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to engineer isogenic cancer cells harboring a &#8220;conditional KRAS gene knockout\" by exchanging the KRAS endogenous promoter.

The Ras family of signal transducing proteins are involved in the activation of several proliferative pathways and therefore are found to be oncogenically mutated in a variety of cancer types. The NRAS-directed pathways resulting in Erk1\/2 activation are dysregulated in a significant percentage of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), metastatic melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancers. The consequence of oncogenic NRAS signaling is the establishment of a transcriptome commanding constitutive proliferation and survival. It has long been known that phorbol ester treatment of AML cell lines, resulting in activation of protein kinase C (PKC), causes phenotypic changes that include cell cycle arrest, myeloid differentiation, and apoptosis. The paradox is that numerous studies identify PKC as an activator of RAS\/ERK signaling. Here we show that phorbol ester treatment of NRAS-driven AML cell lines results in the transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding negative regulators of RAS signaling including <i>DUSP1,2,4,5,6, SPRY2, SPRED1, RASA1, PEA15, RPS6KA1, <\/i>and <i>RASSF5.<\/i> Additionally, phorbol ester treatment eventually results to ERK1\/2 inactivation through dephosphorylation. Several of these negative regulators, when overexpressed in AML cell lines, dampen proliferation, and induce senescence. We propose that the induction of RAS negative regulators alters the AML transcriptome to a non-proliferative state in part through the transcriptional regulation of genes such as <i>CDKN1A, CDKN2B, ZFP36L1,<\/i> and<i> MYC.<\/i> As gene therapy strategies develop, designed to provide negative regulators of proliferative signaling pathways that are repressed in the malignant cell, we imagine the RAS\/ERK pathway as a target for transcriptome reprogramming.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Ras,ERK,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Therefore, ongoing efforts to identify alterations contributing to the transformation, progression, and metastasis of MPNST are essential for pinpointing targetable oncogenic signaling pathways for this cancer. Previous studies have revealed an increase in YAP\/TAZ activity through both LATS1\/2-dependent and LATS1\/2-independent mechanisms, suggesting that YAP\/TAZ hyperactivity may act as a convergence point for MPNST pathogenesis. YES and SRC, two members of the SRC-family kinases (SFKs), were shown to phosphorylate LATS1\/2 and YAP\/TAZ, and stimulate the transcriptional activity of YAP\/TAZ by promoting their nuclear accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer cells.

Given this rich target complexity, &#62;30% of all drug development is focused on kinases. However, these target only 15% of the human kinome and are primarily just one type (ATP-competitive) that can readily result in off-target inhibition and the development of resistance during cancer treatment. Most kinase inhibitor development is carried out <i>in vitro<\/i> assays with an epitope-tagged recombinant kinase. As a result, efficacy in patients can be limited due to poor inhibitor performance under physiological conditions (e.g., mM ATP and kinases being complexed with other proteins). In contrast, i<i>n vitro<\/i> assays using unfractionated cell lysates provide a close approximation of the native kinase environment, including the complexity of interactions with other cellular components. Being able to selectively quantify the enzymatic activity of all protein kinases in crude cell or tissue homogenates would enable an improved understanding of kinase signaling biology, drug development, and personalized medicine. However, despite the large amount of literature on kinase assays, only a fraction is compatible with unfractionated lysates since most peptide substrates are not selective for a given kinase. To that end, we utilized a continuous assay format coupled with high-throughput Sox-sensor-peptide library synthesis using physiological sequences to identify selective sensor peptide substrates for multiple high-profile kinases implicated in cancer. As an example, we identified a highly selective sensor peptide for ERK1 and 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) involved in pro-growth\/oncogenic signaling. We demonstrated selectivity initially with the recombinant enzymes for ERK1\/2 and a panel of other related MAPKs or CMGC kinases. Next, we extended the selectivity screen to 392 kinases using a large panel kinome profiling service. The screen also demonstrated high selectivity for ERK1\/2 isoforms. We then tested our best sensor peptide substrate for ERK1\/2 using unfractionated lysates from the HEK293T cell line with ERK2 overexpression and demonstrated high activity that could be increased 50-fold by the addition of recombinant MEK1 or 2, the upstream kinase that activates ERK1 and 2, and completely blocked with the addition of an ERK2-selective inhibitor. These results demonstrate a method to systematically generate a selective sensor peptide for ERK1\/2 to continuously monitor this kinase activity in crude cell or tissue lysates. This poster will fully describe the methods and results pertaining to ERK-selective sensor peptide development and validation, and the ability to extend to other kinases of interest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Drug-discovery screen,Kinases,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

However, its role in protein function still needs to be elucidated. Numerous proteins initially characterized the PAN domain, including a well-known master regulator for cancer cell proliferation, HGF (Hepatocyte growth factor). Abnormal regulation of HGF-mediated signaling results in multiple deadly cancers. The binding of HGF to its cell surface receptor, c-MET, triggers signaling pathways, which leads to cancer. Here, we show that mutating four core cysteine residues in the HGF PAN domain reduces c-MET interaction, subsequent c-MET autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of its downstream targets, perinuclear localization, cellular internalization of HGF and its receptor, c-MET, and c-MET ubiquitination. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of HGF\/c-MET signaling-related genes involved in cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and cell survival was impaired. Thus, targeting the PAN domain of HGF may represent a mechanism for selectively regulating the binding and activation of the c-MET pathway. Additionally, we found this domain in the tumor suppressor gene, MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1), and mutating the domain altered the protein function through protein stability and ubiquitination. In another study, we show that cysteine residues in the vestigial plasminogen-apple-nematode (PAN) domain of NRP1 are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein internalization. Mutating novel cysteine residues in the PAN altered NRP1 stability and downstream activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, impairing its interaction with the spike protein. These results show the diverse critical role of the PAN domain beyond cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Hepatocyte growth factor,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

In the United States, PCa is the second leading cause of mortality among cancers that affect men. Treatment of advanced PCa aims to suppress androgen signaling and proliferation in cancer cells using anti-androgens and chemotherapy. However, the development of drug resistance is a major limitation to curing advanced prostate cancer and strategies to block mechanisms of therapy resistance would enhance treatment efficacy and potentially improve patient prognosis. Cdc42 and Rac1, members of the family of Rho GTPases, have been associated with the progression of different types of hormone-associated cancer, such as breast, ovary, and prostate, among others. The current study was designed to evaluate the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in chemoresistant prostate cancer cells, including under castration-resistant and androgen-independent conditions. We did not observe significant differences in active (Rac-GTP) or total Rac1 levels in chemoresistant compared to parental PC3 or DU145 cells; similar findings were observed for Ccd42. Treatment of drug-na&#239;ve cells with a sublethal dose of docetaxel (10uM) induced gradual increases in Rac1-GTP up to 30 minutes in 22rv1, 60 minutes in LNCaP and DU145, and 24 hours in PC3 cells. Cdc42-GTP levels also increased with subacute docetaxel treatment up to 24 hours in 22rv1 and DU145. Chemoresistant 22rv1, PC3, and DU145 exhibited similar sensitivity to Rac1 and Ccd42 inhibitors including MB1-167, MBQ-168, EHop-097, with an IC50 of about 1uM for each compound and line. Ongoing studies are evaluating the role of these Rho-GTPases in 3-dimensional growth and survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Chemoresistance,Cdc42,Rac1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Patients with Daple-PDGFRB gene fusion are responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting that the kinase domain on the receptor is active. How the Daple-PDGFRB gene fusion is activated and affects leukemia cells is poorly understood. It is hypothesized that the PDGFRB kinase domains found in gene fusion remain constitutively active, leading to hyperactivation of cell-signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). To test this, identified Daple-PDGFRB mutants found in patients were ectopically expressed in cells and kinase activation were determined using a phospho-specific antibody. We demonstrated that indeed, the kinase domain on the gene fusion were active, and partake in rampant cell signaling. Because drug resistance is common in cancers such as leukemia, the implications from this work may uncover additional methods of therapeutic interventions for patients harboring these types of mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Kinases,Cell signaling,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

A major goal of PCa research has been to broadly identify molecular and cellular mechanisms that aid this progression to identify potential therapeutic targets. Using a combination of human data and unique animal models, we found that the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA2 is overexpressed specifically in castration resistant and advancing prostate cancers. Furthermore we show that in metastatic PCa the receptor undergoes ligand-independent oncogenic signaling mediated by phosphorylation of EphA2 at S897. Together our data indicate a potential mechanism in PCa progression in which EphA2 becomes overexpressed and aids acquisition of castration resistance via acting as a driver of cell migration, invasion, and proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Genetic mutations leading to hyperactivation of RTKs are often seen in cancer and allow signaling pathways to be constitutively active. In some hematological malignanices, the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of Daple, a cell signaling scaffold protein, has been found in gene fusions with the RTKs FLT3 and PDGFRB, and to the intracellular kinase JAK2. It is hypothesized that this gene fusion product causes the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 to become activated and mislocalizes in the cell, leading to rampant cell signaling of either the MAPK, AKT, and STAT5 signal transduction cascades. Using fluorescently tagged Daple-FLT3, it was shown that the gene fusion product is subcellularly localizes to the peri-centrosome space across all leukemia cell lines tested. Ectopic expression demonstrated activation of the kinase domain and subsequent increases in phosphorylation of STAT5&#945; and AKT, but no significant increase in the phosphorylation of MAPK was observed. Further investigation is needed to identify direct substrates of the Daple-FLT3 gene fusion and transcriptional changes.
