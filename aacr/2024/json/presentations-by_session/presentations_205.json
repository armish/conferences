[{"Abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Most CRCs arise from polyps in the colon\/rectum that acquire gene mutations, including frequent activation of the oncogene Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) observed in 40% of cases, particularly at codons 12, 13, and 61. KRAS oligomerization is critical for MAPK pathway signaling, which drives CRC pathogenesis. This study evaluated compounds that bind mutant KRAS G13D to induce non-physiological dimerization. Screening of a 4.1 billion compound DNA-encoded library led to the identification of pyridinylpiperazine\/quinoline compounds. These compounds demonstrated the ability to induce RAS dimer formation, subsequently reducing MAPK signaling, exhibiting similarities to BI-2852, which is known to induce formation of non-physiologic RAS dimers. Structure-activity studies yielded indole, piperidine, and morpholine variants showing improved activity in thermal shift assays (DSF) and in cell-based assays evaluating RAS signaling (p-ERK inhibition).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,KRAS,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

There is therefore a crucial need to identify biomarkers and new targets for therapy. In 90% of CRC, the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway is constitutively activated due to mutations of <i>&#946;-catenin<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i> (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) or <i>axin-1<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>. These alterations cause an accumulation of &#946;-catenin and lead to an over-transcription of target genes involved in tumorigenesis<sup>3-4<\/sup>. Studies of our team pointed out an overexpression of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase 7 (PTK7) in CRC, an event associated with metastatic development, reduced metastases-free survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. In CRC cells, the pseudokinase PTK7 has pro-metastatic and pro-migratory functions, and thus appears to be a promising new therapeutic target<sup>5-6<\/sup>. The role of PTK7 in the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway has been demonstrated in several studies<sup>7-8<\/sup>. Our group identified &#946;-catenin as a partner of PTK7. We selected a first series of small molecules inhibitors targeting PTK7\/&#946;-catenin interaction<sup>9<\/sup>. This strategy could represent, in the future, a new therapeutic strategy to inhibit CRC cell growth dependent on the Wnt signaling pathway. However, the compounds identified had weak activity, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of around 10-25 mM. We have set up a new method with SYNSIGHT to select more potent chemical inhibitors targeting PTK7\/&#946;-catenin in CRC in order to counteract the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway deregulation.

Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is required for the methionine salvage pathway, deletion of MTAP leads to the accumulation of inhibitory PRMT5 cofactor methylthioadenosine (MTA). MTAP gene is adjacent to and frequently co-deleted with CDKN2A gene, the most commonly deleted tumor suppressor gene in human cancers. The increase in MTA significantly reduced PRMT5 activity in MTAP-deficient cancer cells, rendering them more vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibition than normal cells. Selective Inhibitors of PRMT5-MTA complex (MTA-cooperative) are supposed to exhibit an increased therapeutic index compared to first generation PRMT5 inhibitors for the treatment of MTAP-deleted (MTAP-del) cancer patients. Guided by computation-aided drug design (CADD), binding mode analysis of known PRMT5 inhibitors has led to the design and synthesis of a novel series of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. Many compounds within this series were found to inhibit PRMT5\/MEP50 complex with single digit nM of IC<sub>50<\/sub> in enzymatic assay. Cell based activity of these compounds was assessed by measuring the symmetric demethylarginine (SDMA) and 10-day cell proliferation assays. Several compounds exhibited low double-digit nM of cellular potency in HCT116 MTAP-del cells, the inhibition of SDMA and anti-proliferation activities in HCT116 MTAP-del cells over HCT116 MTAP-WT cells have excellent selectivity (80 - 400 fold). Further optimization of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetic properties has yielded candidate compounds suitable for evaluation of pharmacodynamic effect in the LU99 MTAP-del NSCLC xenograft model. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by a reduction of PRMT5-mediated SDMA levels in both the tumor and bone marrow. In summary, we have identified compounds with novel scaffolds that are potent and highly selective MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. Further development of the second-generation PRMT5 inhibitors for treatment of cancers is also planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inhibitors,PRMT5,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.-L.

Combining AXL and MER inhibitors could generate a synergistic effect, enhancing antitumor responses, and further suppressing resistance formed by monotherapy with AXL selective or MER selective inhibitors. According to the explicit function of AXL and MER, the development of dual AXL and MER inhibitors may provide tremendous advantages to cancer patients. Drawing on our experience in the discovery of an anti-EGFR and anti-HER2 clinical candidate, we introduced several AXL-active and MER-active pharmacophores into DBPR112. Furthermore, we modified the scaffold and the solubilizing groups to improve the drug-like properties. Our comprehensive structure-activity relationship study led to the discovery of several potent dual AXL and MER inhibitors. Among approximately 200 synthesized compounds, BPR5K230 demonstrated strong inhibitory activities against AXL and MER, along with favorable oral bioavailability (F% = 55%) and promising <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor effects in various mouse xenograft models, including MDA-MB-231, 4T1, and MC-38 tumor models. BPR5K230 effectively addressed sorafenib resistance in the Hepa 1-6 model and exhibited significant synergistic antitumor effects when combined with an anti-PD-L1 antibody in the EMT-6 model. As a result, BPR5K230 represents a promising dual AXL\/MER kinase inhibitor, and further preclinical evaluation is underway for its development as a potential anticancer and immune-modulating drug.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Kinase inhibitors,Targeted therapy,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-P.

However, reported TNKS inhibitors have serious limitations in that they cause intestinal toxicity. To address these issues and enhance efficacy, we synthesized 60 compounds based on the tetrahydrophthalazine scaffold using protein structure modeling-Al technology. Using an in vitro TNKS1 and TNKS2 enzyme assay and derivatizing Hit compounds, we confirmed that TI-61987 significantly inhibits TNKS enzyme activity at low nanomolar levels.

The succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme plays a critical metabolic role as an intermediate between the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain associated with the cancer disease state. Although several existing compounds have been applied to target metabolic diseases in vitro, modulating SDH for lung cancer treatment is still elusive. By integrating the AtomNet&#174; technology for compound identification with mitochondria- and cell-based enzyme activity assays, we identified four new small molecules from 96 predicted candidates. Cellular thermal shift assay confirmed that these small molecules bind directly to SDH subunits in lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, treatment with these small molecules increased cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, accumulated succinate, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Functionally, these small molecules reduced the growth, migration, and formation of 3D organoids in vitro in lung cancer cell lines, both in the short and long term. Our study sheds light on the function of SDH in metabolic dysfunction related to cancer and highlights the potential of modulating SDH as a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting lung cancer and other cancer types.

Among them, novel ADCs containing synthetic camptothecin-based payloads specially optimized for ADC applications (e.g., DXd) are of special interest due to their successful clinical results. Despite the remarkable success of ADCs exploiting these payloads, such as Enhertu (DS-8201a), there are still clear unmet needs, including the improvement of safety profile (minimization of ILD and neutropenia) and the development of novel ADCs with multiple MoA payloads to combat cancer heterogeneity.<br \/>To address these unmet needs, we have synthesized and evaluated a series of PBX-7 payloads, derived from novel camptothecin FL118, a potent, dual inhibitor of Top 1\/anti-apoptotic pathway known for its favorable safety profile. These compounds showed strong <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity across various cancer cell lines and inhibition of Top 1 comparable to DXd or other related camptothecin compounds. They had excellent safety profile in the preliminary toxicity study in mice that can be attributed to their physicochemical properties.<br \/>PBX-7 series payloads based ADC exhibited superior cellular cytotoxicity and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor regression compared to Enhertu in Her2-positive cell line and CDX mouse model. Notably, PBX-7 based ADC demonstrated remarkable efficacy in reducing tumor volume more than Enhertu in the T-DM1-resistant JIMT-1 xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, PBX-7 based ADC have bystander effects similar to Enhertu, leading to reduced viability of antigen-negative cells when co-cultured with antigen-positive cell lines. In NHP toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, no sign of toxicity was observed when dosed with Trastuzumab-PBX-7016 up to 30mg\/kg.<br \/>As another way of addressing unmet needs, we synthesized novel linker including tandem cleavage site to reduce payload mediated toxicity. Two distinct enzyme, beta-glucuronidase and cathepsin B cleave linker sequentially. This linker system has a higher stability during circulation in the body and higher specific payload release in the tumor tissue than single cleavable linker.<br \/>In conclusion, our research shows the promising potential of novel camptothecin PBX-7 based ADCs and tandem cleavable linker system as potent and safe ADC candidates for cancer therapy. These advancements hold great promise in addressing the current challenges in ADC development with their enhanced safety profiles and targeted efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bystander effect,In vitro,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

We used high-throughput virtual screening to identify inhibitors of PKMYT1 with high lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE), which were rapidly optimized to potent leads with exceptional selectivity over a key off target, WEE1. Machine learning-driven optimization rapidly reduced mouse hepatocyte clearance to acceptable levels, delivering a compound with best-in-class potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profiles in relevant animal models. Tool compounds from this series were used to validate a differentiated biomarker for sensitivity to PKMYT1 inhibition in cellular models, which could significantly expand the potential patient population.

Consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery results in a combinatorial attack on numerous oncogenic pathways. More than 20 small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which bind the Hsp90 N-terminus and exhibit pan-inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms (Hsp90a, Hsp90&#946;, Grp94 and TRAP-1). Most of these clinical trials have failed as pan-Inhibition of Hsp90 appears to be detrimental with toxicities reported alongside induction of the pro-survival heat shock response, which leads to additional dosing challenges\/toxicities. The cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms Hsp90a and Hsp90&#946; are the major contributors to cancer growth\/survival. It has been established that inhibition of Hsp90a is associated with cardiac toxicity, retinal toxicity, and induction of the heat shock response. Therefore, the development of Hsp90&#946; -selective inhibitors represents an alternative approach for the treatment of cancer with limited side effects. Towards this goal, Hsp90&#946;-selective inhibitors that exhibit &#62;150-fold selectivity over Hsp90a have been developed, which exhibit efficacy against select cancers while overcoming the safety challenges associated with previous Hsp90 inhibitors. The results from such studies will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heat shock proteins,Cardiotoxicity,Cancer therapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The protein exerts its function by utilizing its cold shock domain and zinc knuckle domain (ZKD) to engage with the Let-7 pre-microRNA and impede the process of Let-7 production. The implementation of chemical agents to hinder the interaction between Lin28 and Let-7 has been proven as a therapeutic approach for treating aggressive tumors.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Computer-aided drug design techniques were employed in the development of a novel series of small molecule inhibitors, which are derivatives of our previously identified lead compounds Ln115, Ln15, and Ln7. Fluorescent Polarization Assay (FP), and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) were used to screen the chemicals as Lin28-Let7 interaction disruptors using Lin28A\/B ZKD domain. To further screen the chemicals, the Incucyte cell proliferation assay was performed using two Lin28A and Lin28B positive cells, IGROV-1, and DuNE cells, respectively. The inhibition of Lin28 activity was subsequently evaluated by measuring Let-7 micro-RNA and Lin28 protein levels using RT-PCR and Western Blot. Then, the metabolism profile was explored using Microsomal Stability Assay. Incucyte proliferation assay and MTS assay determined the IC50 of lead compound in Lin28 positive cells. The anti-stemness properties of the lead compound were subsequently evaluated through assays for stem gene expression levels and colony formation. To evaluate the potential of the lead compound to further move into animal studies, we tested it on a newly developed 3D Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) model.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> In this study, we provide a novel set of derivatives, within which, Ln268 was chosen as the lead compound. Ln268 shows higher metabolic stability with a half-life time of 462 min and clearance rate of 5 ul\/min\/mg, compared to its father compound at 347 min and 46 ul\/min\/mg, respectively. Ln268 treatment resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of cell growth with an IC50 of 2.5 uM at 72 hrs. Ln268 reduces mRNA levels of stemness and neurodifferentiation markers such as CHGA, CHG, SYP, SCGN, OCT3\/4, NANOG, ID4, FOXC1, ALDH1A2, and FOXO3. In the 3D NEPC model, Ln268 suppresses spheroid growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ln268 achieved 100% spheroid growth inhibition at the concentration of 100 uM, while the current commercially available C1632 only reached 50%.<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> We discovered a novel Ln15 derivative named Ln268, which has a better metabolism profile and increased inhibitory activity to distrust Lin28-Let7 interaction and cancer cell proliferation. Ln268 has the potential to be improved and used as an anti-cancer treatment for a variety of malignancies, such as prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Lin28 inhibitor,Cancer stem cell,Let-7,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

We have optimized LCI133&#8217;s chemical properties to increase PI3K p110&#945; potency to better target epithelial-derived cancers, resulting in nanomolar potent LCI139. We characterized LCI139&#8217;s in vitro potency, target specificity, activity in in vitro EC models, safety against normal cell lines.<br \/>Methods: LCI139&#8217;s chemical structure was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Specific target inhibition was assessed by cell-free kinase hotspot\/lipid kinase assay and selectivity profile. LCI139 (0.001-10&#956;M) was screened against EC cell lines AN3CA, RL95-2, Ishikawa, KLE, HEC-1-A and -B for 48 hours; IC50 values determined by CellTiter-Glo Assay. EC cells were treated with LCI139 or single agent control for 24 hours and stained with Annexin V\/7-AAD to assess apoptosis by cytometer. Representative PTEN wildtype (HEC-1) and mutant (AN3CA) EC cell lines were chosen for mechanistic studies and treated 6 to 24 hours with multitarget or single agent inhibitor. RNA was isolated to determine gene expression by qRT-PCR, cells were stained with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet to determine cell cycle arrest by cytometer, or cellular lysates were prepared for Western blot (WB).<br \/>Results: LCI139&#8217;s has a molecular weight of 502.57Da and is a highly potent PI3K&#945;-CDK4\/6-CDK9 inhibitor by cell-free kinase assays: 0.070&#181;M (PI3K&#945;), 0.461&#181;M (PI3K&#947;), 0.214&#181;M (PI3K&#948;), 0.0015&#181;M (CDK4), 0.0036&#181;M (CDK6), 0.000039&#181;M (CDK9). KINOMEscan revealed a favorable S(35) selectivity score of 0.221 screened against 403 non-mutant kinases. PTEN mutant AN3CA (IC50 243.6nM), RL95-2 (IC50 22.8nM), Ishikawa (IC50 9.8nM) had nanomolar LCI139 IC50 values, while PTEN-wild type cell lines were insensitive up to 10&#956;M; confirmed by dose-dependent apoptosis and colony-forming assays. WB revealed LCI139 treatment ablated MCL-1 expression, decreased phosphorylation of AKT, Rb, Rpb1 (Ser2), induced significant amounts of cPARP. MCL-1 ablation correlated to decreased Mcl1 expression (p&#60;0.0010) assessed 6 hours post treatment. LCI139 generated heterogenous cell line specific effects on cell cycle progression and arrest. LCI139 displayed a favorable toxicity profile against normal human kidney cells (HEK-293) compared to single agent controls.<br \/>Conclusions: Triple PI3K-CDK4\/6-CDK9 inhibitor, LCI139, is nanomolar potent against PTEN mutant EC cell lines and displays decreased toxicity compared with CDK9 inhibitor reference compounds, AZD4573 and flavopiridol. Our results merit further mechanistic dissection of PTEN interaction with PI3K pathway signaling, cell cycle machinery, CDK9-mediated transcriptional control. These data support extensive in vivo potency, toxicity, PK\/PD studies to assess LCI139&#8217;s clinical utility in treating EC.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,PTEN,Drug design,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

We completed a detailed analysis of the nuclear morphometric variables of 57 cancer cell lines from this drug-discovery panel using recently developed computerized method that allows simultaneously assess 42 variables related to morphology\/texture of the cell nuclei. The goal of this study was to determine whether unique nuclear patterns seen in cancer cells can effectively predict response to anti-cancer therapies. Stained sections prepared from paraffin cell blocks were used to measure each cell nucleus by size (e.g. area, perimeters); by shape (e.g. area box, fractal dimensions, roundness); and by optical density of the pixels and texture (e.g. margination, heterogeneity). The obtained values were then summarized at the cell line level, generating a dataset comprising 84 variables, represented by mean values and coefficients of variation. We filtered the complete set of chemical compounds, tested on the NCI-60 panel, based on sufficient GI50 variability, narrowing the list down to 4,839 compounds. These compounds were further refined using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method at 1% FDR, based on the p-values from &#8220;goodness of fit&#8221; tests. This process identified 1,314 compounds where the inclusion of morphometric variables significantly improved the fit of our models. To determine which variables were highly predictive for GI50 in each compound, we performed lasso regression per compound of logged GI50 versus dummied tissue of origin and morphometric variables. We tabulated the proportion of compound models selecting each variable as well as the median relative strength for each variable. This procedure identified 10 promising compound models, in which the top 5 values of relative strength from each of the tested variables emerged. Our primary objective in this analysis was to find associations between certain nuclear morphometric parameters of tumors cells and drug sensitivity. Better defining how to use these previously untapped clues may pave the way for future studies able to predict sensitivity to cancer drugs and to help in the selection of the best anticancer treatments. Additionally, our work may draw new attention to compounds not now used for anticancer treatments, but whose increased cytotoxicity can be linked to abnormal morphometric parameters that indicate possible anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Modeling,Cell lines,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

This represents a crucial step towards the development of optimized narciclasine derivatives, as the price of narciclasine from commercial sources ranges from $100-$500 per milligram. Additionally, clinical advancement of narciclasine and its derivatives has been severely thwarted, potentially owing to its sparing water-solubility. Insolubility in water makes administration at therapeutic dosages difficult and can lead to unfavorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics.

Copper ion transport proteins, notably SLC31A1 and ATP7B, are essential in maintaining intracellular copper homeostasis, averting disruptions that might lead to copper-induced cell death under normal physiological conditions. However, prior research has not explored Esculetin's role in inducing copper-induced cell death. Hence, this study aims to investigate the biological process of Esculetin-induced cell death and the molecular mechanism underlying dysregulation of intracellular copper ion homeostasis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Initially, the CCK-8 assay was used to determine the IC50 values of Esculetin on colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW480) and normal colonic epithelial cell lines (NCM460). In terms of biological behaviors, the effects of Esculetin on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation assay, and EdU staining. Flow cytometry was used to examine the impact of Esculetin on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in colorectal cancer cells. A subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in nude mice was employed to evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor effects of Esculetin, while IHC staining was conducted to detect Ki-67 levels, and Western blotting was performed to assess EMT-related protein expression. To investigate copper ion homeostasis, qPCR was used to measure the expression levels of copper ion transporters SLC31A1 and ATP7B before and after Esculetin treatment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The CCK-8 results revealed that the IC50 of Esculetin for normal colonic epithelial cell lines was significantly higher than that for colorectal cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, a notable inhibitory effect of Esculetin on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells was observed. Additionally, Esculetin treatment suppressed colony formation and reduced the proportion of EdU-positive cells in colorectal cancer cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated an increase in apoptosis and S-phase arrest following Esculetin treatment. The subcutaneous xenograft tumor model showed significant inhibition of tumor growth by Esculetin, as evidenced by reduced Ki-67-positive cells in the Esculetin-treated group. Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression levels of Vimentin and N-Cadherin and an increase in E-Cadherin expression. Furthermore, qPCR analysis post-Esculetin treatment showed an elevation in the inward copper transporter SLC31A1 levels, while the outward transporter ATP7B expression decreased.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Esculetin induces dysregulation of intracellular copper ion homeostasis by upregulating SLC31A1 expression and downregulating ATP7B expression, leading to intracellular copper accumulation and subsequent disruption of copper homeostasis, thereby inducing copper-induced cell death.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Esculetin,SLC31A1,Copper Homeostasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fangyue Guo<sup><\/sup>, Mengying Liu<sup><\/sup>, Kaihe Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Jiapeng Ru<sup><\/sup>, Pei Li<sup><\/sup>, <b>Shanfeng Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Basic Medical Experimental Center, School of Basic Medical Science, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"066760e3-3560-46ab-a4c3-ab5b158dff74","ControlNumber":"5864","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Our study aimed to investigate the anticancer properties of conessine against liver cancer. We tested the effects of conessine on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers using both Huh7 and Mahlavu cells. Our experimental results indicated that conessine inhibited cell proliferation, migration, motility, and invasion in Huh7 and Mahlavu cells.

We also demonstrated polyphenols extracted from Korean Artemisia annua L. (pKAL) exerts anticancer activity on radio-resistant MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells by suppressing stem cell phenotype, &#946;-catenin, and MMP-9. In this study, we found that pKAL significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of &#946;-lapachone (&#946;-Lap) on oxaliplatin-resistant (Oxp-R) HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. The aim of this study is to elucidate how pKAL enhance the anticancer effects of &#946;-Lap on Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells. CCK-8 assay, phase-contrast microscopy analysis, and morphological analysis with hematoxylin stain revealed that the anticancer effect of &#946;-Lap is more enhanced by pKAL on Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells over 60 hr. This phenomenon was associated with suppression of oxaliplatin resistance-related upregulated proteins (Oxp-RR-Proteins) (p53, ERK, and &#946;-catenin), and downregulation of cell survival- and stemness-related proteins (TERT, CD44 and EGFR) that were not up-regulated in Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells. Protein-protein interaction network analysis of the 21 proteins that showed large difference in expression between before and after the combined treatment of pKAL and &#946;-Lap in HCT116-OxPt-R cells revealed that the enhanced anticancer effect of &#946;-Lap by pKAL was related to the inhibition of negative regulation of apoptotic process and the induction of DNA damage through TERT, CD44, and EGFR-mediated multiple signaling networks. The detailed western blot analysis for anti-cancer effects of pKAL revealed that pKAL alone also suppressed the expression of TERT, CD44 and EGFR in p-HCT 116 cells as well as Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells while &#946;-Lap alone did not influence the expression of them. In addition, for some of the Oxp-RR-Proteins of Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells (p53, ERK, and &#946;-catenin) were suppressed by pKAL alone, but not others. However, some other Oxp-RR-Proteins of Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells that were not suppressed by pKAL alone were significantly suppressed by the combination treatment of pKAL and &#946;-Lap. These findings suggest that pKAL enhanced the anti-cancer effects &#946;-Lap by suppressing TERT, CD44, and EGFR-mediated multiple signaling networks as well as some of the Oxp-RR-Proteins of Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that pKAL enhance the anticancer effects of &#946;-Lap on OXP-R-Hct 116 cells by downregulating CD44, EGFR and some of the Oxp-RR-Proteins of Oxp-R-HCT 116 cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Colorectal cancer,Oxalipaltin-resistance,Natural products-Artemisia annua, beta-lapachone,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

This warrants the need for targeted therapy as currently the most prevalent and effective option include chemotherapeutic drugs. Previous studies showed that an enriched sample extracted from the Jamaican Round Leaf yellow yam exhibited antiproliferative effects on DU145 prostate cancer cells. Based on the results obtained, this present study aims at exploring the underlying mechanism of action as well as the antimetastatic activities that the yam derived hexadecanoic acid may exhibit. Flow cytometry analysis was used to assess cell cycle arrest exhibited by hexadecanoic acid on the hormone insensitive DU145 prostate cancer cells. The western blot analysis was then utilized to determine the effects of the hexadecanoic acid enriched sample on cyclins in the cells. Transwell migration assays were then used to evaluate cell metastatic capabilities. Hexadecanoic acid enriched sample induced G1 S cell cycle arrest in the hormone insensitive prostate cancer cell line. Western blot assays also indicated that cell death was possibly induced through the cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin D1 as its expression was downregulated in the treatment groups. Additionally, the observed metastatic inhibition of prostate cancer cells due to the action of the hexadecanoic acid in the wound healing assay may be attributed to a mechanism involving cyclin D1 as studies have indicated that abnormal Ccnd1 Cdk4 expression promotes tumor growth and metastasis. These results are substantial as it indicates a mechanistic pathway through which hexadecanoic acid is able to cause antiproliferative effects through a cell cycle arrest of hormone insensitive prostate cancer cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural products,Prostate cancer,Metastasis,Cell cycle arrest,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-g.

However, treatment only extends survival modestly, and disease recurrence is typical due to systemic instability, drug resistance, severe adverse effects, and limited benefits in patients with locally advanced tumors. These shortcomings have necessitated new strategies to develop safer and more effective anticancer agents. The study&#8217;s objective was to synthesize, characterize, and evaluate the cytotoxic effects of novel 5-FU analogs in pancreatic cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: The analogs, XYZ-I-71 and XYZ-I-73,<b> <\/b>were synthesized by introducing a tetrahydrofuran ring on 5-fluorocytosine (a precursor of 5-FU) and conjugation with octanoyl chloride and lauroyl chloride, respectively. They were characterized by NMR, HPLC, micro-elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity and cell migration studies were performed to determine the effectiveness of the analogs against MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. PARP apoptosis study was conducted in MiaPaca-2 cells using the analogs and 5-FU. The metabolic stability of analogs was determined by using human liver microsomes and quantified by HPLC.<br \/>Results: Analysis of the <sup>1<\/sup>H-NMR spectra displayed amide bonds at 7.80 ppm and 7.73 ppm, confirming the conjugation of octanoyl and lauroyl chloride to 5-fluorocutosine, respectively. The purity of both analogs was 99.6%. We found that the XYZ-I-73 (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>3.6 &#177; 0.4&#956;M) analog was most effective against MiaPaCa-2 cells compared to XYZ-I-71(IC<sub>50<\/sub> 12.3&#177;1.7&#956;M), GemHCl (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 24.2 &#177; 1.3 &#956;M), Irinotecan (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 10.1 &#177; 1.5 &#956;M<b>)<\/b> and 5-FU (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>13.2 &#177; 1.1 &#956;M<b>)<\/b>.<b> <\/b>For PANC-1 cell growth inhibition, XYZ-I-73 (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>3.9 &#177; 0.5) was again observed as the most effective agent compared to XYZ-I-71(IC<sub>50<\/sub> 8.7&#177;0.9 &#956;M), GemHCl (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>10.07&#177;0.9), 5-FU (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>20.43&#177;1.2) and Irinotecan (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>11.6 &#177;1.1). A similar pattern of XYZ-I-73 (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>5.9&#177;0.7) anticancer activity against BxPC-3 cells was found to be higher than XYZ-I-71(IC<sub>50 <\/sub>7.7 &#177; 0.8), GemHCl (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>10.95&#177;0.9), 5-FU (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>14&#177;1.1) and Irinotecan (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>9.5&#177;1.0). For 24-hour MiaPaCa-2 cell migration studies, XYZ-I-73 (5&#181;M) analog significantly reduced migration (# of migrated cells, 168&#177;2.9) followed by XYZ-I-71(315&#177;2.1), Gem-HCl (762&#177;3.1) and 5-FU (710&#177;3.2). PARP studies demonstrated significant inhibition of PARP expression of XYZ-I-73 treated cells compared to 5-FU and XYZ-I-71. Further, BAX and p53 expressions were significantly increased in cells treated with XYZ-I-73 compared to 5-FU and XYZ-I-71. Metabolic stability studies showed that 80 &#177; 5.9 % of XYZ-I-71 and XYZ-I-73 remained intact after 2-hour exposure in liver microsomal solution compared to 5-FU.<br \/>Conclusion: XYZ-I-73 demonstrated a remarkable cytotoxic effect and improved in vitro metabolic stability over the selected standard drugs and may have potential anticancer activity against pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Synthesis, metabolism, and disposition,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Nucleoside analogs,Synthesis,Cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Although NMIBC generally exhibits a favorable prognosis, a considerable number of patients suffer from short-term recurrence, and high risks of progression to the more aggressive muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative treatments to improve outcomes for patients with NMIBC. For centuries, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played a significant role in Asian society, with ongoing research to investigate the intricate relationship between TCM and treatment of cancers. Bufadienolides, the principal active components in Chansu, are derived from the aqueous extract of the parotoid glands and the dried secretion of the Asiatic toad. Bufadienolides have been reported to demonstrate significant antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms that underlie the anticancer effects of bufadienolides in NMIBC. Our experiments show that bufadienolides significantly decrease cell viability, induce cell-cycle arrest at the sub-G1 phase, and activate apoptosis in NMIBC cells (RT112 and RT4). Protein analysis reveals the activation of apoptosis-related proteins (PARP, caspase-3, -8, -9) by bufadienolides in NMIBC cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that bufadienolides present promising potential as therapeutic agents for NMIBC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural products,Bladder cancer,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.-C.

To increase its therapeutic levels, gemcitabine is administered at high doses causing severe side effects. To improve its metabolic stability, increase cytotoxic activity, and limit the phenomena of resistance many alternatives have emerged, such as modifying gemcitabine. The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a novel gemcitabine analog with improved stability and enhanced anticancer activity against pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: A novel analog of gemcitabine (GemAGY) was designed and synthesized through chemical modification of gemcitabine hydrochloride (GemHCl) at position 4 with hydroxylamine. Gem AGY was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), micro-elemental analysis, and purity determined using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2, BxPC3, and PANC-1) were treated with GemHCl and GemAGY. Cytotoxicity, cell migration, clonogenic assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis studies were performed to evaluate the effect of GemAGY against pancreatic cancer cell lines.<br \/>Results: The percent purity of GemAGY was over 99.6%. GemAGY demonstrated a higher cytotoxic effect against pancreatic cancer cells with a lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) value (2.5-fold high) compared with GemHCl. For MiaPaCa-2 cells, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of GemAGY was found to be 1.63 &#177; 0.15 &#181;m compared to GemHCl (4.0 &#177; 1.7 &#181;m). GemAGY also exhibited higher cytotoxicity in PANC-1 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 1.7 &#177; 0.2&#181;m) compared to GemHCl (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 5.6 &#177;1.3 &#181;m) and the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of GemAGY (3.2&#177;1.1&#181;m) in BxPC-3 cells was significantly better than GemHCl (5.5&#177;1.0 &#181;m). The cell cycle analysis indicated that GemAGY-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells at 1.50 &#181;m concentration had a higher G<sub>0<\/sub>\/G<sub>1 <\/sub>population (60.24%) compared to GemHCl-treated cells (55%). The cell migration studies showed that GemAGY-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells at 12.5 &#181;m concentration significantly inhibited cell mobility towards the wound area with migrated cells found to be 65 &#177; 6 compared to Gem HCl (174.3 &#177; 4.0) (GemAGY vs GemHCl; p&#60;0.0001). Similarly, GemAGY-treated PANC-1 cells at 12.5 &#181;m concentration significantly inhibited cell mobility towards the wound area with (98 &#177; 5.1) compared to Gem HCl (254 &#177; 6.6). The quantitative analysis of apoptosis studies showed that GemAGY significantly induced higher apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in MiaPaCa-2 cells compared to GemHCl as concentration increases (GemAGY vs GemHCl; p &#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrates that GemAGY increases the anticancer activity of gemcitabine and may have the potential to improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-08 Synthesis, metabolism, and disposition,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gemcitabine,Cytotoxicity,Pancreatic cancer,Synthesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and FLT3-ITD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) significantly improved the therapy, but not cure, due to the general resistance. Overactivated mTOR protein translation pathway is believed to be one of the mechanisms causing resistance and that targeting protein translation should be one effective approach to overcome resistance. Brusatol is a quassinoid extracted from the fruit of <i>Brucea javanica<\/i> and an inhibitor of protein translation. We tested its antiproliferation and apoptosis induction in a variety of AML and CML cell lines as well as in TKI resistant cell lines. Brusatol effectively inhibits the growth of seven leukemia cell lines with GI<sub>50<\/sub> values less than 20 nM. Brusatol induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and induces G0\/G1 phase arrest in CML cell lines. Brusatol decreases the levels of fast turnover protein cyclin D1 and Mcl-1. In FLT3-ITD inhibitor sorafenib resistant MOLM-13\/Sor cell line brusatol exhibits similar growth inhibition and apoptosis induction with the parental MOLM-13 cells, associated with inhibition of Mcl-1 and FLT3-ITD proteins. In BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib resistant K562\/STI cell line brusatol is effective as in parental K562 cells, associated with inhibition of cyclin D1 and BCR-ABL proteins. Brusatol at 2 mg\/kg effectively inhibit tumor growth of K562 xenografts without causing toxicity to normal organs. These data indicate that brusatol inhibits oncogenic protein translation and has potential to be used to treat TKI resistant leukemia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Natural products,Translation,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Cervical cancer is primarily treated by Chemo\/Radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage, with Carboplatin\/Cisplatin-based drug regime. These drugs being non-specific, target rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells, so safer options are needed for more targeted therapy and lower off-target toxicity. Natural products offer an attractive option compared to synthetic drugs due to their well-established safety profile and capacity to target multiple oncogenic hallmarks of cancer like inflammation, angiogenesis, etc. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Bergenin (C-glycoside of 4-O-methylgallic acid), a natural polyphenol compound that is isolated from medicinal plants such as <i>Bergenia crassifolia<\/i>, <i>Caesalpinia digyna,<\/i> and <i>Flueggea leucopyrus<\/i>. Bergenin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, and wound healing properties. Still, its anticancer potential has been realized only recently. We performed a proteomic analysis of cervical carcinoma cells treated with bergenin and found it to influence multiple hallmarks of cancers, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor suppressor proteins. It was also involved in many different cellular processes unrelated to cancer, as shown by our proteomic analysis. Further analysis showed bergenin to be a potent -angiogenic agent by reducing key angiogenic proteins like Galectin 3 and MMP-9 (Matrix Metalloprotease 9) in cervical carcinoma cells at cellular level as shown by western blotting assay. Further understanding of this interaction was carried out using molecular docking analysis, which indicated MMP-9 has more affinity for Bergenin as compared to Galectin-3. Cumulatively, our data provide novel insight into the anti-angiogenic mechanism of Bergenin in cervical carcinoma cells by modulation of multiple angiogenic proteins like Galectin-3 and MMP-9 which warrant its further development as an anticancer agent in cervical cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-07 Natural products,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Galectin-3,Matrix metalloprotease,Natural products,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Our laboratory at City of Hope has over 20 years of collective experience in defining the anticancer mechanisms of WBM <sup>[2, 3]<\/sup>. Previous studies have indicated that WBM consumption has anti-androgenic activities in prostate cancers in both preclinical models <sup>[4]<\/sup> and clinical trials <sup>[5]<\/sup>. In our first-in-human phase 1 trial on prostate cancer patients, we ensured the safety of consuming WBM in humans. In addition to observing a therapeutic-responsive decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) reduced in responders to WBM treatments <sup>[5]<\/sup>. These observations led us to hypothesize that WBM may mitigate the progression of prostate cancer in part by modulating the immune response. In the current study, we conducted translational research in syngeneic murine models and in prostate cancer patients from an ongoing phase 2 trial, aiming to define the immunomodulatory activity and mechanisms of WBM. We confirmed that WBM consumption in mouse models altered the number and function of immunosuppressive cells (MDSCs) and anti-tumor immune cells (T &#38; NK cells), ultimately enhancing the intratumor and systemic immune responses. At a bulk-transcriptional level, we observed the elevated expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in xenograft tumors. In our single immune cell profiling of patients&#8217; blood specimens following 3 months of WBM consumption in freeze-dried tablets form, we investigated the transcriptional landscape of circulating immune cells in response to WBM interventions. The level of circulating neutrophil-associated PMN-MDSCs decreased, and the remaining cells showed transcriptional profiles associated with \"neutrophil chemotaxis\", \"leukocyte aggregation\", and \"regulation of inflammatory response\", as functions associated with enhanced anti-tumor activity. Lastly, we also showed in a mouse model that WBM consumption synergistically enhances the anticancer activity of anti-PD1 drugs, indicating that WBM may be used as adjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In summary, our results from prostate cancer patients and murine models show the immunomodulatory effects of WBM consumption and provide a scientific foundation for the application of WBM in alleviating prostate cancer progression.<br \/>References 1, Zhang S., et al. <i>Int.

The dried plant was extracted sequentially using organic solvents ranging from non-polar to polar and water. The extracts were filtered and concentrated using a rotary evaporator and then evaporated to dryness\/lyophilized. Cells were cultured according to standard established procedure. The extracts were subjected to phytochemical analyses. FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays were done to examine antioxidant activity and MTT assays were used to evaluate the antiproliferative\/cytotoxicity of the extracts against normal (Vero) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1).<br \/><b>Results and Discussion: <\/b>Extracts of <i>Ipomoea cairic<\/i>a possess alkaloids, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, phytosterols, tannins, triterpenoids, and anthraquinones.
