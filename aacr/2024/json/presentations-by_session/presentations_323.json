[{"Abstract":"KRAS mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in many cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). While Sotorasib and Adagrasib, KRAS G12C inhibitors, have received approval, they exhibit limited responsiveness in clinical trials and are not applicable to various other KRAS mutation types. SOS1 (Son of Sevenless 1) functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) on RAS, facilitating the transition of inactive GDP-bound RAS to its active GTP-bound state. In addition, SOS1 plays a pivotal role in negative feedback by actively contributing to the reactivation of ERK during treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK\/RAS\/MAPK pathway. Inhibiting SOS1, which impedes the reactivation of ERK, has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of inhibitors targeting the RTK\/RAS\/MAPK signaling cascade and prevent the emergence of resistance mechanisms via H-RAS and N-RAS bypass pathways. Therefore, combining the inhibition of SOS1 with inhibitors targeting the RTK\/RAS\/MAPK pathway may enhance outcomes and mitigate relapse associated with observed resistances. Here, we present the discovery of a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule SOS1 inhibitor that effectively disrupts the interaction between SOS1 and RAS. It has demonstrated remarkable synergy effects with RTK\/RAS\/MAPK pathway inhibitors, significantly impeding the growth of tumors carrying KRAS or EGFR mutations <i>in vivo<\/i>. Overall, our development candidate has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in combination with inhibitors targeting the RTK\/RAS\/MAPK pathway for cancers bearing activating mutations in this pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Protein-protein interactions,NSCLC,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

BMF-219 is a covalent menin inhibitor currently under investigation in a dose-finding study evaluating safety and tolerability in adults with KRAS-driven Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), or Colorectal Cancer (CRC) (NCT NCT05631574). We previously showed that BMF-219 induces effective killing of solid tumor cells irrespective of their KRAS mutation subtype (AACR 2022, abstract 2665) and perturbs genomic binding of MYC and its binding partner MAX, in acute leukemia cells (ASH Abstract 2021). To probe into the underlying mechanism and the potential pathways engaged, BMF-219-induced effects were evaluated in CRC, PDAC and NSCLC cell lines. Cells treated with relevant concentrations of BMF-219 versus vehicle were assessed for menin and MYC protein levels, along with treatment effects on cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. In addition, bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed on the cell lines treated with BMF-219 in a time course study. BMF-219 induces a dose-dependent decrease in menin protein levels in the solid tumor cell lines tested following 24 hours treatment, with the least impact observed in a KRAS WT cell line. The effect of BMF-219 on c-MYC protein levels were variable and highly cell-type dependent, with the CRC metastatic tumor cell line SW620 exhibiting the highest reduction. Differential expression (DE) analysis of bulk RNA-seq data comparing BMF-219 treated versus vehicle treated cells, identified significant alterations in transcript abundance at 6- and 24-hours post treatment. The magnitude of change in the transcript abundance showed a dose-dependent response without significant alteration of a panel of housekeeping genes. GSEA analysis identified pathways associated with cell cycle, cell division and MYC-regulated were significantly&#8239;differentially expressed across multiple cell lines. These data suggest similar molecular pathways are altered by BMF-219 across KRAS-mutated solid tumor cells. Additional insights into key pathways and modulators will be reported. Collectively, these data suggest that the functional pathway alterations induced by BMF-219 in solid tumor cells are likely pan-KRAS and are similar across different solid tumor indications. This provides further support for advancing the clinical investigation of BMF-219 in KRAS-driven solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Solid tumor,Menin,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is the predominant KRAS mutation isoform, detected in approximately 35% of pancreatic cancer, 13% of colorectal cancer, and 5% of NSCLC <sup>[3]<\/sup>. Compared to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, targeting KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> has proven to be more challenging since the target protein lacks a reactive amino acid residue for irreversible inhibitory modification by a ligand. Herein, we disclose TSN1611, a potent and selective KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitor, which possesses favorable oral PK profiles and demonstrates significant <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity in various KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-mutant models.<br \/>Method: Biochemical HTRF assay was used to measure the inhibition of TSN1611 to both GDP-bound and GTP-bound state of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>. Biophysical SPR method was used to directly measure the binding of TSN1611 to GDP-bound KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>WT<\/sup>. Cell based activities were evaluated in a series of <i>in vitro<\/i> cell proliferation assay utilizing Ba\/F3 cells engineered with KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> or non-KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutations and tumor cell lines harboring KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation. Human cancer cell-derived xenograft models of HPAC (pancreatic) and GP2D (colorectal) were used to evaluate its <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor effect. <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> PK studies were performed in mouse, rat, and dog. Systematic nonclinical safety evaluations, including safety panel screen testing, safety pharmacology studies, and repeat-dose toxicity studies were carried out to assess its preliminary toxicity profile.<br \/>Results: TSN1611 inhibited both active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> protein at IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1.23 and 1.49 nM, respectively; the K<sub>D<\/sub> value of its direct binding to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> protein is 1.93 pM in SPR assay. TSN1611 demonstrated potent anti-proliferation activity against several tumor cell lines harboring KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation, and excellent selectivity over cells of NRAS, HRAS, and other KRAS isoforms. It also showed dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in GP2D and HPAC models. Mechanism of action studies concluded that the antitumor effect of TSN1611 is resulted from its effective inhibition of KRAS signaling pathway. Oral bioavailability and safety profile across multiple species supported its further development.<br \/>Conclusion: TSN1611 is a selective KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>inhibitor. It exhibited excellent selectivity and activity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>; it demonstrated favorable physicochemical properties, oral PK profiles, and brain penetration potential; it also showed acceptable margins of safety.

Amplifications of the KRAS wild-type (wt) allele account for ~7% of all KRAS-driven cancers and are frequent in gastric (~5%), esophageal (~13%) and gastroesophageal junction cancers (~12%). KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutations account for ~28% of pancreatic cancers, 9% of colorectal cancers and 6% of lung adenocarcinoma. There is an urgent medical need to identify targeted therapies for these frequent KRAS alterations. Herein, we describe BI 3706674, a novel, potent and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS oncogene for clinical testing in patients with tumors harboring KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutations and KRAS wild-type amplifications. BI 3706674 binds non-covalently to multiple KRAS mutant alleles, including the KRAS wt allele, in the GDP-bound state and thereby disrupts oncogenic signaling. Importantly, BI 3706674 is highly selective for KRAS vs HRAS or NRAS, and it is therefore expected to be well-tolerated in normal tissues. In two large cancer cell line panels (PRISM and Horizon), BI 3706674 shows sensitivity across a wide range of KRAS alleles (KRAS wt amplifications and KRAS mutations e.g., G12A\/C\/D\/V, G13D and Q61H). The strongest sensitivity was observed for cell lines with KRAS wt amplifications (relative copy number (CN) of &#62; 10) followed by cell lines with KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutations along with significant pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker modulation (e.g., down-regulation of DUSP6 mRNA).<i> In vivo<\/i>, BI 3706674 was well-tolerated and showed dose-dependent efficacy in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models of human gastric cancer with KRAS wt CN &#62; 10 and diverse tumor types with KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutations. A twice daily oral dose of 30 mg\/kg induced significant tumor regression and PD biomarker modulation. Combination of BI 3706674 with standard of care therapies and novel agents are being tested in preclinical models to guide clinical development. Results of the ongoing pre-clinical analysis will be shared.

However, most current clinical-stage KRAS inhibitors target the KRAS G12C mutation. Inhibitors of other KRAS mutants such as KRAS G12D, the most frequent KRAS mutation in human cancer, are needed for patients. We have developed GFH375 (VS-7375), an oral, selective KRAS G12D inhibitor targeting both &#8220;ON&#8221; (GTP-bound) and &#8220;OFF&#8221; (GDP-bound) states of KRAS proteins. The in vitro potency, selectivity, and in vivo efficacy of monotherapy and combination therapy with avutometinib, a unique RAF\/MEK clamp, were evaluated in preclinical studies.<br \/>Methods: Biochemical and cellular assays were used to investigate inhibition to KRAS cycling and signaling. CellTiter-Glo assay was performed to determine the effects on proliferation of tumor cell lines. Several KRAS G12D CDX tumor models were employed to study the in vivo pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor effects.<br \/>Results: GFH375 inhibited both nucleotide exchange on GDP-bound KRAS G12D and interaction between GMPPNP-bound KRAS G12D with RAF1 with single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values. GFH375 suppressed phosho-ERK1\/2 (p-ERK) level with sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values and potently inhibited cell proliferation across a panel of KRAS G12D tumor cell lines. GFH375 showed high selectivity for KRAS G12D relative to non-G12D KRAS variants, KRAS wild type cells, and NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF mutated cells. Following a single oral dose, GFH375 produced deep and durable inhibition of p-ERK in KRAS G12D CDX tumors. GFH375 demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumor activity with tumor regressions at 10 or 30 mg\/kg given orally twice daily in multiple KRAS G12D PDAC and CRC CDX tumor models. GFH375 also showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in an intracranial KRAS G12D tumor model starting as low as 10 mg\/kg orally twice daily. Strong synergy between GFH375 and avutometinib was observed in vitro and was validated in vivo as anti-tumor activity of GFH375 was further enhanced by avutometinib.<br \/>Conclusions: GFH375 is a highly potent and selective orally active inhibitor of KRAS G12D (ON\/OFF) and demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in multiple KRAS G12D tumor models. GFH375 was also effective in an intracranial tumor model. GFH375 showed strong synergy with avutometinib in vitro and in vivo. GFH375 is currently in IND-enabling development in preparation for clinical studies of monotherapy and potentially in combination with other agents for patients with KRAS G12D mutant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,G12D,GFH375,avutometinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Feng Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lijian Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Leitao Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoming Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yanhui Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoling Lan<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaohui Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Meng Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qiang Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinting Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Fubo Xie<sup>1<\/sup>, Xueyan Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingyang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongcan Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Siyuan Le<sup>1<\/sup>, Lili Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvia Coma<sup>2<\/sup>, Yaofeng Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Nathan Sanburn<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan  A.

MRTX1719 preferentially binds to the PRMT5&#8226;MTA complex to selectively inhibit PRMT5, an essential gene for all cells, in <i>MTAP<\/i> del cancer cells while sparing PRMT5 activity in normal <i>MTAP<\/i>-wildtype cells. <i>MTAP<\/i> del occurs in ~10% of all cancers, and these patients exhibit remarkably poor survival. Among pancreatic cancer, <i>MTAP<\/i> del occurs in ~ 25% of patients and of these ~30% have co-occurring <i>KRAS<\/i> G12D mutations. In addition, ~15% of lung adenocarcinoma patients harbor <i>MTAP<\/i> del and of these ~13% harbor <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C. While recently approved KRAS G12C mutant selective inhibitors demonstrate anti-tumor activity, strategies to address drug resistance and maximize clinical benefit are warranted. Combination of MRTX1719 with adagrasib or the KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 in CDX models harboring both a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation (G12C or G12D) and homozygous <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion resulted in increased anti-tumor activity compared to either single agent. This includes the pancreatic KP4 model in which initial tumor regression in response to single agent MRTX1133 was observed, followed by adaptative resistance and tumor progression with monotherapy while co-administration with MRTX1719 continued to result in marked tumor regression. Mechanistically, combination treated animals demonstrated strong inhibition of both PRMT5 and RAS pathway signaling and combinatorial targeting of these pathways converged on enhanced inhibition of RB-1 phosphorylation. We also characterized this combination treatment in the context of resistance to KRAS selective inhibitors or MRTX1719 to evaluate the benefit of combination over sequential treatment. Finally, an <i>NF1<\/i> mutant, <i>MTAP <\/i>del malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) PDX model was treated with MRTX1719, the SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902, or the combination, and a similar increase in anti-tumor activity was observed in the combination treatment compared to either monotherapy alone. These results suggest that the combination of an MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor with a KRAS mutant selective or KRAS pathway inhibitor may lead to deeper and more durable responses in <i>MTAP<\/i> del cancer patients with co-alterations in the KRAS pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Pancreatic cancer,Lung cancer: non-small cell,PRMT5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"L.

Mutation rates can range from ~25% of Non Small Cell Lung cancers to over 90% of pancreatic cancers. RAS proteins can also be hyper-activated to drive cancer at a significant frequency in the absence of RAS gene mutations when their protein regulatory systems are damaged. Thus, RAS may be the most frequently activated oncoprotein in cancer. We have developed a series of novel, direct, RAS inhibitors with a unique binding site on RAS. The binding of the agents alters the structure of the RAS effector loop and blocks the association with RAS downstream effectors. We used in silico library screening followed by Medicinal Chemistry optimization to develop the compounds. We have validated the agents using Microscale Thermophoresis and NMR to quantify binding to recombinant RAS protein. We have used mutant and wild type RAS driven tumor cell lines in 3D growth and protein-based RAS signaling assays to quantify and characterize the action of the family of inhibitors. We have used xenograft assays to demonstrate compound anti-tumor activity in RAS driven cell lines and pdx systems. We have identified compounds that can bind mutant and wild type K, H, N and M-RAS. We can suppress the association of mutant and wild type RAS protein with its effector RAF-1 in treated cells. The compounds can suppress 3D growth of mutant or wild type RAS driven tumor cell lines and repress tumor development in vivo. The compound family bind to a different site than either clinical agent AMG-510 (K-RAS G12C specific) or MRTX-1133 (K-RAS G12D specific). They exhibit distinct RAS signal inhibition patterns compared to these agents. They can also co-operate with the clinical agents and reduce drug resistance effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Pan-RAS,KRAS,K-ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Tariq Arshad<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Howard Donninger<sup>2<\/sup>, Goeff Clarke<sup>3<\/sup>, Joe Burlison<sup>3<\/sup>, Rob Monsen<sup>3<\/sup>, Mike Sabo<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Qualigen Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Dept.

Gain-of-function missense mutations in KRAS, leading to its aberrant activation, are found in ~90% of pancreatic cancer, ~40% of colorectal cancer and ~30% of lung adenocarcinoma, with KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutations accounting for ~28%, 9% and 6% of the cases, respectively. The poor outcome associated with these tumor types as well as the lack of targeted inhibitors for the KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>-mutant allele calls for the urgent need to identify therapies able to effectively address this allele. BI 3706674 is a novel, potent and orally available small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS oncogene. BI 3706674 binds non-covalently to multiple KRAS mutant alleles, including KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>, in the GDP-bound state, and blocks downstream oncogenic signalling. Here, we show that BI 3706674 has a strong anti-proliferative activity in a panel of KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>-mutant cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>, along with significant pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker modulation (including inhibition of ERK1\/2 phosphorylation and down-regulation of DUSP6 mRNA). <i>In vivo,<\/i> a twice daily oral dose of 30 mg\/kg was well tolerated, while inducing tumour regression in several mutant KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models across multiple different tumor types. Feedback activation of upstream signalling pathways including receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR, has been suggested to limit the efficacy of GDP-KRAS-targeting compounds in preclinical studies. Clinical combination trials involving KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors such as adagrasib and sotorasib and anti-EGFR modalities are further supporting these findings. Here we show that a combination with anti-EGFR antibodies (e.g., Cetuximab) potently enhances the response observed for BI 3706674 in models of KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>-mutant colorectal cancer. The deeper response observed upon combination of BI 3706674 with Cetuximab across multiple xenograft<i> <\/i>models provides a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of this combination therapy.

Currently, apoptosis and autophagy are the central mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) that maintain cellular homeostasis and regulate cell fate. With the recent emergence of &#8216;ferroptosis&#8217; as a new type of PCD and its close association with the pathophysiological processes of many diseases including tumors, it is viewed as a potential mechanism to improve systemic treatment of PC. Considering the opportunity to regulate both apoptosis and ferroptosis by a single agent, our group has developed a cancer-targeted small molecule consisting of a sigma-2 ligand (a known apoptotic inducer) delivery moiety linked to an inhibitor of the cystine importer xCT (dm-Erastin, a known ferroptotic inducer) and named it as Sigma-2-Erastin (S2E) or ACXT-3102. The study presented here is aimed at determining the efficacy of ACXT-3102 in PC and defining its underlying mechanism of action.<br \/>Methods: Using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor xenograft models of human PC, we determined the effects of ACXT-3102 treatments in regulating PCD of PC cells and defined the signaling pathway involved in mediating the effects.<br \/>Results: As assessed by TitreGlo assays, we observed dose-dependent inhibition of PC cell (BxPC-3, AsPC-1 &#38; PANC-1) viability. Following the WES-analysis of signaling proteins, we observed that ACXT-3102 induces PC cell death by combinatorial regulation of apoptotic and ferroptotic PCD via lipid ROS-DUSP6-MAPK\/ERK-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, the results of this study demonstrated a hyperactivation of MAPK\/ERK signaling by increased phosphorylation instead of inhibition involved in inducting apoptotic cell death as represented by significant increases in expression of cleaved Capase-3\/7 and PARP. In addition, ACXT-3102 treatments deceased GPX4 expression along with an increase in lipid ROS production as key markers of inducing ferroptotic cell death. Results from the murine model of human tumor xenografts using AsPC-1 cells further demonstrated significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in survival proportions in ACXT-3102-treated mice.<br \/>Conclusions: ACXT-3102, an orally administered conjugate of sigma-2 ligand and Erastin induces PCD of human PC by uniquely regulating apoptosis and ferroptosis together. Therefore, ACXT-3102 offers a novel and improved therapeutic strategy for treating patients of fatal human carcinomas, especially those, which are difficult to diagnose at an early stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Apoptosis,Pancreatic cancer,Signaling pathways,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

RAS mutations occur de novo in approximately one-third of all human cancers, and are especially prevalent in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung tumors. Where RAS mutations are less frequent in other cancers, such as breast cancer, RAS can be pathologically activated by growth factor receptors that engage numerous downstream effectors.<br \/>The currently FDA-approved KRAS-targeted drugs are designed to covalently inactivate only G12C KRAS mutants, however, this mutation is only prevalent in lung cancer. The most common mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are KRAS-G12D, KRAS-G12V, and KRAS-G12R. Our novel class of pan-RAS inhibitors, exemplified by ADT-007, addresses the urgent need for pan-RAS inhibitors with antitumor activity in cancers harboring these common mutations. These pan-RAS inhibitors have unique pharmacological properties that allow for selective killing of cancer cells harboring RAS mutations. ADT-007 inhibited growth of an array of carcinoma tumor cell lines in vitro with single digit nM IC50 values regardless of RAS mutant allele, and inhibited RAS activation and MAPK\/AKT signaling. Because it is a pan-RAS inhibitor, ADT-007 may not be susceptible to commonly reported mechanisms of resistance to covalent KRAS inhibitors, such as activation of wild type (WT) alleles or secondary RAS mutations. Differentiated normal epithelial or hepatic cells, and tumor cells with WT RAS were insensitive to ADT-007 due to enzymatic detoxification of ADT-007 via glucuronidation, representing a novel mechanism of tumor selectivity. An orally bioavailable prodrug of ADT-007 (ADT-1004) is well tolerated in vivo, and produced sustained concentrations of ADT-007 well above IC50 values in plasma and even higher levels in tumors. Daily oral administration of ADT-1004 significantly inhibited RAS signaling and tumor growth in orthotopic and PDX mouse models of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Pancreatic cancer,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

At AIGEN Sciences, Inc., we have harnessed an advanced human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI-based drug discovery platform (AIGEN ChemTailor). This innovative platform allows online learning through expert feedback, optimizing our drug development endeavors. We designed a potent SOS1 inhibitor, AIG01012 using AIGEN ChemTailor in combination with fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) and molecular modeling techniques. We conceived numerous compounds and shortlisted the leading candidates for extensive testing after meticulous computer simulations. AIG01012 manifested substantial inhibitory effects against several KRAS mutant interactions with SOS1, specifically SOS1-KRAS WT, SOS1-KRAS G12C, SOS1-KRAS G12D, SOS1-KRAS G12V, and SOS1-KRAS G13D. However, its inhibitory capacity did not extend to the SOS2-KRAS G12C interaction. AIG01012 demonstrated remarkable inhibitory effects in 3D cell proliferation assays across various cell lines, including H358, MIA-PaCa2, SW837, AsPC-1, A427, SW620, Capan-2, A549, DLD-1, MKN-1, and H1666. Moreover, AIG01012 showed synergistic antiproliferative effects when combined with approved drugs such as sotorasib (for lung cancer with KRAS mutations), trametinib (a MEK inhibitor), and Osimertinib (targets specific EGFR mutations) in either H358 or PC-9 cell lines. Mouse studies further confirmed its favorable pharmacological properties, and its efficacy was evaluated in subsequent mouse tumor model. In summary, utilizing our human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI platform, AIGEN ChemTailor, we have efficiently derived AIG01012 as a potent SOS1 inhibitor that targets a wide range of KRAS interactions. With its notable in vitro and in vivo outcomes, AIG01012 is set for further exploration and prospective clinical trials as a significant contender in KRAS-targeted cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Antitumor agents,Small molecule inhibitor,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Method: Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we have aimed to design novel small-molecule KRAS G12D inhibitors that are orally bioavailable. The compounds were screened via pERK and cell viability (CTG) assays in multiple cell types. The optimized compounds were further evaluated based on their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and toxicity. The anti-tumor efficacy of the leads was confirmed in the GP2D (colorectal carcinoma with KRAS G12D mutation) mouse xenograft tumor model. Result: As shown in the table, HBW-012-D and HBW-012-E have significantly better potency and PK characteristics than MRTX1133. In the mouse GP2D model, comparing head-to-head with the same vehicle and protocol (50 mg\/kg, twice daily, orally), MRTX1133 hardly inhibited tumor growth, whereas HBW-012-D inhibited tumor growth well (58 % tumor growth inhibition), and HBW-012-E not only completely inhibited tumor growth but also further regressed tumor size by around 40%. Preliminary toxicity tests showed that HBW-012-D and HBW-012-E are safe: weak inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, negative mini-Ames test, excellent kinase selectivity, and no obvious abnormalities in the 14-day rat or mouse toxicity test. Conclusion: New KRAS G12D inhibitors, HBW-012-D and HBW-012-E, were identified. Their preclinical profile, including potency, efficacy, and PK data, are all superior to MRTX1133, and their safety meets the criteria of clinical development. They show potential as a preferred oral treatment option for patients with tumors mediated by the KRAS G12D mutation, such as pancreatic cancer that still lacks effective treatments.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{F9027912-8380-45B3-ACB5-528101D625EF}\"><caption>in vitro data<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>IC 50 (nM)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MRTX1133<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HBW-012-D<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HBW-012-E<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AGS (G12D, stomach, pERK)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AsPC-1 (G12D, pancreas, 3D CTG)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.88<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.09<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GP2D (G12D, colon, 3D CTG)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.38<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MKN-1 (WT, stomach, 3D CTG)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;3000<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Rat PK @ 100 mg\/kg oral<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cmax (ng\/mL)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">82<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1444<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC0~t (mg.h\/mL)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">258<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5724<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Small molecule inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

On-target activity of PMR-116 was confirmed in peripheral blood cells isolated from patients with solid tumors enrolled in a phase I trial of PMR-116.<br \/>Results: PMR-116 potently inhibits Pol I transcription with ~200 fold higher selectivity towards Pol I compared to Pol II transcription. PMR-116 inhibits rRNA synthesis by stalling the Pol I complex at the rDNA promoter preventing promoter escape and consequently elongation. PMR-116 anti-cancer activity was evaluated against a panel of over 100 cancer cell lines representative of 20 major types of solid and haematological malignancies. This new Pol I inhibitor exhibited broad anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity with an IC50 ranging from 32-4500nM and a median IC50 of 300nM.

However, some tumors called \"cold tumors\" lack infiltrating T-cells and are not responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), leading to worse clinical outcomes. This study demonstrates that L-pampo, a novel TLR2\/3 agonist, promotes an anti-tumor immune response in cold tumors. Also, combining L-pampo with ICIs can improve the anti-tumor efficacy more safely than standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapies.<br \/>Method: We utilized syngeneic tumor models using CT26 colon cancer and 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). L-pampo was administered alone or in combination with ICIs such as anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) and anti-CTLA-4 (aCTLA-4) antibodies to tumor-bearing mice (n=8\/group). Tumor size was measured every three days, and the survival rate was monitored until day 60. On day 21 or 27 after transplantation, we analyzed the tumor weight and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, we assessed the respective anti-tumor efficacies and safety of L-pampo and SoC chemotherapies (FOLFOX and paclitaxel).<br \/>Result: In the CT26 colon cancer model, L-pampo effectively reduced the tumor size compared to the vehicle group (83.7%). The combination of L-pampo and ICI reduced tumor size by 86.1% (with aCTLA4) and 90.5% (with aPD-1), while the ICI alone did not effectively inhibit tumor growth (aPD-1; 17.3%, aCTLA-4; 23.6%). Notably, the triple concurrent treatment with L-pampo, aPD-1 and aCTLA-4 reduced tumor size by 96.6% and induced completed tumor regression in 1 out of 8. In the 4T1 TNBC model, L-pampo reduced tumor size by 64.2% compared to the vehicle treatment, and combined treatment with L-pampo and a-PD-1 suppressed tumor growth compared to aPD-1 alone (9.6% vs. 61.5%). Additionally, L-pampo improved median overall survival in each tumor model (CT26; 25.5 vs. 35.5, 4T1; 29.5 vs. 53.5 days). To compare the anti-tumor efficacy of L-pampo and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, we treated tumor-bearing mice with FOLFOX or paclitaxel as SoC regimen, respectively. Compared with each chemotherapy, L-pampo revealed comparable antitumor efficacies (Tumor growth inhibition CT26; 75.6% vs. 70.6%, 4T1; 65.5% vs. 58.8%). Interestingly, L-pampo inhibited tumor growth without significant adverse effects. In contrast, conventional chemotherapies induced acute hematological side effects such as leukopenia\/neutropenia\/thrombocytopenia and rapid weight loss. Furthermore, L-pampo increased the active cytotoxic T-cells infiltration through antigen-presenting cells stimulation within the tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: This study suggests that L-pampo, a novel TLR2\/3 agonist, can be a potent anti-tumor agent, improving the anti-tumor efficacy of ICIs in cold tumors with enhanced anti-tumor immunity and minimal toxicities than conventional chemotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immunostimulation,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Guentae Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yoonki Heo<sup>1<\/sup>, Hye Jung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sejung Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Byung Cheol Ahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Won Suk Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Chan Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Hong Jae Chon<sup>2<\/sup>, Eunyoung Chun<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung Sun Yum<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>CHA Vaccine Institute, Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine, Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2d5ca3ef-b48b-41d5-aea5-adcbcd0fe244","ControlNumber":"1403","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Despite the development of targeted treatments and immunotherapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) continues to evade effective treatment. TNBC lacks sufficient expression of druggable markers, ER, PR, and Her2, and exhibits especially aggressive characteristics including later diagnosis, lower survival rate, and higher rates of metastasis and reoccurrence. Currently, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation remain the standard of care for TNBC. Our work utilizes compounds from nature to develop therapies for TNBC with improved efficacy and safety. Oridonin, a natural kaurene-type diterpenoid enriched in the medicinal herb <i>Rabdosia rubescens<\/i>, is a promising anticancer agent, but exhibits limited bioavailability and potency. Our team successfully developed oridonin derivative CYD0618 compound that exhibits significantly improved solubility and anticancer activity. This study aims to characterize the mechanism of action of CYD0618 on TNBC cells. We found that CYD0618 reduces the proliferation of TNBC cells <i>in vitro<\/i> with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s at the nanomolar level. We also found CYD0618 has high potency against TNBC <i>in vivo<\/i>. Within a xenograft mouse model, CYD0618 suppresses the growth of TNBC tumors and extends animal survival. Using Western blot to probe for putative targets, we found CYD0618 reduces activation of STAT3, a transcription factor critically involved in proliferation, survival, and transformation of epithelial cells. Because STAT3 is constitutively active in ~70% of human cancers, there has been a tremendous effort to develop STAT3 targeting therapies; however, none has achieved FDA approval. In addition to STAT3, we show CYD0618 also suppresses other STAT transcription factors. Compared to selective STAT3 degradation by PROTAC treatment, poly-STAT targeting by CYD0618 exhibits superior activity against TNBC cells. Our study identifies CYD0618 as a novel poly-STAT inhibitor with promising activity against TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Oridonin,STAT,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

It has been discovered that sodium chlorite generates radicals in an acidic environment, and phosphatidylserine on the surface of tumor cells acts as a Lewis acid to generate radicals. HM-001, like other anticancer drugs and BCG, is intended to be injected into the bladder, retained, and then excreted. GLP studies using the same administration method has been completed, and no toxic changes have been observed in human trial doses. The efficacy of HM-001 against NMIBC was evaluated using an orthotopic transplantation model of UM-UC-3, a bladder cancer cell line. In the model, cells were transplanted into the bladder of SCID mouse after epithelial removal with trypsin, 600, 800, 1,600, and 3,200 ppm of HM-001 were administered once a week, and the weight of the excised bladder was calculated. After 4 weeks, the tumor weight was calculated and the tumor weight suppression rate in the control group was evaluated. As a result, the medicinal efficacy was confirmed at concentrations of 800ppm or higher. On the other hand, the UM-UC-3 model is a commonly used model, but it mimics CIS (carcinoma in situ) and can only partially mimic NMIBC. That is, other models are needed to evaluate efficacy for low- and high-grade NMIBC other than CIS. Therefore, we established high-grade and low-grade PDX and evaluated the effectiveness of HM-001 against low- and high-grade PDX through ex vivo testing. First, patient-derived tissue was transplanted into SCID mice, allowed to grow, and then removed. After extraction, they were cut into 2 mm3 pieces, exposed to HM-001 at 800, 1600, and 3200 ppm for 2 hours, and then transplanted into SCID mice. As a result of comparing the tumor size after transplantation with the control group, a dose-dependent tumor regression effect was confirmed in high-grade and low-grade PDX. NMIBC is divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories, with different treatment methods and drugs used for each. In particular, low-grade forms are restricted to low- and intermediate-risk groups. The results of this study show that HM-001 is effective not only for high-risk (including CIS) NMIBC but also for low- and intermediate-risk (low-grade) NMIBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Small molecule drugs,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Shinji Mima<sup>1<\/sup>, Monta Sakaki<sup>1<\/sup>, Noriaki Kiya<sup>1<\/sup>, Atsunari Kawashima<sup>2<\/sup>, Norio Nonomura<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Chihaya Kakinuma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>HOIST Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1a16a792-5b38-43f2-b94e-b84f7dd02e6a","ControlNumber":"816","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Our investigation focuses on BPP, a dual-functional inhibitor capable of inducing DNA cross-linking and suppressing angiogenesis. In a diverse panel of solid tumor and leukemic cells, BPP exhibited exceptional sensitivity against MLL-rearranged AML cell types. In MOLM13 and MV4-11 xenograft models, BPP showcased outstanding tumor suppression, with some tumors even achieving complete remission. In-house acute toxicity testing, BPP treated group showed excellent safety margin in both blood chemistry and pathological examination. Remarkably, BPP demonstrated significant cytotoxicity not only in FLT3-WT AML but also in FLT3-ITD AML. Delving into the mechanism, BPP was found to induce FLT3-ITD and MLL degradation by triggering DNA damage and ER stress. Comet assays revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of DNA fragments in MLL cells upon BPP exposure.The involvement of the KMT2A gene in chromosomal translocation in THP1 cells was highlighted, with BPP treatment resulting in a significant increase in Heat-shock protein. Notably, the combination of ganetespib, an FDA-approved HSP90 inhibitor, with BPP exhibited synergistic effects in both in vitro and in vivo models, inducing synthetic lethality and inhibiting HR repair. Furthermore, BPP not only reduced leukemic stem cells in colony formation assays but also demonstrated sensitivity in relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) and multiple drug-resistant patient samples. These findings collectively position BPP as a promising candidate for the treatment of MLL-rearranged AML, offering multifaceted therapeutic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Synthetic lethality,Small molecule drugs,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-L.

It is also the most aggressive and lethal. Standard of care therapy comprises maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT). There have only been five drugs and one device ever approved by the FDA for the treatment of GBM. The five-year survival rate for GBM patients has shown no notable improvement in the last three decades. We previously reported that the first-in-class imipridone small-molecule Dordaviprone (ONC201) decreases protein chaperone ClpX to unleash mitochondrial protease ClpP activity, integrated stress response and cell death. Preclinical combination of ONC201 (100 mg\/kg weekly) with radiotherapy and Temozolomide in a GBM mouse orthotopic model results in reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. The second generation imipridone ONC206 also activates integrated stress response and decreases ClpX in GBM cells but ONC206 is approximately 20 times more potent than its parent imipridone ONC201. ONC206 0.08 uM in combination with 12.5 uM TMZ and 2 Gy RT reduced the cell viability of GBM cells significantly compared to all single treatments and double treatments. During a short-term treatment of a GBM mouse orthotopic model, ONC206 (50 mg\/kg weekly, half of ONC201 doses) synergizes with TMZ and RT to induce more tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits more tumor cell proliferation compared to other groups with single or double treatments. There are two ongoing clinical trials with ONC206: single weekly or multiple-day weekly dose regimens of single-agent, oral ONC206 in patients with recurrent, primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms (NCT04541082) and ONC206 alone or in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with diffuse midline gliomas that is newly diagnosed or has come back (recurrent) or other recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors (NCT04732065). Future studies evaluating the role of immune function, mitochondrial metabolism, dopamine receptors, the ISR and TRAIL pathway in the synergistic effect would support further development of the triple combination regimen of ONC206, TMZ and radiation therapy for GBM clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,ONC206,Radiotherapy,Temozolomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Metastasis resulting from advanced breast cancer increases mortality in patients. MDA-MB-231 is triple-negative breast cancer that does not have any of the receptors that are commonly found in breast cancer. The lipopeptide toxin kalkitoxin thiol amide (KTA), generated from the marine cyanobacterium Moorena producens (formerly Lyngbya majuscule), has a wide range of biological and pharmacological effects. Its promise as a therapeutic agent for treating bone metastases from breast cancer is still uncertain. This study aimed to determine whether KTA could prevent breast cancer from metastasis to mice's bones and to elucidate any potential mechanisms causing this inhibition.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with pGL4.50 (Luc2\/CMV\/Hygro) vector using LipofectamineTM 2000. Positive clones of MDA-MB-231 cells were selected after treatment with 300 &#181;g\/ml hygromycin for one week. After cancer implantation to the heart, bioluminescent imaging of femurs was measured upto 5 weeks and signal intensity of KTA-treated groups was compared with the vehicle group.<br \/>Summary: KTA decreased breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. KTA prevented MDA-MB-231 cells from breast cancer metastasizing to the bone and brain via inhibiting MAPK and STAT signaling. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, which are responsible for distant metastasis, are highly opposed by KTA. Compared to mice in the control group, mice receiving KTA displayed considerably less bone and brain metastasis, a lower tumor burden, and less bone destruction in the murine breast cancer bone metastasis model.<br \/>Conclusion: KTA has new inhibitory effects on cancer cell invasion and migration both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. From these findings, KTA may have therapeutic promise for treating breast cancer patients with distant metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Cancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

As part of an alliance between Newcastle University, Astex Pharmaceuticals, and Cancer Research Horizons, we discovered ASTX295, a potent inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction that is currently under clinical investigation in patients with solid tumors (NCT03975387). We selected ASTX295 as a compound with a predicted short plasma half-life, which we hypothesised would help to mitigate the dose-limiting neutropenia and thrombocytopenia observed with earlier MDM2-p53 antagonists in clinical studies. To examine this hypothesis <i>in vitro<\/i>, we determined time- and concentration-dependent responses to ASTX295 treatment in healthy volunteer-derived human bone marrow cells, megakaryocytes, and in a panel of human tumor cell lines.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Samples containing bone marrow cells from healthy patients undergoing hip surgery were obtained under the ethical approval of the Newcastle Biobank (REC 12\/NE\/0395). Following Lymphoprep&#8482; separation, cells were treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with ASTX295 and seeded for Granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-forming assays in methylcellulose. Megakaryocytes were obtained from <i>in vitro<\/i> differentiation of CD34+ stem\/progenitor cells. Human tumor cell lines (including <i>MDM2<\/i>-amplified SJSA-1) were treated with ASTX295 <i>in vitro<\/i> and seeded at low density for colony-forming assays. Exposures of 6, 12, or 24h were examined, and the data plotted to calculate LC<sub>50<\/sub> values.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The clonogenic survival of tumor cells was time-dependent, with LC<sub>50<\/sub> values (mean &#177; SEM) in SJSA1 cells being 238 &#177; 46nM and 75 &#177; 7nM respectively (n = 3-4), following a 12h or 24h exposure to ASTX295. Time-dependent effects were also evident in five human bone marrow samples but with LC<sub>50 <\/sub>values of 1.9, &#62;3, &#62;10, &#62;10, and &#62;10uM being achieved at 12h, and 860 &#177; 268nM at 24h. Megakaryocytes showed similar time-dependent sensitivities in which daily treatment of 2 or 6h over three days did not induce apoptosis while significant cell death was observed when the treatment time was extended to 16-24h daily. In contrast, short, daily pulse treatment of 2-6h in cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13, SJSA-1) over three days was sufficient to induce cell death.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>ASTX295 is a potent antagonist of the MDM2-p53 interaction. Collectively, our <i>in vitro<\/i> data suggest that a shorter exposure to ASTX295 (up to 12h), may help to spare healthy bone marrow cells whilst killing tumor cells. Hence, intermittent exposure to an MDM2-p53 antagonist could favourably modulate its therapeutic index. The predicted short plasma half-life of ASTX295 should provide flexibility in controlling the duration of exposure <i>in vivo<\/i>, potentially enabling a more bone-marrow sparing approach to MDM2-p53 antagonism to be utilised.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,p53,Anticancer therapy,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Elaine Willmore<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Ahn<sup>2<\/sup>, Suzanne Kyle<sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Huw Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth  S.

The ISR controls protein synthesis and proteostasis. ISR main effector ATF4 transcriptional factor regulates the balance between survival and cell death. Under acute ISR, ATF4 promotes cell adaptation and survival. Sustained ISR leads to ATF4-mediated apoptosis. In many cancers, mutations or overexpression of oncogenes, results in enhanced cell proliferation and increased protein synthesis, which activate the ISR. Therefore, protein translation is reduced to maintain proteostasis. In other words, many cancers are primed by the ISR. Therefore, additional push by small molecule ISR-inducers will disrupt the balance and force cancer cells to enter apoptosis. Nelfinavir activates ATF4 through inhibition of eIF2&#945; specific phosphatases CReP and GADD34. PG3 upregulates ATF4 through the HRI\/eIF2&#945;\/ATF4 pathway. We hypothesize that combined treatment of PG3 and Nelfinavir will sustain upregulation of ATF4, and lead to ATF4-mediated cell apoptosis. Cell viability assays indicated that the combined treatment potently and synergistically inhibited cell viability in colorectal cancer cell lines HT29, SW480 and HCT116 p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D. The combined treatment sustained the induction of ATF4 and enhanced the expression of its proapoptotic target genes, CHOP and PUMA, and cell apoptosis. We confirmed that the enhanced induction of ATF4, CHOP and PUMA is through the ISR because ISRIB (ISR inhibitor) blocked the combined treatment-induced upregulation of ATF4, CHOP and PUMA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATF4,Integrated stress response,HRI,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Inositol-requiring enzyme 1&#945; (IRE1&#945;) is an ER membrane-resident kinase\/RNase that mediates signal transmission in the most evolutionarily conserved way of the UPR. The IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway, one of the most essential branches of the UPR, is activated in various types of cancer.<sup> <\/sup>When IRE1&#945; is activated, the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) is generated to activate the transcription of many pro-survival genes to prevent cellular death and relieve cellular stress. IRE1&#945; plays an instrumental pro-tumoral role in various cancers, such as glioblastoma, myeloma, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancers, as well as high IRE1&#945; activity is associated with poor prognoses. Moreover, IRE1-XBP1 plays an essential role in the UPR and ER stress responses, which have been implicated in the development of drug resistance. Thereby, blockade of the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 pathway is crucial as it is considered as a potential anti-cancer strategy. Here, we developed a potent and selective IRE1&#945; RNase inhibitor, which have a hydroxy-aryl-aldehydes (HAA) moiety that binds to IRE1&#945; within the RNase catalytic site. Our lead compound, HM100168, potently inhibited the RNase activity of human IRE1&#945; at nanomolar concentrations without affecting its kinase activity. Experiments were performed on MCF7 breast cancer cells to confirm the inhibitory effect in the mRNA and protein levels of XBP1s, which was increased by tunicamycin (TM), a ER stress inducer. HM100168 strongly inhibited &#8203;&#8203;XBP1s levels in a dose-dependent manner, displaying the potent IC<sub>50<\/sub> values. We tested cell growth inhibition activity in 3D as well as 2D cell culture condition of various cancer cell lines. Interestingly, HM100168 effectively inhibited cell proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines in both 2D and 3D culture condition. In addition, we explored the promising anti-cancer effects of HM100168 and its synergistic potential when combined with anti-tumorigenic agents. As a result, HM100168 in combination with anti-tumorigenic agents significantly enhanced suppression of tumor growth in human cancer cell transplanted mice. In conclusion, we have identified a novel compound with unique properties that specifically blocked the endonuclease activity of IRE1&#945;. HM100168 inhibited IRE1&#945; endonuclease activity, without affecting its kinase activity after endoplasmic reticulum stress <i>in vitro<\/i>. The identification of this novel IRE1&#945; inhibitor supports the hypothesis that the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 axis is a promising target for anticancer therapy. Also, co-targeting of IRE1&#945;-XBP1 in combination with anti-tumorigenic agents can be considered a novel approach to overcome cancer resistance. Further preclinical studies will be performed and reported soon after the establishment of a preclinical candidate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,IRE1, Inositol-requiring enzyme 1,solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

LXRs are overexpressed in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer, and targeting LXR with small molecule ligands has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer. Current small molecule LXR ligands were originally developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis and other metabolic diseases. To identify ligands specifically targeting cancer cells, we screened a focused library of drug-like molecules predicted to bind to LXR using molecular docking. In the screen, novel LXR ligand GAC0001E5 (1E5) exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. Functionally, 1E5 is an LXR inverse agonist which decreases LXR target gene expression and a &#8220;degrader&#8221; of LXR proteins following prolonged treatment. We posit that this novel ligand inhibits PDAC cells by downregulating the expression of LXR target genes. To test this hypothesis, we treated cancer cells with the previously described LXR inverse agonist SR9238 and examined its effect on cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, treatments with SR9238 had no effect on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation as compared to the novel ligand 1E5 and the 1E5 derivative KD-95, suggesting that LXR inverse agonism was insufficient to inhibit cell proliferation. To determine whether SR9238 has similar effects on LXR protein levels as novel ligands, we performed western analysis of protein expression following ligand treatment. In contrast to the novel ligands 1E5 and KD-95, treatments with SR9238 increased LXR protein levels. Furthermore, time-course studies in cycloheximide treated cells indicated that novel ligands decreased protein stability whereas SR9238 had the opposite effect. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation and autophagy abolished the effects of 1E5 and KD-95 in a cell line-dependent manner. Related to these observations, previously published data revealed that knockdown of LXR expression greatly diminished PDAC cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings indicate that LXR expression is essential in pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that the novel ligands may disrupt its involvement in protein-protein interactions and non-genomic mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Liver X Receptor,Protein stability,Pancreatic cancer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Knockdown or knockout of KIF18A has been shown to inhibit proliferation in cells with whole genome doubling or aneuploidy, cellular states characterized by chromosomal rearrangements. These alterations render cells particularly vulnerable to disrupted mitosis upon KIF18A loss. As such, KIF18A is a compelling target in a subset of tumors with chromosomal instability (CIN), which have ongoing chromosomal segregation defects. We have identified potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of KIF18A. A proprietary tool compound, ATX020, inhibits KIF18A ATPase activity with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 14.5 nM; KIF18A is selectively inhibited over other kinesins including CENPE (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#62; 10 &#181;M) and EG5 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 5.87 &#181;M). ATX020 exhibits robust cellular activity, with anti-proliferative activity observed in chromosomally instable ovarian cancer cell lines such as OVCAR-3 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 53.3 nM) and OVCAR-8 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.54 &#181;M). Upon treatment with ATX020, Annexin V is robustly induced in sensitive cell lines, demonstrating that KIF18A-dependent cell lines undergo apoptosis upon KIF18A inhibition. In KIF18Ai sensitive cells, a dose-dependent upregulation of phospho-Histone H3 and gamma-H2AX is observed upon ATX020 treatment in OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-8 cells, consistent with the induction of mitotic arrest and DNA damage. In contrast, CIN negative Ovarian cancer cells that are insensitive to KIF18A loss, such as A2780 and OVK18, proliferate normally upon ATX020 treatment, and Annexin V, phospho-Histone H3, and gamma-H2AX are not induced. In sensitive cell lines, ATX020 induces a dose-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2\/M, consistent with the role of KIF18A in facilitating mitosis. OVCAR-3 cells treated with ATX020 exhibit fragmented nuclei and malformed mitotic spindles, in contrast to A2780 cells where cell division is unaffected, suggesting that KIF18A is dispensable in CIN negative cells. This selective dependency is also observed <i>in vivo<\/i>, where administration of ATX020 leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in an OVCAR-3 cancer cell line-derived xenograft model, with significant tumor regression observed at 100 mpk\/day. In contrast, OVK18 tumors are unaffected by ATX020 administration, as expected based on the lack of cell cycle and proliferation effects in that cell line. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for KIF18A in facilitating mitosis in a subset of chromosomally instable cells. These effects are selective, with KIF18A-independent cell lines proceeding through the cell cycle normally in the presence of inhibitors. Small molecule inhibition of KIF18A is therefore expected to have robust efficacy in solid tumors with high levels of chromosomal instability such as Ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinesin,Chromosomal instability,Mitosis,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The wnt pathway is known to be sensitive to and amplified by CK2&#945; activity at multiple nodes and can be inhibited by loss of CK2&#945; function. The human genetics of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been well characterized and approximately 80% tumors are identified as being wnt pathway mutation driven. CRC tumors can be further stratified into consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), with iCMS2 representing 37% of CRC patients, being characterized by ongoing wnt pathway upregulation. Development of CK2&#945; inhibitors as a targeted therapy for CRC is therefore mechanistically well aligned to the wnt signaling drive and may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for this cancer. A novel small molecule binding site on CK2&#945; has been exploited to design and develop an inhibitor with K<sub>i <\/sub>of 95 pM and exquisite selectivity over the kinome. This inhibitor has been comprehensively characterized using <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacology studies. Cellular mechanism of action studies in CRC cell lines have quantified the potency of target engagement, inhibition of known CK2&#945; phospho-sites, inhibition of tumorigenic wnt pathway activity, and induction of apoptosis. This CK2&#945; inhibitor was also profiled in a high content screen of CRC patient-derived organoids established from various driver mutation backgrounds. Use of these <i>ex vivo<\/i> models has validated the potent cytotoxic activity of CK2&#945; inhibition in tumor samples with wnt-driven characteristics and highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of CK2&#945; inhibition in this setting. <i>In vivo<\/i> CRC xenograft studies have confirmed anti-tumor efficacy and developed the understanding of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic relationship between free plasma concentration of drug and inhibition of CK2&#945;-specific biomarker in the tumor.

KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> is the second most frequent RAS mutation in RAS-addicted cancers, including pancreatic cancer (34 %), colorectal cancer (21 %), and non-small cell lung cancer (19%). RMC-5127 is an orally bioavailable, mutant-selective tri-complex inhibitor of the GTP-bound (ON) form of RAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>. RMC-5127 non-covalently binds to an abundant intracellular chaperone protein cyclophilin A (CypA), resulting in a binary complex that engages RAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>(ON) to form a high-affinity tri-complex that sterically inhibits RAS binding to effectors. RMC-5127 drove deep suppression of RAS pathway activity, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in a panel of KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutant human cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> but only caused submaximal inhibition in the panel of K\/N\/HRAS wildtype cancer cells, indicative of selectivity for KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> over K\/N\/HRAS wildtype. Repeated oral dosing of RMC-5127 resulted in profound and durable anti-tumor activity in subcutaneous CDX and PDX models of KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> mutant NSCLC, PDAC, and CRC <i>in vivo<\/i>. Dose-dependent exposure of RMC-5127 was observed in the whole brain of na&#239;ve mice, indicating the compound is brain penetrant. An intracranial xenograft model of KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> tumors was established in immunodeficient mice to assess the CNS anti-tumor activity of RMC-5127. The intracranial tumor exposure of RMC-5127 was comparable with that observed in the whole brains of na&#239;ve mice and was sufficient to drive robust pharmacodynamic responses in the brain tumor. Moreover, RMC-5127 exhibited profound and durable anti-tumor activity in the intracranial model, with tumor regressions at well-tolerated doses. The anti-tumor activity of RMC-5127 in intracranial tumors was consistent with that in subcutaneous tumors at equivalent tumor exposures. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrate that RMC-5127 is a CNS-penetrant RAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor and support further study to determine the potential to benefit patients with advanced RAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>-mutated cancers, including those that have developed or are at risk of developing brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Ras,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

The activation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by its ligand SDF-1 leads to signaling by the AKT and mTOR pathways. CXCR4 is highly expressed in several types of cancer and contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a cytokine that often drives disease progression, as well as contributing to tumor immune evasion. NMX1 (NovoMedix) is a novel oral small molecule that inhibits mTOR signaling, CXCR4 expression, IL-11 secretion, and activates AMPK. In animal models of breast cancer, NMX1 effectively prevented tumor growth and metastasis, while also protecting from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of NMX1 in preclinical models of high-risk pediatric and adult malignancies.<br \/>Methods: Cell viability assays using alamar blue were performed in a panel of pediatric and adult cancer cells, including leukemia, brain, breast, lung, neuroblastoma, and sarcoma. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NMX1 ranging from 250 nM to 16 &#181;M for 96 hours, followed by determination of half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50<\/sub>). To validate target modulation, the level of IL-11 and CXCR4 was determined by ELISA and immunoblot, respectively. Protein kinase activity was assessed by phosphorylation levels. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by caspase-mediated PARP cleavage. To identify effective drug combinations, NMX1-treated cells were screened with a comprehensive drug library. Synergy was evaluated in the top candidates by dose-response matrices and SynergyFinder. Safety and tolerability was tested in animal models.<br \/>Results: NMX1 treatment induced cytotoxicity at micromolar concentrations in diverse types of cancer, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 0.2-8.7 &#181;M and 0.4-4.4 &#181;M for leukemia and solid tumor cells, respectively. NMX1 induced cancer cell death by PARP cleavage and apoptosis. Mechanistically, CXCR4 expression, mTOR signaling, and IL-11 secretion were decreased upon treatment with NMX1, validating effective target modulation. The drug combination screen identified several candidates in a tumor type-dependent manner. Synergistic effects were observed using NMX1 combined with clinically relevant concentrations of rucaparib, linsitinib, and crizotinib, which target PARP, IGFR, and c-MET, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study shows antitumor activity by NMX1 through inhibition of CXCR4, IL-11, and mTOR signaling, providing an effective therapeutic strategy for high-risk and refractory malignancies. Preclinical data on feasible drug combinations and biological correlates of activity support development of early phase clinical studies involving NMX1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CXCR4,mTOR,Novel anticancer agents,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Patrick Sipila<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Son Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Chunfen Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura  G.

Efforts in harnessing androgen and AR axis for castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment have led to discovery of several therapeutics, including AR antagonists and Cyp17 inhibitors. However, resistance to these approved therapeutics has emerged, and remained a significant unmet medical need. Among the prominent resistance mechanisms of action are restored androgen signaling via AR amplification and overexpression, and gain-of-function mutations occurring at AR ligand binding domain that can be agonized by existing AR antagonists and\/or non-androgenic steroids such as glucocorticoids. Targeting Cyp11A1 that catalyzes the formation of pregnenolone is effective to ablate biosynthesis of androgens and all steroids and thus holds promise to deliver coverage of a significant percentage of drug resistant AR mutations and benefit CRPC patients post treatment with AR antagonists or Cyp17 inhibitors. Here we present discovery and characterization of INV-9956, an orally available, selective, and potent Cyp11A1 inhibitor with well-acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. INV-9956 potently inhibits biosynthesis of pregnenolone and other androgens in H295R cells with IC50 at single-digit nanomolar, suppresses proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines harboring major clinically acquired drug resistant AR LBD mutations, such as AR L702H using coculture assays. Orally administered INV-9956 showed consistent dose dependent PK\/PD correlations across animal species. Particularly, INV-9956 displayed pronounced tumor inhibition superior to known competitors in a CRPC VCaP xenograft model and in a &#8220;humanized&#8221; animal model. Furthermore, INV-9956 displayed a good tox profile in 14-day repeated dosing rat and dog studies, supported by a high selectivity to Cyp11A1 over other Cyp family members, clean hERG and mini-Ames, and no significant off-target activity in a safety panel screen. The promising preclinical profiles of INV-9956 lend strong support to its potentials in addressing unmet needs in CRPC treatments and warrant clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Enzalutamide,Glucocorticoid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.
