[{"Abstract":"Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive bone and soft-tissue cancer, characterized by a hallmark fusion oncoprotein comprising the amino terminus of a FET gene and the carboxy terminus of an ETS gene, most commonly (85%), the EWSR1-FLI1 t (11,22) fusion.TK-216 is a first-in-class EWSR1-FLI1 inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials for EWS. Although TK-216 was designed to target the fusion protein interaction directly, it has demonstrated limited efficacy as a monotherapy. Thus, more effective TK-216 combination therapies are needed. We have used genome wide Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Knockout screening in EWS cells treated with TK-216 to identify novel synthetic lethality. We have identified 97 genes whose deletion potentially enhances the action of TK-216 in EWS cells. We have also identified several druggable targets, such as USP9X and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway as synthetic lethal interactions for TK-216. USP9X is known to deubiquitinate and stabilize the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. USP9X and EWS-FLI1 protein expression levels were found to be positively correlated in EWS clinical specimens. USP9X siRNA-mediated gene silencing reduced EWS cell viability. Most importantly, USP9X siRNA-mediated gene silencing sensitized EWS cells to TK-216 treatment. In addition, inhibition of USP9X with a small-molecule inhibitor WP1130, led to significant cell death in EWS alone and in combination with TK-216 with wide therapeutic indices. The molecular mechanism of synergy and <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy of the novel TK-216 combination will be determined in our study for future clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,EWS-FLI1,CRISPR\/Cas9,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a bone and soft-tissue sarcoma occurring in adolescence defined by a t(11;22)(q24;q12) balanced chromosomal translocation that results in chimeric transcription factor and oncogenic driver protein, EWS-FLI1. Independent studies and unbiased cell line screens have reported ES to be sensitive to DR5 targeting. INBRX-109 is a tetravalent, DR5-targeted antibody. Here, we analyzed the sensitivity of ES models to DR5 targeting by INBRX-109 and explored how the EWS-FLI1 transcriptional program impacts the continuum of sensitivity-resistance to this targeting.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: In a panel of 11 ES lines, in vitro sensitivity was assessed to both single agent and INBRX-109 combinations. A screen of 1,363 FDA approved compounds identified cooperative combinations that were prioritized mechanistically. Differential sensitivity for single agent and in combination with irinotecan was confirmed in vivo in xenograft models. Resistant clones were isolated from in vivo experiments and evaluated for DR5 expression and sensitivity. Cellular factors associated with sensitivity and resistance were determined by siRNA knockdown and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation assay (CUT and Tag).<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: ES models showed variable sensitivity to INBRX-109, with a GI90 as low as 10 picomolar in some models. All models showed robust expression of DR5, but absolute expression of DR5 did not correlate with sensitivity. In vitro sensitivity was replicated in vivo, with all 7 mice bearing RD-ES xenografts demonstrating initial complete tumor regression and 3 of 7 mice demonstrating no recurrence beyond 90 days. Importantly, cells isolated from recurrent tumors showed a novel mechanism of resistance: direct repression of DR5 by EWS-FLI1. INBRX-109 was ineffective as a single agent at 10 nM in resistant ES models. However, there was striking synergy in vitro with SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and this effect translated into tumor regressions of a resistant TC32 xenograft in vivo. The FDA compound screen captured novel synergy with a panel of agents.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: INBRX-109 is an exciting candidate for ES as a single agent in subsets of tumors or in combination with irinotecan, which is currently being evaluated in the clinic. Investigation of the exact relationship between EWS-FLI1 and sensitivity to DR5 targeting is ongoing. Initial findings suggest EWS-FLI1, combined with other disease modifying mutations, is a key mediator of this sensitivity. Further, EWS-FLI1 plays a direct role repressing DR5 in the setting of therapeutic challenge in one model in vivo. These findings highlight the potential for INBRX-109 in combination with irinotecan or novel candidates as therapies for ES patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Apoptosis,Death receptors,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

EWS-FLI1 acts as an aberrant transcription factor, inducing and silencing genes involved with increasing cell proliferation and survival. We have previously shown that lurbinectedin, a trabectedin analog, effectively inactivates the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1 by redistributing it within the nucleus to the nucleolus. Interestingly, this process activates a gene signature like that of the DNA damage response (DDR) to UV light, which was also shown to induce nucleolar translocation of WT Ewing sarcoma breakpoint 1 (EWSR1). However, the mechanism governing the nucleolar translocation of EWS-FLI1 induced by these drugs has yet to be elucidated. In addition, novel approaches to exploit this relocalization mechanism as a means to broaden the therapeutic window have yet to be established.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> We used immunoblotting, RT-qPCR, viability assays, cell fractionation, confocal microscopy, proximity ligation assays (PLA), mass spectrometry, genomics, and immunoprecipitation to investigate the mechanism of action of trabectedin\/lurbinectedin-induced nucleolar relocalization of EWS-FLI1.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> Through interrogation of the pathways triggered by trabectedin\/lurbinectedin, we found that this mechanism is in part mediated by HSP70. Viability assays also revealed profound synergy between HSP70 inhibitors (HSP70is) and lurbinectedin. Immunoprecipitated EWS-FLI1 subjected to mass spectrometry revealed an association of EWS-FLI1 and several HSP70 isoforms after trabectedin treatment which was confirmed with PLA. Trabectedin\/lurbinectedin treatment also revealed an upregulation of EWS-FLI1-suppressed targets and suppression of induced targets. Confocal microscopy showed that EWS-FLI1 &#8220;trapping&#8221; in the nucleolus was potentiated by combination treatment with HSP70is.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: Our results underscore the synergistic effect of combining HSP70is with trabectedin or lurbinectedin treatment to attenuate several aspects of ES tumorigenesis <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments with patient-derived xenografts are underway to corroborate the synergy of HSP70is and trabectedin\/lurbinectedin.

CAF-targeted CAR-T cell therapy cannot infiltrate ECM-rich tumors such as osteosarcoma.<br \/>Method: In this study, we used RNA sequencing to assess whether the recently invented membrane-anchored and tumor-targeted IL12-armed (attIL12) T cells, which bind cell-surface vimentin (CSV) on tumor cells, could destroy CAFs to disrupt the ECM. We established an <i>in vitro<\/i> model of the interaction between osteosarcoma CAFs and attIL12-T cells to uncover the underlying mechanism by which attIL12-T cells penetrate stroma-enriched osteosarcoma tumors.<br \/>Results: RNA sequencing demonstrated that attIL12-T cell treatment altered ECM-related gene expression. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed disruption or elimination of high-density CAFs and ECM in osteosarcoma xenograft tumors following attIL12-T cell treatment, and CAF\/ECM density was inversely correlated with T-cell infiltration. Other IL12-armed T cells, such as wild-type IL12- or tumor-targeted IL12-T cells, did not disrupt the ECM because this effect depended on the engagement between CSV on the tumor cell and its ligand on the attIL12-T cells. Mechanistic studies found that attIL12-T cell treatment elevated IFN&#947; production upon interacting with CSV<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells, suppressing TGF&#946; secretion and in turn upregulating FAS-mediated CAF apoptosis. CAF destruction reshaped the tumor stroma to favor T-cell infiltration and tumor inhibition.<br \/>Conclusions: This study unveiled a novel therapy&#8212;attIL12-T cells&#8212;for targeting CAFs\/ECM. These findings are highly relevant to humans because CAFs are abundant in human osteosarcoma. <b>What is already known on this topic: <\/b>As the major source of ECM factors in tumors, the FAP<sup>+<\/sup>&#945;SMA<sup>+<\/sup> subtype of CAFs within tumors induce production of ECM factors, preventing antitumor T cells from accessing the core regions of tumors. <b>What this study adds: <\/b>Our group demonstrated that attIL12-T cell transfer (US Patent: 11421010) induced T-cell infiltration into and eliminated large osteosarcoma PDX tumors. Comparison of gene expression in sensitive or resistant PDX models to attIL12-T cell therapy elucidated the ECM-targeting mechanism of attIL12-T cells. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> system further determined that the CSV-attIL12 interaction mediated IFN&#947; upregulation, which triggered FAS induction in CAFs to induce CAF apoptosis. In sum, attIL12-T cell treatment shifts tumor stroma from a TGF&#946;-dependent CAF-promoting phenotype to an IFN&#947;-induced immune-inflamed phenotype.<b><\/b> <b>How this study might affect research, practice or policy: <\/b>attIL12-T cell transfer is a novel anti-ECM strategy that renders ECM-rich tumors more susceptible to T cell-mediated tumor killing.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Extracellular matrix,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The antitumor activity of this CADM1 ADC was validated in vivo in 8 osteosarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). CADM1 is also highly expressed in other pediatric solid malignancies such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor. The CADM1 ADC was tested in vitro in neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor models.

For decades, the long-term survival for patients with recurrences and metastases remains ~30%. There&#8217;s an urgent need for new prognostic marker and therapeutic options. ZFP36L2, a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of CCCH zinc finger proteins, stands out for its pivotal role in post transcriptional modifications and modify tumor microenvironment (TME). Notably, ZFP36L2 contributes to the recruitment of macrophages, specifically the M1 subtype, which are known for their ability to secrete IL1&#946; and exhibit anti-tumor functions. Our study reveals that, ZFP36L2 can be used as a predictor of prognosis in OS patients with enriched IL1B expression. This study aims to elucidate the interaction between ZFP36L2 and IL1B in modification of TME and shed light on its potential of prognosis prediction and therapeutic in IL1&#946; positive OS patients.<br \/>Methods: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of ZFP36L2 expression across TCGA cohorts. Then, we performed IHC staining to confirm the evaluated expression of ZFP36L2 in cancerous tissues. Immune infiltration analysis, including QUANTISEQ, TIMER, and CIBERSORT, was conducted. KM plot was employed to analyze the prognosis of OS patients. Finally, qPCR and western blot were used to validate transcriptional and translational changes of key molecules across OS cell lines.<br \/>Results: Our findings demonstrate that ZFP36L2 exhibits specific expression across various cancer types, with a notable elevation in sarcoma tissues, as confirmed by IHC. Importantly, this high expression of ZFP36L2 in sarcoma tissues is correlated with metastasis. We found ZFP36L2 significantly correlates with tumor metastasis but failed in patient overall survival. Immunoinfiltration analysis indicates a significant correlation between ZFP36L2 and macrophages, as well as T cells, suggesting a role in the TME. Prognostic analysis reveals that ZFP36L2 can serve as a predictive marker for IL1&#946; positive patients. The wetlab experiments demonstrated that ZFP36L2 leads to IRGM mRNA degradation, ultimately affecting IL1&#946;<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages.<br \/>Conclusion: This study delineates the tumor-specific elevated expression of ZFP36L2 and its potential as a prognostic marker in IL1&#946;<sup>+<\/sup> OS patients. We hypothesize that ZFP36L2 affects IL1&#946;<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages through IRGM degradation. Besides, IRGM also has an impact on cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, the ZFP36L2-IRGM axis plays an important role in remodeling OS TME. These results indicated ZFP36L2, not only serves as a marker, but also can be a therapeutic target in IL1&#946; enriched patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Therapeutic target,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

To address this inadequacy, we leverage oncolytic herpes simplex virotherapy as a double-edged attack against tumors through 1) tumor cell-specific lysis and 2) antitumor immune stimulation. However, previous trials of oncolytic herpes simplex virotherapy in pediatric sarcomas displayed limited responses, likely due to the observed presence of immunosuppressive monocytes and macrophages. To improve efficacy, we combined oncolytic herpes simplex virotherapy with trabectedin, an FDA-approved DNA-binding agent known to disrupt gene expression and deplete monocytes and macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that the efficacy of this combination far surpassed our predictions, inducing complete and partial regressions in multiple models of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. To explore potential mechanisms driving this high degree of synergy, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on tumors of mice treated with monotherapy or combination therapy. Interestingly, trabectedin synergized with the oncolytic virotherapy through two unexpected mechanisms. Our analysis revealed that trabectedin increased intratumoral oncolytic virus spread by disrupting expression of the intrinsic antiviral response in human Ewing sarcoma cells. Additionally, trabectedin not only reduced immunosuppressive macrophages but also stimulated cytotoxic granzyme expression in infiltrating T and NK cells in immunocompetent osteosarcoma models. These effector NK and T cells were necessary for the regressions of osteosarcoma allografts treated with trabectedin and oncolytic virotherapy. Thus, trabectedin enhanced both the oncolytic effect of herpes simplex virotherapy and the effector function of cytotoxic lymphocytes that become activated in response to the virus. The combination of trabectedin and oncolytic herpes simplex virotherapy offers the potential to unite these mechanisms against bone tumors to achieve better outcomes for children.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Drug synergy,Immuno-oncology,Bone sarcomas,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Two childhood cancers with HER3 expression are rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and hepatoblastoma (HB), and the goal of this work was to evaluate the activity of HER3-DXd against PDX models for these cancer types.<br \/>Methods: IHC testing was conducted on FFPE tissue (slides or TMA) using HER3\/ErbB3 (D22C5) XP rabbit mAB and membrane expression was determined. HB models were evaluated using HER3-DXd and control IgG ADC (C-ADC) with a DXd payload, both at 10 mg\/kg weekly x 3. RMS models were evaluated using HER3-DXd and C-ADC at 3 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg administered weekly x 3. Activity was assessed by the PIVOT objective response measure (ORM) targeting partial, complete, or maintained complete responses (PR, CR, and MCR) as compared to stable disease (SD) or progressive disease, with or without growth delay (PD2 and PD1, respectively).<br \/>Results: For 11 HB models, HER3 expression was 0 (n=2), 1+ (n=5), 2+ (n=1), and 3+ (n=3). For 8 RMS models, median IHC scores were 0 (n=1), 1+ (n=5), and 2+ (n=2). HER3-DXd activity by ORM is shown in the table. Three of 4 HB models treated with HER3-DXd showed MCR, while one had PD. The 3 HB models with MCR responses to HER3-DXd showed lesser responses to C-ADC. HER3-DXd was highly active against RMS models at 3 and 10 mg\/kg with most models having MCR. C-ADC was also highly active against RMS models at both dose levels. At 10 mg\/kg HER3-DXd, 2 of 4 HB models and 3 of 6 evaluable RMS models had time to event &#62; 100 days.<br \/>Conclusions: Many HB and RMS models show HER3 expression by IHC. HER3-DXd is highly active against both HB and RMS models. The high activity of C-ADC for RMS models suggests exquisite sensitivity of RMS models to the DXd payload<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{24121A8A-5E2A-417A-8B13-28CE536BF6C8}\"><caption>Treatment response categories to treatment of pediatric PDX models with HER3-Dxd<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MCR<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HB (HER3-Dxd, 10 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HB (C-ADC, 10 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RMS (HER3-Dxd, 3 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RMS (C-ADC, 3 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RMS (HER-Dxd, 10 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RMS (C-ADC, 10 mg\/kg)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Pediatric cancers,Preclinical testing,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) is the dominant oncogenic driver of fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) with no current targeted therapy. We developed methods to directly measure endogenous P3F protein levels amenable to high-throughput drug screens.<br \/>Method: HiBiT tag, an 11 amino acid peptide of NanoLuc luciferase, was inserted into the endogenous P3F using CRISPR in FP-RMS cell lines RH4 and SCMC. Western blot was used for HiBiT tag validation. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were used to assess transcriptomics and DNA binding of HiBiT-tagged P3F (P3F-HiBiT). High-throughput drug screen using Nano-Glo luciferase assay was performed using the Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE 5.0) drug library, a 2,480 drug library with known mechanisms of action. CellTiter-Glo was used to monitor cell viability. Mouse xenograft models of FP-RMS were used to investigate in vivo efficacy.<br \/>Results: We validated HiBiT tagging of P3F by Western. Both P3F-HiBiT and unmodified P3F activated the same gene sets in fibroblasts by RNA-seq Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). ChIP-seq using HiBiT antibody for P3F-HiBiT matched the genomic locations from ChIP-seq with P3F antibody in RH4 and SCMC. Using a cutoff value of &#62; 90 (Area Under the Curve (AUC) of CellTiter-Glo minus AUC of Nano-Glo), in both RH4 and SCMC, we identified 182 compounds which downregulate P3F before cell death. Filtering for drugs with &#8805; 3 hits for the same target identified 14 drug classes that suppressed P3F including HDAC inhibitors (3), BRD4 inhibitors (3), and CDK inhibitors (8). FP-RMS was sensitive to CDK1\/2, CDK4\/6, CDK9, and multi-CDK inhibitors. A multi-CDK inhibitor TG02, currently in human trials, downregulated P3F and RNA-seq GSEA showed marked suppression of P3F targets. TG02 also significantly delayed tumor progression in mouse xenograft model of FP-RMS without weight loss. Interestingly, the commonly used chemotherapeutic Vincristine (VCR) also downregulated P3F in vitro. TG02 with VCR showed synergy by Loewe analysis. In vivo, testing showed significant delay in tumor progression by the combination compared to TG02 or VCR alone. Of note, tumor RNA-seq GSEA following treatment with TG02, or VCR alone, and in combination significantly downregulated P3F targets.<br \/>Conclusion And Future Directions: By HiBiT tagging the fusion oncogene P3F, we identified 182 drugs that suppress P3F levels of which TG02 was a top hit. TG02 showed in vivo efficacy indicating that FP-RMS is susceptible to CDK inhibition. We also found synergy between TG02 and VCR, resulting in a significant delay in FP-RMS tumor progression compared to single agents. Interestingly, we found that VCR alone can downregulate P3F and its targets. Combination therapy of TG02 with VCR shows promise for clinical translation in FP-RMS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,CDK inhibitor,Combination therapy,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Surface proteins were scored by IMMUNOTAR, our custom pipeline which extracts and integrates quantitative features from diverse proteogenomic and annotation datasets to provide a score for each protein, using mean-average-precision for score optimization. Cell surface expression of IMMUNOTAR-prioritized proteins was validated using flow cytometry, focusing on targets with immunotherapies in development. CAR T cells targeting the lead protein were engineered and studied in RMS preclinical models.<br \/>Results: A total of 847 and 882 high confidence cell surface proteins were detected in FP and FN RMS surfaceome, respectively, with 94% of proteins overlapping the phenotypes. IMMUNOTAR ranked anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a putative immunotherapeutic target in FP RMS, as the top FP target. Glypican 2 (GPC2), a differentially expressed cell surface proteoglycan identified in neuroblastoma and other neural-derived tumors, targetable with CAR T cells and antibody-drug conjugates [Bosse et al. Cancer Cell 2017], ranked as the top protein in FN and 5th protein in FP RMS. Overall, GPC2 was abundantly expressed in 16 of 21 RMS models profiled. Flow cytometry revealed expression of GPC2 comparable to neuroblastoma in 5 of 8 RMS cells lines. Additionally, both FP and FN GPC2+ RMS cell lines (FN: RH36, SMS-CTR; FP: RH41, RH30) activated GPC2 CAR T cells with either a CD28 or a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, inducing release of IFN-gamma and IL-2 upon co-incubation across different E:T ratios as quantified by ELISA. Further, GPC2 CAR T cells induced potent RMS cell cytotoxicity compared to control CD19 CAR T cells with near 100% specific cytotoxicity at 1:1 E:T ratio. In a pilot study, GPC2 CAR T cells with 4-1BB costimulatory domains induced significant tumor regression (p=0.03) and prolonged progression-free survival (p=0.01) compared to CD19 CAR T cells in an established murine RH41 flank xenograft model.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, we probed the RMS surfaceome using MS and identified candidate proteins amenable for immunotherapeutic targeting using our IMMUNOTAR algorithm. We validated GPC2 as a candidate target in FP and FN RMS and are corroborating our findings in additional pre-clinical RMS models. Demonstration of GPC2 CAR efficacy in these models could lead to inclusion of RMS in our ongoing phase 1 clinical trial (NCT05650749) in a planned expansion phase.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Pediatric cancers,Bioinformatics,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Antigen loss or modulation on tumor cells commonly leads to tumor escape across diverse cancer types after CAR T therapy targeting different antigens. We hypothesize that simultaneously targeting two RMS antigens with a bispecific CAR T will reduce the likelihood of tumor escape. The integrin alpha<sub>v<\/sub>beta<sub>3<\/sub> (&#945;v&#946;3) plays a role in cancer progression, metastasis and neovascularization in several malignancies. HER2 also contributes to cancer progression and metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Control of intramuscular RMS tumors by &#945;v&#946;3 or HER2 CAR Ts was assessed in NSG mice, with non-specific CD19 CAR Ts as controls. Tumor burden was assessed weekly by bioluminescence imaging. Persistence and phenotype of CAR Ts were evaluated by flow cytometry. CAR T cell infiltration, tumor antigen expression and residual disease were determined by immunohistochemistry.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Six of six pediatric patient-derived RMS cell lines express &#945;v&#946;3 and\/or HER2. &#945;v&#946;3 and HER2 CAR Ts kill RMS cells <i>in vitro <\/i>at low effector-to-target ratios. &#945;v&#946;3 and HER2 CAR Ts independently control&#8212;and nearly eliminate&#8212;orthotopic RMS tumors. Fewer HER2 CAR Ts (5x10<sup>6<\/sup>) are needed to control tumors than &#945;v&#946;3 CAR Ts (10x10<sup>6<\/sup>), but this is not due to lack of persistence or exhaustion of &#945;v&#946;3 CAR Ts. Tumor control by &#945;v&#946;3 CAR Ts is delayed (&#62;21 days) compared to that by HER2 CAR Ts (7 days), and is robust, despite initial tumor progression following treatment. Importantly, despite strong tumor control by both CAR Ts, at 7 weeks post-treatment residual tumor nests are evident by histology. At this time, CAR Ts are still abundant, are not exhausted and express memory markers, suggesting that the remaining tumor cells are no longer susceptible to CAR T killing. We are currently evaluating the hypothesis that the remaining tumor cells have down-regulated antigen expression. Delayed tumor control by &#945;v&#946;3 CAR Ts was ameliorated by engineering &#945;v&#946;3 overexpression in RMS tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>&#945;v&#946;3 and HER2 CAR Ts control orthotopic RMS tumors by distinct mechanisms with changes in &#945;v&#946;3 antigen expression, likely due to tumor progression, one prevalent factor. This is consistent with our prior reports of &#945;v&#946;3 CAR Ts preventing breast cancer metastases, which naturally upregulate &#945;v&#946;3 compared to the primary tumor. Despite near elimination of tumors, residual nests of tumor cells are likely to rebound as CAR T resistant tumors, similar to what is seen in patients treated with monospecific CAR Ts.

While the incidence of RMS is ~4.5 patients per million individuals aged &#60;20 years, 5-year survival for high-risk children is &#60;30%, and &#60;8% when metastatic. The <i>PAX3::FOXO1 (P3F)<\/i> fusion gene, resulting from <i>t<\/i>(2:13), is the most prominent fusion oncogene that drives FP-RMS. P3F is a fusion transcription factor and supports FP-RMS by keeping it in a persistent myoblastic state. We found P3F functions in part by suppressing MST kinase activity in the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, a developmental pathway involved in cell fate and organ size. To investigate how this may rewire gene expression to support FP-RMS, we performed ATAC-seq analysis of a myoblast-based model of FP-RMS in which MST was further inhibited and found the <i>RUNX2<\/i> gene locus was more accessible. Since RUNX2 is a pioneer transcription factor known to interact with the &#8220;WW&#8221; domains of Hippo pathway members to support mesenchymal cell fate, we hypothesize that RUNX2 maintains these relationships to support FP-RMS cell state and survival.<br \/><b>Methods &#38; Results:<\/b> Inquiry of in silico databases and previously published literature unveiled that sarcomas including RMS have a high dependency on RUNX2 and that P3F directly binds a RUNX2 enhancer. Interrogation of a proximity labeling proteomics study from our collaborators in the Counter lab found that RUNX2 was part of the protein interactome of 7\/7 FP-RMS fusions including P3F. Additionally, Co-IP experiments confirmed that there is a direct protein-protein relationship between RUNX2, P3F, and TAZ. Next, we performed <i>in vitro<\/i> genetic loss of function (LOF) of RUNX2 using RNAi, which showed that suppression of RUNX2 caused cell death, growth inhibition, increased TAZ expression, and induction of both myogenic and osteogenic markers. We also performed complementary pharmacologic LOF using two available small molecules, AI-14-91 (Bushweller lab) <i>in vitro, <\/i>and CADD522 (commercially available) <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We found that these partially phenocopied the genetic LOF and that CADD522 reduces tumor volume and growth.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>RUNX2 is a vulnerability in RMS based on <i>in silico<\/i>, <i>in vitro, <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation, and may act to prevent osteogenic and myogenic differentiation via protein-protein relationships in the Hippo pathway. The next step will be assessing mechanistic relationships between the Hippo pathway and RUNX2, as well as the genome wide changes upon RUNX2 LOF by performing ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and scRNA-seq experiments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,RNAi,Pediatric cancers,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

It is commonly divided into subtypes based on histopathological appearance. The oncogenic fusion proteins PAX3::FOXO1 or PAX7::FOXO1 are present in the alveolar subtype of RMS (ARMS). These chimeric proteins are formed by reciprocal chromosomal translocations and consist of an N-terminal portion of the PAX3 or PAX7 transcription factor fused to a C-terminal portion of the FOXO1 transcription factor. These fusion proteins have been shown to drive malignant transformation in ARMS, and patients with fusion-positive ARMS have a worse prognosis than patients with fusion-negative ARMS and embryonal RMS. We recently reported that piperacetazine, a phenothiazine derivative and first-generation antipsychotic, is capable of binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional activity of PAX3::FOXO1, reducing the expression of PAX3::FOXO1 target genes, and inhibiting the ability of fusion-positive RMS cells to grow in soft agar. We hypothesize that other phenothiazine derivatives may have stronger binding affinity for PAX3::FOXO1 and greater ability to reduce tumor growth in vivo. We employed a structure-activity relationship campaign to develop new phenothiazine derivatives that may be more potent inhibitors of PAX3::FOXO1 than piperacetazine. We synthesized and tested 10 new compounds, in addition to 9 existing FDA-approved phenothiazine derivatives, for their ability to bind to PAX3::FOXO1 and inhibit its transcriptional activity and target gene expression as well as inhibiting the growth of fusion-positive RMS cells in 3D culture. Seven derivatives inhibited PAX3::FOXO1 reporter activity better than piperacetazine, nine of them performed worse, and three of them showed comparable activity to piperacetazine. We demonstrated that piperacetazine does not alter PAX3::FOXO1 levels, subcellular localization, binding to a PAX3::FOXO1 target DNA sequence, or phosphorylation at Ser256 in the FOXO1 portion of the fusion protein. We therefore hypothesize that piperacetazine may be disrupting interactions between PAX3::FOXO1 and its partner proteins. We are employing a proximity-based biotinylation method to identify proteins that are competed away from PAX3::FOXO1 by piperacetazine. Our data suggest that it is possible to target PAX3::FOXO1 protein using small molecules that can directly bind to it and inhibit its activity in fusion-positive RMS cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Childhood cancer drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Fusion proteins,Pediatric cancers,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Cas13 function was validated with a mCherry knockdown proof-of-concept expression in the ARMS cell lines Rh5 and Rh30. 90-95% knockdown efficiency was seen over three independent experiments. Ten P3F1 breakpoint targeting guides were designed and screened first in a HEK293T P3F1 overexpression model to select optimal high efficiency targeting guides. The highest efficiency targeting guide showed a GFP reduction of 70% in three independent experiments. High-efficiency Cas13 guides were taken forward into Rh5 cells to knockdown endogenous P3F1 expression which were validated by western blotting and RT-PCR. Western blots of Cas13 sorted Rh5 cells showed that guide 1150 was able to knockdown P3F1 protein expression by ~70%.<br \/>Discussion\/Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the high efficiency and specificity of the Cas13 system to silence P3F1, and other oncogenic fusion drivers.

Despite being prevalent, patients with metastatic or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma still experience poor outcomes, underscoring the necessity for novel treatments. We have recently shown that PROX1 is a critical factor in RMS tumor growth and myogenic characteristics (Gizaw NY, et al. PNAS 2022). As PROX1 has previously been associated with tumor metabolism in colorectal cancer, we investigated further its role in RMS metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that PROX1 plays a crucial role in regulating RMS cell metabolism. Specifically, silencing of PROX1 resulted in decreased lipid and oxidative metabolism, which was accompanied by an increase in glycolysis and triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed downregulation of all genes involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway in PROX1-silenced RMS cells. Our studies further reveal that inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, akin to PROX1 silencing, can effectively inhibit RMS cell growth. Our results provide novel insights into the role of PROX1 in RMS metabolism and highlight the potential of PROX1-regulated metabolic pathways as promising targets for the development of novel RMS therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Metabolism,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Immunotherapy advances with adoptive cell therapy in hematologic malignancies have not yet translated to pediatric solid tumors including sarcomas. Hallmarks of the immune microenvironment in pediatric sarcomas include the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune cells and a lack of potent T cell activation. We are seeking ways to overcome these barriers to effective adoptive cell therapy in pediatric sarcoma. We are exploring introduction of a novel synthetic co-receptor, CD8a:MyD88, that can augment tumor-specific T cell effector function and potentially improve outcomes in murine models of sarcoma. Tumor-antigen specific T cells or tumor-infiltrating T cell populations are transduced ex vivo to express the CD8a:MyD88 synthetic co-receptor resulting in MyD88 signaling when T cells encounter their cognate MHC I\/epitope complex. We have studied the effects of CD8a:MyD88 expression on cytokine production and lytic activity against murine sarcoma cell lines in vitro. Initial experiments utilized the OT1 T cell model (specific to the model antigen chicken ovalbumin) which we introduced into our murine sarcoma cell lines (KPSarc pleomorphic sarcoma and M3-9M rhabdomyosarcoma). Using GFP as a marker of T cell transduction, the production of effector cytokine interferon gamma was measured following T cell activation compared with GFP-negative non-transduced T cells. CD8a:MyD88 expressing T cells expressed higher levels of interferon gamma at basal levels and following antigen-specific activation when co-cultured with Ova-expressing sarcoma cells. Improved tumor-specific lytic function in CD8a:MyD88 expressing T cells was also observed in co-culture experiments compared to untransduced or control vector- transduced T cells. We further hypothesized that skewing T cell differentiation toward an effector phenotype with the addition of interleukin-12 during T cell expansion would increase the anti-tumor effect of the CD8a:MyD88 expressing T cells. Co-culture with our murine sarcoma cell lines showed increased tumor-lytic function in T cells primed with IL-12. We have ongoing experiments studying the in vivo effects of the CD8a:MyD88 expressing T cells in model antigen-expressing murine sarcoma models. In addition, the ability of the CD8a:MyD88 co-receptor to augment the effector function of polyclonal sarcoma infiltrating T cells is being explored. These results will further define the obstacles and potential solutions to successful adoptive T cell therapy for pediatric sarcomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immunotherapeutic approaches to pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Immunotherapy,Adoptive cell therapy,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Fusion-Negative RMS (FN-RMS) accounts for more than 80% of all RMS cases. The long-term event-free survival rate for patients with high grade FN-RMS is below 30%, highlighting the need for improved therapeutic strategies. CD73 is a 5&#8217; ectonucleotidase that hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine and regulates the purinergic signaling pathway. We found that CD73 is elevated in FN-RMS tumors that express high levels of TWIST2. While high expression of CD73 contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers, its role in FN-RMS has not been investigated. We found that CD73 knockdown decreased FN-RMS cell growth while upregulating the myogenic differentiation program. Moreover, mutation of the catalytic residues of CD73 rendered the protein enzymatically inactive and abolished its ability to stimulate FN-RMS growth. Overexpression of wildtype CD73, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, in CD73 knockdown FN-RMS cells, restored their growth capacity. Likewise, treatment with an adenosine receptor A<sub>2A-B <\/sub>agonist partially rescued FN-RMS cell proliferation and bypassed the CD73 knockdown defective growth phenotype. These results demonstrate that the catalytic activity of CD73 contributes to the pathogenic growth of FN-RMS through the activation of the purinergic signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting CD73 and the purinergic signaling pathway represents a potential therapeutic approach for FN-RMS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD73,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

It disproportionately affects children, adolescents and young adults with tumors emerging in muscles, tendons, nerve tissue and joints. Current treatment involves radiation and radical surgery including limb amputation with overall survival around 50% highlighting the urgent need to develop targeted therapies for these patients. In this study, we hypothesized that the fusion SS18-SSX protein found in SySa transcriptionally rewires the tumor cells creating a dependence on specific genes that if uncovered can be exploited therapeutically. To study genes that are selectively essential to SySa, we analyzed the dependency maps (DepMap) whole genome RNAi and CRISPR screening datasets consisting of ~1750 human cancer cell lines including 9 SySa cell lines. We identified 368 target genes that specifically impact the proliferation of SySa when compared to other tumor cell lines. To interrogate these genes systematically, we designed pooled CRISPR libraries and conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as <i>in vivo<\/i> screens in SySa cell line HS-SY-II. Our screens revealed that Small Ubiquitin like-modifier 2 (SUMO2) was one of the most significant dependencies in both the <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as <i>in vivo<\/i> screens. We tested the SUMO2 inhibitor, TAK-981, a clinical stage small molecule inhibitor specific for E1 SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE), against a panel of SySa cell lines with HS-SY-II and SYO1 showing an EC<sub>50<\/sub> in the low nanomolar range. Furthermore, TAK-981 treatment potently induced apoptosis and reduced the proportion of cycling cells in both HS-SY-II as well as SYO1 cell lines. Strikingly, transcriptomic studies on HS-SY-II and SYO1 cell lines showed that TAK-981 treatment substantially altered the oncogenic signatures of SySa. This was evident both in the HS-SY-II cell line expressing the SS18-SSX1 fusion as well as the SYO1 cell line expressing the SS18-SSX2 fusion protein. These data strongly indicate that SUMO2 is critical for the transcriptional activity of the different SS18-SSX chimeric oncoproteins. In addition, TAK-981 treatment showed a highly significant downregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression as well as a modulation of genes of the BAF and PRC1\/PRC2 complexes that have been implicated in SySa pathogenesis. Taken together, we developed an integrated computational and experimental screening approach to prioritize and validate selective dependencies in synovial sarcoma. Our studies identify SUMO2 as a novel, selective vulnerability in this cancer and since SUMO2 inhibitors are currently in Phase 1\/2 clinical trials for other malignancies, our findings present a novel potential avenue for targeted treatment of synovial sarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adolescent and young adult oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,SWI\/SNF,Sumoylation,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Patients with metastatic MTC treated with RET inhibitors (RETi) can develop resistance through mechanisms currently being investigated. We aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to RETi and develop novel combination therapies to circumvent resistance to these drugs. We used TT, an MTC cell line, to develop vandetanib-resistant (VanR) lines, at two independent sites, the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) at the NCI. We applied a multiomic approach to investigate the mechanisms of resistance, including Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multiplex interphase Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (miFISH) to study the karyotype, ploidy, and heterogeneity at a single-cell level. Whole exome and RNA-sequencing was done to identify genetic alterations such as acquired mutations, copy number variations, and gene expression changes. In parallel, we performed genome-wide CRISPR gene knockout (KO) in TT cells treated with selpercatinib or vehicle to develop potential synergistic targeted combination therapy with RETi. Additionally, we performed a cytotoxicity screening using the Mechanism Interrogation Plate (MIPE6.0) library containing 2803 investigational drugs, novel agents, and FDA-approved drugs with known mechanisms of action. SKY and miFISH results showed that, for the parental TT_POB cell line, there were 4 copies of chromosome 10 (location of the <i>RET<\/i> gene), whereas there were 3 copies in TT_POB VanR. This was associated with an increase in the <i>RET<\/i> variant allele frequency, indicating a loss of heterozygosity of the wildtype allele as a mechanism of resistance, which was confirmed by whole exome sequencing. For TT_MCW VanR, we identified a new <i>RET<\/i> solvent front (G810S), as well as an increased copy number of <i>RET<\/i> with an increase in expression. CRISPR KO demonstrated that the knockout of NF1 led to resistance and survival to selpercatinib treatment. The MIPE6.0 screening confirmed resistance to RETi in TT_MCW VanR and sensitivity to multiple MEK inhibitors. <i>In vivo<\/i> testing in a xenograft mouse model confirmed the synergistic\/additive activity of combined selpercatinib with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. In conclusion, using a multiomic approach, we show that resistance to RETi occurs by an adaptive increase in RET signaling through secondary mutations in <i>RET<\/i>, and an increase in expression or dose of the mutant <i>RET<\/i> allele. These genetic events are associated with an activation of RAS signaling, in VanR cell lines, through the ERK\/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of RET and ERK\/MAPK inhibition is synergistic against <i>RET<\/i>-mutant MTC.

It's a sporadic malignancy that is often overly aggressive. The current treatment consists of chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy in young patients has disastrous and long-term side effects such as ototoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and infertility. Thus, alternative strategies are needed. One hint is to target the most common mutations in HB. It has been demonstrated that 90% of HB tumors are mutated for the Wnt pathway effector &#223;-catenin. This mutation leads to an aberrant constitutive activation of Wnt\/&#223;-catenin signaling. Here, we investigate one of &#223;-catenin transcriptional targets, Fascin-1 that is found up-regulated in many tumors. Fascin1 affects actin organization into bundles, and this leads to cell migration and invasion. Whereas Fascin-1 is absent from normal hepatocytes, we found its expression associated to the poor prognosis C2 subtype of HB. In both human and murine HB samples, Fascin-1 is associated to undifferentiated tumor cells. We further demonstrated that Fascin-1 expression modulates tumor hepatocyte differentiation status through gene expression. In this study, we investigate how Fascin-1 can regulate tumor cell plasticity and whether Fascin-1 is a druggable target in HB tumors.<br \/>Methods: We use two classical HB model cells Huh6 and HepG2 and 3 Patient-Derived-Xenograft cell lines. We explore the effect of Fascin-1 actin-bundling activity impairment by using inhibitors, on invasion and migration using Trans-well and wound-healing assays. We follow proliferation and cell death by Flow cytometry and investigate gene expression by PCR and reporter assay. We investigate Fascin modulation of the kinome with PamGene technology.<br \/>Results: We show that the inhibition of Fascin actin-binding activity decreases cell invasion and migration as well as proliferation. We show an increase of cell death in Huh6\/HepG2 cells but not in the PDX models. A cell cycle arrest is induced, and the cells become senescent. Differentiation genes are overexpressed and EMT genes are repressed. Yap expression is downregulated; Yap promoter activity is downregulated, and Yap is found translocated into the cytoplasm upon Fascin-1 inhibition. These data suggest that Fascin inhibition decreases tumors cell invasion, induces cell senescence, and favors a switch towards a differentiated and these effects on the cells are mediated via the Hippo pathway. The kinome is also modulated.<br \/>Conclusion: Fascin-1 is an interesting target in hepatoblastoma, commercialized phase-2 drugs are available, and this study will confirm the potential use of those drugs in HB treatment and elucidate by which mechanism Fascin-1 inhibition impacts tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

However, resistance of the primary tumor towards chemotherapy and the persistence of metastases still represents major challenges to achieve complete remission in high-risk patients, which is associated with poor prognosis. In order to identify new treatment options, we have used a newly developed in vitro drug-testing platform comprised of conventional cell lines and cultures from dissociated patient-derived xenografts of pediatric liver cancers to test standard-of-care medications used in the current PHITT trial as well as compounds targeting a wide range of different cellular pathways. We identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a promising drug family to reduce tumor cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, with panobinostat being the most effective drug tested. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that panobinostat reduced short- and long-term proliferation, retarded three-dimensional spheroid growth and ultimately induced apoptosis of hepatoblastoma cells. RNA sequencing indicated that panobinostat results in downregulation of MYC target genes and upregulation of the dual specificity phosphatase 1. Of clinical relevance, the combination of panobinostat with doxorubicin revealed a strong synergistic effect, even stronger than the one of cisplatin and doxorubicin, which is currently given to high-risk hepatoblastoma patients. Moreover, increased expression of <i>HDAC4<\/i> and <i>HDAC11<\/i> in primary tumor tissues was significantly associated with metastatic disease. Our results strongly suggest panobinostat to be used in future therapeutic trials for high-risk hepatoblastoma patients, especially when combined with doxorubicin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Pediatric cancers,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Amentoflavone, a biflavonoid compound, possesses antiviral, angiogenesis-inhibitory, and anticancer properties. Prior studies have illustrated that amentoflavone effectively restrains tumor growth and promotes apoptosis in various cancers, including brain cancer and osteosarcoma. Regorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of multi-kinases, can inhibit angiogenesis, tumor growth, and anti-tumor metastasis. While regorafenib is a targeted drug approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and has also been approved for use in HCC, its effectiveness in HCC is limited. Consequently, our goal is to investigate whether amentoflavone may enhance the sensitivity of regorafenib in treating HCC and explore the underlying mechanisms. In our study, through the combined treatment and combination index analysis, we proved that the combination of regorafenib and amentoflavone may induce cytotoxicity more effectively compared to monotherapy, as assessed by the MTT assay in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. The invasion and migration assays also demonstrated a superior inhibitory effect in the combination group. Additionally, apoptosis markers such as \"cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9, Fas and FasL\" assayed by flow cytometry, confirm that the combination treatment may induce the extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis pathway in HCC. In our Western blotting analysis, we observed that the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-&#954;B proteins was effectively suppressed by the combination of regorafenib and amentoflavone in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, respectively. Furthermore, our in vivo<\/i> study confirmed a superior tumor inhibition rate and control rate with the combination of regorafenib and amentoflavone. Importantly, no signs of general toxicity were observed in any of the treatment groups, as evidenced by body weight monitoring and Hematoxylin and Eosin stain (H&#38;E) pathology evaluation. We believe that the combined treatment of these two drugs effectively triggers cell death and suppresses metastatic patterns through the inactivation of the STAT3\/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. These results suggest that amentoflavone has the potential to serve as an adjuvant that sensitizes regorafenib for the treatment of HCC without causing any side effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Therapeutic dosing, resistance, and combination therapy application,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Regorafenib,NF-&#954;B,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

To better understand the biology of Wilms tumors and develop drugs especially against tumors that relapse, we sought to identify mutations in the exome, differential gene expression patterns, and tumor suppressor expression status of Wilms tumors in Kentucky. The Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) Virtual Tissue Repository identified 29 cases of Wilms tumor diagnosed between 2015 and 2021 at hospitals across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Markey Cancer Center Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology Facility prepared tumor microarrays (TMAs) using Wilms tumor and matching normal tissue cores for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. RNA-Seq analysis performed at the Markey Cancer Center Oncogenomics Facility identified a gene signature that was further validated by IHC and reverse-transcription quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR). Outcome data provided by KCR indicated that increased expression of an anti-apoptotic protein in the tumor counter-intuitively provided better prognosis and outcome to treatment, indicating that the treatments either directly or indirectly targeted this protein. Loss of function of the tumor suppressor proteins in Par-4\/PAWR, WT1 and p53 did not explain the higher expression of the cell survival protein. Our multidisciplinary team approach involves basic science\/translational researchers, population scientists, biomedical informaticists, and clinicians and has resulted in well-characterized, Wilms tumor tissue microarrays. The next phase of the study is generating patient derived xenografts (PDXs) for a better understanding of Wilms tumor biology in children.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wilms' tumor,Par-4,WT1,Molecular signature,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
