[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Tumor recurrence is the most common cause of treatment failure after surgical resection. The S100 protein family is a multigenic group of cytoplasmic calcium-binding proteins. S100A16 has to be reported to be an independent prognostic indicator of poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma recently. However, the prognostic value of S100A16 in recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma has not been well demonstrated. The relationship between S100A16 expression and the histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma remained unknown.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A total of 79 patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma were included in the study. S100A16 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens. The prognostic value of S100A16 overexpression and its relationship with clinicopathological variables, including histology subtypes, were investigated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> S100A16 overexpression tended to be significantly associated with order age (<i>P<\/i> = 0.074). There was no significant association between S100A16 overexpression and predominant pattern group (lepidic\/acinar\/papillary vs. micropapillary\/solid) (<i>P<\/i> = 0.447). Univariate analysis indicated that pathologic stage (II or III vs. I) (<i>P <\/i>= 0.001) and S100A16 overexpression (<i>P <\/i>= 0.005) were significant prognostic factors for worse recurrence-free survival (RFS). Predominant pattern group (lepidic\/acinar\/papillary vs. micropapillary\/solid) (<i>P <\/i>= 0.064) tended to be a significant prognostic factor for worse RFS. In multivariate analysis, pathologic stage (II or III vs. I) (HR, 27.847; 95% CI, 4.173 to 185.831; <i>P <\/i>= 0.001), and S100A16 overexpression (HR, 21.740; 95% CI, 2.516 to 187.870; <i>P <\/i>= 0.005) were still significant prognostic factors for worse RFS.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> S100A16 overexpression was a significant prognostic factor for worse RFS in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.

While NMIBC may be cured with transurethral resection +\/- intravesical therapies, approximately 20% of patients develop progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) which requires life-altering treatments such as cystectomy and has a high risk of lethal metastatic recurrence. Current risk stratification for NMIBC relies on clinicopathologic features that overlook the potential role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in bladder cancer pathogenesis. We sought to delineate the stromal and immune landscape alterations within the TME upon bladder cancer progression and to identify TME-related features that could enhance current prognostic approaches. Analyzing by single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed imaging of 22 untreated NMIBC and MIBC specimens, coupled with publicly available datasets, we discovered significant transcriptional variability among cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages across patients. This inter-patient variability was attributable to the extensive remodeling of these cell types during cancer progression. Notably, a specific subset of CAF, characterized by ITGA8+F3+ markers, was found to be highly enriched in NMIBC lesions and transcriptionally related to sub-urothelial fibroblasts of the healthy bladder, whereas a FAP+ CAF subset enriched for core matrisome related genes was dominant in MIBC lesions. We developed a FAP+ CAF signature which was then projected onto a large public dataset of bulk-RNAseq data from patients with NMIBC demonstrating that the FAP+ CAF signature was significantly associated with progression to MIBC independently of contemporary risk stratification scores. The presence of FAP+ CAFs in a subset of NMIBC specimens was orthogonally validated using immunohistochemistry. Importantly, areas with FAP staining were observed in close contact with individual or small groups of tumor cells exhibiting an invasive phenotype and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition, likely explaining the higher risk of progression to MIBC. Our study improves our understanding of fibroblasts remodeling during bladder cancer progression and highlights the potential of integrating CAF-derived biomarkers into NMIBC risk stratification models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Further, we identified a direct correlation between mRNA expression and copy numbers, alongside an inverse relationship with methylation levels, particularly in CLDN1, CLDN12, CLDN15, CLDN23, and CLDN4. Intriguingly, claudin expression escalated from grades G1 to G3 but diminished in G4, with CLDN1, CLDN4, and CLDN7 showing significant variability (Kruskal-Wallis rank test p-values of 1.2E-5, 0.00064, and 0.023, respectively). Survival analysis indicated that high expression levels of CLDN1 and CLDN4 were linked to poorer patient outcomes, while higher levels of CLDN5 and CLDN15 correlated with improved survival (log-rank p-values of 0.007, 0.016, 0.0035, and 0.0012, respectively), findings consistent across both univariate and multivariate analyses. Furthermore, immune infiltration patterns, assessed via the EPIC deconvolution algorithm, varied significantly between high and low CLDN expression groups.

According to RCB classification, class III predicted short survival duration regardless of BC subtypes according to hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) state. However, up to 20-40% of BCs with RCB class III did not experience BC recurrence and had long term survival without disease recurrence. In our study, we evaluated genomic characteristics of BC which had high RCB class. We collected 96 fresh frozen BC specimens which had undergone surgery after NAC between 2010 and 2018 from Samsung Medical Center Biobank. We performed whole genome or exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and high-plex single-cell spatial transcriptomics. Of 96 BCs, 65 BCs had experienced BC recurrence and 31 BCs have not been BC recurrence. Of 65 BCs with dismal prognosis, 12 were HR+HER2-, four in HR+HER2+, 39 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 10 in HR-HER2+ BC. Of 31 BCs without recurrence, 11 were HR+HER2-, two in HR+HER2+, 14 in TNBC and four in HR-HER2+ BC. In HR+HER2- BC, ten of 12 BCs with dismal prognosis were categorized into basal like intrinsic subtype and two were into luminal B subtype compared that six of luminal A and five of luminal B subtype categorization in good prognosis BC group. Age associated mutation signature were enriched in HR+HER2- BC with good prognosis (p=0.027). Tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis using Kassandra suggested that high monocytes were associated with BC with dismal prognosis (p=0.00031). In single-cell spatial transcriptome analysis, T-cell abundance in the tumoral niche is associated with dismal prognosis in HR+HER2- BC (p=0.039). In TNBC, almost BCs (88.7%) were categorized into basal-like intrinsic subtype regardless of their prognosis. TME analysis presented that immune cells including macrophages and lymphocytes with CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly enriched in TNBC with good prognosis (ps &#60;0.05, respectively). In HER2+ BC, intrinsic subtypes were heterogeneous in both groups. Focal amplification in HER2+BC patient harbored DNA segments from different chromosomes more frequently than in those with good prognosis (p=0.00091), which was prominent in oncogenic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications compared to other oncogenic amplifications. In TME analysis, there were no specific cell enrichments according to BC prognosis but sing-cell spatial transcriptome analysis revealed that higher T-cell abundance in the tumoral niche was associated with HR+HER2+ BC with good prognosis (p=0.047). In conclusion, each BC subtype had their own genomic characteristics to determine their prognosis. Our study also suggested that TME characteristics was common prognostic factor for survival outcome of BC with residual tumor after NAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-Y.

Consequently, there is a pressing need for improved means of interrogating race\/ethnicity-based prostate cancer biology in order to identify biomarkers to help stratify men at high-risk for prostate cancer-specific progression and death and offer treatment recommendation that would mostly benefit AA men undergoing early aggressive therapies. Current predictive models rely on clinical variables but do not account for these disparities. The overall goal is to construct a race-specific prostate cancer prognostic prediction model for risk assessment. Here we performed comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using the data from 17 pairs of gene expression array from AA and CA cohorts and identified 63 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by race. Among them, chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), viz. p-Akt (Ser473), fatty acid synthase (FASN), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) gene expressions were significantly altered in AA groups. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 163 prostate cancer patient specimens to validate DEG expression and immunoreactive scores (IRS) were calculated. CXCR4 exhibited significantly higher expression in AA tumors, with &#62; 85% of AA prostate tumors showing weak to strong CXCR4 expression, compared to &#60; 5% in CA specimens. While immunostaining for IL-6, FASN, MMP9 and p-Akt did not provide a significant distinction between CA and AA cases. IRS analysis confirmed higher expression of CXCR4 in AA cancers, compared to CA prostate cancer (p &#60; 0.001). MMP9 and IL6 expression were moderately higher in AA cancer compared to CA prostate cancer (p &#60; 0.05). In contrast, FASN expression was significantly higher in CA cancer, compared to AA prostate cancer (p &#60; 0.001). We further investigated the impact of these genes on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis to examine the differences between low-risk versus high-risk groups. BCRFS analysis demonstrated that CXCR4 is a determinant factor of recurrence risk in AA prostate cancer patients. The activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, particularly in AA patients, suggests its role in prostate cancer aggressiveness. Taken together, this study demonstrates the importance of differential expression of biomarkers which constitute the bulk tumors in driving cancer. The distinct gene expression patterns, especially the upregulation of CXCR4, in AA prostate cancer highlight its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for personalized treatment strategies. These findings encourage further study into the role of population-specific difference in adding CXCR4 in risk model construction, especially in machine learning models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Racial Disparity,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Besides pathological response, there remains no biomarkers for recurrence risk prediction after neoadjuvant ICB. Recent studies have highlighted a strong association between ICB efficacy and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Thus, we sought to investigate the TIME features in surgically resected tumors following neoadjuvant ICB from patients with ESCC to develop a potential way for recurrence risk prediction.<br \/>Methods: This is a side study of a phase 2 NICE trial (ChiCTR1900026240) of 51 patients with resectable locally advanced ESCC who received neoadjuvant ICB plus chemotherapy followed by surgery from 2019 to 2020. TIME features of surgically resected tumors after neoadjuvant therapy were assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) for immune markers (CD8, PD-L1, CD45RO, PD-1, Pan-CK, CD4, FoxP3, CD68, CD163). We first analyzed TIME features in tumors evaluated as pathological complete response (pCR) and major pathological response (MPR). Then, we divided 51 patients into a training and validation set; and machine learning was applied to identify a list of TIME features that predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and to develop a TIME-based signature (TIS) on neoadjuvant ICB prognosis.<br \/>Results: Fifty-one patients from NICE trial were used for primary analysis. A higher positive rate of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells, CD163<sup>-<\/sup>CD68<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup> cells was observed in patients with pCR. Similarly, MPR patients exhibited a higher positive rate of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cells and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Regarding RFS prediction, machine learning selection of TIS were identified: CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>-<\/sup>(cytotoxic T cells), CD4<sup>+<\/sup>Foxp3<sup>+<\/sup> (Treg), CD8<sup>+<\/sup>CD45RO<sup>+<\/sup> (memory T cells), and M1 macrophages (CD163<sup>-<\/sup>CD68<sup>+<\/sup>) exhibited significant predictive value. Stratifying patients into low- and high-risk groups using TIS for RFS revealed a prolonged prolonged RFS in the low-risk group (p&#60;0.001; HR: 0.08, 95% CI [0.03-0.25]). Notably, when applying TIS to pCR patients, we identified a subset of high-risk pCR patients (median RFS = 8.9 months, 1- year RFS=32%) relapsed earlier than low-risk pCR patients (median RFS = not reached, 1-year RFS=100%, p&#60;0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that TIS was an independent predictor for RFS as well as overall survival (both p&#60;0.001). Further independent validation (ICB and non-ICB cohort) of TIS is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: The establishment of a risk prediction model based on TIME demonstrated the potential to enhance postoperative monitoring management for ESCC patients who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant ICB. Our study provides insights into development of optimal post-immunotherapy management strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,Recurrence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

However, such signatures are frequently indication-specific, which limits their utility to stratify broader populations. Transcriptional plasticity, the ability of a transcriptome to change in response to external stimuli, is of interest due to its relation to disease progression and therapeutic response. To extend and generalize the measurement of a patient&#8217;s risk of disease progression to a pan-cancer, sequencing-based biomarker, Emax, the maximum cytotoxicity of a compound in a cell line, was explored as a potential universal marker of transcriptional plasticity.<br \/>To explore correlation between Emax and transcriptional plasticity, cancer cell lines were ranked by mean Emax across multiple classes of cytotoxic compounds analyzed in GDSC (Yang et. al., 2013). Cell lines with lower Emax (more surviving cells at high drug concentrations) were filtered to exclude cell lines which tended to have higher IC50 values to remove cell lines that may be generally more resistant. With GDSC1 as the train set and GDSC2 as the test set, differentially expressed genes between high-Emax and low-Emax cell lines were selected for further analysis and possible inclusion in the plasticity biomarker signature.<br \/>Test analysis in GDSC2 revealed an R2 of 0.88 suggesting transferability. For clinical validation, public repositories were queried for tumor RNA sequencing data with paired response data. To avoid batch effects between experiments, preliminary validation focused on one sufficiently large dataset with well-curated response data (n = 170; Barrett et. al., 2013, GSE91061; phs000452.v1.p1). Analysis of the expression of the genes identified in the in vitro signature revealed significant differential expression between patients who were reported as having an objective response and patients who achieved stable disease as best response. In silico pathway analysis of this signature revealed enrichment in cell-cell adhesion, signaling, and gene regulation, which relate to the hallmarks of phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming (Hanahan, 2022).<br \/>This analysis reveals similarity between gene expression patterns associated with Emax measured in vitro and transcriptional plasticity in the clinic. Additional experimentation is underway to prospectively analyze this set of biomarkers and to retrospectively validate this signature in additional datasets with the goal of patient stratification by the risk of disease progression following an initial, incomplete response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Bioinformatics,Transcription,Pan-cancer biomarker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Systemic inflammation contributes to sarcopenia or low muscle mass through increased catabolism and decreased synthesis of muscle protein. In turn, sarcopenia leads to inflammation in the muscle and exacerbation of systemic inflammation. Specific Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the association between sarcopenia and systemic biomarkers of inflammation including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and albumin in diverse individuals with lung cancer and determine their use as prognostic indicators of sarcopenia. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 218 non-Hispanic Black (n=111) and White (n=107) individuals with lung cancer. Computed tomography scans were analyzed to calculate skeletal mass index (SMI) at the third lumbar vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined using published sex-specific criteria for SMI in healthy individuals then categorized into the binary variable of sarcopenia\/no sarcopenia. NLR, PLR, and albumin were analyzed as both continuous and categorical variables, with NLR<u>&#62;<\/u> 3, PLR <u>&#62;<\/u>150, and albumin &#60;3.5 defining moderate to high inflammation.

Sarcopenia has been shown to be a prognostic factor in some metastatic cancers. We evaluated the impact of sarcopenia derived via an automated segmentation algorithm on outcomes in the Phase 3 NSCLC clinical trial, CheckMate 227 (NCT02477826)<br \/>Methods: The sarcopenia score assessment involves automated selection of the L3 vertebra level slice from abdominal or chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) CT scans, followed by automated segmentation of the muscle area from that slice. Sarcopenia scores were derived from previously established definitions of sarcopenia, with values below 41 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for female patients (regardless of BMI) and below 43 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2<\/sup> or 53 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for male (based on BMI &#60; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> or &#8805; 25 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). Among the 967 patients with evaluable scans, sarcopenia at baseline was identified in 68.39% (n=329\/481) patients receiving nivolumab (NIVO) with ipilimumab (IPI) and 70.2% (n=341\/486) receiving chemotherapy (Chemo).<br \/>Results: There was a trend of worse overall survival (OS) in patients with baseline sarcopenia across both treatment arms (minimum follow up 49.4 months). In patients with baseline sarcopenia vs ITT, median OS was 16.5 mo vs. 21.8 mo (<i>p=<\/i> 0.219) within the NIVO + IPI arm and 12.9 mo vs.15.0 mo (<i>p=<\/i> 0.273) within the Chemo arm respectively. Any increase in muscle mass from baseline to week 12 was associated with better OS for patients treated with NIVO+IPI (n=98) with sarcopenia at baseline compared to those without an increase in muscle mass (median OS 45.3 mo vs.19.5 mo,<i> p=<\/i> 0.012). This was not seen in those who received Chemo (n=87). Weight and muscle mass were moderately correlated at baseline (r=0.60).<br \/>Conclusions: We found that in CheckMate 227, baseline sarcopenia is associated with numerically worse OS, regardless of treatment, leading to potential use as a negative prognostic biomarker. Patients with NSCLC receiving immunotherapy might benefit from changes in muscle mass being monitored during treatment. Validation of these findings in other studies and other tumor types is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Ipilimumab,NSCLC,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Since only some patients will develop aggressive cancer and require treatment, accurate disease prognosis is crucial. A wide range of parameters with prognostic value have been described, including age, clinical stage, mutational status, protein markers, and flow cytometry levels of CD19+CD38+ B cells above 20%. Here, we investigated epigenetic markers for B cell types including a marker for overall B cells, na&#239;ve B cells, memory B cells and IgM positive B cells in a cohort of more than 40 patients with B-CLL. When comparing to a cohort of more than 100 healthy donors, the epigenetic B cell marker identified all patients with 100% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the epigenetic B cell markers for na&#239;ve and memory B cells identified with high sensitivity and excellent specificity a subgroup of B-CLL patients with CD19+CD38+ B cell levels above 20% which is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. The results suggest that the epigenetic analysis of B cells in capillary blood may be a promising tool for B-CLL diagnosis and disease prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,B cells,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"K.

The prognostic significance of these markers and their relationship to thrombotic events and overall survival (OS) are under-explored.<br \/>Methods: Patients &#62;18 years were included if they had progressive PC planned to start ADT, were &#62;6 months from surgery or RT, with no history of prior VTE, unexplained bleeding, current or planned anticoagulation, or an additional active malignancy. Plasma samples were obtained via peripheral venipuncture in tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate and immediately placed on ice. Samples were analyzed for D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and tissue factor (TF) levels by ELISA. Patients had markers drawn at baseline (prior to initiation of ADT), 1 month, and 6 months after initiation.<br \/>Results: 40 patients were accrued with a median age of 68 years. At baseline, 29 (73%) had presence of metastases. Baseline median PSA was 15 and median PSA doubling time was 0.32. Baseline median hemoglobin was 13.85, platelets were 218, D-dimer was 322 ng\/dL, IL-6 was 0 pg\/mL, IL-8 was 0 pg\/mL, TAT was 3 ug\/L, VEGF was 21 pg\/mL, and TF was 26 pg\/mL. Median follow-up was 78 months. During follow up, 35 (87.5%) had metastases. 10 (25%) had thrombotic events (6 [15%] venous, 4 [10%] arterial) at median 37 months follow up. Median baseline age of pts with subsequent thrombotic events was 74, vs 67 in those without a thrombotic event. While there was no significant difference in baseline PSA between groups with and without clotting events, pretreatment PSA doubling time was significantly lower in pts with subsequent thrombosis (0.27 vs 0.35, p=0.047). Median baseline D-dimer and TF were higher in patients with subsequent thrombosis (D-dimer: 516 vs 282, p=0.10; TF: 36 vs 24, p=0.12). In univariate analysis, baseline IL-6 and VEGF were associated with OS (IL-6: HR=1.05, 95% CI [1.01,1.09], p=0.025; VEGF: HR=1.02, 95% CI [1.00,1.03], p=0.028). When controlling for presence of metastasis, baseline TAT was associated with OS (HR=1.05, 95% CI [1.00,1.11], p=0.055).<br \/>Conclusions: Plasma markers of hemostatic activation, fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis prior to initiation of ADT are associated with subsequent thrombotic events and overall survival years later.

Among them, the luminal B1 subtype exhibits higher proliferation rates and a worse prognosis compared to the luminal A subtype. Despite significant advancements in detection and therapies, recurrence still occurs after primary treatment. In this study, our aim is to identify genomic alterations in early recurrent luminal B1 breast cancer.<br \/>Experimental Design: In this VGHTPE cohort, we recruited a total of 42 patients diagnosed with stage I-III luminal B1 breast cancer, comprising 15 subjects who experienced recurrence within five years and 27 subjects who did not. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing. We assessed cell aggressiveness through in vitro transwell migration, invasion, and sphere assays.<br \/>Results: Luminal B1 breast cancer patients with advanced stage and poorly differentiated tumors were associated with recurrence within five years. Driver gene mutation analysis revealed that <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations were present in 46.7% of patients who experienced recurrence within five years, compared to 29.6% in the non-recurrence group. In the analysis of copy number variations, the most common amplifications\/gains observed in luminal B1 breast cancer patients were in <i>MCL1<\/i>, <i>MYC<\/i>, and <i>KLF6<\/i>. Remarkably, patients who experienced recurrence within five years showed a higher occurrence of gain in <i>ITGB2<\/i>, the gene encoding the integrin &#946; chain, compared to those who remained recurrence-free.

A recent study involving patients receiving curative surgical resection alone for localized ESCC showed TLS as a favorable prognostic factor associated with improved progression free survival (Hayashi et al. British Journal of Cancer, 2023;128:2175-2185). Our study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of TLS in patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).<br \/>Patients and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 137 patients of locally advanced ESCC patients from two referral centers of Taiwan from 2002 to 2018. All patients received paclitaxel\/platinum-based CRT followed by esophagectomy. Primary esophageal tumor tissues biopsied endoscopically before treatment were collected for immunohistochemical stains for CD20 (clone L26; Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) and CD23 (clone DAK-CD23; agilent Dako, California, U.S.A.). The TLS status of each patient was defined as no TLS (no aggregation of CD20-positive cells), immature TLS (aggregation of CD20-positive cells without CD23-positive cells in it), and mature TLS (aggregation of CD20-positive cells with CD23-positive cells in it). The associations of the TLS status with pathologic complete response (pCR) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed univariately and multivariately by logistic regression and cox regression, respectively. The variables included in the analyses were age, gender, tumor location, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, the institutes, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (PD-L1 TC) and immune cells (PD-L1 IC), and the TLS status.<br \/>Results: The median age was 54 years with 125 males and 12 females. The TLS status of no, immature, and mature TLS were seen in 64, 40, and 33 patients, respectively. Mature TLS was associated with PD-L1 IC (p=0.0007). Compared to no TLS, mature TLS associated with lower pCR rate (24% vs 47%) in both univariate (OR: 0.36, p=0.034) and multivariate (OR: 0.26, p=0.023) analysis. Compared to no TLS, mature TLS was associated with shorter OS (median OS: 27 vs 46 months) in multivariate analysis (HR: 2.96, p=0.0008), but not in univariate analysis (HR: 1.29, p=0.29). Other prognostic factors associated with OS in multivariate analysis include male gender (HR: 2.88, p=0.021), PD-L1 TC (HR: 1.62, p=0.039), and PD-L1 IC (HR: 0.30, p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: Mature TLS is an independent factor for poor treatment outcomes, including pathologic response and overall survival in locally advanced ESCC patients receiving neoadjuvant CRT.

This study investigates <i>KMT2A<\/i> PTDs levels in healthy donors and myeloid malignancy samples to establish a threshold to report samples with high PTDs, using next generation sequencing (NGS) with Oncomine<sup>TM<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>Myeloid Assay GX v2. We also report <i>KMT2A<\/i> fusions in myeloid malignancies.<br \/>Methods: We sequenced 8483 research samples with known myeloid malignancies at Sonora Quest Laboratories<sup>TM<\/sup> and at Thermo Fisher Scientific<sup>TM<\/sup>. We acquired 20 healthy donor whole blood samples (total 127 replicates) from Stanford<sup>TM<\/sup> Blood Center and Discovery Life Sciences<sup>TM<\/sup> and sequenced them at 3 different sites of Thermo Fisher Scientific<sup>TM<\/sup>. Samples were sequenced with the Ion Torrent<sup>TM<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>Genexus<sup>TM<\/sup> 6.6 or Ion GeneStudio<sup>TM<\/sup><sup> <\/sup> S5 System. They were profiled for 6 different <i>KMT2A<\/i>-PTD variants and 199 <i>KMT2A<\/i> fusion isoforms.<br \/>Results: The mean read length of this data set is 90 - 120 bp and the mean mapped fusion reads is 20,000 - 30,000. <i>KMT2A<\/i>-PTDs were detected in both healthy donors and myeloid samples. Healthy donor PTD read counts were consistently &#60;2000 and averaged 1\/3 of myeloid sample PTD read counts. About 33% of myeloid samples had higher PTD read counts than any healthy donor sample. BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) analysis confirmed specific exon matching on the <i>KMT2A<\/i> gene in both cohorts. Among the 8483 myeloid samples, 162 samples contained a total of 5 unique <i>KMT2A<\/i> PTDs, and 105 samples contained a total of 30 unique <i>KMT2A<\/i> fusion isoforms with <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>MLLT1<\/i> and <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>MLLT3<\/i> being the most prevalent <i>KMT2A<\/i> fusion gene pairs.<br \/>Conclusions: We characterize the <i>KMT2A<\/i> fusions present in myeloid malignant samples. We also describe the abundance of <i>KMT2A<\/i> PTDs in both healthy donor and myeloid samples, with myeloid cases showing significantly higher PTD read counts. <i>KMT2A<\/i> PTD read count &#62;2000 is present only in malignant samples but not in healthy donors. This intriguing finding opens opportunities for prospective studies to monitor individuals with elevated PTD levels for myeloid malignancy development and retrospective studies to explore whether healthy donors identified with this alteration years ago after blood donation were subsequently recorded in the national health system with myeloid malignancies.<br \/>(For research use only.

Their development, however, is challenged by strict regulations and high costs, leading to sparse and varied data collected over extended periods and through diverse technologies. These variations complicate the harmonization and analysis of the data. Traditional methods struggle to navigate these complexities, further obscuring biomarker identification. For instance, PDL-1, approved as a biomarker by the FDA, has its effectiveness debated in several studies. To address these issues, we introduce Biomarkers Navigator, a flexible and automated analysis framework engineered explicitly for the robust identification of biomarkers. This framework is designed to aggregate, standardize, and store expansive biomarker information, ensuring efficient and traceable knowledge retrieval. By pre-calculating each potential biomarker, Biomarkers Navigator enables immediate and comprehensive meta-analyses, facilitating rapid decision-making tailored to the level of risk acceptance. Large Language Models (LLMs) further enhance the framework's capability to uncover signatures of response and resistance. LLM integration has accelerated the discovery of new potential biomarkers for hematological malignancies by combining prior knowledge and previously obscured associations. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale hypothesis-free analysis and substantiates the utility of AI in unveiling hidden biological connections within clinical data. Our findings underscore the potential of AI-augmented frameworks in revolutionizing biomarker discovery and advancing personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,Databases,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

L-Arg is also a substrate for nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and arginases (ARG) 1 and 2. Methylation of L-arg residues within proteins by protein L-arg methyltransferases (PRMTs) leads to asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Protein L-arg methylation is an important post-translational mechanism to regulate gene expression and cell cycle control. We measured L-arg and its metabolites in a prospective cohort of patients with primary breast cancer (BC). We further measured these metabolites and expression of genes involved in L-arg metabolic pathways in cell lines representing intrinsic BC subtypes. Plasma L-arg-related metabolite concentrations from 243 women with primary BC were associated with total mortality and disease recurrence during a median follow-up of 88 (IQR, 82-93) months. MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-468 cells representing ER-positive, HER2-positive, and triple negative BC were cultured in standard conditions and compared to MCF-12A normal breast epithelial cells. The plasma (<i>in vivo<\/i>) and intracellular concentrations (<i>in vitro<\/i>) of L-arg, L-ornithine (L-orn), L-citrulline (L-cit), ADMA, and SDMA were measured by UPLC-MS\/MS. mRNA expression was quantified by qRT-PCR and protein expression was analyzed by Western Blot. In vivo, the plasma concentrations of all L-arg metabolites differed significantly between BC patients and healthy controls. L-Arg and ADMA were significantly higher in patients with recurrent disease and in those who died during follow up. ADMA was significantly associated with total mortality and recurrent disease in Luminal A patients; low L-orn\/L-arg ratio was associated with survival in HER2+ BC patients, and low L-cit was associated with survival in triple negative BC. With the exception of MCF-7 cells, DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA concentrations in vitro were significantly higher in BC cells than in MCF-12A cells (DDAH1: 32-44 fold, DDAH2: 1.7-4.2 fold; p&#60;0.05). These differences were mirrored by DDAH1 and DDAH2 protein concentrations. By contrast, MCF-7 cells were characterized by low DDAH1 and DDAH2, but high PRMT4 and PRMT6 mRNA expression and high L-arg content. BT-474 cells showed high ARG2 expression and high L-arg and L-orn concentrations, and MDA-MB-468 cells had the highest L&#8209;cit\/L-arg ratio. In conclusion, regulation of L-arg metabolic pathways shows a complex and differential pattern between intrinsic BC subtypes, which is mirrored in representative cell lines in vitro. ADMA is a prognostic biomarker in Luminal A breast cancer patients; its metabolizing enzyme, DDAH, is highly overexpressed in BC cells in vitro. Thus, fingerprinting of L-arg metabolism may offer novel personalized treatment options within intrinsic BC subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survival,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Current radiographic-based biomarkers mainly focus on primary tumor (PT) alone, neglecting the potential prognostic value from the lymph node (LN). In this work, we constructed a radiomic model integrating texture features from both PT and LN to predict overall survival (OS) in HPV-associated OPSCC patients.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Pretreatment CT scans for 647 OPSCC patients treated with definitive radiation with or without chemotherapy were acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and the Cleveland Clinic (CCF), which were divided into training set D<sub>1<\/sub> (n=294) and test set D<sub>2<\/sub> (n=353). PT and LN contours were annotated by three. 2045 texture radiomic features were extracted from both PT and LN and were concatenated as input to a LASSO Cox model to predict OS. We used the harrell&#8217;s concordance index (C-index) and hazard ratio (HR) to evaluate the prognostic performance. We also performed the multivariable cox proportional hazard analysis adjusting for clinicopathological variables to validate the independent prognostic significance.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Among the 647 patients, median follow-up time was 70.23 months, with 155 patients (24%) experienced death. 22.6%, 38.8%, 23.2% and 15.4% had T stage I, II, III and IV tumors, respectively. 203 patients (31.4%) were treated with radiation alone. The model integrating PT and LN (M_PTLN) yielded higher C-index compared to PT alone (M_PT) on D1 (0.74 vs 0.66) and on D2 (0.64 vs 0.61). In univariate analysis on D2, M_PTLN is prognostic of OS (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.32 - 3.87; log rank p = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, M_PTLN is still statistically significant (p = 0.04) accounting for clinicopathologic factors (age, gender, smoking pack-year [PY], T stage, N stage and treatment modality).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We developed and validated a CT-based survival prediction model for HPV-associated OPSCC patients with significant prognostic values, accounting for both primary tumor and lymph node.

It is partly due to the mild symptoms in early stages and relatively high diagnostic age (about 63-year-old median age). These factors contribute to the short chemotherapy response time and survival time with about 18- and 36-months median progression-free survival and overall survival duration, respectively. The advancements of convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning algorithms provide opportunities for the development of cost- and time-effective models which is urgently needed for ovarian cancer patients, especially for those with elevated risk. A CNN model was trained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained tumor whole slide images (WSIs) from ovarian cancer patients with advanced stages. 773 WSIs of 335 patients from TCGA-OV dataset were separated randomly for training and testing cohort. The model was then applied on testing cohort with advanced stage and age patients for H&#38;E survival score. The c-index of the predicted risk on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 0.66 and 0.63, respectively. The log-rank p-values of patients between low and high risk were 0.00137 and 0.00138, respectively. The model was then further evaluated with an external dataset. The c-index of the predicted risk were 0.64 and 0.72 for OS and PFS, respectively. And the log-rank test between patients with low and high risk achieved p-values 0.017 and 0.0047 for OS and PFS, respectively. In conclusion, a novel prognostic CNN model was developed for ovarian cancer patients with advanced age and stage for better disease management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Prognostic markers,Deep learning,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The identification of these patients is crucial for treatment management and strategic decisions.<br \/>Methods: We developed a novel computational framework that only requires gene expression profiles to define prognostic gene signatures by selecting genes with expression driven by inferred clonal copy number alterations. We applied this framework to MM and developed a clonal gene signature (CGS) consisting of only 22 genes. This prognostic signature was evaluated in 5 independent datasets with gene expression data of a total of 2,155 MM samples. For each patient, we calculated a prognostic score based on the expression of the signature genes. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of these signature scores with patient prognosis after adjusting established clinical factors. The performances of CGS and the only commercialized MM gene signatures, GEP70 and SKY92, in identifying high-risk patients were carefully compared by multiple different approaches.<br \/>Results: Our results indicated that CGS provided significant prognostic values after adjusting for well-established prognostic factors including cytogenetic abnormalities, International Staging System (ISS), and Revised ISS (R-ISS). In addition, it showed significant prognostic associations in patient subsets stratified by these conventional prognostic factors. Importantly, CGS demonstrated a better performance in identifying high-risk patients compared to the GEP70 and SKY92 signatures, which have been recommended for prognostic stratification in MM. Moreover, CGS can further stratify patients into subgroups with significantly differential prognoses when applied to the high-risk and low-risk groups already identified by GEP70 and SKY92. The higher CGS score of patients is significantly associated with poor response to dexamethasone, a commonly used drug for MM treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, we proposed a computational framework that only requires gene expression data to identify clonal gene signatures for prognosis prediction. The CGS provides a useful biomarker for improving prognostic stratification in MM, especially for the identification of patients with the highest risk. The computational framework used for defining this signature provides a useful tool, which can be readily applied to many other cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Prognostic gene signature,Computational biology,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-R.

Black\/AA patients have the highest mortality and the shortest survival of any racial\/ethnic group in the US. With the approval of pembrolizumab, the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has become the standard of care (SOC) for high-risk early-stage TNBC. The pathologic complete response (pCR) is a reliable prognostic marker that correlates with tumor remission and good outcome, whereas pathologic incomplete response (pIR) with high residual cancer burden (RCB) is often associated with early relapse, treatment resistance, and poor survival. Many similarly-treated patients with identical TNM and RCB classifications still experience racial disparity, different relapse rates, and disparate survival. Current methods fall short in predicting tumor recurrence\/chemo-resistance\/patient survival with high accuracy in the clinic.<br \/>Methods: We detected a major racial disparity in our large regional cohorts of TNBC patients (&#62; 1,000 patients), of which 48% patients are Black\/AA and 48% patients are white patients, at the Sentara Cancer Network and VCU Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center, that have historically provided excellent healthcare and quality cancer care to the social-economically-disadvantaged, medically underserved, and underinsured racial\/ethnic minorities in low income communities in Virginia. Despite Sentara\/VCU&#8217;s best efforts, Black\/AA breast cancer patients still suffer 70-100% higher MBC mortality, and the worst survival compared to their white counterparts, based on our clinical studies and the SEER\/CDC databases.<br \/>Result: We showed that persistent EGFR\/RAS\/SIAH pathway activation is a major driving force of TNBC malignancy. The most downstream and evolutionarily conserved signaling gatekeeper, SIAH, is an RING domain E3 ligase that is a high-resolution prognostic biomarker for patient risk stratification and racial disparity prediction in TNBC. High SIAH expression in residual tumors reflects ineffective NACT\/IO therapy and persistent EGFR\/K-RAS\/SIAH pathway activation (ON) that drives tumor relapse, resistance, and reduced survival. Low SIAH expression in residual tumors reflects effective NACT\/IO therapy and EGFR\/K-RAS\/SIAH pathway inactivation (OFF) that predicts tumor remission, good outcome, and prolonged survival. We found that SIAH expression is 2.0-fold higher in Black\/AA patients&#8217; residual tumors than in the white patients&#8217; residual tumors, mirroring a 1.8-2.0-fold higher death rates in the Black\/AA patients than the white patients.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrate the prognostic power of SIAH for patient risk stratification, therapy quantification, and relationship to cancer racial disparity in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,,Recurrence,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Recurrence risks following curative resection remain high, ~50% after three years and 75-100% over five years. A biomarker for HCC recurrence is urgently needed to help lead treatment strategies. We previously showed that hepatic &#947;-hydroxy-1, N<sup>2<\/sup>-propano-2&#8242;-deoxyguanosine (&#947;-OHPdG), a DNA adduct derived from lipid peroxidation, increased during hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, in a retrospective study, higher &#947;-OHPdG levels in post-surgical liver tumor tissues were associated with poorer survival (p&#60;0.0001) and shorter recurrence-free survival (p=0.007), suggesting that it may be a prognostic biomarker for HCC (Hepatology 2018). In this study, we aimed to test &#947;-OHPdG detected in livers after curative resection as a recurrence biomarker in a prospective study and, in addition, we developed a new non-invasive method for &#947;-OHPdG in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This multicenter study seeks to validate &#947;-OHPdG as a biomarker for HCC recurrence.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> A total of 28 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy at MedStar\/Georgetown University Hospital, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, and the University of Maryland Medical Center were enrolled. &#947;-OHPdG was detected in DNA isolated from hepatic tumors and non-tumors by a previous liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) method and in HCC CTCs isolated from blood samples. CTCs were isolated using hepatocyte-specific rabbit anti-asialoglycoprotein-1 (ASGPR-1), followed by staining with mouse anti-&#947;-OHPdG antibodies. Clinical outcomes were correlated with &#947;-OHPdG in liver tissues and CTCs.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> In our current cohort of 28 patients (mean age: 64.7 years; 82% male), five patients experienced HCC recurrence, with an estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 85% over 8 months. &#947;-OHPdG levels (adducts\/10<sup>9<\/sup> nucleotides)<sup> <\/sup>detected by LC-MS\/MS varied widely in tumor tissues (5-56, mean: 11.8) and non-tumor tissue (7-71, mean: 20.6).

In multiple epithelial cancers, both type XVII collagen and its shed ectodomain are associated with cancer development and invasiveness. This study aims to assess the potential of type XVII collagen as an epithelial damage biomarker in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and in patients with skin diseases like atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. Methodology Type XVII collagen ectodomain levels were measured in serum using a competitive ELISA (nordicPRO-C17). The study included two cohorts: cohort 1 comprised 212 patients with mCRC and 28 healthy controls and cohort 2 included patients with AD (n=8) or psoriasis (n=3). PRO-C17 levels in mCRC patients were compared to 28 healthy controls using a t-test. The association between PRO-C17 levels and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by categorizing patients into low PRO-C17 levels (tertiles 1+2) and high PRO-C17 levels (tertile 3). Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to assess differences in survival between the two groups. The independent predictive value of PRO-C17 was evaluated using multivariate Cox analysis. PRO-C17 levels in AD and psoriasis patients were compared to 15 healthy controls using one-way ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons with Dunn's test. Results PRO-C17 levels were elevated (p&#60;0.05) in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab compared to healthy controls. Patients with high PRO-C17 levels had a shorter overall survival (390 days) compared to those with low levels (539 days) (p=0.007). High levels of the biomarker were associated with an increased risk of mortality and PRO-C17 levels were independent of other risk factors, such as the number of drugs in the treatment regimen, tumor location, synchronous metastatic disease, primary tumor resection, performance status, and the number of metastatic sites (HR=1.43, 95% CI 1.01-2.01, p=0.044). Further, patients with AD had increased PRO-C17 levels (p=0.0057), while patients with psoriasis showed no significant differences in biomarker levels compared to healthy controls (p=0.58). Conclusions This study demonstrated that high PRO-C17 levels were independently associated with shorter OS and an increased risk of mortality in patients with mCRC. Additionally, elevated levels of PRO-C17 were observed in patients with AD. These findings suggest that type XVII collagen may serve as a reflection of epithelial damage in the invasive front during tumor metastasis. The role of this biomarker in other cancer types and skin diseases warrants further exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Colorectal cancer,Collagen,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In cancer patients, inflammation and immune status plays crucial roles in tumor growth and the prognosis. While several studies have explored the relationship between NLR and inflammation, there are few reports on the relationship between NLR and immune status in the tumor microenvironment of cancer patient so far. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential utility of NLR as a surrogate biomarker for assessing the immune response to tumors.<br \/>Methods: The medical records of NSCLC patients who underwent surgery at our institution in 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients&#8217; clinical information including age, sex, performance status, smoking history, histology, clinical stage (7th), and NLR, was obtained. NLR was calculated based on blood tests conducted within a month before surgery. Tumor immune status was evaluated by Immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD8, and FOXP3 in their surgical specimens. The relationship between NLR, clinicopathology, and tumor immune status was examined. The survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Blood cell counts and ratios between different groups were compared using nonpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test, with a significance threshold set at p = 0.05.<br \/>Results: A total of 120 patients were included. The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) in all 120 patients was 63.4%. The 5-year OS of the patients with lower NLR was significantly better than those with high NLR (low &#60; 2.2 vs high &#8805; 2.2; 70.1% vs 56.8%, p = 0.042). The 5-year OS of the patients with high density of CD3+ TILs was significantly better than that in patients with low density of CD3+ TILs (high &#8805; 242 vs low &#60; 242; 70% vs 56.8%, p = 0.019). The 5-year OS of the patients with high density of CD8+ TILs was significantly better than that in patients with low density of CD8+ TILs (high &#8805; 112 vs low &#60; 112; 72.4% vs 54.1%, p = 0.011). Conversely, the 5-year OS of the patients with low density of FOXP3+ TILs was significantly better than that in patients with high density of FOXP3+ TILs (high &#8805; 7.5 vs low &#60; 7.5; 46.2.% vs 79.6%, p = 0.0006). The number of CD3+ TILs had negative correlation with NLR (p = 0.005), while the number of CD8+ TILs and FOXP3+ TILs didn&#8217;t exhibit an association with NLR.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that NLR might potentially reflect immune status in the tumor microenvironment, explaining its impact on the prognosis of NSCLC patients. While further research is needed, these findings may offer valuable insights for guiding treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Biomarkers,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Genomic risk classifiers provide useful information but require substantial tissue, are costly, and are not commonly accessible in many medical centers. The study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) model for automated risk assessment of biochemical recurrence (BCR) by analyzing nuclear morphologic patterns from Pca archival H&#38;E slides. Nuclear morphometric features are essential for disease diagnosis and gaining insights into cellular functions. Specifically, we sought to evaluate whether the computational pathology approach could provide additional granular risk stratification within the low-risk group identified by Decipher.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The study employed two cohorts from the University of Pennsylvania D<sub>1<\/sub> and D<sub>2<\/sub>. D<sub>1 <\/sub>comprised 180 patients, while D<sub>2 <\/sub>comprised 175 patients, including 63 individuals from the Decipher low-risk group. None of the patients in either cohort had received any pre-operative treatments. Within the Decipher cohort, a tumor segmentation model was created using the U-net deep learning network. The HoVer-Net model was used to both segment and classify nuclei. The feature extracted included a combination of nuclear texture and quantitative measurements of the spatial arrangement of nuclei. The eleven most significant features, selected via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), were utilized to build a Cox regression model for predicting the risk of BCR in D<sub>1<\/sub>.
