[{"Abstract":"The cell-surface glycoprotein melanotransferrin (MELTF, CD228) is a member of the iron-binding transferrin superfamily expressed in human melanocytes and other cell types. Dysregulated <i>MELTF<\/i> expression in malignant melanoma has been reported before but its specific role in tumorigenesis has remained elusive. Following our interest in the role of the transferrin receptor (TFRC) in melanomagenesis, our initial TCGA-analysis suggested that high <i>MELTF <\/i>expression is associated with increased melanoma patient survival. In order to explore the mechanistic role of <i>MELTF<\/i> in melanoma we performed CRISPR\/Cas9-based <i>MELTF <\/i>deletion in A375-luc2 human malignant melanoma cells. ICP\/MS-analysis indicated no difference in iron-content between <i>MELTF<\/i>_WT and <i>MELTF<\/i>_KO cells. NanoString nCounter<sup>TM<\/sup> ('PanCancer-Progression-Panel'; 770 genes) comparative transcriptomic profiling (<i>MELTF<\/i>_KO versus <i>MELTF<\/i>_WT) demonstrated an upregulation of EMT-related expression networks in <i>MELTF<\/i>_KO cells, an observation consistent with phenotypic detection of enhanced matrigel invasiveness; likewise, inclusion of recombinant glycosylated MELTF (Gly20-Gly711 His-tag; 92 kDa; 10-100 nM) attenuated invasiveness of <i>MELTF<\/i>_KO cells. In SCID mice,<i> <\/i>subcutaneous growth of <i>MELTF<\/i>_KO exceeded that of <i>MELTF<\/i>_WT xenografts, and intracardial injection followed by non-invasive bioluminescent monitoring revealed an increase in lung metastatic burden associated with decreased survival of the <i>MELTF<\/i>_KO group. These data support a heretofore unrecognized tumor-suppressive function of <i>MELTF<\/i> expression in melanoma progression, a mechanistic role consistent with a potential survival benefit associated with high <i>MELTF <\/i>expression observed in human melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Metastasis,Metastasis suppressor genes,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms of CD1146-driven TNBC metastasis in an inflammatory context remain elusive. We synthesized CD146 nanobody (anti-CD146 #112-2), which degraded CD146 protein specifically, inhibiting IL-6-mediated JAK\/STAT3 activation and suppressing TNBC metastasis. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of CD146 degradation by 112-2 and the role of CD146 in mediating inflammatory responses leading to TNBC metastasis. <b> <\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> CD146 knockout and overxpression cell models were created using CRISPR\/Cas9 or lentiviral techniques. Lung metastasis was evaluated by injecting luciferase-labeled cells into the tail veins of Balb\/c-nu mice, monitored with the IVIS Kinetic system. The impact of CD146 on TNBC metastasis in an inflammatory environment was explored through cell-adhesion assays and trans-endothelial migration assays using CD146 knockout models and HUVEC cells. Transwell assays assessed the influence of IL-6 and 112-2 on TNBC. CD146 mutant vectors with specific truncations were generated to confirm the binding sites between CD146 and 112-2. ELISA and immunofluorescence assays examined CD146 protein internalization. CD146 degradation by 112-2 was confirmed using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, along with western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments. <b>Results: <\/b>Stimulation of TNBC cells with IL-6 increased CD146 expression and tumor metastasis. Knocking down CD146 significantly reduced IL-6 secretion by TNBC cells, leading to reduced tumor-endothelial cell adhesion and trans-endothelial migration. CD146 knockout or 112-2 treatment inhibited IL-6-mediated JAK\/STAT3 activation and tumor metastasis. Experiments with CD146 mutants and molecular docking identified the specific 112-2 binding site at leucine positions 331-332 of CD146 protein. 112-2 treatment led to CD146 protein internalization and cleavage, resulting in an 80 kDa fragment recognized by both 112-2 and C-terminus-specific CD146 antibodies, ultimately inhibiting the activation of IL-6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling. Notably, the inhibition of proteasome or lysosome activity failed to reverse the 112-2-induced reduction in CD146 protein levels. However, inhibiting lysosomal acidification resulted in significant co-localization of CD146 with lysosomes, suggesting a potential role of lysosomes in 112-2-mediated cleavage of CD146. <b>Conclusion: <\/b>CD146 promotes TNBC metastasis by modulating IL-6\/JAK\/STAT3 activation. The nanobody anti-CD146 #112-2 specifically binds to CD146 extracellular domain induces the proteolysis of CD146 protein, thereby inhibiting the tumor-promoting effect of IL-6.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,CD146,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

There is currently no effective treatment due to the unique brain microenvironment and limitation for drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB limits access of nutrients from the circulation and thereby makes the brain hypoxic and depleted of metabolites, growth factors and proteins. However, it remains poorly understood how breast cancer cells manipulate for adaption and colonization in the brain. To probe the molecular mechanism of breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM), we compared gene signatures in primary breast tumors and BCBM tumors, and identified that <i>SQLE<\/i> (encodes squalene epoxidase, the second rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis) could be a leading-edge gene in breast cancer brain metastasis. To explore the role of SQLE in BCBM, we established the brain metastatic TNBC MDA-MB-231 (MDA231-BrM) cell line from brain metastatic subpopulation that originated from its parental MDA-MB-231 (MDA231) cell line. We found that SQLE expression was greatly upregulated in MDA231-BrM cells compared with the parental MDA231 cells. Using MDA231-BrM and MDA231 cell lines expressing <i>SQLE<\/i> shRNAs, we evaluated the effects of SQLE loss on cancer cell migration, invasion, and stemness by wound-healing, transwell invasion\/migration, and tumorsphere formation assays. While loss of SQLE greatly attenuated cell invasiveness and stemness in both MDA231 and MDA231-BrM cells, loss of SQLE could only affect the cell migration activity on MDA231 cells but not MDA231-BrM cells. Our RNA-seq data further identified a subset of SQLE-affected genes that is uniquely enriched in MDA231-BrM cells and favors brain extravasation and colonization. To explore the potential function of SQLE in brain extravasation and colonization, we established <i>in vitro<\/i> BBB models and <i>ex vivo<\/i> mouse brain slice organotypic cultures. We showed that loss of SQLE inhibited the ability of MDA231-BrM cells to across the BBB-mimic astrocyte-endothelial structures as well as impaired the co-option with blood capillaries in the mouse brain slices. Although SQLE-deficient MDA231-BrM cells could still spread on the surface of the blood vessels, they seemed to undergo apoptosis. Since the ability to invade, migrate, and penetrate is critical for invasion of cancer cells, our results strongly imply the novel function of SQLE in breast cancer cell invasion, penetration, and even colonization in the brain through blood vessel co-option. In summary, our data reveal a novel role for SQLE in two critical requisites for breast-to-brain extravasation and colonization - the ability to penetrate through BBB and to co-opt brain vessels for metastatic expansion. Our findings indicate that targeting SQLE may represent a therapeutic opportunity for breast cancer brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,Blood-brain barrier,Invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-P.

Mitochondrial metabolism plays an essential role in various biological processes of cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism through which mitochondrial factors contribute to cancer metastasis remains largely elusive. Anoikis is a form of apoptosis induced by loss of cell adhesion, and metastatic tumor cells must be anoikis resistant to survive during circulation before forming metastatic foci in distant organs. We performed an unbiased RNAi screen using a customized mitochondrion shRNA library and identified succinyl-CoA synthetase beta-A (A-SCS, also called SUCLA2), which is known to catalyze the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA and ADP to succinate and ATP in the TCA cycle as an essential factor that promotes the survival of disseminated cancer cells during metastasis. We demonstrate that A-SCS manages redox balance during tumor metastasis, and this metabolic contribution is independent of its role in the TCA cycle. Mechanistically, A-SCS relocates from the mitochondria to the cytosol and binds to stress granules, promoting stress granules to express the redox-scavenging enzyme catalase upon cell detachment. This mitigates oxidative stress and makes cancer cells survive through anoikis, eventually promoting metastasis. A clinical correlation study comparing primary and metastasized tumors collected from lung cancer patients demonstrated that A-SCS levels align with catalase expression as well as the metastatic progression of lung cancer. Our finding provides an academic basis for developing new treatment targets against metastasis, which strikes elevated mitochondrial metabolism during cancer cell dissemination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Mitochondria,Metabolism,Anoikis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

Despite this observation, the mechanisms contributing to PTEN&#8217;s downregulation have remained elusive. In this study, we discovered that mice exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybu-tyl)nitrosamine (BBN), a specific bladder chemical carcinogen, exhibited primary basal muscle invasive BC (BMIBC) accompanied by a pronounced reduction in PTEN protein expression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Utilizing a lncRNA deep sequencing high-throughput platform, along with gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we identified small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (<i>SNHG1<\/i>) as a critical lncRNA that might drive the formation of primary BMIBCs in BBN-treated mice. Cell culture results further demonstrated that BBN exposure significantly induced <i>SNHG1<\/i> in normal human bladder urothelial cell UROtsa. Notably, the ectopic expression of <i>SNHG1<\/i> alone was sufficient to induce malignant transformation in human urothelial cells, while <i>SNHG1<\/i> knockdown effectively inhibited anchorage-independent growth of human BMIBCs. Our detailed investigation revealed that <i>SNHG1 <\/i>overexpression led to PTEN protein degradation through its direct interaction with HUR. This interaction reduced HUR binding to ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) mRNA, causing degradation of USP8 mRNA and a subsequent decrease in USP8 protein expression. The downregulation of USP8, in turn, increased PTEN poly-ubiquitination and degradation, culminating in cell malignant transformation and BMIBC anchorage-independent growth. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies confirmed the downregulation of PTEN and USP8, as well as their positive correlations in both BBN-treated mouse bladder urothelium and tumor tissues of bladder cancer in nude mice.Our findings, for the first time, demonstrate that overexpressed <i>SNHG1 <\/i>competes with USP8 for binding to HUR. This competition attenuates USP8 mRNA stability and protein expression, leading to PTEN protein degradation, consequently, this process drives urothelial cell malignant transformation and fosters BMIBC growth and primary BMIBC formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"lncRNA,PTEN,Ubiquitination,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Notably, nearly all of them present with ascites at diagnosis, which is directly associated with poor prognosis. Malignant ascites production occurs when ovarian cancer cells shed from the primary tumor, creating a selective pressure environment that threatens their survival. Therefore, cancer cells cluster into tumorspheres, the main metastatic units in HGSOC. In recent years, valuable insights into the mutational and immunological landscapes of HGSOC have been gained. However, there is scarce evidence on the precise molecular mechanisms that enable tumorspheres to surpass the ascites bottleneck and metastasize. In this work, our group addresses this knowledge gap by deciphering the role of S1PR1 in ovarian tumorsphere biology. In this study, ascites samples and Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tumors and peritoneal metastases from a cohort of 32 treatment-na&#239;ve HGSOC patients have been used. Furthermore, 3D spheroid models from four different ovarian cancer cell lines have also been developed for <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays. Our results indicate that up to 60% of cells within HGSOC tumorspheres are proliferating due to an increased expression of pro-proliferative receptors. Thus, cancer cells within tumorspheres that overexpress these receptors might benefit from autocrine and paracrine signaling through release of their ligands. In this work, we have identified S1P-S1PR1 as one of these ligand-receptor axes, which promotes an autocrine positive loop that increases the intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism in ovarian cancer spheroids. Here, we demonstrate that S1PR1 is highly expressed in ascites tumorspheres and, in consequence, overexpressed in metastases in comparison with primary tumors. Furthermore, we also report that proliferation levels of ovarian cancer spheroids positively correlate with S1PR1 endogenous expression. Consistently, these levels are significantly reduced when S1PR1 is knocked out or pharmacologically inhibited. In addition, our results indicate that MEK1\/2-ERK is the key downstream pro-mitogenic pathway of S1PR1 in HGSOC tumorspheres, and that its pharmacological inhibition is effective in reducing growth and number of disseminations <i>in vivo<\/i>. Conclusively, our group is the first one in reporting that the axis S1P-S1PR1-MEK1\/2 is the main proliferative mechanism in HGSOC tumorspheres, providing them with a selective advantage and, consequently, a greater metastatic potential. The preclinical findings presented here may represent an opportunity to further explore targeted therapeutic strategies to hamper disease progression in ovarian cancer patients with the poorest outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Metastasis,Tumor metastases,Ascites fluid,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

It has also been reported to collaborate with Rho kinase to regulate actin filament formation and to activate the Rho-myocardin-related transcription factor serum response factor pathway. Additionally, LMO7 itself may function as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Alternative splicing of <i>LMO7<\/i> has the potential to modulate its function. Previously, we reported <i>LMO7<\/i> as a target that is alternatively spliced in prostate cancer (PCa) between self-reported Black and White patients. In addition, by analyzing expression of <i>LMO7<\/i> splice variants in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we previously reported increased expression of a <i>LMO7<\/i> splice variant skipping exon 12 in breast, lung and liver cancer compared with paired normal tissues. In the present study, we found that <i>LMO7<\/i> is downregulated in metastatic PCa specimens within the Stand Up To Cancer cohort. To investigate the functional impact of expression of the <i>LMO7<\/i> splice variant skipping exon 12 in PCa, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 methodology to delete <i>LMO7<\/i> exon 12 in PCa cells and assessed resulting alterations in PCa cell biology. The <i>LMO7<\/i> exon 12 deleted PC3 PCa cells exhibited enhanced migratory potential compared with parental PCa cells. An Immunofluorescence (IF) assay showed weak staining of cell-cell junctions in <i>LMO7<\/i> exon 12 deleted PCa cells compared with parental PCa cells. Moreover, IF staining showed retardation in f-actin in <i>LMO7<\/i> exon 12 deleted PCa cells compared with parental PCa cells. As E-Cadherin is often inhibited during EMT, we assessed the level of E-Cadherin by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These analyses revealed that E-Cadherin protein as well as messenger RNA is suppressed in <i>LMO7 <\/i>exon 12 deleted PCa cells compared with parental PCa cells. These findings suggest a role for skipping of <i>LMO7<\/i> exon 12 in disrupting PCa cell-cell junctions, down-regulating E-Cadherin in PCa and enhancing PCa cell migratory potential, consistent with EMT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Splice variants,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),RNA splicing,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The research involved evaluating AMIGO2 expression in patients with ovarian serous carcinoma using immunohistochemistry. The AMIGO2-high group exhibited significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the AMIGO2-low group. The predictive index of the AMIGO2-high group was considerably higher than that of the AMIGO2-low group. The rate of complete cytoreductive surgery was lower in the AMIGO2-high group than in the AMIGO2-low group. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that four serous ovarian cancer cell lines expressed AMIGO2 expression and adhesion to mesothelial cells. Adhesion to mesothelial cells was attenuated by AMIGO2 knockdown in SKOV3 cells. Moreover, in a murine model, AMIGO2 downregulation in SKOV3 cells significantly suppressed peritoneal dissemination.

The median survival of breast cancer patients who developed brain metastases (BrM) is less than a year even with the advanced treatment such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Regardless of high clinical significance, the pathological mechanism of brain metastasis is still poorly understood. Previously, we found that loss of lncRNA XIST robustly promote metastasis and specially brain metastasis in breast cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism was not fully understood. In following study, we found that loss of XIST has significantly altered lipid metabolism of breast cancer cells specifically increasing lipid droplet amount and PUFA incorporation. Instead of <i>de novo<\/i> syntheses, XISTl<sup>ow<\/sup> cancer cells acquire fatty acid by uptake from exogenous. We found that one X-linked gene, Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) which are highly upregulated after loss of XIST is responsible for the altered lipid metabolism. ACSL4 activated the free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lead to increased incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipids. On one hand, elevated ACLS4 expression leads to relative low PPAR pathway activation by decreasing the cellular free PUFA level which directly binds and activate PPAR. PPAR pathway is known to inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines which are important for cancer cells to establish brain metastasis. On the other hand, elevated ACSL4 expression enable cancer cells to metabolize the abundant PUFAs in the brain environment, thereby gaining survival advantage. However, increased PUFA incorporation into lipids especially phospholipids produce excess lipid ROS and sensitize cells to ferroptosis inducer such as RSL3. Our study has find out that brain microenvironment not only supports the outgrowth of <i>XIST<\/i> <sup>low<\/sup> cells by providing PUFAs for maintaining their metastatic properties but also sensitizes those cells to ferroptosis inducers, a potential therapy for treating this devastating disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast,Brain metastasis,Lipid metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Most MpBCs display a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype (ER-\/PR-\/HER2-). MpBCs exhibit the most dismal prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes. The standard of care for metastatic MpBC remains systemic chemotherapy, despite known resistance to most cytotoxic drugs. MpBCs are enriched with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. We previously described a unique molecular signature for breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) derived from patient biopsies and identified ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39) as a critical driver of treatment resistance, BCSCs self-renewal, and lung metastases in TNBC\/MpBC. Growing evidence has also demonstrated aberrant expression of the testis-specific ribosomal protein paralog 39L (RPL39L) in several cancer types. Here, we hypothesize that RPL39 and its paralog RPL39L alter ribosome composition and function to initiate a specific translational landscape that promotes tumor growth and enhanced metastatic potential in MpBC. We first examined the relative expression of RPL39 and RPL39L in TNBC\/MpBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) using real-time qPCR. We detected co-expression of RPL39\/RPL39L transcripts, however, RPL39L mRNA levels were significantly lower than RPL39. These results suggest that both RPL39 and RPL39L contribute to ribosome heterogeneity in TNBC\/MpBC. To investigate the function of RPL39\/RPL39L transcripts, we designed a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-strategy targeting their differential 5' untranslated region (5&#8217; UTR). Selective downregulation of RPL39 and RPL39L mRNA inhibited in vitro cell proliferation in TNBC\/MpBC models. Notably, combined targeted silencing of both RPL39 and RPL39L further decreased cell proliferation in comparison to individual siRNAs. We next evaluated the efficacy of RPL39\/RPL39L dual blockade in vivo using MpBC PDXs. MpBC PDX4664 was implanted into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice. Once tumors were established (100-150 mm<sup>3<\/sup>), mice received phosphate buffered saline (PBS controls) or 0.5 mg\/kg RPL39\/RPL39L siRNAs encapsulated into liposome-like nanoparticles (NPs) via tail vain (i.v.) injection. Animals were treated thrice a week for 21 days and sacrificed 48 h after the last injection. We found that siRNAs-NP formulation silenced RPL39\/RPL39L expression in vivo and significantly reduced tumor growth. Overall, our findings support the notion that RPL39\/RPL39L ribosome heterogeneity may confer preferential translation of oncogenic and BCSC-related genes, facilitating tumor progression and metastasis in MpBC. Ongoing studies are directed to validate ribosome heterogeneity by proteomic analysis and evaluate the role of RPL39\/RPL39L on global translation by ribosome profiling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer stem cell,Metastasis,Ribosomal heterogenity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

If melanoma has spread to distant sites, it is refractory to existing therapies with the 5-year survival rate declining to 17%.

This indicates a significant need for further study of metastasis pathways to find novel druggable targets. Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive childhood cancer that occurs in the bones or soft tissue. The five-year survival rate for Ewing sarcoma patients diagnosed with metastatic disease is still only 25%,<b> <\/b>making ES a good model for studying metastasis. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 transcriptional activation screen in a zebrafish xenograft model to discover genes whose activation leads to increased metastasis. The screen identified a number of genes that may accelerate ES metastasis; we chose <i>INAFM2<\/i> for further study because multiple unique INAFM2-targeting gRNAs were enriched in the screen and we discovered a potential link to metastasis and patient survival in publicly available clinical data. Overexpression of INAFM2 in six different cancer cell lines (four ES, one hepatocellular carcinoma, and one stomach adenocarcinoma) caused increased cell migration and chemotaxis <i>in vitro<\/i>, and increased intravasation in zebrafish xenografts. INAFM2 knockdown in four cancer cell lines (two ES, one clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and one stomach adenocarcinoma) decreased chemotaxis and rescue of INAFM2 expression restored the cells&#8217; ability to migrate. Analysis of patient tumor RNA sequencing data from many different types of cancers revealed correlations between INAFM2 expression and both an increased metastatic phenotype and poor patient survival. Further <i>in vivo <\/i>studies by tail vein injection of ES cells in immunodeficient mice demonstrated significantly increased gross metastases with INAFM2 overexpression and decreased gross metastases with INAFM2 knockdown compared to the respective control groups. This provides strong evidence for a substantial role of INAFM2 in cancer metastasis. Human <i>INAFM2<\/i> is an unstudied gene and our preliminary work has revealed that the INAFM2 protein localizes to the cell membrane, is glycosylated, and may be involved in Wnt and\/or MAPK pathway signaling. Inafm2 silencing by morpholino in zebrafish embryos lead to significant mortality, necrosis, and developmental delays\/defects including severe cardiac edema. Current studies are focused on further discerning the molecular pathways that mediate the role of INAFM2 in promoting metastasis using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models as well as characterizing the functional significance of the direct protein binding partners and post-translational modifications for INAFM2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Metastasis,Ewing sarcoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, the mechanisms underlying PD formation remain unclear, and a PD-specific signature has not been identified. PD development is thought to be influenced by various changes occurring in GC tumor cells and immune cells present in the peritoneal cavity. We previously performed RNA-seq analysis of cell components in cytology-positive (CY1) gastric cancer ascites. The results suggested that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltrate the abdominal cavity together with GC tumor cells and might be involved in PD development. In this study, we aimed to identify the specific TAMs responsible for promoting metastasis during the early stage of PD in GC. We demonstrated the abundant presence of TAMs in CY1 GC ascites using flow cytometry analysis and identified several genes that were significantly expressed in CY1 TAMs using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of these genes to serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD in GC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peritoneal metastasis,Gastric cancer,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

The High Mobility Group AT-Hook 2 (HMGA2) plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and has been implicated in tumorigenesis and the metastatic process. Our recent study revealed that overexpression of the wild-type\/full-length HMGA2 isoform in PCa cells promotes cancer progression by triggering epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas truncated HMGA2 isoform promotes progression through oxidative stress signaling. We hypothesize that HMGA2 regulates GPX4 expression and oxidative stress in PCa. We studied the expression of HMGA2 and GPX4 in various PCa cell lines including enzalutamide resistant cell line (C4-2B MDVR), LNCaP cells overexpressing HMGA2 isoforms (wild type and truncated HMGA2). Our analysis of HMGA2 and GPX4 expression in diverse PCa cell lines, shows an inverse relationship between HMGA2 and GPX4 levels. Elevated HMGA2 expression coincides with reduced GPX4 expression, leading to heightened oxidative stress and susceptibility to ferroptosis. Moreover, treatment of enzalutamide resistant cell line C4-2B MDVR with ferroptosis inducer RSL3, further suppresses GPX4 expression, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. Our results unveils the intricate relationship between HMGA2, GPX4 regulation and oxidative stress in the context of prostate cancer progression. Exploiting this oxidative stress pathway offers a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, especially for enzalutamide-resistant cancer cells.<br \/>Acknowledgements: These studies were supported by NIH\/NIGMS\/RISE SR25GM060414 and NIH\/NIMHD 2U54MD007590; 5U54MD013376.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Gene regulation,Oxidative stress,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

This is partially due to the low survival rate once CRC is diagnosed at a distant location. This warrants early diagnostic markers and an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process, anoikis resistance being one of them. Our laboratory analysis of the TCGA database comprising 519 human CRC tissues shows lncRNA UCA1 overexpressed in tumors compared to normal, and higher expression of lncRNA UCA1 is responsible for the progression, metastasis, and poor survival of CRC patients. In our anchorage-independent growth model (anoikis resistant), using isogenic (oncogenic and metastatic) cell lines, we observed a very high expression of lncRNA UCA1 along with GluT1 with increased cell survival. Cancer cells, however, appear to rapidly increase their glucose uptake and directly ferment it into lactate, even in the presence of oxygen and functional mitochondria. UCA1 has been found to play an essential role in the development of metastasis and dysregulation of glycolysis in various cancers. To verify if lncRNA UCA1 modulates anoikis resistance and glucose metabolism, we generated SW480+UCA1 overexpression (OE) and SW620+shUCA1 knockdown (KD) stable cell lines using lentiviral transduction. The OE GFP-expressing cell lines were further sorted, and grown in puromycin. The KD cell lines were selected with puromycin for the generation of stable cell lines. The stable cell lines were characterized through different phenotypic assays. UCA1 OE cell lines have a higher glucose uptake and the UCA1 KD cell lines have a lower glucose uptake. The lactate production is high in the KD and low in OE cell lines. The OE and KD cell lines along with the control cell lines were subjected to an anoikis model, and glucose and lactate analysis were performed accordingly. RT-PCR and western blot analysis were performed for the target genes responsible for cell survival, stemness, and glucose metabolism. We are analyzing the Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR), Oxidative Consumption Rate (OCR), ATP production rate the rate and potential max rate of glycolysis, and the mitochondrial stress of the recombinant cell lines using the &#8220;Agilent Seahorse XF&#8221;. The role of lncRNA UCA1 in anoikis resistance leading to metastasis and modulating glucose metabolism will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of CRC metastasis. This information will be beneficial for developing more unique strategies for the treatment of this metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"lncRNA,Anoikis,Metastasis,Glucose metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Although the characteristic cancer glycoconjugates are widely used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, our knowledge about cancer glycome remains quite fragmented due to the technique limitations in analyzing glycan chains with tremendous structural and functional heterogeneity.<br \/>Method: Given the dysregulated cancer glycome is defined by the altered glycosylation machinery, here we performed a systematic loss-of-function screen on 498 genes involved in glycosylation for key regulators of OC dissemination. We identified neuraminidase 4 (NEU4), an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates, as a vital peritoneal dissemination-promoting modifier of OC glycome. What&#8217;s more, we also identified membrane proteins whose sialylation was able to be modified by NEU4 in OC cells by pull down and mass spectrum to investigate the functional significance of NEU4-mediated desialylation.<br \/>Results: In human patients with high-grade serous OC (HGSOC), increased NEU4 was detected in the disseminated OC cells when compared with that in the primary tumor cells, which significantly correlated with the worse survival. Among three alternative splice-generated isoforms of human NEU4, we revealed that only the plasma membrane-localized NEU4 isoform 2 (NEU4-iso2) and intracellular isoform 3 promoted the peritoneal dissemination of OC by enhancing the cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We also identified NEU4-iso2-regulated cell surface glycoproteome and found that NEU4-iso2 desialylated the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), in particular at N196 residue, for the hyperactivation of EGFR and its downstream tumor-promoting signaling cascades.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results provide new insights into how the OC glycome is dysregulated by NEU4 during OC progression and reveals a functionally important glycosite on EGFR for its abnormal activation in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Signaling pathways,Cancer,Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

To uncover the underlying role of USP13 in HGSOC, we developed a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of HGSOC. <i>Ovgp1-iCreER<sup>T2<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>;Pten<sup>flox\/flox <\/sup><\/i>mouse (OPT) was crossed with Rosa26<sup>-LSL-<i>Usp13<\/i><\/sup> knockin mouse model (U), generating <i>Ovgp1-iCreER<sup>T2<\/sup>;Trp53<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>;Pten<sup>flox\/flox <\/sup><\/i>; Rosa26<sup>-LSL-<i>Usp13<\/i><\/sup> mouse model (OPTU). Usp13 overexpression with loss of p53 and Pten was induced specifically in fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells in OPTU mice. OPTU mice demonstrated the development of STIC and early HGSOC in the fallopian tube as well as invasive metastatic HGSOC. While OPT tumors largely retained mucinous and HGSOC subtypes, displaying limited metastatic behavior, OPTU tumors exhibited more complex ovarian tumor subtypes, including mucinous, HGSOC, and Mixed Mesodermal Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) histology. Furthermore, OPTU tumors showed invasive and metastatic phenotypes, characterized by an increased incidence of ovary invasion, metastasis to distant organs, and ascites development. Importantly, OPTU-driven HGSOC tumors closely resemble human HGSOC histology features, making the OPTU model a valuable tool for exploring fallopian tube-originated ovarian cancer. Primary ovarian cancer cells established from ascites of the OPTU mouse reproduced metastatic HGSOC tumorigenesis in the syngeneic mouse study. Stable USP13 knockdown in OPTU cells exhibited reduced cell proliferation and metastatic abilities in 2D and 3D cultures. In summary, this study underscores the pivotal role of USP13 in facilitating metastasis in fallopian tube-originated HGOSC. Our findings may provide a promising avenue for future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the aggressive nature of USP13-amplified fallopian tube-originated HGOSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Metastatic potential,GEMM,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The high mortality is directly associated with metastatic disease which is thought to be initiated by colon cancer stem cells according to cancer stem cell (CSC) model. Consequently, early identification of those patients who are at high risk for metastasis is crucial for improved treatment and patient outcome. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) is a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor progression and metastasis formation independent of tumor stage. We previously showed an involvement of MACC1 in cancer stemness in the mouse intestine of our transgenic mouse models. However, the expression of MACC1 in human CSCs and possible implications remain elusive. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which MACC1 regulates stemness and CSC-associated invasive phenotype based on patient-derived 3D cell culture models (PD3D), patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and human CRC cell lines. We showed that CD44-enriched CSCs from PD3D models express significantly higher levels of MACC1 and display higher tumorigenicity in immunocompromised mice. Similarly, RNA sequencing performed on PD3D and PDX models demonstrated significantly increased MACC1 expression in ALDH1(+) CSCs, highlighting its involvement in cancer stemness. We further showed the correlation of MACC1 with CSC markers CD44, NANOG and LGR5 in PD3D models as well as established cell lines. Additionally, MACC1 increased stem cell gene expression, clonogenicity and sphere formation. Strikingly, we showed that MACC1 binds as a transcription factor to the LGR5 gene promoter uncovering the long-known CSC marker LGR5 as novel essential signaling mediator used by MACC1 to induce CSC-like properties in human CRC patients. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> findings were further substantiated by significant positive correlation of MACC1 and LGR5 in CRC cell lines as well as CRC patient tumors. Taken together, this study indicates that the metastasis-inducer MACC1 act as a cancer stem cell-associated marker. Interventional approaches targeting MACC1 would potentially improve further targeted therapies for colorectal cancer patients to eradicate CSCs, prevent cancer recurrence and distant metastasis formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Stemness,MACC1,LGR5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

However, despite decades of widespread breast &#38; colon cancer (CA) screening and interceptive surgeries, there hasn't been any decrease in metastatic (M) stages, a discrepancy that undermines the validity of this principle. Others suggested unlinking tumorigenesis from metastasis, supporting an evolutionarily convergent model. We reasoned that cells' ability to circulate (physiologic in white blood cells) is mediated by putative gene(s)-encoded metastatic apparatus (MA), hence subject to alteration during the genomic turmoil of tumorigenesis. It follows that essential components of MA cannot be chromosomally deleted in M CAs; stage I CA may indicate deactivated MA. The overarching goal here is to identify genes encoding the putative MA. Chromosomal deletions are relevant since they are definitive, testable and inform mutational and epigenetic events. Of note, the retained gene list (RGL) in any CA includes cell-viability genes (CVG).<br \/>Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a well-curated, clinically annotated public database. We examined copy number variation to determine the RGL1 in stage 1 cancers (CVG); and RGL2 in metastatic CAs. To account for possible heterogeneity or redundancy in MA in different CA types, we performed the RGL2 analysis within organ systems.

Increasing evidence shows that cancer cells can disseminate from early primary lesions that are impalpable, but the pathways are poorly understood. Her2 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by suppressing p38, but how Her2 downregulates p38 is unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying suppression of p38 by Her2 in breast cancer early dissemination using cell models and xenograft models of early lesions of breast cancer.<br \/>(b)We studied the role of Wip1, a p38 phosphatase, in disseminating phenotypes in cell line models of breast cancer early lesions, including cell motility measured in transwell assays, cell invasion measured by percentage of organoids with outward invading cells, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) measured by levels of EMT markers in Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining assays.<br \/>(c)We demonstrate that high levels of Wip1 correlated with Her2+ status, and reduced phosphorylation of p38 and its downstream effectors MK2 and Hsp27 in tissue samples from early lesions of human breast cancer. In addition, ectopic expression of Wip1 reduced phosphorylation of p38, MK2 and Hsp27 in cell models of breast cancer early lesions.We found that Wip1 promoted migration, invasion and EMT, while Wip1 knockdown abrogated the ability of Her2 to induce these disseminating phenotypes, in cell line models of early lesion breast cancer. Thus, Wip1 induction is both sufficient, and necessary for Her2, to promote migration, invasion and EMT in early lesion breast cancer cells. In an attempt to identify the Wip1 downstream effectors involved in disseminating phenotypes, we found that ectopic expression of the constitutively active mutants of p38 reversed the ability of Wip1 to suppress MK2 and Hsp27 phosphorylation and to induce migration, invasion and EMT in early lesion breast cancer cells. These results suggest that Wip1 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by suppressing p38. We investigate the mechanism by which Her2 induces Wip1 expression. Ectopic expression of Her2 did not alter the level of Wip1 mRNA or the Wip1 protein stability, suggesting that Her2 promote Wip1 expression by regulating its translation. We are currently investigating the mechanism by which Her2 induces Wip1 translation.Moreover, inhibitors of Her2, Wip1 and Skp2 can each reduce the disseminating phenotypes in cells models of breast cancer early lesions ectopically expressing Her2, Wip1 or Skp2.<br \/>(d)Our findings identify the Her2-Wip1-p38-Mk2-Hsp27 cascade as a novel mechanism mediating breast cancer early dissemination and provide a basis for new therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination in Her2+ breast cancer using inhibitors for Her2, Wip1 or Skp2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wip1,p38,Early dissemination,Her2+ breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nan Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"928287f4-3dec-4fa0-a0e4-c580ca89d3e8","ControlNumber":"5387","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

The key molecules involved in cirrhosis-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis have not been clearly defined. Understanding the oncogenic pathways and their associations with cancer growth, metastasis and drug resistance may help scientists devise new effective therapeutic agents. In the present study, we identified the intermediate filament-forming protein keratin X (KRTX) as a key factor in cirrhosis-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. KRTX was highly expressed in HCC tissues and correlated with poor survival outcomes. Experimental verification revealed that overexpression of KRTX enhanced cell growth, tumor cell metastasis, glycolysis and sorafenib resistance. Conversely, knockdown of KRTX led to opposite effects. Mechanistically, KRTX inhibited AMPK&#945; phosphorylation, thereby enhancing Snail protein stability. Additionally, TGF&#946;1 positively regulated <i>KRTX<\/i> expression, resulting in a KRTX\/AMPK&#945; (Thr172)\/Snail axis-mediated increase in cell motility.

PD-L1 also performs oncogenic functions within cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms of PD-L1 internalization and signaling remain largely unknown. Here, we report a new mechanism whereby altered ceramide metabolism via ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) drives PD-L1 internalization to potentiate a TGF&#946;\/Shh\/&#946;-catenin signaling axis to drive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) migration and metastasis. In response to altered ceramide metabolism, we observed that PD-L1 is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and depends on S278\/S279 in its cytoplasmic domain. Once internalized, PD-L1 directly interacts with Caprin-1, an RNA-binding protein previously unassociated with PD-L1 signaling. Through our analysis of clinical specimens, we established a positive association between PD-L1\/Caprin-1 interaction and metastatic progression in human TNBC. In terms of mechanism, we determined that the PD-L1\/Caprin-1 complex plays a pivotal role in mediating CerS4-dependent cell migration. This complex selectively binds and stabilizes mRNA, resulting in heightened TGF&#946;\/Shh\/&#946;-catenin signaling. Conversely, CerS4 restoration in metastatic TNBC cells impaired cellular migration and the interaction between PD-L1 and Caprin-1. Genetic depletion of CerS4 enhanced lung metastasis derived from 4T1 orthotopic allografts and transgenic MMTV-PyMT breast tumors concomitant with PD-L1\/Caprin-1 interaction and TGF&#946;\/Shh\/&#946;-catenin signaling. Bioinformatics analysis of clinical datasets was used to validate the impact of the CerS4\/PD-L1\/Caprin-1 axis on metastatic progression in human TNBC. In alignment with enhanced tumor progression, CerS4 depletion in tumors promoted regulatory T-cell infiltration, suggesting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Treatment with sonidegib, an FDA-approved Hedgehog (Hh) inhibitor, effectively prevented PD-L1 internalization and its interaction with Caprin-1. We hypothesized that sonidegib could synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to sensitize TNBC to immunotherapy, which typically has low response rates. Sonidegib, in combination with &#945;PD-L1 therapy, was significantly more effective in controlling TNBC primary and metastatic tumor growth, especially when Cers4 was downregulated, compared to &#945;PD-L1 monotherapy. Our data also suggested that this potent anti-tumor effect was due to immunotherapy sensitization after combined flow cytometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence, and bulk RNA-sequencing analyses. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a mechanism to define intracellular PD-L1 signaling in response to altered ceramide metabolism, providing a new therapeutic strategy to target TNBC metastasis and improve response to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Ceramide,Metastasis,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Gastric cancer mortality is largely due to its high level of invasiveness and metastasis to distal organs. Thus, it is an urgent priority to identify mechanisms underlying GC metastasis to improve cancer diagnosis develop of effective biological targeting agents. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphoglyceric acid mutase-1 (PGAM1) was preferentially over-expressed in lymph node metastasis (LNM) tissues of GC patients and correlated with poor prognosis. PGAM1 knock down in two human GC cell lines resulted in impaired cell proliferation and increased cell cycle arrest. Further, PGAM knockdown inhibited migration of both GC cell lines, which correlated with decreased expression of MMP2, MMP9 and ICAM-1. In a murine xenograft model, GC cells with a PGAM1 knockdown displayed decreased growth capacity <i>in vivo. <\/i>Western blot analysis showed that PGAM1 knockdown in SGC7901 and BGC823 decreased the phosphorylation of Src, FAK and Paxillin relative to the parental cell lines. These results indicate that PGAM1 may play an important role in promoting GC lymph node metastasis by driving cell proliferation and activating cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration through the regulating Src\/FAK\/Paxillin pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Gastric cancer,Migration,Cytoskeleton,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.

Its human product is endowed with oncogenic properties, notably promoting gastrointestinal cancer growth and metastasis. Here, we reveal that the oncogenic action of POU5F1B requires ubiquitination of lysine residues found only in the human protein. This post-translational modification is essential for POU5F1B to localize to the cytoplasm and become acylated by the DHHC17 palmitoyltransferase. This leads to POU5F1B association with detergent-resistant membrane subdomains, where it triggers the accumulation of integrins and signaling molecules, and to a stimulation of cell focal adhesion. Finally, we determined that POU5F1B stability is critically dependent on ROCK, a crucial regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,human-restricted oncoprotein,membrane nanodomains,cell adhesion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.
