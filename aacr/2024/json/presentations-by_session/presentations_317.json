[{"Abstract":"KAT6A and its paralog KAT6B are histone acetyltransferases (HATs) which direct chromatin structural rearrangement and subsequent changes in gene transcription through acetylation of histones, primarily specific lysine residues on histone H3. KAT6A is modified in cancer, including genomic amplification, overexpression, mutation, as well as genetic rearrangement, resulting in the production of fusion proteins. Dysregulation of this MYST family member and its acetyl transferase activity is known to drive gene expression and tumorigenic progression in cancers. An inhibitor of KAT6A and KAT6B entered phase 1 clinical trials (NCT04606446). With continuous daily dosing, durable partial responses were seen in estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients who had progressed on a prior endocrine therapy and CDK4\/6 inhibitor. In that study, evidence of dose dependent pharmacodynamics (H3K23Ac inhibition) was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and paired tumor biopsies (Sommerhalder, ASCO2023). Isosterix has developed a series of structurally diverse small molecule KAT6A-selective inhibitors which engage at the active site in the acetyl CoA substrate binding pocket. Lead compounds are selective for KAT6A and have significant potency and cellular activity in a variety of assays; they inhibit KAT6A-mediated histone acetylation in a biochemical assay as well as pharmacodynamic dose-dependent inhibition of histone acetylation in the breast cancer tumor cell line ZR-75-1. These compounds reduce cell viability of ZR-75-1 in 10 days with continuous compound administration, confirming the dependence of this cell line on KAT6A acetyl transferase activity for proliferation and cell cycle progression. Lead inhibitors are orally bioavailable with excellent pharmacokinetic properties in rodents. They demonstrate dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy with minimal weight loss with continuous daily dosing in mouse xenograft tumor models. Inhibitors against this novel epigenetic target demonstrate the potential for efficacy in not only ER+ breast cancer but also other tumor indications which exhibit transcriptional induction dependent on KAT6A-directed chromatin remodeling. Selection of a lead candidate is planned for early 2024 with IND enabling studies to follow.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone acetylation,Breast cancer,Epigenetics,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Menin inhibitors have shown promising anti-leukemic effects in KMT2A-rearranged and NPM1-mutated AML. However, the efficacy of menin inhibitors as single agents may be limited by the development of resistance mutations. Combining menin inhibitors with other epigenetic drugs may present a strategy to enhance their therapeutic potential. In this study, we performed a combination drug screen using an epigenetic drug library in KMT2A-rearranged (MV4;11) and NPM1-mutant (OCI-AML3) AML cell lines to identify synergistic therapies that can be used in conjunction with menin inhibitors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> During assay optimization, MV4;11 and OCI-AML3 cells were treated with the menin inhibitor DSP-5336, and their viability was assessed. Quality control metrics were applied with Z&#8217; values consistently greater than 0.5 for all assay plates and then the cells were subjected to a small molecule compound library screen containing a set of 932 epigenetic drugs. The screening process included a systematic evaluation of each drug's effect on cell viability in combination with the DSP-5336.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The combination drug screen demonstrated robust performance in both MV4;11 and OCI-AML3 cell lines, with reliable quality control metrics. Among the epigenetic drugs tested, five compounds were identified as potential hits that synergistically enhanced the efficacy of DSP-5336 across both cell lines.The five identified compounds exhibited enhanced anti-leukemic effects when combined with the menin inhibitor in either one of the cell lines. The targets of these drugs varied, including histone deacetylases, histone acetyltransferases and BRD4 inhibition, suggesting many alternate mechanisms of action involving epigenetic modulation. Remarkably, one of the 5 hits C301-3161, a KAT2A inhibitor, showed limited activity in either cell line alone but increased cell killing with DSP-5336 in both cell lines, highlighting its potential as a specific therapeutic for combining with DSP-5336 in AML patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our findings suggest combining menin inhibitors with other epigenetic drugs may improve AML treatment outcomes. The combination drug screen successfully identified four novel compounds that synergistically enhance menin inhibitor efficacy in both KMT2A-rearranged and NPM1-mutant AML cell lines. These compounds hold significant promise as potential therapeutic candidates for further investigation. Future studies should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of action for each hit and evaluating their effects in preclinical animal models.

Therefore, there is a critical need for therapies that prevent disease dissemination in both early and late-stage disease presentations. Among the recent novel therapeutic combinations that have transformed the treatment landscape of NSCLC is an approach developed in our lab and others utilizing DNA methyltransferase inhibition (DNMTi) paired with histone deacetylase inhibition (HDACi) to sensitize patients to immunotherapy. However, most patients do not benefit durably from epigenetic therapy alone or in combination with other therapies.<br \/>In this study, we identified STAT3 as an actionable target in tumor cells that synergizes with epigenetic therapy (DNMTi+HDACi). We and others have previously shown that STAT3 signaling is augmented after epigenetic therapy. To interrogate the importance of this finding, we treated a panel of 12 human NSCLC cell lines with STAT3i+epigenetic therapy and identified five cell lines demonstrating a synergistic reduction of cell viability. These <i>in vitro <\/i>monolayer<i> <\/i>observations were recapitulated in an intermediate complexity 3D model, thus providing orthogonal validation of response applicability in a more treatment-resistant setting.<br \/>In addition to phenotypic characterization, we deployed RNA sequencing to define the whole transcriptome consequences of our novel therapeutic paradigm. These transcriptional data showed that STAT3i+epigenetic therapy suppressed cell cycle and activated apoptotic pathways, which were validated by immunoblotting and flow cytometry-based approaches. We further demonstrated a significant and durable reduction in colony formation after treatment with STAT3i+epigenetic therapy. Additionally, we observed significant perturbation of a subset of genes involved in both epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and suppression of glutamine and fatty acid metabolism.<br \/>Reliance on glutamine is considered a hallmark of cancer metabolism. Furthermore, glutamine metabolism has been implicated in the plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell states, which is required for metastatic success. Additionally, survival of metastatic cells requires upregulation of pathways that promote anchorage-independent growth and anoikis resistance, which are suppressed in our phenotypic and transcriptional data, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest <b>1.<\/b> STAT3i+epigenetic therapy diminishes the ability of NSCLC cells to survive and return to a colony-forming state and <b>2<\/b>. This phenotype is associated with metabolic dysfunction. Our studies therefore provide a basis for the development of novel strategies to intercept metastatic recolonization by impairing circulating tumor cells from seeding distant sites.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Stemness,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

While multiple actionable genetic mutations have been identified as the underlying molecular basis of resistance, a genomic mechanism cannot be identified in &#62;50% of Osimertinib resistant tumors and thus an effective combinatorial treatment strategy cannot be deployed for these patients. Recently, we identified YAP\/TEAD activation and ERK1\/2 reactivation as two major non-mutational counter-regulatory pathways that diminish the efficacy of Osimertinib, promoting establishment of the drug tolerant persister (DTP) and resistant states. Moreover, it is well known that cancer cells escape tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy by developing dependence on alternate, non-mutated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through a treatment-induced &#8220;RTK switch&#8221; phenomenon. The link however between alternate RTK signaling and YAP\/TEAD\/ERK1\/2 has never been explored in the context of Osimertinib resistance. In this study, we systemically uncover transcriptional de-repression of, and critical dependence on PDGFR&#946; as part of a novel &#8220;RTK switch&#8221; mechanism deployed by cells to evade Osimertinib-induced death. Genetic or pharmacologic co-inhibition of PDGFR&#946; renders NSCLC cells more sensitive to Osimertinib during drug na&#239;ve, DTP and resistant phases of treatment through suppression of ERK1\/2 reactivation, YAP activity\/nuclear translocation and YAP-mediated induction of EMT factors, SLUG and Zeb2. Importantly, compared to Osimertinib alone, co-targeting EGFR and PDGFR&#946; robustly suppresses tumor regrowth following treatment cessation both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>which is consistent with a reduction in the DTP cell population. These data auspiciously demonstrate a two-fold utility of concomitant PDGFR&#946; inhibition: to enhance the initial efficacy of Osimertinib and to eliminate the DTP and resistant cells following chronic Osimertinib treatment. Further mechanistic studies from integration of ATAC-seq, CUT&#38;RUN and RNA-seq reveal that Osimertinib induces the dynamic cooperativity of chromatin modulator BRD4 with pluripotent POU-domain transcription factors Oct-4, Pit-1 and Brn-3 at putative proximal enhancer elements, facilitating upregulation of PDGFR&#946;. Collectively, we demonstrate a novel treatment-induced BRD4\/POUF epigenetic\/transcriptional mediated &#8220;RTK switch&#8221; that involves co-opting PDGFR&#946; signaling to activate YAP\/TEAD and ERK1\/2 as a means of driving adaptive resistance to Osimertinib.

Dysregulation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and leads to gene silencing, is common in PCa and correlates with poor prognosis. EED, a core PRC2 component, is crucial for histone methyltransferase activity. MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, is often amplified or overexpressed in PCa and associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. We evaluated antitumor activity and molecular mechanisms of EED inhibitor APG-5918\/EEDi-5273 and MDM2 selective inhibitor alrizomadlin in preclinical PCa models. Human castration-resistant (22Rv1) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP) PCa cell lines were used in antiproliferation assays. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo luminescent assays. Western blotting was used to explore mechanisms of action. Subcutaneous 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models were established to evaluate antitumor effects of APG-5918 and alrizomadlin <i>in vivo<\/i>. Single-agent APG-5918 or alrizomadlin had limited inhibition on PCa cell growth; combined, they demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity. In the 22Rv1 CDX model, single-agent alrizomadlin (100 mg\/kg) or APG-5918 (100 mg\/kg) administered for 26 days exerted no\/limited antitumor activity, with treatment-to-control (T\/C) values of 93.39% and 49.89%, respectively. In contrast, the doublet enhanced antitumor activity (T\/C value, 33.22%), with a synergistic index of 1.40. In the LNCaP CDX model, APG-5918 (100 mg\/kg) administered for 28 days exhibited minimal antitumor effects (T\/C value on last day of dosing, 80.32%). Alrizomadlin (100 or 50 mg\/kg) showed limited antitumor activity (T\/C value, 47.61%). Combined treatment significantly enhanced antitumor activity (T\/C value, 15.69%), with a synergistic index of 2.44. Regarding putative mechanisms, western blot analyses showed that APG-5918 downregulated oncogenic drivers and DNA methylation factors (UHRF1, DNMT1) and on-target-related pharmacodynamic markers (H3K27me3, EED, EZH2). Alrizomadlin markedly downregulated UHRF1 and DNMT1, and upregulated p53 and p21 expression. Combined treatment further enhanced downregulation of DNMT1, UHRF1, cell cycle pathway proteins (pRb, CDK6), antiapoptotic protein MCL-1, and synergistically increased cleavage of PARP-1, a marker of apoptosis. In summary, we show that<b> <\/b>targeting EED and MDM2 synergistically enhances antitumor activity in PCa cell lines and CDX models. Mechanistically, this combination likely modulated pathways related to DNA methylation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. The findings provide a scientific rationale for future clinical development of APG-5918 and alrizomadlin for PCa patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synergism,EED,MDM2,Castration-resistant prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Cancer survival has improved over the past four decades for all the most common cancers except cervical and EC, calling for significant treatment advancements. Progesterone receptor (PR) is a favorable prognostic marker for EC and other solid tumors. However, PR expression has been shown to be reduced or lost in these malignant tumors, which correlates with worse patient survival and limits the effectiveness of progestin therapy. Thus, restoring functional PR expression is vital to sensitizing tumor cells to progestin therapy, enhancing EC clinical interventions, and improving patient outcomes. In this project, we aim to restore functional PR expression.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To visualize PR expression in real-time, we constructed an innovative endogenous PR reporter gene transfected EC cells. This system facilitated screening potential small molecular PR inducers from the FDA-approved oncology drug library. Sixteen drugs were identified to increase PR expression; topoisomerase II inhibitors (Top IIi), mitoxantrone and idarubicin were the top hits. Drug effect of Top IIi, as well as HDAC inhibitor romidepsin, dual PI3k\/HDAC inhibitor CUDC-907, and PHB2 inhibitors, fluorizoline (FLZ) and rocaglamide (RocA), were evaluated as single drug or in combination. Potential PR repressors, including G9a, HDAC2, PHB2, and Top2A, were knocked down using siRNA, shRNA, or CRISPR-Cas9 in EC cells and PR expression was analyzed. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was also conducted to validate bona fide PR repressors.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Mitoxantrone and idarubicin were validated to be effective PR inducers. G9a, HDAC2, PHB2, and Top2A were confirmed PR repressors. Single treatment with mitoxantrone, idarubicin, romidepsin , CUDC-907 , FLZ , and RocA achieved effective inhibition of EC cell proliferation and enhanced PR expression except FLZ and RocA. Combined romidepsin with Topi or PHB2i demonstrated additive or synergistic effects. More importantly, dual treatment of CUDC-907 with mitoxantrone enhanced PR expression compared to a single treatment or no treatment control. Our mass spectrometry and ChIP assay by specific antibodies against HDAC2 and PHB2 revealed that potential mechanisms include PHB2 forming a complex with HDAC2 that binds on the PR promoter, thus inhibiting PR transcription.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Co-treatment of CUDC-907 with Top2Ai increased PR expression and enhanced cell death in EC cell lines, indicating a potential treatment strategy.<b> <\/b><i>In vivo<\/i> studies utilizing our EC-PDX models will further validate the efficacy of restoring PR expression and suppressing EC tumor growth.

Despite their importance, many of these proteins are considered undruggable due to challenges in modeling their activity in vitro.<br \/>Methods: We have addressed these shortcomings by implementing a live-cell Regulome profiling approach that quantifies the global activity of TFs without the need for cell manipulation or genome engineering, called TF-Scan.

Despite the near ubiquity of VHL loss, evidence suggests that it alone is insufficient to drive tumor establishment. Additional loss of function (LOF) mutations in epigenetic regulatory proteins including <i>PBRM1<\/i>, <i>SETD2<\/i> and <i>BAP1<\/i> have been identified as tumor drivers. The frequency and penetrance of these mutations in epigenetic regulators implicates a vulnerability in ccRCC that may be exploited to develop new therapies. To explore this vulnerability, the Ailles lab completed a screen of the Structural Genomics Consortium&#8217;s (SGC) epiprobe library - a panel of inhibitors targeting an array of epigenetic regulators in patient derived ccRCC models. Among the several promising targets identified, a particularly favorable inhibition profile was noted for MS023, an inhibitor of the type I protein arginine methyltransferase family (PRMT1\/3\/4\/6 and 8). PRMTs transfer methyl groups to nuclear histones and cytoplasmic targets, influencing gene expression, mRNA processing and viability. This growth inhibition was corroborated using an additional type I PRMT compound, GSK3368715. CRISPR-mediated deletion of type I PRMT targets indicated that PRMT1 is the main enzyme responsible for growth inhibition in our ccRCC models. Furthermore, genetic depletion of PRMT1 <i>via<\/i> shRNA phenocopied pharmacological inhibition and proliferative growth was restored in the presence of MS023 by overexpressing PRMT1. Finally, MS023 treatment of mice bearing ccRCC cell line and patient derived xenografts led to significant inhibition of tumor growth <i>in vivo. <\/i>Transcriptomic profiling of chemical treatment and PRMT1 genetic depletion demonstrated that PRMT1 inhibition triggers a significant down regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression and DNA damage. ccRCC cells treated with MS023 accumulated significant levels of DNA damage before undergoing cell death, with several DDR-related proteins being down-regulated. Proximity ligation and proteomic analysis (Bio-ID) revealed that PRMT1&#8217;s interactors skew heavily towards RNA metabolism regulators and widespread alterations in mRNA processing were noted with MS023 treatment. Evidence continues to mount that PRMT1 is implicated in the biology of cancer, but to our knowledge, no thorough investigations have been performed in the context of ccRCC. Our data suggests that inhibition of PRMT1 inhibits processing of mRNA transcripts, compromises DDR mechanisms, leading to an accumulation of double stranded breaks, cytostasis and cell death. Thus PRMT1 represents a viable therapeutic target in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Renal cell carcinoma,Spliceosome,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Paralogs CREBBP and EP300, in association with co-factors, are hijacked during leukemogenesis by aberrant transcriptional factors, thus driving blast proliferation and maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype. Here, we introduce IACS-16559, a bromodomain inhibitor targeting CREBBP\/EP300. IACS-16559 is highly selective for the bromodomains of CBP and EP300 versus BRD4, showing a dose-dependent inhibition of H3K27 acetylation residue <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i>. In addition, IACS-16559 pharmacokinetic properties show low clearances, high oral exposures and predicted QD dosing in human. We screened AML cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> for their response to IACS-16559 and identified specific subtypes of AML that exhibit heightened sensitivity to CBP\/EP300 inhibition, specifically AML with AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 rearrangements, and AML featuring mutations in the nucleophosmin (NPM1c) gene. IACS-16559 inhibited proliferation of AML responder cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>, halted cell cycle progression, with an accumulation of cells in G1 and a decrease of cells in S phase. IACS-16559 did not induce apoptosis across a panel of AML cell lines, indicating that induction of apoptosis is not a major mechanism of action of CBP\/EP300 inhibition. To augment the anti-tumor effects of IACS-16559, we prioritized the pharmacological combination of CBP\/EP300 and MLL-Menin inhibitors. This combination synergistically impeded cell proliferation and potently triggered apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, whereas none of the individual agents alone had this effect. The changes in gene and surface marker expression produced by these treatments, as single agents and in combination with synergistic effects, were in line with an induced myeloid differentiation phenotype. Collectively, our findings provide a compelling basis for further exploring the use of a CBP\/EP300 bromodomain inhibitor in conjunction with an inhibitor of the MLL-Menin interaction in a subset of AML patients with MLL rearrangements or NPM1 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p300,Acute myeloid leukemia,Epigenetics,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Ciro Zanca<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Soth<sup><\/sup>, Guang Gao<sup><\/sup>, Jason Gay<sup><\/sup>, Ningping Feng<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Bristow<sup><\/sup>, Kang Le<sup><\/sup>, Quanyun Xu<sup><\/sup>, Phuong Nguyen<sup><\/sup>, Yongying Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Teresa Perry<sup><\/sup>, Faika Mseeh<sup><\/sup>, Paul Leonard<sup><\/sup>, Jason Cross<sup><\/sup>, Virginia Giuliani<sup><\/sup>, Joe Marszalek<sup><\/sup>, Philip Jones<sup><\/sup>, Tim Heffernan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"72c18199-104b-4405-bb0a-9214be5dab7b","ControlNumber":"5585","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

BRM and BRG1 are mutually exclusive enzymatic subunits of BAF complexes, and functional genomic screens have shown a synthetic lethal relationship between the two genes. BRG1 is frequently mutated in cancer, including in approximately 10% of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Selective inhibition of BRM is a mechanism by which BRG1-mutated cancer cell growth would be affected by losing BRM function, while normal tissues should be spared as they still express functional BRG1. Given that the ATPase domains of BRM and BRG1 are 92% identical, the identification of selective enzymatic inhibitors of BRM has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of novel, highly potent compounds that selectively inhibit BRM over BRG1 as seen in cell-based transcription and proliferation assays, that also possess excellent oral pharmacokinetics. Our lead compounds inhibit BRM in a cell-based reporter assay with an unbound IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1 nM and are greater than 20-fold selective over BRG1. They are also selective against other helicases and do not show any significant activity in off-target screening panels. Dosing of mice carrying BRG1-mutant xenografts causes target gene modulation that is correlated with compound exposure. Treatment of A549 and RERF-LC-AI xenografts with lead compounds led to tumor growth inhibition of 87% and 96%, respectively, at well-tolerated doses, and significant tumor growth inhibition was also achieved in multiple other BRG1-mutant models. The results suggest that our compounds have first-in-class potential as potent and selective BRM ATPase inhibitors for the treatment of BRG1-mutated cancers, and we are planning to file an IND in 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,BRM,SMARCA2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one such regulatory mechanism involves post transcriptional modification of RNAs. The most abundant post transcriptional modification is methylation of adenosine at the N6 position (m<sup>6<\/sup>A). This modification is catalyzed by the m<sup>6<\/sup>A &#8220;writer&#8221;, METTL3 and METTL14 complex, and is removed by &#8220;erasers&#8221; such as FTO and ALKBH5. m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNAs can regulate a variety of cellular processes which can impact tumor phenotypes, including RNA stability, splicing, and nuclear export; and METTL3 catalytic inhibitors are currently in clinical development for AML and other cancers (NCT05584111).The m<sup>6<\/sup>A &#8220;reader&#8221;, YTHDC1, has been recognized as a critical contributor to the proliferation and survival of AML cells. As the primary nuclear m<sup>6<\/sup>A reader, YTHDC1 localizes with m<sup>6<\/sup>A marked RNAs in phase-separated assemblies, termed biomolecular condensates, helping to maintain the stability of oncogenic transcripts such as <i>MYC<\/i>. Here, we have employed our proprietary microfluidics based screening platform (termed PhaseScan<sup>TM<\/sup>) to identify modulators of YTHDC1 biomolecular condensates. Evaluation of early screening hits helped identify that disruption of the interaction between YTHDC1 and m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA is a functionally relevant mechanism of action (MoA) that results in dissolution of YTHDC1 condensates. Using computational and knowledge based approaches, we have identified other structurally distinct inhibitors that occupy the RNA binding pocket of YTHDC1 and disrupt its interaction with m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA at nanomolar potencies. These compounds disrupt cellular YTHDC1 condensates, suppress oncogenic gene expression, and result in anti proliferative and pro-differentiation phenotypes in AML cell lines. Compounds are selective for YTHDC1 over other YTH family members and are also selective in dissolving YTHDC1 condensates over other nuclear and cytosolic condensate systems. Our optimized chemical matter has suitable ADME properties to support <i>in vivo<\/i> studies. Thus, targeting YTHDC1 biomolecular condensates represents a novel approach to the treatment of AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Acute myeloid leukemia,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

However, an increasing frequency of CRPC-Adeno tumors progress to the highly aggressive and lethal neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) by acquiring a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype as a mechanism of therapeutic resistance. This transformation from CRPC-Adeno to NEPC requires distinct epigenetic reprogramming by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which can be exploited for development of novel therapies to target NEPC. LSD1 is upregulated in NEPC and promotes a stem-like transition state through lineage plasticity which enables the cancer cell to undergo NE differentiation. We have shown that LSD1 inhibition reduces the NE program, driving NEPC towards a non-neuroendocrine state through ASCL1 suppression and YAP1 re-expression. This less aggressive non-neuroendocrine state exposes unique vulnerabilities for the development of novel combination therapies to treat this lethal disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Epigenetics,LSD1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The prevalence of m6A and the activity and expression of METTL3 have been linked to the appearance and progression of numerous hematological and solid tumor cancers. EPICS has discovered and optimized small molecule inhibitors of METTL3 (&#8220;M3i&#8221;). The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of M3i in various CDX mouse tumor models. M3i compound potency was evaluated in vitro by measuring enzymatic inhibition of METTL3\/14 by scintillation proximity assay (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 2 nM). The anti-proliferative effects of M3i were measured in cell viability assays following a 72h treatment of A549 (NSCLC, IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 190 nM), SKOV3 (ovarian, IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 9 nM) and FaDu (hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 24 nM) cells. Complementary data in all three cell lines demonstrates a clear concentration-response for a target engagement biomarker (m6A; IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 2-8 nM, across cell lines) as well as M3i-induced changes in biomarkers of oncogenic drivers. M3i (30 mg\/kg, IP, QD) was tested in vivo in mouse models using FaDu (subcutaneous implant) in addition to A549 and SKOV3 (both orthotopic implants); all animal models were performed by LabCorp (MI, USA). Daily M3i treatment significantly prolonged survival in all three disease models consistent with efficacy on tumor growth inhibition as measured by imaging (A549, SKOV3) or direct measurement of tumor volume in the case of subcutaneous implant (FaDu). M3i has previously been shown to be effective in mouse CDX and PDX models of AML. The current results extend the application of METTL3 inhibitors to include the treatment of various types of solid tumors. The efficacy of M3i as a single-agent on tumor growth inhibition and survival advances the validation of METTL3 as a cancer target and provides additional evidence for the applicability of mRNA epigenetic mechanisms to the treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Drug discovery,Solid tumors,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Around 10% of pancreatic cancer diagnoses are thought to be familial pancreatic cancer (FPC). <i>BRCA2<\/i> pathogenic variants have been identified to be closely associated with FPC. Personalized medicine approaches that are tailored to FPC patients based on their mutation profiles could improve patient outcomes and minimize adverse effects. This study aims to identify novel potential drug candidates for <i>BRCA2<\/i>-deficient PDAC and dissect its underlying molecular mechanisms. To discover new vulnerabilities for <i>BRCA2<\/i>-deficient pancreatic cancer, we performed high-throughput drug screening (HTS) using isogenic murine <i>Brca2<\/i> knockout (KO) and control PDAC cells. The HTS assay revealed that JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein (BET) family, selectively induced cytotoxicity in <i>Brca2<\/i> KO cells. JQ1 significantly decreased the cell viability of <i>Brca2<\/i> KO cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of <i>Brca2<\/i> KO tumors in vivo compared to the controls. The transcriptomic analyses showed that JQ1 treatment resulted in upregulation of the gene sets associated with macroautophagy. Multi-orthogonal autophagy assays, including live cell imaging of fluorescence-based autophagy reporter, also supported that <i>Brca2<\/i> KO cells had a constitutively higher basal level of autophagic activities compared to the controls, and JQ1 further induced autophagic flux in <i>Brca2<\/i> KO cells.

However, due to the conserved catalytic domain among HDACs, developing specific inhibitors for these isozymes has proven challenging. HDAC8 also has deacetylase-independent activity which cannot be blocked by an inhibitor. Previously we reported the discoveries of a potent HDAC3 degrader XZ9002 and an HDAC3\/8 dual degrader YX968. In this study, we carried out further optimizations based on the warhead of YX968 through rational design, which led to the discovery of YX862 and YL246, novel hydrazide-based HDAC8 selective PROTAC degraders with single-digit nanomolar DC50 and excellent selectivity. We demonstrated that the degradation of HDAC8 affects its non-histone substrates; however, it does not trigger profound histone hyper-acetylation and gene expression alteration, highlighting the unique role of HDAC8. The PROTACs developed in this study are well-characterized HDAC8 degraders without triggering pan-HDAC inhibition which represent valuable tool compounds for exploring the biological and therapeutic potential of HDAC8 in cancers and beyond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase,HDAC8,PROTAC,Targeted Protein Degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The standard treatment for OCa is platinum-based chemotherapy, such as carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with paclitaxel. Most patients are initially responsive to these treatments; however, nearly 90% will develop recurrence and inevitably succumb to chemotherapy-resistant disease. Recent studies have revealed that the epigenetic modifier lysine-specific histone demethylase (KDM1A\/LSD1) is highly overexpressed in OCa. However, whether KDM1A plays a role in chemoresistance and whether its inhibition enhances chemotherapy response in OCa is unknown. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that KDM1A inhibition will sensitize OCa cells to standard-of-care chemotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Transduction of KDM1A-specific shRNA was used to generate KDM1A knockdown (KD) cells.

Moreover, knockdown of KDM1A sensitized carboplatin-resistantA2780-CP70 cells to carboplatin treatment. RNA-seq studies revealed that KDM1A-KD and cisplatin-regulated genes showed negative correction with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and positive correlation with apoptosis-related pathways.

Almost all mPCas eventually develops therapy resistance against androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors (e.g., Enzalutamide, Abiraterone) or to poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors ( Olaparib, Niraparib, Talazoparib) (HRRd) when used as monotherapy. Although the patients in the ARSi+PARPi combination produced significantly longer radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS), a substantial number had attained therapy resistance by the end of the study tenure. So, a newer therapy is urgently needed. In recent years, a new targetable therapeutics development domain has been unfolding with an expanding understanding of the role of SIRTuins in prostate cancer cell survival, invasion, and progression to an aggressive metastatic state. Here, we will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of SIRT1\/7 inhibitor (SIRT1\/7i) and determine synergy with DNA-damaging PARP inhibitor combinations through a battery of cell and molecular assays using various prostate cancer cellular models.<br \/>Methods: We have treated the mPCa cell lines 22Rv1, LAPC4, PC3 and LnCAP as well as prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1 with SIRT1 inhibitor SIRT1-IN-2 (MedChemExpress, HY-146689), SIRT7 inhibitor 97491 (MedChemExpress, HY-135899) and AR inhibitor Enzalutamide individually as well as in combination of PARP inhibitor Olaparib. The treatment of the SIRT1 and SIRT7 monotherapy arm was 72 hours long, and combination therapy continued for 7 days. The cell viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo&#174; 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The cell cycle progression and proliferation analysis were done using flow cytometry through Propidium iodide staining and AnnexinV-FITC apoptosis detection chemistry. Cell survival was orthogonally assessed using colony counting assays. We adopt RAD51 foci counting assays and COMET assays for evaluating treatment-induced genome instability.<br \/>Results: The preliminary result suggested that the SIRT1i+Olaparib and SIRT7i+Olaparib combination significantly sensitized the mPCa cell lines 22Rv1, PC3, and LnCAP for cell death compared to the prostate epithelial cell RWPE1. Upon the combination treatment, the mPCa cell lines showed elevated apoptotic cell death, reconfirmed through colony counting assay.<br \/>Conclusion: Therapeutic combination treatment of SIRT1 and SIRT7 inhibition with Olaparib could be an effective treatment option for aggressive metastatic prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sirtuins,Prostate cancer,Therapeutic target,Overall survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

This domain preferentially recognizes acetylated lysine residues on chromatin to facilitate gene expression by recruiting chromatin remodeling and transcription activating complexes. The <i>YEATS4<\/i> gene encoding for GAS41 protein is frequently amplified in NSCLC patient samples relative to normal lung tissue, and GAS41 protein is overexpressed in NSCLC cells. In knockdown experiments using NSCLC xenograft mouse models, GAS41 has been shown to be essential for NSCLC tumor growth. In mutagenesis studies, the YEATS domain residues responsible for acetylation reader activity were found to be essential for NSCLC cellular proliferation and tumor progression. Thus, the YEATS domain of GAS41 represents an attractive target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors as potential therapeutics for NSCLC.<br \/>Results: We developed the first-in-class small-molecule inhibitors for the GAS41 YEATS domain. Using an NMR-based fragment screen, we identified a hit with low millimolar binding affinity. Structure-based drug design followed by extensive medicinal chemistry optimization yielded the potent and selective inhibitor DLG-369 with sub-micromolar inhibition of the GAS41 YEATS domain interaction with acylated histones. Using the NanoBRET platform, we showed that DLG-369 selectively disrupts the association of GAS41 YEATS with chromatin in mammalian cells. Furthermore, DLG-369 inhibits proliferation of NSCLC cell lines without affecting normal lung fibroblasts. In transcriptomic experiments, DLG-369 treatment regulates expression of multiple genes in NSCLC cells, including upregulation of the critical tumor suppressor genes <i>CDKN1A <\/i>and <i>CYR61<\/i> and downregulation of chemokine genes <i>CXCL5 <\/i>and <i>CXCR4<\/i> associated with NSCLC progression.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed DLG-369, a potent inhibitor of the GAS41 YEATS domain with activity in NSCLC cellular models. DLG-369 potently binds to the YEATS domain acetylation reader pocket and disrupts GAS41 recognition of acetylation in cells. DLG-369 potently reduces proliferation and drives differential expression of key genes associated with NSCLC. DLG-369 can serve as a chemical probe to further interrogate the biological role of the GAS41 YEATS domain in NSCLC and other cancers for potential therapeutic implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Small molecule inhibitor,Acetylation,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

It has been proposed that epigenetic regulators could serve as novel drug targets, and EZH2 is one of the targets with considerable therapeutic potential. Meanwhile, synthetic lethality is a phenomenon whereby individual genes in a pair can be knocked-out without affecting cell viability, while disruptions of both genes concurrently cause cell death. It has been shown that loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of component proteins in SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex, including PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4, and so on, are synthetic lethal with inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Especially, ARID1A-mutated solid tumors are vulnerable to EZH2 inhibition. Given that ARID1A is mutated in approximately 10% of all tumor types, inhibiting EZH2 activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with this mutation. Although the methyltransferase activity of PRC2 is mainly contributed by EZH2, EZH1 also plays a compensatory role in maintaining tri-methylation of H3K27 and directly binds to chromatin, modulating its condensation. These emphasize that blocking both EZH1 and EZH2 might have greater anti-tumor effect than EZH2 alone. Herein, we introduce a novel EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, HM97662, which concurrently suppressed the methyltransferase activity not only wild-type EZH1, but also wild-type and gain-of-function (GOF) mutant EZH2 at nanomolar concentrations. HM97662 potently repressed tri-methylation of H3K27me3 in TOV-21G (ovarian cancer) and HT-1376 (bladder cancer) cell lines with ARID1A LOF mutation. HM97662 also showed a wide and strong growth inhibitory effect in various solid cancer cell lines harboring ARID1A mutation. HM97662 exhibited potent antitumor activities in xenograft mouse models with various ARID1A-mutated cancer cells including ovarian, bladder, small cell lung cancer, prostate, and gastric cancers (e.g. TOV-21G, HT-1197, NCI-H128, LNCap, and MKN-45, respectively). Once-daily oral dosing of HM97662 greatly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner without significant clinical signs compared to known EZH2 selective or EZH1\/2 dual inhibitors. HM97662 also exhibited a synergistic effect in combination with second-line standard of care in small cell lung cancer. In conclusion, these preclinical studies demonstrated that HM97662 as an EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, holds promising therapeutic potential for ARID1A-mutated solid cancers. It is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of HM97662 in subsequent clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,EZH1\/2 ,ARID1A,solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-Y.

The combination of DNMTi with BRAFi showed selective additivity in vitro; however, did not improve efficacies in PDXs. The 5-azacitidine treatment induced profound demethylation in PDXs compared to control samples, predominantly attributed to promoter regions (48%). However, DNA demethylation failed to reactivate classic CIMP markers or tumor suppressor genes in CRC (e.g., CDKN2A, MGMT). Interestingly, demethylated genomic regions gained H3K27 trimethylation, repressive histone mark, in azacitidine-treated samples compared to control (9,431 vs 5,147 peaks respectively). We validated the elevation of H3K27 trimethylation as well as additional histone PTMs following DNMTi in MS-based histone analysis. Finally, combining a demethylating agent with EZH2i or RNF2i, which either deplete H3K27 trimethylation or block the PRC activity respectively, has demonstrated additive growth inhibitory effects in BRAFV600E CRC cell lines (p &#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: This study unveiled intriguing aspects of demethylation agent treatment, which led to the compensatory engagement of other epigenomic markers, particularly repressive histone marks, resulting in limited efficacies to azacitidine treatment in preclinical BRAFV600E CRC models. This finding suggests the existence of adaptive interactions between epigenetic modifiers and potential clinical strategies in combinational epigenetic therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,DNA hypermethylation,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

The hallmark genetic alteration involves the fusion of the FET RNA-binding protein, EWSR1, with an ETS transcription factor, typically FLI1, resulting in the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein. EWS-FLI1 orchestrates a unique epigenetic program, leading to the aberrant expression of genes crucial for cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and cell migration.<br \/>Targeting the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein is a daunting task, which has prompted us to pursue other strategies in parallel. Here, we present an innovative approach harnessing the power of phenotypic drug screens to uncover amenable pathways for targeted medicines in ES. Leveraging data from the Broad Institute&#8217;s repurposing dataset encompassing 4,518 drug molecules screened across 578 adherent cancer cell lines using the high-throughput multiplexed screening platform known as PRISM, we identified compounds with selective efficacy against ES.<br \/>The top-ranking compound identified for selective ES toxicity in the screen was R112, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK). In low-throughput evaluation, R112 induced selective ES cell death when compared to other sarcomas. However, the reported target of R112, SYK, is a dependency in ES based on the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) resource.<br \/>Subsequent validation of compounds identified in the PRISM screen as selectively toxic in ES revealed that while majority of them induced selective ES cell death, their reported targets were diverse and not linked to known dependencies in ES. Notably, one of the emerging compounds, luteolin, a natural compound known for its antioxidative properties, stood out and was selected for further studies alongside R112.<br \/>Comprehensive genome-wide CRISPR-rescue screens identified<i> UGT3A2<\/i>, encoding a UDP glycosyltransferase, along with its solute carrier,<i> <\/i><i>SLC35B4<\/i>, as pivotal genes that when deleted rescued both R112 and luteolin-induced cytotoxicity in ES cells. UGT3A2, a direct target gene of EWS-FLI1, demonstrated hyperexpression in EWS-FLI1-positive ES cells and no expression in most cancer and normal cells. While ES cells do not depend on UGT3A2 for survival, this abnormal elevation of<i> <\/i><i>UGT3A2<\/i> expression emerged as a key determinant driving their hypersensitivity to a subset of additional small molecules identified from the PRISM screen. Despite divergent mechanisms and direct targets, these drugs shared a common phenoxy motif, which UGT3A2 glycosylated.<br \/>This specific EWS-FLI1-induced UGT3A2 upregulation, thus, unveils a novel biomarker for drug sensitivity,paving the way for precision medicine strategies tailored for Ewing sarcoma.<br \/>Beyond Ewing sarcoma, this work holds promise in reshaping therapeutic paradigms and offering new avenues for discovering safe and enhanced treatments across a spectrum of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Tumor biology,Drug discovery,High-content screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Olasunkanmi Olaoye<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Colleen Harrington<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenneth Ross<sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Kyung  A.

These cells evade activation induced cell death, allowing them to accumulate as highly cytotoxic lymphocytes that contribute to autoimmune attacks, neutropenia, and anemia. Frontline treatments are limited to repurposed, nonspecific immunosuppressive agents with limited efficacy and incomplete response rates. As there are no FDA-approved antineoplastic agents for LGL leukemia, our research explores novel therapeutic avenues for this orphan disease. Somatic activating mutations in the transcription factor<i> STAT3<\/i> are the most common molecular alteration found in &#62;50% of patients, and STAT3 signaling is dysregulated in almost all LGL leukemia patients. In the largest molecularly profiled LGL leukemia patient cohort to date, we found that <i>STAT3<\/i> mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in chromatin and epigenetic modifying genes, suggesting crosstalk and cooperativity between STAT3 activation and epigenetic dysregulation. Moreover, <i>TET2<\/i>, which promotes DNA demethylation, is frequently inactivated in LGL leukemia via loss-of-function mutations and promoter hypermethylation. As DNA hypermethylation is an emerging hallmark of LGL leukemia, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of two epigenetic agents, azacitidine (AZA) and cladribine (CLAD), that directly and indirectly inhibit DNA hypermethylation, respectively. We hypothesize that AZA and CLAD will 1) exhibit cell intrinsic efficacy, 2) reprogram the epigenome of LGL leukemia through DNA hypomethylation to normalize aberrant gene expression, and 3) induce cytokine-mediated immune responses. AZA and CLAD cytotoxicity was assessed by the Cell Titer Glo viability assay in human LGL leukemia cell lines. Each exhibited potent anti-leukemic effects with IC50 values in the low micromolar and nanomolar ranges. Western blotting analysis demonstrated the decrease in protein expression of DNA methyltransferases and phosphorylated STAT3 levels with treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also explored the immunomodulatory effects of these hypomethylating agents since LGL leukemia is a pro-inflammatory malignancy with cytotoxic lymphocytes. Preliminary findings using the Isoplexis platform suggest that AZA and CLAD induce production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in LGL leukemia cells. Ongoing studies will identify differential methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression using RRBS, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq of AZA or CLAD treated samples to define the mechanisms and consequences of DNA demethylation. Uncovering the reprogramming capabilities of AZA and CLAD could allow for the potential repurposing of these inhibitors for treatment of LGL leukemia patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Leukemias,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
