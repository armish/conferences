[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Colorectal cancers (CRC) have an important impact on both incidence and mortality worldwide, with varying rates in different parts of the world. Despite an overall decrease in incidence in the past years, an alarming increase in early onset colorectal cancer (CRC in patients under 50 years of age) rates has been observed. As part of the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Mutographs project, we aim to better understand the underlying mutagenic causes contributing to the differences in CRC incidence rates through mutational signatures.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We collected epidemiological data and performed whole genome sequencing and mutational signature analysis on 981 CRC tumor samples from 11 countries with varying incidence rates, including intermediate incidence regions (Iran, Colombia, Thailand, and Brazil) and higher incidence regions (Argentina, Russia, Canada, Poland, Czechia, Serbia, and Japan).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The average mutational profiles were similar across the countries. Mutational signatures associated with DNA repair deficiencies, including <i>POLE<\/i> and <i>POLD1<\/i> associated signatures (SBS10a\/b\/c\/d and SBS28), <i>MUTYH<\/i> (SBS36), <i>NTHL1<\/i> (SBS30), homologous recombination deficiency (SBS3), and a plethora of microsatellite instability (MSI) signatures, were found in 177 cancers (18% of all samples) and at comparable levels across all countries. Multiple signatures with known etiologies were found in 802 DNA repair proficient colorectal cancers including clock-like (SBS1 and SBS5), reactive oxygen species (SBS18), APOBEC (SBS2 and SBS13), and the microbiome-product colibactin (SBS88) signatures. The colibactin signature SBS88 was observed in 14% of samples overall, being more prevalent in distal and rectum tumors. SBS88 was significantly enriched in younger patients (33% &#60;40y, 23% 40-49y, 20% 50-59y,10% 60-69y, 10% &#8805;70y; p-value = 0.0001). Tumors from early onset patients also showed higher prevalence of another mutational signature with unknown etiology (19% &#60;40y, 16% 40-49y, 13% 50-59y, 6% 60-69y, 7% &#8805;70y, p-value = 0.005).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These results indicate a potential association between SBS88 with early onset CRC, suggesting that the recent increase in incidence may be at least partially explained by the genotoxic compound colibactin, and associated bacteria.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Mutational Signatures,Whole genome sequencing,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W. dos Santos<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, M.

To date, however, little research has explored the possibility that exposure to acute psychological stresses in daily life may acutely increase levels of DNA damage and thus, much like repeated tobacco use, may cumulatively contribute to lifetime cancer risk. The purpose of the present experimental study was to provide a first critical test of the hypothesis that exposure of healthy humans to a brief psychological stress results in increased levels of DNA damage. We also tested preventative effects of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol), a mechanistic pathway for psychological stress effects on DNA supported by preclinical research. Healthy volunteers were recruited by multiple strategies including targeted outreach (telephone\/email), with oversampling for age, sex, and minority status. Eligibility was confirmed by self-report, clinical testing (blood &#38; urine), and MD review. On the experimental day, participants were randomized to receive either a single dose of propranolol (80mg) or a placebo. After a 60 min rest period with video distraction, all participants (n=123; 48.8% &#8805; 40yr; 52% women; 52% minority) underwent a well-established, 15-minute stress challenge, a speech task and mental arithmetic (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST), with psychological stress confirmed by visual analog scales. Blood samples were collected (via IV line) immediately before and after the TSST. As the primary study outcome, DNA damage in PBMC was assessed (blind) with Comet IV software (% tail intensity) following single cell gel electrophoresis under alkaline conditions with and without <i>in vitro<\/i> exposure to 25uM H2O2 (comet assay). For a subset of participants with sufficient frozen PBMC samples available (n=43), levels of pan-nuclear &#947;-H2AX were determined with a validated, sensitive, immunoblot method that detects H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139, and expresses &#947;-H2AX as the ratio of p-Ser139-H2AX to total H2AX. Exploratory nonparametric analyses revealed that undergoing the TSST significantly increased levels of DNA damage in PBMC (H2O2 comet assay [p&#60;.001] and &#947;-H2AX biomarker [p=.03], Wilcoxon tests) in the group of participants that was randomized to pretreatment with placebo. In the group pretreated with propranolol before the TSST, a significant increase in &#947;-H2AX was not found.<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>Supporting the study hypothesis that acute stress can increase levels of DNA damage, the results of the present study highlight the potential importance of additional research to address the possibility that repeated exposures to acute life stresses may cumulatively contribute to increased lifetime risk of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,DNA damage,DNA damage response,Human,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

While socioeconomic status and access to healthcare may contribute to these disparities, mounting evidence indicates that significant biological differences between diverse ancestries play a role in the severity of different cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and squamous cell carcinomas. The purpose of the study is to investigate diagnostic and biological differences in HPV-induced squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx by self-reported race.<br \/>The study population consists of oropharynx cases identified at the University of Michigan (non-Hispanic White) and through the Louisiana Tumor Registry (African American). A total of 52 individuals from two study sites were included in this study, 40 of whom are men, two are women and 10 are unknown. Forty-four percent (23\/52) of individuals were African Americans (AA), and 46 % (19\/52) were Non-Hispanic White (NHW).<br \/>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors from these patients were tested for p16 expression via immunohistochemistry as a proxy for HPV status. Fifty-two percent (27\/52) tested negative (p16-) and 48% (25\/52) tested positive (p16+). Total RNA from these samples was extracted, sequenced, and bioinformatically analyzed to test for the presence of HPV. Among AA samples, 61% were negative for both p16 and HPV RNA (p16-\/RNA-), 26% were p16+\/RNA-, 13% were p16+\/RNA+ and none were p16-\/RNA+. Among NHWs, 37% were p16-\/RNA-, 16% were p16-\/RNA+, 47% were p16+\/RNA+ and none were p16+\/RNA-. Interestingly, 6 of 20 HPV RNA- AA samples were p16+, whereas 0 of 7 HPV RNA- NHW samples were p16+.<br \/>We performed data dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implemented in the PCAtools Bioconductor package. Four groups were separated in a plot of the first two PCs, comprising, (i) all p16+\/RNA+ (18\/18), (ii) dominantly p16-\/RNA- (6\/7), (iii) p16-\/RNA- mixed with p16+\/RNA-, and (iv) p16-\/RNA+ in the middle of all the groups and mixing with some p16+\/RNA+ samples. A total of 13\/17 (76%) p16-\/RNA- samples in group (iii) that were mixed with p16+\/RNA- samples were AA, 3 (18%) were NHW and 1 was unknown. Based on clinical data, the PCA group (iii) consisted of samples that were characterized as invasive, keratinizing, and moderately differentiated, whereas group (ii) samples were mostly clinically characterized as nonkeratinizing. A total of 13\/14 AA samples that tested p16-\/RNA- possessed similar clinical attributes as samples classified as p16+\/RNA-, suggesting that the p16 expression via immunohistochemistry test might be classifying a significant percent of HPV-negative AA samples as positive.<br \/>Taken together, these results suggest that the p16 immunohistochemistry test for oropharyngeal cancer may be overly sensitive for classifying AA oropharynx cancer samples. Clinical decisions regarding treatment for AA based on this test have the potential to negatively impact outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Human papillomavirus (HPV),p16,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Preliminary studies led by the African Caribbean Consortium (AC3) show that Blacks are diverse with distinct cancer risks and outcomes. It is clear that cancer screening is critical to prevention, and population patterns of screening are dictated by complex and multilevel factors including cost, access and health system as well as personal factors. These personal characteristics, especially considering Black diversity, are particularly understudied. Hence, this study seeks to describe cancer screening patterns in Black subgroups, especially considering the influence of quality of life (QOL).<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods <\/b>This study drew data from the community-engaged AC3-Cancer Prevention Project (CAP3) targeting diverse Blacks. Specifically, we sought to identify associations between QOL measured by CDC Physical and Mental Health; Perceived Stress, and self-reported cancer screenings breast, prostate, cervical and colon cancers. Cancer screening rates were stratified by African Americans (AfA) and African (AfI) and African-Caribbean (AfC) immigrants. Descriptive analyses and Fisher&#8217;s Exact test were conducted.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results <\/b>There were 263 AfA, 103 AfI, and 174 AfC. Overall, cancer screening rates were consistently above 50%. Distinct QOL variables were associated with cancer screening patterns with some variability by Black sub-group. Better Mental Health e.g., wellbeing (p=0.01) and energy (p=0.04) are related to mammogram uptake for all subgroups.

For AfCs, Mental Health- depressive symptomatology was significantly related to breast- (p=0.04), prostate- (p=0.03), and colorectal- cancer screening (p=0.03).

Representation of patients for clinical trials throughout an NCI cancer center catchment area is a crucial goal to promote improved health outcomes. This study investigates the demographic landscape of patients with preneoplastic oral lesions seen at the CASP.<br \/>Methods: Through the UMN Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, we queried 30 International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9 and 10 codes corresponding to 120 unique mucosal oral precancerous lesion descriptors of CASP patients. Automated extraction of electronic medical record (EMR) data for 4,496 patients treated by the senior author between 2011 and 2023 identified 1,375 patients with preneoplastic lesions. The proportion of patients residing in three-digit zip code regions of Minnesota were compared to 2021 American Community Survey state population data. Additionally, race data were compared between CASP patients and the UMN Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) patient catchment data.<br \/>Results: CASP patients were over-represented relative to state population distributions within the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and surrounding suburbs (region 554 p&#60;0.0001 and region 551 p&#60;0.0001). Under-representation of CASP patients was observed in all western and southern border regions (regions 559 p&#60;0.0001, 560 p&#60;0.0001, 561 p&#60;0.0001, 562 p=0.0037, 565 p&#60;0.0001, and 567 p=0.0006) as well as portions of central (563 p&#60;0.0001), northern (566 p=0.0015), and north-eastern (558 p&#60;0.0001) Minnesota. Proportional representation was observed in several regions of central (553 and 564), eastern (550), and north-eastern (557 and 556) Minnesota. Comparisons of CASP race data revealed a higher proportion of black patients (CASP 8.59% [95% CI 7.17-10.27%] vs. MCC 7.16% [95% CI 7.14-7.17%]) and a lower proportion of Asian\/Pacific Islander patients (CASP 3.74% [95% CI 2.82-4.94%] vs. MCC 5.32% [95% CI 5.30-5.34%]) relative to MCC catchment patients. White, American Indian\/Alaskan Native, and mixed-race groups were proportionally represented in both data sets.<br \/>Conclusions: These data show that system wide EMR searches can be implemented to identify patients in an NCI cancer center catchment area with precancerous or other at-risk conditions for cancer. Importantly, Native patients were proportionally represented in the screening program while several rural locations were under-represented. This information can instruct the expenditure of additional resources for under-represented groups and permit streamlined enrollment of patients for cancer prevention clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer surveillance,Disparities,Midwest,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In response, the LIFE Project aimed to establish a cancer-focused robust, functional platform for data harmonization and sharing across national and international studies with a focus on low-resourced settings and LMIC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Established in 2022, the integrated database platform hosts data collected from the ongoing Jamaican LIFE and US CAP3 projects. Both studies focus on investigating biologic and socioecologic risk factors for non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) and cancers. Participants self-reported data via REDCap. A one-to one mapping of the variables from both questionnaires was conducted and stored in the integrated REDCap file. An automated REDCap Application Programming Interface (API) script weekly imports the new entries into the integrated database. To ensure data accuracy, on a weekly schedule, data importation and data integration are monitored and assessed by random sampling of original source data entries and the corresponding entries in the integrated database.

Despite this, approximately 4% of new cancer cases worldwide in 2020 were attributable to alcohol intake. Growing evidence indicates that alcohol use increases the risk of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx) and lower digestive tract (colon, rectum, and liver). Over half of the 6.3 million cases of these cancers are considered preventable, underscoring notable gaps regarding alcohol consumption and cancer prevention. Despite (1) the longstanding designation of alcohol as an established carcinogen, (2) an increasing and consistent body of data noting alcohol as a leading contributor to the global cancer burden, and (3) the publication of policy statements by authoritative sources, it is unclear whether cancer-focused institutions are aware of these facts or are acting on these data (i.e., implementing evidence-based policies and practices to limit alcohol-related cancer risks for their employees, guests, or the public). Driven by these data and shortfalls, we developed a 22-item survey to inquire about cancer organizations' interpretation of current literature, existing policies, decision-making processes, inclination to act, and perceived responsibility to lead in the realms of public education and policy implementation to mitigate alcohol-related cancer risks in the public&#8217;s interest. The survey will be sent to over 100 leading U.S. cancer organizations, including NCI-designated- and other major cancer centers, cancer-oriented professional organizations, and cancer-research organizations. It underwent rigorous testing for clarity, brevity, and expected response time, also drawing upon the expertise of five survey-science professionals. The study is under institutional review board (IRB) review, and we anticipate the survey&#8217;s distribution in the first quarter of the calendar year 2024.

We investigated the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, as well as a urinary marker of oxidative DNA damage in Korean adults (n=2,199) from the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study. Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;, as well as urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2&#8242;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), were selected as biomarkers of interest. We estimated a range of air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM, PM<sub>10<\/sub> and PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), utilizing a chemical transport model. The exposure duration was defined based on 1- to 7-day averages. To explore the association between air pollution and biomarkers, we utilized multivariable linear models adjusting for major covariates, including demographic, lifestyle, relative humidity, and temperature. PM<sub>10<\/sub> was linked to increased levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and 8-OHdG, and PM<sub>2.5<\/sub> was associated with elevated levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and 8-OHdG.

National guidelines recommend germline genetic testing (GT) for all PDAC patients, but only 6.8-19% obtain GT. Current GT barriers include under-referral and genetic counselor shortage. Our goal was to improve uptake of GT among PDAC patients using a novel delivery model for genetic education and testing.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The Genetic Information for Treatment Decisions (GIFTD) Initiative at Moffitt Cancer Center was created to streamline education and GT for PDAC patients. A Genetic Risk Education Coordinator (GREC), trained by licensed, board-certified genetic counselors, was hired to identify eligible patients and facilitate GT during clinician appointments. In partnership with Nest Genomics, a digital point-of-care tool was developed to collect personal and family history information, provide education about GT, and assess interest in GT. Patients receive a link from Nest ahead of their appointment via text and\/or email to invite them to provide information and view education via mobile device. An auto-generated summary report with an indicator regarding GT interest is created in real-time for the GREC.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Seventy patients were invited to the Nest tool over the six-week launch period. Of those who opened the link, 83% (35\/42) logged into their Nest account. Of these patients who logged into Nest, 71% (25\/35) completed Nest&#8217;s GT education. The GREC met with 68% (17\/25) of the patients that completed the education. 76% (13\/17) of these patients were consented to GT. There were 2 patients who initially indicated that they were not interested in genetic testing in Nest but changed their mind after meeting with the GREC.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Moffitt's collaboration with Nest through the GREC has successfully facilitated prompt germline genetic testing for PDAC patients, aiding in informed treatment decisions and family screening. Our preliminary findings suggest that the scalable Nest tool successfully captures PDAC patients who may be interested in GT, but follow-up with the GREC may further increase GT rates. Future directions for increasing uptake of GT and adhering to national guidelines include additional personalization and enhancement of the Nest tool.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Genetic susceptibility,Risk factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Therefore, we conducted a multi-omics study to identify lung cancer susceptibility genes.<br \/><b>Method <\/b>We first conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using S-PrediXcan framework. Whole transcriptome data from adjacent-normal lung tissue samples and genomic data from 304 European-ancestry lung cancer patients were used to build genetic prediction models for expression levels of protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. The prediction models were then applied to GWAS meta-analysis results for lung cancer with 39,363 cases and 621,480 controls of European descents from TRICL-ILCCO, the UK Biobank, and FinnGen. COJO was used to assess whether those significant genes were independent of proximal (&#177;1.5 Mb) GWAS-identified risk variants. To replicate our TWAS-identified genes, we used data from GTEx version 8 normal lung tissue (N=444) to build imputation models and then run association analyses. We acquired gene (N=107) and protein expression data (N=111) from tumor and matched adjacent-normal lung tissues from European-ancestry participants in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. Paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests were then conducted to assess whether identified genes and their corresponding proteins were expressed differentially.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Out of 18,850 genes (read count &#62;6 and TPM &#62;0.1 in at least 20% samples), 6,754 protein-coding genes and 802 lincRNAs were predicted reliably using genetic variants (R&#62;0.1 and P&#60;0.05). Among them, genetically proxied expression levels of 24 genes located at 15 loci were significantly associated with lung cancer risk at a Bonferroni adjusted P &#60;0.05.

SRMA were eligible if they evaluated MetS with ORC incidence or survival, were conducted in an adult population (&#8805;18 years), and included the pre-defined study-specific data. Using Covidence, two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts (2,524) and then reviewed full text (41), selecting 23 SRMAs for inclusion.

In this study, the effect of the technology-based program was examined on various needs for help among a larger group of Asian American breast cancer survivors.<br \/><i><\/i><br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>This study used a randomized clinical trial design with repeated measures. The study included 199 participants who were recruited through both online and offline communities\/groups for Asian Americans. With multiple measurement scales related to background characteristics and theory-based mediators, the Support Care Needs Survey-34 Short Form (SCNS) was used to measure various needs for help. The SCNS included five subscales on psychological, information, physical, support, and communication needs. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach and mediation analyses.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: All types of needs except support needs decreased over time (p &#60; .001). However, there were no significant group * time effects. Among all the theory-based mediators, only social support significantly mediated the effects of the program on psychological, information, and support needs at the pre-test and the post-1 month.<br \/><i><\/i><br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>This study supported significant effects of the technology-based program on various needs for help among Asian American breast cancer survivors. Future research needs to be conducted with other racial\/ethnic minority groups of cancer survivors to confirm the findings reported in this presentation.<br \/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survivorship,Asian American,Computer and Mobile Technology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.-O.

Nevertheless, the association of radiotherapy for breast cancer and the risk of subtype-specific lung cancer is unknown.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Females diagnosed with first primary breast cancer at ages 20-84 years from 1992-2020 were identified from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. Follow-up began at 2 months from breast cancer diagnosis and ended at subsequent lung cancer diagnosis, last known vital status, death, or December 31, 2020. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs, per 10,000 women) were calculated for each histological subtype of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and others) using expected rates of each subtype in the SEER population. Subgroup analyses were conducted by treatment for breast cancer (radiotherapy yes or no\/unknown), overall and stratified by the relative position (ipsilateral and contralateral) of the breast and SPLC.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Of all 550,007 breast cancer survivors (&#62;50 years old, 74%; non-Hispanic Whites, 67%; localized, 51%), 8,014 SPLCs were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 9.7 years. 52.6% of the participants received radiotherapy treatment. Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors had a statistically significantly higher risk of lung cancer with subtype-specific SIR being greatest for adenocarcinoma (Observed N=4337; SIR=1.20, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.16-1.24; EAR=1.35), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (Observed N=1368; SIR=1.11, 95% CI=1.05-1.17; EAR=0.26) and small cell carcinoma (Observed N=1026; SIR=1.08, 95% CI=1.02-1.15; EAR=0.14). When stratified by radiotherapy receipt, the increased risk associated with adenocarcinoma did not vary across strata. In contrast, the increased risk for squamous and transitional cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma were confined to those who received radiotherapy (SIR=1.16, 95% CI=1.08-1.24 vs SIR=1.06, 95% CI=0.98-1.15 for squamous and transitional cell carcinoma; SIR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06-1.25 vs SIR= 1.00, 95% CI=0.91-1.09 for small cell carcinoma). Further analysis by laterality showed that associations of treatment receipt with increased risk of lung cancer were confined to ipsilateral SPLC for these two subtypes.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> Different subtypes of lung cancer may have distinct associations with prior radiation treatment in individuals who have survived breast cancer. The findings have implications for evaluating risks and implementing surveillance for subsequent primary lung cancer in the growing population of breast cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-25 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Radiation therapy,Breast cancer survivors,Subtype-specific risk,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.
