[{"Abstract":"The NCI60 screen was established in the 1980s and introduced in the 1990s as a screening service for the worldwide cancer research community. The screen features 60 human tumor cell lines that represent 9 cancer types including non-small cell lung, colon, central nervous system, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast, as well as leukemia and melanoma. On a weekly basis, synthetic molecules, natural products, and biologics are screened against the 60-cell line panel to evaluate their anticancer potential. On average, more than 13,000 compounds are screened annually for investigators throughout the world. Cell growth and cytotoxicity were assessed by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, performed in a 96-well format, that measures cellular protein content with an absorbance readout and enabled unprecedented throughput in the 1980s. Although the SRB assay supported a robust screening platform for three decades, its sensitivity and throughput are limited. Recently the NCI&#8217;s DCTD introduced the HTS384 NCI60 as a modernized screening platform. While the same 60 cell lines are evaluated, the HTS384 NCI60 is fully automated and performed in a 384-well format to enable a higher throughput. Additionally, the 48-h test agent exposure period of the SRB assay was increased to 72 h, which may result in lower 50% growth inhibition values (GI<sub>50<\/sub>) for some agents. A highly sensitive CellTiter-Glo luminescence readout for cell viability, based on cellular ATP content, was selected to enable comparisons of the NCI60 monolayer data to 3D cell culture models where the same assay chemistry can be applied. The HTS384 NCI60 was evaluated by screening a library of 1,003 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational oncology agents at five concentrations. Assay performance of the 60 cell lines was assessed from the controls of 30 - 60 microplates per cell line. The average doubling time of the 60 cell lines during the 72-h exposure period ranged between 19 h for NCI-H460 (17 - 23 h, <i>n<\/i> = 57) to 117 h for MDA-MB-468 (43 - 272 h, <i>n<\/i> = 60). The average signal-to-background ratio of all 60 cell lines was 89 (3,413 microplates) and ranged from 6 for OVCAR-5 (3 - 13, <i>n<\/i> = 54) to 229 for SF-539 (141 - 566, <i>n<\/i> = 60). The average coefficient of variation for microplate vehicle controls (<i>n<\/i> = 14) of all 60 cell lines (<i>n<\/i> = 3,413) was 5.2% and ranged from 3.2% for SK-MEL-28 (1.4 - 7.7%, <i>n<\/i> = 60) to 11.1% for HL-60(TB) (5.2 - 20.2%, <i>n<\/i> = 59). The average Z&#8217;-factor value of all 60 cell lines (<i>n<\/i> = 3,413) was 0.82 and ranged between 0.66 for HL-60(TB) (0.39 - 0.84, <i>n<\/i> = 59) to 0.89 for MALME-3M (0.79 - 0.95, <i>n<\/i> = 59), SF-295 (0.49 - 0.97, <i>n<\/i> = 59), SK-MEL-28 (0.74 - 0.95, <i>n<\/i> = 60), and UO-31 (0.8 - 0.94, <i>n<\/i> = 54). The development and performance of the HTS384 NCI60 screen will be described. This project was funded in part with federal funds from the NCI, NIH, under contract no.

Cell target engagement (CTE) presents a combined biological &#38; biophysical method, which provides quantitative evaluation of target-drug interaction within the native environment of the cell. The currently available luminescence-based CTE methods are limited to measurement of end-point signal and poor resolution, thereby limiting their mechanistic and stoichiometric insight. We have developed MICRO-TAG, a novel fluorescence-based CTE platform, which relies on complementation of split-RNAse A. It enables interrogation of target engagement without interfering with folding, localization and function of target proteins - all within the physiological milieu of the cell. Uniquely, this new platform allows for quantitation and monitoring of CTE in real- time in the cell. It enables extraction of important parameters from target-drug interaction: target thermal profile and temperature of aggregation (T<sub>agg<\/sub>), time required to reach equilibrium (t<sub>eq<\/sub>), apparent association rate (K<sub>on<\/sub>) and physiologically relevant drug:target binding affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub>). We provide data demonstrating potential and utility of MICRO-TAG platform on drug targets, such as KRAS, MTH1, EGFR, and UBE2N. The platform demonstrates relevance for discovery of novel drug candidates targeting challenging drug targets such as transcription factors. This highly scalable and quantitative novel method for assessing drug-target interaction within cells can enhance drug discovery programs, and offers potential to rapidly identify clinically relevant hit compounds for challenging drug targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Transcription factor,Small molecule drugs,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

In particular, current PDO analysis fall short in at least 1 of 2 major criteria: 1) accurate recapitulation of patient tumor or 2) scalability. To address this, we have developed an automation-compatible protocol to satisfy these 2 major criteria to facilitate the adoption of PDOs for HTS applications<sup>1<\/sup>. Our novel protocol leverages live-cell imaging techniques to capture the dynamic interactions and intricate complexities of PDOs, which allowed for more precise and comprehensive analysis. To further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of our approach, we developed a fully automated image and data analysis pipeline (Orbits). Using label-free detection of organoids from brightfield images, Orbits integrates growth-rate-based drug response metrics with drug synergy metrics to significantly improve the identification of synergistic drug interactions. Here, present the results of our HTS protocol on 10 distinct drug combination strategies, specifically focusing on the repurposed drug candidate Auranofin, a Thioredoxin reductase inhibitor. We screened on 10 PDOs sourced from healthy lung, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Not only were we able to distinguishing cytostatic from cytotoxic drug responses at a single-organoid level, we identified drug candidates that can synergistically enhanced the efficacy of Auranofin in a tumor selective manner. Our study presents a major step forward in the field of PDO-based drug discovery, offering a robust protocol for HTS and automated data analysis. The implementation of our method will accelerate the discovery of effective therapeutic strategies, ultimately translating to improved patient outcomes. <sup>1<\/sup> Le Compte, M., et al <i>JoVE<\/i> 190 (2022)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Drug synergy,Translation,Artificial intelligence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

With advanced technologies, such as the Echo<sup>&#174;<\/sup> MS and RapidFire MS for HTS, and SPR, MST, TSA, nanoDSF and ITC for Biophysics, the cascade is effective for primary screening, orthogonal assays and evaluating Mechanism of Action (MoA). There are many biophysical approaches which bring value to drug discovery programs, and it is the target properties which drive the selection of the most suitable technology. In this presentation, we will highlight the novel Spectral Shift technology, one of the techniques employed by the Dianthus (well-known for the MST-TRIC). The goal was to rapidly implement an assay that monitors the ability of PIM3 to bind to ATP, as well as to compounds and fragments in solution. Using the Echo MS&#8217; acoustic-droplet ejection, nanoliter dispensing in 394-well plates, robust data by Spectral Shift were quickly generated for the fragment-based screening campaign. Hits were confirmed in Dose-response with &#181;M-range affinity values (K<sub>D<\/sub>), and TSA was used as an orthogonal assay for the identification of stabilizers among the selected PIM3 binders. For a defined set of 826 proprietary fragments, a single dose screening at 600&#181;M using Spectral Shift was run, leading to the identification of 11% of potential binders. The 100 fragments were then confirmed in dose-response titration and 80 binders were confirmed. The top 30 binders were selected for orthogonal characterization using TSA. This led to the selection of the top 6 confirmed fragments, on which a MoA study in MST-TRIC was performed. Following this evaluation, 3 allosteric binders were identified, with K<sub>D<\/sub> from 355 to 550&#181;M (affinity of orthosteric binders from 55 to 333&#181;M). Biophysics plays an important role in drug discovery by qualifying valuable assets and increasing the success rates of future Hit-finding programs. The fragment hits selected in this PIM3 Kinase project, which show ADP-Glo&#8482; activities, are now ready for crystallography studies (NMR &#38; X-ray co-crystallization).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Kinase inhibitors,Drug design,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

It has recently been shown to be essential to cancer cells with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). In MSI-H cancer cells, WRN depletion was shown to induce DNA damage and disrupt mitoses, resulting in a distinct phenotype of enlarged and fragmented nuclei. Here, we present a high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify compounds that selectively induce enlarged nuclei in MSI-H cancer cells. In HCT116, an MSI-H colorectal cancer cell line, approximately 40% of cells exhibited enlarged nuclei when WRN was depleted using siRNA. In contrast, fewer than 10% of control cells displayed this phenotype. In HT29, a microsatellite stable (MSS) cancer cell line, no such difference in nuclear morphology was observed, suggesting that the phenotype is specific to MSI-H cells. We used high content imaging to screen our in-house diversity library of approximately 175,000 compounds in 384-well format. 4,260 compounds induced enlarged nuclei in HCT116 cells, a 2.4% hit rate. After re-screening hits in HCT116 along with two additional MSI-H cancer cell lines, SW48 and SNU-407, and counter-screening in HT29 cells, 144 hits were confirmed to specifically enlarge nuclei in MSI-H but not MSS cells. Using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay, two of these compounds were confirmed to inhibit WRN ATPase activity, suggesting WRN inhibition as a potential mechanism for their specific effects in MSI-H cells. This screen will also identify compounds which selectively kill MSI-H cells through mechanisms beyond direct inhibition of WRN, including interaction with WRN complex members or other members of DNA damage repair pathways. Validation studies including the assessment of cell viability and DNA damage in a panel of MSI-H and MSS cell lines will be performed. Our study proposes a phenotypic screening strategy for identifying small molecules with the potential to target WRN and uncover additional novel mechanisms for treating MSI-H cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-content screening,Microsatellite instability,Drug-discovery screen,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

By the introduction of the high-throughput format (CETSA Navigate HT), this technology offers a reliable high-throughput screening method in natural cellular environments that can successfully be applied in compound screening for hit identification and confirmation already during lead generation. Due to its broad applicability to native, full length protein targets in the live cellular environment, without the need for expensive and time-consuming protein and\/or compound labelling efforts, CETSA Navigate HT may be regarded as a new paradigm for high-throughput screening and actives generation. As a case study to demonstrate the applicability of CETSA Navigate HT in hit identification, we have applied the technology for primary screening of a 12000 compound library for CDK4, a protein targeted in several cancers.

A significant portion of projects fail to reach the clinic due to lack of efficacy or failure to show lead candidates interacting with the intended target in a more complex environment. The utility of using the CETSA&#174; (CEllular Thermal Shift Assay) technology to measure target engagement in intact cells is increasingly exploited in high throughput screening, where examples demonstrate low false positive rates in screens of up to 500K compounds. The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a crucial guardian against cancer, functions as a transcription factor that mediates cancer suppression by regulating genes involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis. Unfortunately, frequent mutations in the TP53 gene hinder p53's tumor suppressor role in human cancers, thus designating it as a promising target for anticancer therapy. However, attempts to restore p53 function for therapeutic purposes have not yet advanced to clinical approval, highlighting the complexities in leveraging p53 for cancer treatment. Its undruggable nature, attributed to the absence of accessible deep pockets, lack of enzymatic activity, and its intracellular location, further complicates targeted interventions with both low and high molecular weight drugs. Here, we demonstrate the analysis of a high-throughput plate based CETSA&#174; HT screen on the challenging target p53, performed using AlphaLISA&#174; SureFire&#174; Ultra&#8482; technology and our newly developed high-throughput screening platform. Hits identified from this screen are privileged from the onset by binding to the target in a physiologically relevant cellular matrix and in a binding-mode agnostic way. This is in contrast to traditional screening methods targeting activity or in vitro interaction where cellular activity is addressed in later stages. This assay cascade highlights a rapid target-to-hit lead generation strategy placing the emphasis on finding chemical matter that interacts with endogenous target in living cells first, followed by analysis of hit material activity. The &#8216;shortcut&#8217; to chemical matter active in living cells represents significant potential cost savings in comparison to assay development time on recombinantly produced proteins and\/or modified cell lines for traditional HTS screening approaches that still rely on target engagement assessment downstream.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Breast cancer,Drug discovery,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Merve Kacal<sup><\/sup>, <b>Tomas Friman<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Laurence Arnold<sup><\/sup>, Victoria Brehmer<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Martinez Molina<sup><\/sup>, Stina Lundgren<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pelago Bioscience AB, Solna, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"773db5f2-7e7c-4fdb-b75c-869f1fb53d57","ControlNumber":"6488","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

In this area, CETSA is a powerful technology for identifying new binders, assessing target engagement, and investigating the mechanism of action of the degraders in the intact cell environment - without the need to modify your compound, the proteins or the cellular environment.&#8239; CETSA can provide insights into the binding of the degrader to both the E3 ligase and the protein of interest (POI), as well as follow the downstream cellular and molecular effects. Here we will exemplify how CETSA can be applied in various stages of drug discovery to provide biologically relevant data to guide the design and optimization of new degraders. For example, CETSA can provide valuable information of the cell permeability and the in-cell performance of the degrader, which is important for understanding how the degrader enters cells and reaches its target proteins. By combining data from CETSA with data from degradation readout, in our case quantitative proteomics, it is possible to correlate cellular target engagement potencies with degradation efficiency and importantly, also identify any drug:protein binding that does not result in degradation By using the proteome-wide CETSA Explore format, the selectivity of the degrader and the downstream protein consequences of the elimination of the target protein could be studied.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Thermal proteome profiling,CETSA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

While the total of all such RAS mutations drives some 20-25% of all human cancers, each isoform tends to favor particular mutations that are cancer specific. Many evolving treatment strategies for these cancers target these mutant isoforms to minimize off target effects. NRAS mutations are seen in about one-fifth of cutaneous melanomas and patients with NRAS mutation melanomas have a poorer prognosis due to the high aggressiveness of RAS mutant tumors, a lack of efficient targeted therapies, or rapidly emerging resistance to existing treatments. Furthermore, there is no currently authorized targeted treatment for NRAS-mutated melanoma. As a result, there is a growing need for assays which can quantify activated NRAS. Here we describe the development of a highly specific and sensitive ELISA for determining the active NRAS protein in high throughput compatible (HTS) format.<br \/>A NRAS specific recombinant antibody was developed via cloning of immunoglobulin variable regions from antigen positive B cells isolated by FACS from rabbits immunized with a NRAS peptide corresponding to a region of low homology between the RAS isoforms. Immunoblotting and a bead-based multiplex ELISA with all three RAS isoforms were used to confirm antibody specificity with recombinant HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS proteins over a wide concentration range.<br \/>The new immunoassay enables in-well lysis of cells cultivated in 96-well plate. Activated NRAS in the lysate is collected on the test plate and detected using the NRAS specific antibody via chemiluminescence. We anticipate that this assay will further the discovery of novel NRAS specific therapeutics. EGF treatment of MCF7 cells demonstrated activation in cells expressing wildtype NRAS in preliminary assay validation. Evaluation of assay performance in mutant NRAS melanoma cell lines will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Ras,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Neuroblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Approximately 890,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, while incidence continues to rise and is anticipated to increase by 30% by 2030. HNSCC occurs most often in men in their 50-60s, although the incidence among younger individuals is increasing. Current standard of care practices include surgical resection, followed by adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. HNSCC tumors exhibit frequent mutation of CDKN2A (22% of tumors) and TP53 (72% of tumors). Additionally, two members of the TP53 gene family, TP63 and TP73, are frequently altered in HNSCC. TP63 encodes two major isoforms, &#916;Np63 which lacks the main transcription activation domain and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of transactivation (TA), and TAp63 (contains a p53-like TA domain). &#916;Np63 is overexpressed in a majority of HNSCC tumors. Our lab has reported &#916;Np63&#945; interacts with activated c-Rel (a nuclear factor-KB family member) in HNSCC, thereby promoting uncontrolled proliferation, a key alteration in the pathogenesis of cancers. Consistent with a role in growth regulation, &#916;Np63&#945;:c-Rel complexes bind a promoter motif and repress the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 in both human HNSCCs and normal keratinocytes overexpressing &#916;Np63&#945;. The direct relationship between &#916;Np63&#945; and activated c-Rel is observed by strong nuclear co-localization in the proliferating compartment of primary head and neck SCC. Stimulation of HNSCC cells with TNF&#945; results in the induction of the c-Rel oncoprotein that binds to &#916;Np63, displacing and inactivating the tumor suppressor TAp73 from &#916;Np63-TAp73 complexes. Using western blot analysis in human HNSCC cell lines, we confirmed that stimulation with TNF&#945; enhances nuclear c-Rel localization. We then set out to design a high throughput screening bioassay for the purpose of evaluating compounds that can inhibit c-Rel accumulation in the nucleus under TNF&#945; stimulation. By preventing activated c-Rel from interacting with &#916;Np63&#945; in the nucleus we aim to decrease uncontrolled proliferation and restore the tumor-suppressive functionality of the &#916;Np63-TAp73 complex. A 384-well immunocytochemistry assay was developed using a confocal microscopy readout and an automated image analysis algorithm to quantify nuclear translocation. The optimized assay will be used to screen the NCATS collection of approved drugs and investigational oncology agents. Top candidates will undergo further investigation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo to explore the possibility of repurposing the small molecules for HNSCC therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,High-throughput assay,p63,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

In most cases, drug development starts in discovering candidate compounds from a chemical library in high-throughput screening (HTS). Tohoku University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Science owns the original chemical library consisting of thousands of original chemical compounds. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a major drug efflux transporter mediates multi-drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Therefore, P-gp modulators could revere MDR and increase chemosensitivity. The aim of this study is to reveal an adequate method of HTS for discovering potent P-gp modulators from the chemical library in Tohoku University.<br \/>Methods: The chemical library in Tohoku University had 5861 compounds in the present study, and the collection contains over 7 thousand compounds in 2023. P-gp overexpressing KB-V1, human epidermal carcinoma cell lines were obtained, and calcein AM, P-gp substrate was employed for fluorescent substrate efflux assays. A plate reader-based calcein AM efflux assay for HTS was established to select candidate compounds as P-gp modulators. After the primary HTS, structures of the candidate compounds were analyzed, then several analogous compounds were extracted from the chemical library. For the validation of the hit compounds in HTS and the analogs, a flow cytometry-based calcein AM efflux assay was conducted. In addition, reversal effects of P-gp modulators on the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel were measured in a cell proliferation assay.<br \/>Results: Of 5861 compounds in the chemical library, 53 compounds showed 2-fold or higher fluorescence intensity, and then 13 compounds showed 3-fold or higher fluorescence intensity in a plate reader-based assay for the HTS. Especially 2 candidate compounds showed over 5-fold fluorescence intensity. In the analysis for structures of the candidate compounds, 20 analogous compounds were extracted from the chemical library. To verify the result of the plate reader-based assay, a flow cytometry-based assay was conducted for 53 hits and 20 analogs. As a result, the 2 candidate compounds that selected in the plate reader-based assay showed 60-fold, the highest fluorescence intensity in a flow cytometry-based assay. The other compounds showed less fluorescence intensity than these 2 candidates.

Simplified and automated workflows benefit from assays that measure sample characteristics independent of their buffer, media, or storage conditions. Reliable and robust results are thus required to maintain quality control of downstream processes. In this work, we demonstrate a novel fluorescence-based dye, NexGreen\/PI, capable of live and dead cell detection comparable to AO\/PI in multiple cell buffer\/media conditions. Jurkat cells of different viabilities (low, intermediate, and high) were stained in parallel with either NexGreen\/PI or AO\/PI for 1-2 minutes and measured on multiple image cytometer platforms including low-throughput (Cellometer K2, Auto2000, and Spectrum) and high-throughput (Cellaca MX, Cellaca PLX, and Celigo) instruments. Both NexGreen\/PI and AO\/PI dyes are used as equal volumes added to cell samples (ex: 20 uL cells + 20 uL dye). Additionally, we tested if difficult to analyze cells in &#8220;spent&#8221; media (typically with a lower pH) or in PBS can be stained using NexGreen\/PI compared to AO\/PI. Results on the high-throughput platforms show that NexGreen\/PI staining can discriminate between live and dead Jurkats, analogous to AO\/PI in samples of low (10-25%), intermediate (40-60%), and high (80-95%) viabilities. Measured viability of all samples using NexGreen\/PI was within 5% of the paired AO\/PI-stained samples. Cell concentration results with either NexGreen\/PI or AO\/PI also show counts with less than 6% difference. Low-throughput instrument results are similar and show that viabilities of Jurkat cells match within 5% of each other independent of sample (low, intermediate, or high viability), while cell concentrations differ up to 6% when comparing NexGreen\/PI and AO\/PI. Cells in &#8220;spent&#8221; media or washed and resuspended in PBS can exhibit low AO signal intensity that can be difficult to detect in a robust fashion. NexGreen\/PI-stained cells, however, showed an unaltered fluorescence signal in these &#8220;tricky&#8221; cell samples. In this work, we demonstrated the capability of NexGreen\/PI to measure cell counts and viability using low- and high-throughput instruments, which enables fit-for-purpose for a wide range of samples. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that NexGreen\/PI is scalable and can be of significant value for use in automation and high-throughput systems where multiple samples in different mediums can be precisely measured.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,High-throughput assay,Cell death,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Encoded by the POLQ gene, Pol-theta is a large (290 Kda) protein with two distinct functional domains (polymerase, helicase), separated by an unstructured region. Each domain of Pol-theta has proven vulnerable to small molecule inhibitors, with a number of molecules undergoing clinical evaluation. Unlike the helicase domain, target engagement at the polymerase domain requires cooperativity with DNA fragments. Here we describe a novel NanoBRET Target Engagement assay that enables domain-specific analysis of small molecule occupancy in live cells. To observe the high affinity-state of small molecule inhibitors to the polymerase domain, we have developed a cell-permeable pol domain NanoBRET probe, along with a novel work flow to introduce small DNA fragments into live cells. Together these components form a nucleoprotein complex with full length polymerase theta. This assay method can be used to quantify and rank-order engagement to the polymerase domain in live cells. To enable domain-selectivity analysis, we have developed a second NanoBRET probe directed to the helicase domain. Together these two NanoBRET probes allow for the mechanism of action studies at Pol-theta in living cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,Drug discovery,Screening,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Additionally, its role in immune modulation suggests that DEFB4A may hold promise as a target for novel cancer treatments, particularly in the context of immunotherapy. This study aimed to develop a stable and high-affinity DEFB4A antibody for clinical and pre-clinical use.<br \/>To achieve this, a combination of high-diversity phage libraries and computation-assisted analysis was employed to generate single-chain variable fragments (ScFv) clones specifically targeting DEFB4A. This research presents a robust approach for the generation of DEFB4A-targeting single-chain variable fragments (ScFv) from a phage library characterized by a high diversity of 10<sup>9<\/sup> unique clones and high titer of 10<sup>13<\/sup> cfu\/mL. Computational optimization was then applied to enhance the affinity, stability, and expression of these candidates through rational design and virtual mutagenesis programs. The binding activity of the optimized mutants was validated using biophysical methods such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and thermal stability assays. The process showed a remarkable 100-fold increase in affinity and stability. Additionally, the selected ScFv clone was further employed in immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect DEFB4A in breast, prostate, and gastric cancers, showing higher expression levels compared to initial clones.<br \/>This study highlights the synergy of high-diversity phage libraries and computational methods in crafting DEFB4A antibodies with enhanced affinity, stability, and expression. The findings advance the field of antibody engineering, emphasizing the crucial integration of experimental and computational approaches. This work lays the groundwork for the development of high-performance biologics with diagnostic and prognostic applications across diverse cancer types. Furthermore, it demonstrates the possibility of integrating computational approaches in antibody development, offering the promise of expediting the process in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phage display,Affinity maturation,Computational analysis,Antibody stability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

In response, we executed an in vitro high-throughput drug screening utilizing a 10,000-compound library in an NF1-associated ATRX mutant glioblastoma cell line (JHH-NF1-GBM1) and in U251 cells with ATRX knockout, mimicking the concurrent loss of ATRX and NF1. The screening protocol aimed to pinpoint compounds selectively targeting vulnerabilities arising from the co-occurrence of ATRX and NF1 loss. To enhance the precision of our results, we employed an unsupervised-supervised machine learning approach. Unsupervised models identified distinctive chemical groups associated with heightened sensitivity in ATRX\/NF1-deficient cells. Subsequently, supervised models were trained, and their uncertainty estimates were utilized to further narrow down the selection of hit compounds. We also utilized pre-trained models to predict ADME and toxicity properties, facilitating a further filtration. This multi-step in vitro screening, coupled with in silico analyses, successfully identified promising compounds, subsequently validated through biophysical characterization. The integration of machine learning in our screening pipeline enhances the identification of potential targeted therapies for aggressive tumors (gliomas) characterized by ATRX\/NF1 loss, offering a comprehensive and efficient approach to drug discovery in the pursuit of more effective treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug-discovery screen,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite enabling the high-throughput screening of extensive libraries, the process for identification and characterization of antibodies remains laborious and time-intensive. Here we report a platform that not only compiles hit finding and validation processes, but also provides high-resolution binding affinity as well as rank order among the library being screened. We streamlined the library construction and affinity screening via microscale transient expression in HEK293T cells with designed antibody sequence and direct quantification of antibody-antigen binding affinity which reduced the timeline from multiple weeks to a single week. We constructed the single-chain fragment antigen binding (scFab) libraries by replacing the duplex DNA fragment in CDR of interest while preserving the human framework of Fab. We have demonstrated that the SPID technique allows to detect antibody-antigen interactions from just dozens of pg of scFabs in total. This allowed us to bypass the conventional DNA cloning or even PCR amplification to achieve the minimum amount of DNA plasmids for expressing scFabs to be analyzed such as BLI and SPR. Therefore, we assembled the DNA plasmids through in vitro ligation with high efficiency and directly introduced it to HEK293T in 96-well microplate with microscale (200 ul) for transient transfection, which only takes three days for library generation. Next, we utilized SPID to quantify the number of single molecules between free and antigen-bound fractions of scFab, resulting in occupancy at the antibody-antigen binding equilibrium. This technique facilitated the determination of binding affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub>) for 200 antibody-antigen pairs within a 6-hour TAT encompassing both measurement and analysis. In total, we utilized 4,000 times less antibody for characterization while achieving enhanced sensitivity compared to both BLI and SPR methods. As a proof-of-concept, we generated a library consisting of 720 variants of Trastuzumab in scFab format to probe the landscape of CDRs affecting affinities against HER2 showing nM to low uM dynamic range of K<sub>D<\/sub>. Out of 720 analyzed variants, 5% were deleterious, 38% provided substantial changes, 40% showed little\/no change, 17% enhanced affinity to HER2. To validate the robustness of the platform, we extensively expanded the library screening, assessing over 2,000 antibody variants for their affinity against more than three different therapeutic targets. To conclude, we demonstrated an efficient approach for monitoring changes in affinity resulting from single mutations in scFab. This rapid screening of site-saturated libraries would lead to a combinational variant library that our platform can screen. Ultimately, our platform aims to identify potential candidates for therapeutic antibody development throughput the phases of antibody discovery, maturation, and engineering.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Screening,Therapeutic proteins,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jihye Jo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Changju Chun<sup>2<\/sup>, Byeong-Kwon Sohn<sup>2<\/sup>, Booyoung Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiyu Lee<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Proteina Co., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9f0dc98-54e7-440d-815e-1bbc465f191a","ControlNumber":"6127","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Thermo Fisher Scientific has developed the next generation of Invitrogen&#8482; Zenon&#8482; reagents to enable screening of potential therapeutic antibodies, working across a variety of sample types including primary B cells and hybridomas, while being compatible with a wide range of platforms including flow cytometry, high content imaging, and in-incubator imaging systems.<br \/>Methods: The Invitrogen&#8482; Zenon&#8482; Alexa Fluor&#8482; Plus IgG Labeling Reagents to screen for antibody binding provide a fast, versatile, and reliable method to evaluate antibody binding to cell surface antigens. Zenon screening reagents are labeled with Invitrogen Alexa Fluor Plus 488, Alexa Fluor Plus 594, or Alexa Fluor Plus 647 dyes (i.e., labeling reagent). The labeling reagent is directed against the Fc portion of an intact mouse or human IgG primary antibody. The formation of the zenon-antibody complex is rapid and requires no purification steps. The Invitrogen&#8482; Zenon&#8482; pHrodo&#8482; Deep Red Labeling Reagents for screening antibody internalization provides a highly sensitive method for monitoring antibody internalization. Zenon pHrodo Deep Red utilizes the same screening reagent as Zenon Alexa Fluor Plus reagents, replacing Alexa fluor dyes with the pH-sensitive dye, pHrodo Deep Red. The pHrodo Deep Red sensors have minimal fluorescence at neutral pH and only upon entry into the late endosome and lysosome do they brightly fluoresce. Zenon pHrodo Deep Red Labeling Reagents are perfectly suited for screening the endocytosis and degradation of potentially therapeutic antibodies including antibody-drug conjugates.<br \/>Results: Live cells stained with Zenon-labeled antibodies show remarkable signal to background in both flow and imaging applications, while retaining their signal following fixation. Therapeutic antibodies such as anti-Her2 labeled with Zenon<sup> <\/sup>pHrodo Deep Red show as bright fluorescent puncta upon lysosomal degradation in the Alexa Fluor 647 channel and co-localize with lysosomal markers such as Invitrogen&#8482; LysoTracker Red dye. Both Zenon Alexa Fluor Plus and Zenon phrodo Deep Red are ideal reagents for screening antibody panels of up to 96 different antibodies.<br \/>Conclusions: Thermo Fisher Scientific has developed sensitive and rapid Zenon reagents to allow for high throughput therapeutic antibody screening.

Nanobodies (Nbs) offer an appealing therapeutic approach due to their low immunogenicity, rapid clearance, and high targeting specificity. The aim of this study is to isolate, design, and characterize Nbs directed against EGFR.<br \/>Methods: The Nb library was constructed following llama immunization with cells overexpressing EGFR. After three rounds of panning the phage-display library (both in solid phase and solution), individual clones were screened for EGFR reactivity using ELISA against Virus-Like Particles. Positive clones were sequenced, cloned into an expression vector, and then purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The Nbs were characterized through immunofluorescence (IF), flow cytometry (FACS), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The most promising candidates were used to design bivalent constructs, which were subsequently characterized by SPR and in a cell proliferation assay.<br \/>Results: We successfully constructed an EGFR-targeted Nb library, which allowed the selection of multiple EGFR-specific Nbs following the optimization of the panning strategy. Two of the candidates exhibit strong binding to native EGFR in cells and outperform the gold standard anti-EGFR Nb 7D12. They demonstrate enhanced binding parameters in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, with fast association and slow dissociation rates. The homo\/heterodimeric bivalent constructs show improved affinity and the ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.<br \/>Conclusion: We were able to develop novel mono and bivalent nanobodies with enhanced binding properties which can be used for targeted cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,EGFR,Nanobodies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, the significant challenge in neoantigen-based therapies is that the neoantigens are rare and difficult to predict. Therefore, in addition to prediction algorithms, the optimization of validation methods is essential for the reliable selection of highly immunogenic neoepitopes. In this study, we have developed a cost-effective screening method to validate large scale of neoantigen candidates. The DNA library-based methods have been employed for antigen selection and T cell receptor identification. We improved the DNA library-based neoantigen screening method by adding two barcodes to each minigene transcribing multiple neoantigen candidates and pooled synthesis of minigenes. We initially designed the barcodes to allow analysis in a 10 by 10 format for screening of hundreds of neoantigens so that PCR with each barcode result in amplification of ten candidates. The second barcode allowed the deconvolution of immunogenicity results without the need for synthesis of individual peptides. In this method B cell was used as antigen-presenting cell, which were co-transfected with mRNA for a minigene pool, 41BBL, and OX40L after expansion with CD40L\/IL4\/IL21. The resulting B cells were co-cultured with T cells and T cell responses were evaluated using ELISpot. To validate the method the TESLA consortium reported tetramer positive neoantigens were included in minigene. In results, the neoantigens including each barcode were amplified to form a pool of ten neoantigens as a minigene and confirmed that the neoantigens were equally amplified by nested PCR. The neoantigen pools synthesized as mRNA were transfected for presentation in B cells. The result of the targeting a neoantigen pool containing tetramer-positive neoantigens of the TESLA consortium showed a positive for ELISpot. In conclusion, our optimized screening method, employing the double barcode system, offers a time- and cost-efficient approach for the selection of immunogenic neoantigens without the need for individual peptides. This method will facilitate large-scale screening to identify actual neoantigens with immunogenic potential, contributing to the development of neoantigen-targeted vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,mRNA,Immune response,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, significant differences in their effectiveness persist among individual patients. This variability partly stems from poorly immunogenic tumors, referred to as \"cold\" tumors, characterized by low levels of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). Studies indicate that lower levels of TILs, specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, lead to reduced efficacy of certain immunotherapies. Therefore, the imaging of these cell types could be invaluable in screening cancer patients to predict the effectiveness of a prescribed immunotherapeutic agent before and during treatment. CD4+ T-cells, identified by their high expression of CD4 receptors, could serve as a potential molecular imaging target for an immuno-oncology relevant PET tracer. For this purpose a peptide-based PET tracer offer several beneficial characteristics such as relatively low circulation time, cell penetration, and low development costs.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> All peptides were identified through peptide phage display (PPD) and commercially synthesized (&#62;95% purity). These peptides underwent screening for their binding affinity to recombinant human CD4 and a negative control protein using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore X100. Peptides exhibiting specific binding to CD4, as determined by SPR, were further selected for FITC-labeling (&#62;95% purity). FITC-labeled peptides were applied in fluorescence-based cell assays conducted on the SUP-T1 (CRL-1942) cell line and an established SUP-T1 CD4 knockout (KO) cell line.

We produced the recombinant enzymes using BaV-infected insect cells, as full-length polypeptides, or in some cases truncated to remove disordered N-terminal domains. We determined RNA substrate and cofactor requirements and kinetic parameters with the purified enzymes and optimized the assays for initial velocity detection of RNA-dependent ATPase activity with a Z&#8217; value greater than 0.7, ensuring a sufficient signal window for inhibitor screening and dose response assays. We validated each of the helicase ATPase assays for HTS by screening a collection of bioactives (Tocris 2.0) and confirming hits in dose response mode with the enzymatic assay and with thermal shift assays to confirm target binding.

In 2019, a phase 3 clinical trial suggested that gilteritinib treatment resulted in significantly longer survival than salvage chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients. Targeting FLT3-mutants in AML has become one of the important therapeutic strategies in this decade. The ex vivo hematological VitroScreen platform provides a powerful tool to evaluate the performance of FLT3 inhibitors and other test articles. With Champions Oncology&#8217;s primary hematological repository (https:\/\/www.championsoncology.com\/hematological-vitroscreen) and proprietary LUMIN Bioinformatics platform, we classified models based on patient responses, clinical annotation, NGS data, and cell surface markers. In this Ex vivo study, we tested gilteritinib in 30 AML patients, and 8 of models were identified as FLT-3 mutants&#8217; carrier. Fold changes of cell viability after gilteritinib treatment were assessed based on quantitation of the ATP present. FLT3-mutants models showed significantly higher sensitivity to gilteritinib than FLT3-WT models (IC50, 132.56 nM vs. 234.16nM) in a 6-day assay. Only 25% of models in the FLT3-mutants group had higher IC50 than the average of all AML models (n=28, IC50 = 204.05 nM), compared to 53% in the FLT3-WT group. Our preclinical data highly match the observations in previous clinical trials, which suggest that VitroScreen is a reliable high throughput tool for drug development of drug resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Leukemias: acute myeloid,FLT3,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.-J.

Immune-oncology (IO) drugs play an important role in treating various malignancies. Immunotherapies work by re-educating and boosting patients&#8217; immune systems to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. The immune co-culture assay provides invaluable information to understand the tumor microenvironment (TME) and observe the immune response after IO drug treatment. Recent advancements in the Champions TumorGraft3D (CTG3D) platform provides more consistent and accurate information for preclinical drug evaluation, but also efficiently simulate the tumor-Immune microenvironment (TIME) and interactions between cancer organoids and immunocyte. However, current analytic approaches in organoid-immune co-culture studies are still highly reliant on flow cytometry and high-resolution confocal imaging endpoints to provide the study outcome. There is a need for a fast and cost-effective co-culture platform to help set up experimental conditions. Easily traceable tags (e.g. bioluminescent and fluorescent) can quickly help establish reliable the effector (E) cell to tumor (T) cell conditions, thus enabling the user to test multiple immune-cell activator or engagers concentrations in a cost-effective and rapid manner. At Champions Oncology we provide stable Luc\/GFP-tagged CTG3D models. We have built a reliable CTG3D-immune co-culture platform with various indications (including colon, prostate, gastric, non-small cell lung cancer, and leukemia) which can be used in co-culture with autologous TIL, allogenic TIL and NK cells, thus providing users a fast and cost-effective option to optimize the E:T ratio and monitor the drug performance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-05 High-throughput screening (assays and libraries),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-content screening,3D models,3D imaging,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.-J.
