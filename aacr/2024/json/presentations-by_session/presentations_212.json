Variant cellular origin was determined using a tumor-independent WBC DNA-informed approach. The maximum mutant allele fraction (maxMAF) of tumor-derived mutations was tracked longitudinally to assess changes in total cell-free tumor load (cfTL).<br \/>Results: Among 3,418 variants with resolved cellular origin, 2,452 (72%) were tumor-derived, 125 (4%) were germline, while 841 (25%) were related to clonal haematopoiesis (CH). Cell-free DNA fragments harbouring tumor-derived mutations were significantly shorter than fragments containing wild-type alleles; however, fragment length alone was insufficient to distinguish CH variants from wild-type. Overall, 97 (89%) patients with <u>&#62;<\/u>1 detectable tumor mutation were considered for cfTL tracking and molecular response assessment. Clearance of cfTL indicated molecular response (mR) whereas persistence indicated molecular progression (mPD). Time-course analyses, aiming to establish the optimal timing for molecular response assessment, revealed that early cfTL clearance within 3-9 weeks was significantly linked to improved survival outcomes. Notably, blood tumor mutation burden above or below 16 mutations\/megabase showed no association with overall survival (OS; log rank p=0.98) or progression-free survival (PFS; log rank p=0.95). Of 81 patients evaluated for early on-therapy molecular responses, 28 (35%) were classified as having an mR, while 53 (65%) patients were classified in the mPD category. The median time to mR was 5 weeks in patients receiving immune checkpoint monotherapy and 6 weeks in patients receiving chemo-immunotherapy combination regimens. Patients in the mR group achieved longer OS (log rank p=0.001) and PFS (log rank p=0.0003) compared to those with mPD. Assessment of landmark PFS at 6 months demonstrated a significant association between ctDNA molecular response and durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients receiving immune checkpoint monotherapy (p &#60; 0.001, Fisher&#8217;s exact test), and a numerical association with DCB in patients on chemo-immunotherapy (p=0.07, Fisher&#8217;s exact test).<br \/>Conclusions: Longitudinal tracking of ctDNA provides a real-time and accurate approach for monitoring immunotherapy response. These findings underscore the clinical utility of employing ctDNA molecular response to inform clinical decision-making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Immune checkpoint blockade,Circulating tumor DNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Monitoring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood may allow clinicians to predict ICI response or resistance earlier than imaging and track response more frequently. In this study, melanoma patients receiving ICI were profiled using an ultra-sensitive, tumor-informed ctDNA detection platform, and the findings were correlated with clinical outcome. <b> <\/b> In this retrospective study, 188 plasma samples were collected from 23 advanced melanoma patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, spanning a period of up to 40 months. Levels of ctDNA were then profiled using the NeXT Personal&#174; assay. NeXT Personal is a liquid biopsy platform that utilizes whole-genome sequencing of tumor and normal samples to create a customized panel for each patient, encompassing up to 1,800 genetic somatic variants. This enables the detection of molecular residual disease (MRD) down to a limit of detection (LOD) of 1-3 parts per million (PPM). We subsequently compared the results obtained through NeXT Personal with RECIST-defined measurements and clinical outcomes. Ultra-sensitive ctDNA detection was achieved across a wide dynamic range, spanning from 2.3 PPM to over 130,000 PPM (median LOD = 2 PPM). A significant number of detections were attained at low PPM levels, with 30% (31\/105) occurring below 100 PPM and 25% (26\/105) occurring below 50 PPM. 94% (17\/18) of baseline samples were ctDNA+ among patients without recent second-line therapy, including all patients who progressed. All ctDNA+ detections aligned with imaging results that indicated the presence of tumor. Likewise, all plasma timepoints corresponding to complete responses (CR) assessed via RECIST were ctDNA-. Early increase in ctDNA from baseline to treatment cycle 3 significantly predicted PFS (log-rank 0.003; Wald p=0.01, HR=8.35, 95% CI 1.62-43.15). Survival was predicted by both imaging CR (log-rank p=0.018) and ctDNA clearance (log-rank p=0.003). Molecular progression, defined as a 20% increase in ctDNA, significantly predicted OS (log-rank p=0.023), whereas imaging PD status did not predict OS (log-rank p=0.09). We achieved detection of ctDNA with an LOD down to 1.3 PPM in this cohort, with nearly a third of detections occurring below 100 PPM, suggesting the importance of an ultra-sensitive ctDNA approach even in late stage patients. Our findings suggest that ctDNA changes arepredictive of ICI response in late stage melanoma. These results highlight the potential for patient-specific ctDNA monitoring to inform patient management and for clincal trial design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Liquid biopsies,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, only 15-20% of patients benefit from ACT, as half of patients are cured by surgery, and 25-30% still experience a recurrence. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after resection of the primary tumor is a strong prognostic biomarker in non-metastatic colon cancer and offers a promising approach to better stratify stage III colon cancer patients for ACT treatment decisions.<br \/>Aim: The PROVENC3 study aims to determine the clinical validity of post-surgery ctDNA detection in patients with stage III colon cancer treated with ACT.<br \/>Methods: Blood was collected pre-surgery, post-surgery and post-ACT for stage III colon cancer patients treated with ACT. Tumor-informed detection of ctDNA was performed through integrated whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue DNA (80x), germline DNA (40x), and plasma cell-free DNA (30x). The primary outcome was time to recurrence (TTR).<br \/>Results: Results from 209 patients (median follow up: 40 months) show that ctDNA-positive patients post-surgery (n=28) had a higher risk of developing a recurrence than ctDNA-negative patients (HR: 6.3, [95%CI: 3.5-11.3],<i> P<\/i>&#60;10<sup>-8<\/sup>). 38% of patients with a recurrence within 3 years were ctDNA-positive post-surgery. Combination of post-surgery ctDNA status with established clinicopathological risk classification of low-risk (T1-3 and N1) and high-risk (T4 and\/or N2) resulted in a 3-year cumulative recurrence risk of 82% for clinical high-risk ctDNA-positive patients compared to 7% for clinical low-risk ctDNA-negative patients (HR 28.9 [95%CI: 10.6-78.2]; <i>P<\/i>&#60;10<sup>-10<\/sup>). Results from 170 patients with post-ACT blood available showed that post-ACT ctDNA-positive patients (n=24) were at a higher risk of developing a recurrence (HR 7.9 [95%CI: 3.5-15.9]; <i>P<\/i>&#60;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) than ctDNA-negative patients. The patients experiencing a recurrence had higher aggregate ctDNA variant allele frequencies than patients not experiencing a recurrence post-surgery or post-ACT (P&#60;0.001 and P&#60;0.001, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: Post-surgery ctDNA detection by tumor-informed WGS is a strong prognostic biomarker in stage III colon cancer patients, and improves the current risk stratification. Importantly, the post-surgery ctDNA-positive patients who did not experience a recurrence were likely cured by ACT. These data enable the design of clinical practice-changing ctDNA-guided interventional trials in stage III colon cancer to personalize adjuvant treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Prognostic markers,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) analysis could potentially complement circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and allow broader molecular characterization of cancers but has not been extensively explored. Here, we describe RARE-Seq, a novel cfRNA sequencing method designed to maximize sensitivity by targeting rare, tissue-specific transcripts, and simultaneously detecting both tumor-derived expression signatures and somatic mutations in circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA).<br \/>To interrogate samples for specific gene expression signatures, we developed and optimized a framework to measure tumor- and tissue-specific enrichment scores (ES) within cfRNA. We then empirically determined the limit of detection (LOD95) of RARE-Seq using admixtures of tumor cell line RNA and control cfRNA across a wide range of fractions. We found RARE-Seq to have an estimated LOD95 of 0.05% for cancer-derived RNA, which was 52-fold better than whole transcriptome cfRNA profiling.<br \/>To explore its potential clinical utility, we profiled 192 samples from 170 subjects with various cancers and non-cancer controls using RARE-Seq. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expression signatures were significantly detected in 40 out of 51 NSCLC samples (78% sensitivity at 90% specificity). Detection increased with stage, ranging from 40% in stage I to 87% in stage IV. In a subset of stage IV NSCLC patients with matching ctDNA data (<i>n=<\/i>16), ctRNA levels were significantly correlated with ctDNA allele frequencies (Pearson <i>R<\/i>=0.84<i>, P<\/i>=0.005). Intriguingly, 86% of samples with undetectable ctDNA contained detectable ctRNA, suggesting potential complementarity of ctRNA and ctDNA analysis for cancer detection. We also developed and benchmarked a direct ctRNA genotyping approach, allowing noninvasive detection of driver mutations in 42% of patients with advanced NSCLC. When applied to other tumors, RARE-Seq demonstrated 80-100% sensitivity at 90% specificity for detection of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PAAD), prostate adenocarcinomas (PRAD), and hepatocellular carcinomas (LIHC). Furthermore, when evaluating tissue of origin (TOO) classification performance, RARE-Seq achieved 85% median accuracy for the top predicted tissue and 96% median accuracy for the top two tissues.<br \/>These results highlight the potential value of ultrasensitive cfRNA analysis, providing proof-of-principle for detection of multiple tumor types using RARE-Seq.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Cancer detection,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Since tumor tissue is not always available, blood allows the investigation of single circulating tumor cells (sCTC) over time. We combined immunomagnetic enrichment and image-based sCTC sorting for phenotypic and genotypic analysis of sCTCs in the follow-up of OC to provide insights into sCTC heterogeneity and their malignant character.<br \/>Patients and Methods: 10 ml blood of high-grade serous OC patients (pts) at the time of primary diagnosis (n=42), after chemotherapy (n=23) and after Avastin (n=11) was analyzed for sCTCs using density-gradient centrifugation to further apply MACS&#174; using CD45 and CD235a antibodies coupled to MACS&#174; MicroBeads. For image-based sCTC sorting (DEPArray&#174;), an immunofluorescence protocol staining for Hoechst, cytokeratin (CK), the folate receptor alpha (FRa), Vimentin (Vim) and CD45 was applied. Whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed in recovered single cells, comprising cell lysis, DNA digestion, adaptor ligation and an amplification PCR for subsequent copy number alteration (CNA) analysis. Ampli1<sup>TM<\/sup> low-pass analysis was used to analyze single cell WGA products. 21 primary tumors (PT) were assessed for whole-genome CNA and the Ampli 1<sup>TM<\/sup> OncoSeek panel was used for deep sequencing of sCTCs.<br \/>Results: Phenotypic assessment revealed FRa-positive cells in 28\/42 (67%) pts, CK-positive cells in 32\/42 (76%) pts and CK-FRa-double-positive cells in 15\/42 (36%) pts, respectively, with a significant (p= 0.0205) reduction of cells after chemotherapy only documented for FRa-positive cells. Interestingly, cells with a high nuclear staining but no expression of target antigens were found in 37\/42 pts (88%) and significantly (p=0.002) expanded during treatment. Genotyping revealed that only 7% (19\/289) of single cells deriving from 13 different pts were aberrant. Whole genome CNA analysis in all pre-treatment sCTCs revealed enriched CNAs in chromosomes 2, 7 and 12. In post-treatment sCTCs, CNA dynamics highlighted the adaptive potential of the homologous recombination pathway and suggested further investigation of MAPK signaling in resistant OC. Low-pass CNA comparison between sCTCs and the PT was feasible in nine pts, 2\/9 with persistent PT characteristics in sCTCs at different sampling times. TP53 variants were the most frequently detected ones, persistent CNA in the <i>CDK4<\/i> oncogene and emerging CNA in the <i>ALK<\/i> oncogene were found in sCTCs from two pts.<br \/>Conclusion: We identified sCTCs in the follow-up of OC and demonstrated interpatient as well as intrapatient heterogeneity of sCTCs.

In this study, we describe a comprehensive liquid biopsy analysis of whole blood to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs), large extracellular vesicles and CTC fragments, and CTC-white blood cell hybrids; quantify protein biomarker expression on CTCs; perform targeted mutation profiling on CTCs and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma; and analyze protein expression on white blood cells (WBCs) from a single 7.5 mL blood sample. This array of tests was applied to blood samples from patients with Stage IV prostate cancer to demonstrate clinical feasibility.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> A novel dual biomarker CTC assay was developed to measure protein expression of PSMA and ARv7 on CTCs from stage IV prostate cancer patients. Nucleated cells from clinical samples were processed to microscope slides using AccuCyte&#174;, an unbiased, density-based separation method that also allows for plasma collection for downstream analysis. Slides were fixed and stained with antibodies to cytokeratin, EpCAM, and CD45 to detect CTCs and exclude WBCs, and with PSMA and ARv7 to evaluate protein biomarker expression on identified CTCs. The slides were imaged with the CyteFinder&#174; automated immunofluorescence scanning microscope that identifies CTCs for confirmation by trained reviewers and quantitatively measures protein mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on any cells detected on the slides (CTCs, CTC-WBC hybrids, large extracellular vesicles and CTC fragments and WBCs). Individual CTCs and control pools of WBCs from clinical samples with at least 4 CTCs were picked using CytePicker<sup>&#174;<\/sup>, a needle-based system used to isolate single cells. cfDNA was isolated from plasma removed during the AccuCyte&#174; process using a QIAamp MinElute ccfDNA kit. Picked CTCs, WBC pools, and isolated ctDNA were sequenced using the OncoZoom Cancer HotSpot panel from Paragon Genomics.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Nine progressing Stage IV prostate cancer patient blood samples were stained with a novel PSMA\/ARv7 dual biomarker assay. CTCs were identified in all clinical samples (median 4, range 1 - 384). PSMA positivity in clinical samples ranged from 0% to 75%, and ARv7 positivity ranged from 33% to 100%, and. Additional analysis using QuPath was performed to determine PSMA\/ARv7 protein expression on WBCs and CTC fragments. ctDNA analysis from 5 individual samples was compared to sequencing results from individual CTCs from the same samples.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> Using a single 7.5 mL blood liquid biopsy, we can measure protein expression on enumerated CTCs and quantify these same protein biomarkers on WBCs and CTC fragments\/oncosomes, determine the genetic makeup of the tumor through the sequencing of cfDNA, and monitor genetic mutations in intact CTCs in circulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Cell-free DNA,Extracellular vesicles,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Liquid biopsies show great promise in providing insights on the current disease state, but generally rely on a small number of protein markers identified through immunofluorescence staining or genomic mutations determined from cell-free DNA which limits the amount of information available to make treatment decisions. One way to better select the optimal drug target is to generate unbiased mass-spectrometry based proteomic data from the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from blood. In this study, we collaborated with Astrin Biosciences using their patented isolation technology to enrich CTCs with high purity from the blood of 57 metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The CTC-enriched sample (along with a patient-matched control sample consisting primarily of white blood cells) was analyzed in real time for either PSMA protein (Lutetium-PSMA-617 study, n=32) or via mass-spectrometry (CTC proteomics study, n=25). Over 1,500 peptides corresponding to greater than 600 proteins were identified from each patient&#8217;s CTCs. These included increased epithelial cell markers in the CTC-enriched sample and increased WBC markers in the control sample. Specifically, detection of the androgen receptor protein was identified in the CTC-enriched sample which is of particular interest in mCRPC patients. Furthermore, this method is able to detect and quantify PSMA expression, which is of clear relevance in the context of PSMA-directed therapeutics. This study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining large scale proteomic data from a liquid biopsy. Future studies will focus on cancer signaling mechanisms and biomarkers to elucidate the clinical utility of such data. As more patients are analyzed, we will compare proteomic data with known tissue proteome information when available and to correlate these with drug response to improve treatment selection and patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Prostate cancer,Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
