Despite a high tumor mutational burden, MSI-H tumors do not frequently harbor mutations in TP53. Notably, a frameshift mutation (<i>p.K15fs<\/i>) in the gene <i>RPL22<\/i> is among the most recurrent mutations in MSI-H tumors. RPL22 and its paralog, RPL22L1, form part of the large subunit of the 60S ribosome and are known to affect protein synthesis as well as splicing of genes and transcription factors that affect development and tumorigenesis. Here we explore the result of <i>RPL22<\/i> loss on the regulation of MDM4, an upstream target of p53. MDM4 protein expression is mediated through alternative mRNA splicing of its sixth exon, which leads to two isoforms, the exon 6-inclusive MDM4-FL and the exon 6-exclusive MDM4-S, which is prone to degradation. To date, no mutational events have been associated with this alternative splicing event. We show the prevalence of <i>RPL22fs <\/i>mutations is more than 70% in certain MSI-H cell lines (e.g. colon, endometrial) and tumors (e.g. stomach adenocarcinoma) in the CCLE and TCGA. <i>RPL22 <\/i>copy number loss and <i>RPL22<\/i> frameshift mutations are strongly correlated with MDM4 exon 6 inclusion in TCGA samples, and <i>RPL22 <\/i>knockout increases <i>MDM4 <\/i>exon 6 inclusion and MDM4 protein in multiple cell lines. <i>RPL22<\/i> loss increases cell proliferation and augments resistance to the MDM inhibitor Nutlin-3a. Downstream targets of p53 (p21, BBC3) are downregulated due to <i>RPL22 <\/i>loss and Nutlin-3a inhibition, suggesting mutation of <i>RPL22<\/i> and subsequent overexpression of MDM4 promotes resistance to Nutlin-3a. CLIP-seq revealed that RPL22 binds the <i>MDM4<\/i> 3&#8217;-UTR. We find that <i>RPL22 <\/i>loss is associated with an alternative 3&#8217;-splicing event in <i>RPL22L1<\/i> adjacent to exon 3 and results in the expression of the full-length transcript of <i>RPL22L1<\/i>. In summary, we identify RPL22 as a key modulator of <i>MDM4<\/i> splicing through an alternative splicing switch in exon 6. Furthermore, RPL22 represses the expression of its paralog, RPL22L1, by mediating the splicing of a cryptic exon corresponding to a truncated functional transcript. Therefore, we propose that damaging mutations in <i>RPL22<\/i> drive oncogenic MDM4 induction and reveal a common splicing circuit in MSI-H tumors that may inform therapeutic targeting of the MDM4-p53 axis and oncogenic RPL22L1 induction. Our results also suggest that the presence of RPL22 may act as a rheostat to maintain <i>MDM4<\/i> exon 6 skipping under normal cellular contexts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microsatellite instability,MDM4,Splicing modulation,RPL22,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive primary brain cancer, median survival being approximately one year and the 5-year survival rate being only 5%. Despite decades of effort, this devastating picture has not appreciably improved and effective therapies have been elusive for GBM patients. A better understanding of GBM biology is essential for developing more effective therapies. Although several genetic alterations have been implicated in gliomagenesis, driving genetic factors responsible for GBM are still obscure, and the interplay between genetic alterations and epigenetic dysregulation is largely undocumented during the gliomagenic process. Here, we show that <i>CHD5<\/i> &#8212; a gene mapping to the 1p36 chromosomal region that is notoriously deleted in many cancers, is recurrently deleted in over 20% of GBM cases and is further downregulated through epigenetic means. To delineate how CHD5 loss promotes gliomagenesis, we established a glioma-prone mouse model harboring conditional alleles of <i>Pten<\/i>, <i>Trp53<\/i>, and <i>Chd5<\/i>. We developed an engineered mouse neural stem cell (NSCs)-based strategy to elicit glioma formation, as NSCs are the major cell-of-origin for GBM. We show that Chd5 loss significantly impairs NSCs differentiation while promoting proliferation, transformation, and gliomagenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanistically, Chd5 forms a Chd3-containing but Chd4-independent NuRD complex that directly binds the <i>Myc <\/i>promoter and super enhancers to govern <i>Myc<\/i> expression in normal NSCs, with the Snf2 domain of Chd5 playing the most critical chromatin regulating role in the context of GBM. Chd5 loss triggers the remodeling of chromatin, enhances accessibility, and augments <i>Myc <\/i>expression, leading to the formation of highly aggressive glioma. Furthermore, reactivating CHD5 in human GBM xenograft models significantly extends survival. This work demonstrates the tumor suppressive role of CHD5 in gliomagenesis, providing therapeutic insights for cancers with 1p36 deletions. In parallel, this work presents a powerful strategy for rapidly interrogating gene function during gliomagenesis using engineering NSCs, and the generation of novel mouse models with classic clinical features of GBM, offering new approaches for elucidating GBM biology that can inform on therapeutic opportunities for treating patients with GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,CHD5\/NuRD complex,Myc,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Elevated cholesterol is associated with poor prognosis, with several potential mechanisms proposed. Work in murine models found that many of the pro-metastatic actions of cholesterol required the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), which functions as a ligand for both the estrogen receptors (ERs) and liver X receptors (LXRs). Importantly, we have found that 27HC promotes metastasis, in part through its actions on neutrophils. When examining mechanisms, we have made the observation that 27HC resulted in increased secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from neutrophils. These 27HC-neutrophil-sEVs independently promote metastatic colonization. Since we have found that breast cancer cell lines can take up neutrophil-derived sEVs, we hypothesized that 27HC results in altered cargo within sEVs which leads to functional changes within cancer cells, the ultimate consequence of which being their increased metastatic potential. Using a non-biased small RNA-seq approach we have found that sEVs from 27HC-treated neutrophils had an altered miRNA signature. Bioinformatic analysis revealed several downregulated miRNAs from the let-7 subgroup. Let-7 miRs are known to target several genes associated with the WNT\/&#946;-catenin pathway, a pathway strongly implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell stemness. Strikingly, breast cancer cells treated with sEVs from neutrophils treated with 27HC lost their adherent properties and adopted a mesenchymal and stem-like phenotype. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which these sEVs promote EMT and stemness, we performed comprehensive transcriptomics through time. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) confirmed these phenotypic shifts, and implicated the WNT\/&#946;-catenin pathway, providing support to our hypothesis that the loss of let-7 miRs is the upstream mediator. Collectively, our data suggests that 27HC increases metastasis in part through its effects on neutrophils, by shifting sEVs cargo towards a loss of protective microRNA, resulting in increased EMT and stemness, and thus the ability of cancer cells to migrate, invade and metastasize.

The <i>High Mobility Group A1<\/i> (<i>HMGA1<\/i>) gene encodes an architectural transcription factor that binds to DNA at AT-rich sequences where it recruits chromatin complexes to modulate gene expression. <i>HMGA1<\/i> is highly expressed during embryogenesis and in adult stem cells, but silenced in differentiated cells. <i>HMGA1 <\/i>becomes re-expressed in aggressive cancers where high levels portend adverse outcomes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), <i>HMGA1<\/i> is among the genes most highly overexpressed compared to normal colon epithelium. We previously discovered that <i>HMGA1<\/i> is required for oncogenic phenotypes in CRC cell lines by inducing genes involved in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. <i>Hmga1<\/i> transgenic mice also develop aberrant proliferation and polyposis of small intestinal epithelium where Hmga1 amplifies Wnt signals to enhance self-renewal. To determine how HMGA1 functions in colon epithelial homeostasis and tumorigenesis, we examined mouse models with overexpression or deficiency of <i>Hmga1<\/i>. Here, we uncover a previously unknown role for HMGA1 as an epigenetic gatekeeper of Wnt signals in colon epithelial cells, both during tumorigenesis driven by mutant <i>APC<\/i> or stress-induced tissue repair. Strikingly, loss of just a single <i>Hmga1<\/i> allele within the colon epithelium disrupts tumorigenesis while prolonging survival in two models of colon tumorigenesis driven by <i>APC<\/i> mutation, including <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>TC<\/sup>Apc<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i> and <i>APC<sup>Min <\/sup><\/i>mice inoculated with pro-carcinogenic, enterotoxigenic <i>Bacteroides fragilis<\/i>. Single cell RNA sequencing in <i>Apc<\/i> mutant crypt epithelial cells reveals that intact Hmga1 is required for expansion in the <i>Lgr5<sup>+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>stem cell pool, deep secretory cells, and tuft cells during tumorigenesis. <i>Hmga1<\/i> deficiency impacts the stem cell pool the greatest, decreasing Lgr5+ stem cells with skewing to more proliferative, transit amplifying-like cells. Single cell transcriptomic analyses together with assays of single cell chromatin accessibility demonstrate that Hmga1 maintains accessible chromatin to activate gene loci involved in Wnt signals, including <i>Ascl2<\/i>, a stem cell master regulator, Wnt agonist receptors, and Wnt downstream effectors. Surprisingly, either depletion or overexpression of <i>Hmga1<\/i> has no impact on colon epithelial regeneration under homeostatic conditions, although <i>Hmga1<\/i> overexpression enhances tissue repair and survival following injury induced by inflammation or irradiation. Together, our results establish HMGA1 as an epigenetic gatekeeper of Wnt signals in colon stem cells during APC-driven tumorigenesis or injury, but not steady state homeostasis, highlighting its role as a promising therapeutic target for both cancer and regenerative medicine. <i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-03 Developmental pathways in cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HMGA1,Wnt signaling,Colorectal cancer,Cancer stem cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

These chromosomes, inherited only by one daughter cell, are subsequently encapsulated in micronuclei (MNi). Micronucleation is detrimental for replication fidelity not only because it sustains chromosomal missegregation, but also because MNi frequently undergo irreversible collapse during interphase exposing their enclosed chromatin to the cytosol. This exposure catalyzes chromosomal rearrangements and heritable epigenetic abnormalities that have been shown to further bolster cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, MNi collapse is known to promote distant metastasis and poor prognosis through eliciting a non-canonical response of otherwise inflammatory signaling pathways. Despite the fundamental role played by MNi catastrophe in compromising genome integrity and sustaining cancer progression, and the subsequent therapeutic potential of targeting this process, the mechanisms underlying MNi collapse are poorly understood. Here, we identify mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the main cause of MNi rupture. Notably, we observe that MNi that locate closer to mitochondria are more prone to rupture. Accordingly, increasing ROS chemically and by H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> addition increment rupture in a panel of 5 different tumor cell lines, while decreasing ROS using pan-cellular or mitochondrial specific scavengers reduce the frequency of ruptured MNi. By using a combination of advanced super-resolution microscopy, proteomics, transcriptomics, <i>in vitro<\/i> biochemistry assays, and extensive mutagenesis, we reveal the exact pathway leading to MNi collapse. We demonstrate that ROS promote a noncanonical function of the membrane repair ESCRT-III complex scaffolding protein, CHMP7. ROS reduce CHMP7 interaction with ESCRT-III promoting CHMP7 oligomerization and its binding to the inner nuclear membrane protein, LEMD2. CHMP7, while aggregating, physically pulls the micronuclear envelope together with the LEMD2-associated lamina, thereby disrupting MNi integrity. Finally, we show that hypoxic conditions promote ROS-dependent CHMP7-LEMD2 interaction, inducing MNi rupture and inflammatory signaling. Thus, we observe that human tumors characterized by hypoxia have a significantly increased predominance of ruptured MNi, providing a mechanistic link between tumor hypoxia and downstream processes that drive cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Reactive oxygen species,Protein-protein interactions,Hypoxia,Mitochondria,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In patients with medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, mortality is almost exclusively dictated by metastasis to the leptomeninges, the inner covering of the brain and spinal cord. We aim to mechanistically understand the molecular drivers of leptomeningeal colonization, including how leptomeningeal adhesion mediates therapy resistance.<br \/><u>Experimental approach:<\/u> Progress in leptomeningeal metastasis research has been hindered by the scarcity of matched primary and metastatic tissue from patients given the lack of clinical benefit to obtaining metastatic tissue. Furthermore, end points from pre-clinical human xenograft mouse models are often driven by primary cerebellar tumors, not leptomeningeal dissemination. These barriers underscore the necessity for novel<i> in vitro<\/i> leptomeningeal metastasis models that allow for rigorous experimental analysis. These models must simultaneously recapitulate tumor cell-host and tumor cell-environment interactions driving colonization to produce translatable findings. Accordingly, our lab has developed two novel<i> in vitro<\/i> leptomeningeal metastasis models that allow for cell-based experimental analysis: a primary meningeal cell-medulloblastoma organotypic co-culture and an acellular leptomeningeal matrix mimetic monoculture.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> Proteomic analysis identified that leptomeningeal cells promote medulloblastoma chemotactic honing to the leptomeninges through CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Additionally, loss of CXCL12\/CXCR4 signaling impaired medulloblastoma adhesion to the leptomeninges. CXCL12\/CXCR4 are known to mediate adhesion of stem cells in stromal niches via activation of integrin receptor ITGA4\/ITGB1 (VLA4) binding to stromal VCAM1. Indeed, the VLA4-VCAM1 axis is required for medulloblastoma leptomeningeal adhesion and requires activation by CXCL12\/CXCR4 signaling. From a translational perspective, we found that leptomeningeal adhesion promotes therapy resistance and that inhibition of adhesion signaling sensitized adherent medulloblastoma cells to therapy.<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> These findings provide proof-of-concept that appropriate<i> in vitro<\/i> models of metastasis can be developed and utilized to define the biology driving adhesion and chemotherapy resistance in medulloblastoma metastasis. Furthermore, we show that medulloblastoma leptomeningeal adhesion is mediated by a CXCL12\/CXCR4-VLA4\/VCAM1 axis. Finally, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting this axis in sensitizing medulloblastoma metastases to current therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Metastatic tumors,Adhesion,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Both truncating loss-of-function mutations and point mutations of the <i>TP53 <\/i>gene (mouse gene <i>Trp53<\/i>), which encodes for the p53 protein, are frequently observed across human cancers. While point mutations in p53 result in loss of canonical tumor suppressor function, recent studies suggest that these mutated proteins acquire pro-tumorigenic gain-of-function properties. For example, <i>Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup> <\/i>mutations (the murine homolog of <i>TP53<sup>R175H<\/sup><\/i>, the most common human <i>TP53<\/i> variant) enhance metastatic spread relative to deletion mutations in mouse models of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To further explore the differential functions of p53 point and deletion mutants in cancer progression, we performed a rigorous comparative analysis of <i>Trp53<\/i> alleles <i>in vivo<\/i> using <b><u>M<\/u><\/b>osaic <b><u>A<\/u><\/b>nalysis with <b><u>D<\/u><\/b>ouble <b><u>M<\/u><\/b>arkers (MADM) in mice. MADM uses stochastic mitotic recombination to induce two genotypically distinct daughter cells - created at 1-to-1 ratios - expressing different <i>Trp53<\/i> variants dependent on the genotype of the mouse (<i>+\/+<\/i> vs. <i>-\/-<\/i>, <i>R172H\/R172H<\/i> vs. <i>+\/+<\/i>, <i>R172H\/R172H<\/i> vs. <i>-\/-<\/i>) and simultaneously label them with unique genetically encoded fluorescent markers (TdTomato vs. GFP). We integrated MADM into a faithful <i>Kras<\/i>-driven model of pancreatic tumorigenesis and used fluorescence microscopy to trace subclonal populations with various p53 alleles within the same mouse. By analyzing the ratio of TdTomato+ to GFP+ cells, we studied the functional differences between alleles in driving pancreatic cancer at various stages of progression. We found that <i>Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells exhibited greater tumor initiation of preinvasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) and early PanIN cell expansion compared to <i>Trp53<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i> cells. Surprisingly, <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/R172H<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>cells were comparable in number to <i>Trp53<sup>+\/+<\/sup><\/i> cells in early PanINs but were outcompeted by <i>Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells.In contrast, both <i>Trp53<sup>R172H\/R172H<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>and<i> Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells were capable of facilitating the transition to advanced PDAC with comparable survival times. These phenotypic differences imply that p53<sup>R172H<\/sup> retains tumor suppressive properties in early pancreatic tumorigenesis, but similar to the loss of p53, it is incapable of constraining progression to advanced disease, arguing that p53<sup>R172H<\/sup> is a separation of function mutation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Ongoing studies examining the molecular differences between <i>Trp53<\/i> alleles by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-sequencing will shed further light onto the underlying mechanisms that explain these phenotypic differences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,p53 mutations,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
