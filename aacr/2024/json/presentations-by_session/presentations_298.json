[{"Abstract":"Background: Adoptive T cell-based transfer has shown tremendous success in hematological cancers. However, an important obstacle to using cell and gene therapy for solid tumors is the aggressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To significantly improve prognosis of subjects undergoing immunotherapy, it is essential to incorporate unique methods to drive T cell energy production and metabolism towards empowering T cells to dismantle the suppressive TME. This can promote anti-tumor effects and persistence of the transfused engineered T cells. In the present study we present a simple metabolic preconditioning process that improves T cell performance and bioenergetics.<br \/>Methods: Using the Agilent xCELLigence RTCA eSight, and Seahorse XF Analyzer we assessed the killing efficiency, and bioenergetics of engineered T-cells after pretreating with Arginine. Briefly, engineered TCR T-cells against MART-1 were generated by transducing CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells (Hemacare, Seattle, WA) with retrovirus SAMEN-DMF5 with a CD34 marker gene, against MART-1. The TCR T cells were pre-conditioned in 6mM Arginine for 7 days, followed by a killing assay using MART-1 expressing melanoma cell line as target cells (624.38) at the E:T ratio of 5:1. Target melanoma cells, 624.38 cells, were engineered to express a red-fluorescent nuclear protein. The comparison was made with transduced T-cells grown in RPMI (no added amino acid supplementation, and non-transduced T cells. The cytotoxicity assay was assessed using real-time impedance and live cell imaging data collected on xCELLigence RTCA eSight. Concurrently, the metabolic profiling of the engineered T-cells was examined by the XF96 Analyzer.<br \/>Results: Supplementing the growth medium with 6 mM Arginine significantly increased the potency of MART-1 engineered T cells (up to 6-fold) and bioenergetic studies revealed increased spare respiratory capacity, basal respiration, and ATP production via mitochondrial respiration.<br \/>Conclusions: Arginine pre-conditioning improved TCR T cell potency through metabolic rewiring favoring mitochondrial respiration.

Individuals with pre-existing immunity to AAVs are less likely to benefit from AAV-based therapies due to both, a reduction in cellular AAV uptake and activation of a cytotoxic T-cell response to transduced cells, decreasing efficacy or changing the safety profile. Measurement of serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AAV is essential to determine treatment eligibility and to identify clinical trial candidates. Here we introduce a cell-based assay using NanoLuc&#174; luciferase to detect NAbs in serum samples. The superior brightness of NanoLuc&#174; luciferase in our AAV reporter system results in the need of low concentrations of AAV and a short 24h assay time. The minimal AAV concentration in our assay aids in detecting low NAb titers in serum samples, reducing false negatives and enhancing decision-making accuracy. Testing 60 human serum samples against a range of AAV serotypes, we found that a large fraction of the population had pre-existing NAbs to at least one serotype, and of the pre-exposed individuals a majority displayed NAbs against multiple AAV serotypes. Interestingly, fewer samples were seropositive for AAV-DJ than for either parental serotype (AAV2, AAV8 or AAV9), highlighting the assays utility in the development of engineered capsids. Furthermore, the broad dynamic range of our assay facilitates serum sample categorization into four NAb tiers: negative, low, medium, and high using a single serum dilution. Neutralizing titers (ND<sub>50<\/sub>) which was determined by serial dilution of the serum samples strongly agreed with the assigned NAb tiers. Our study with 40 na&#239;ve mice further validated the assay's robustness, showing a clear correlation between NAb levels and injected AAV viral loads. Taken together, this rapid, highly sensitive, and reliable assay enabled by NanoLuc&#174; AAV reporter technology precisely measures NAbs against AAVs in both human and animal serum. Further validation of the assay is required for future use in a clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Antibody,Assay development,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Morten Seirup<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kirsten Wingate<sup><\/sup>, Jeff Nelson<sup><\/sup>, Kara Machleidt<sup><\/sup>, Vanessa Ott<sup><\/sup>, Trish Hoang<sup><\/sup>, Marjeta Urh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Promega Corporation, Madison, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d6dc6723-24de-42c5-b012-3c8c9f83064e","ControlNumber":"7931","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Gastrin stimulates growth of pancreatic cancer by an autocrine mechanism and RNAi techniques that decrease gastrin expression have been shown to inhibit growth of this malignancy in vitro. Locked nucleic acid (LNA) Gapmers are antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that have long half-life and stability in vivo, hence represent a potential method to deliver RNAi for cancer therapeutics. We developed an LNA Gapmer that selectively downregulates gastrin expression in pancreatic cancer cells in culture. The goal of this project was to test this anti-gastrin Gapmer in vivo as a novel therapy for pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: The anti-gastrin LNA Gapmer was modified using thiol-click chemistry to conjugate a peptide to the 5&#8217; end and render the Gapmer target-specific with the ability to bind selectively to the cholecystokinin-B receptor that is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer. Forty athymic nude mice with established AsPC-1 human pancreatic orthotopic tumors were divided into four groups of equal tumor size. Mice (N=10 per group) were treated with PBS (controls), an untargeted LNA-Gapmer, the CCK-BR targeted Gapmer (60nM), and the CCK-BR targeted Gapmer (120nM) intraperitoneally twice a week for 4 weeks. Growth was monitored by luciferase IVIS imaging. At necropsy, tumors were excised, and metastases counted.<br \/>Results: Mean tumor mass was 43% smaller in mice treated with the targeted Gapmer-120nM (P=0.0007). Untargeted and targeted Gapmer 60nM slightly decreased tumor mass but this difference was not significant. Compared to PBS control-treated mice, metastases were significantly less in mice treated with the untargeted Gapmer by -39% (p=0.01); in the targeted Gapmer-60nM by -44% (p=0.003), and with the targeted Gapmer-120nM by -72% (p&#60;0.0001). Gastrin mRNA analysis of the tumors by qRT-PCR confirmed downregulation of gastrin.<br \/>Conclusion: Novel LNA Gapmers that downregulate gastrin mRNA expression decrease growth and metastases of pancreatic cancer in a dose-related fashion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Metastasis,Receptors,RNAi,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Our study showed that QTOLIMOD, a 26nt CpG-ODN delivered via QTsome<sup>TM<\/sup> lipid nanoparticle, significantly inhibited tumor growth in MC38-bearing mice (TGI%=99.06%, p&#60;0.001). Here, we report QTOLIMOD's potential for complete tumor rejection, prevention of recurrence, and advantages in safety and immune-cell induction.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b> C57BL\/6 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> MC38 cells. To assess drug tissue distribution, Cy5-labeled naked CpG-ODN or QTOLIMOD were intratumorally injected and in vivo imaging was conducted. ELISA was utilized to determine the levels of cytokines in serum and tumor samples. Once the tumor volume reached an average size of 80-100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were grouped and intratumorally injected with saline, vehicle, or QTOLIMOD. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: length &#215; width<sup>2<\/sup> &#215; 1\/2.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Following intratumoral injection of QTOLIMOD or naked CpG-ODN, free CpG-ODN were significantly reduced within 24 hours, while QTOLIMOD exhibited extended duration of action up to 7 days. Anatomical examination revealed that a dose of 5 mg\/kg naked CpG-ODN caused liver and spleen enlargement in mice, whereas QTOLIMOD at the same dose did not cause the adverse events. Immunohistochemical assay indicated a significant increase in the infiltration of macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD8+ T cells at the tumor site after dosing. IL-10, IFN-&#947;, and IL-12 were significantly upregulated in the tumor samples, but not in the serum. In a dose escalation experiment, tumor suppression were observed with intratumoral injection of 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mg\/kg (every 3 days, 5 doses), resulting in tumor growth inhibition rates ranging from 92.5% to 98.8%. In the QTOLIMOD treated groups, complete tumor rejection was achieved in 4 out of 6 animals in the 0.5 mg\/kg group and in all animals in the 1-2 mg\/kg groups within 56 days. To investigate the effect of QTOLIMOD on tumor recurrence, cured mice were re-inoculated with MC38 tumor cells at a distant site. All cured mice rejected newly inoculated tumors without additional injection, resulting in 100% survival for up to 60 days. In a dosing frequency experiment, mice were administered with QTOLIMOD at 1 mg\/kg once every 3, 5, 7, or 14 days for a total of 5 doses. The results suggested that fortnightly dosing of QTOLIMOD is more effective than more frequent dosing.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> QTOLIMOD exhibits a high intratumoral retention rate, resulting in increased safety, while effectively promoting the expansion and infiltration of immune cells associated with tumors. Moreover, QTOLIMOD demonstrates potent efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth, potentially leading to complete eradication. Furthermore, treatment with QTOLIMOD effectively prevents tumor from recurrence, offering promising long-term effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Anticancer therapy,Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

WGI-0301 is a proprietary lipid nanoparticle formulation (QTsomeTM) of Archexin designed to enhance delivery. A phase I clinical study of WGI-0301 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing in the U.S. Given the limited efficacy of TKIs compared to immunotherapy and growing incidence resistance, WGI-0301 combined with TKIs may augment the therapeutic response to TKIs by enhancing angiogenic blockade, inhibiting AKT-1, and overcome resistance. Methods: The anti-tumor effect of combining WGI-0301 with Lenvatinib\/Sorafenib\/Cabozantinib was assessed using a Hep3B-Luciferase orthotopic mouse tumor model. We divided sixty-four female Balb\/c nude mice into groups (8 mice per group), including vehicle control, WGI-0301 (8 mg\/kg), Lenvatinib (10 mg\/kg), Sorafenib (20 mg\/kg), Cabozantinib (20 mg\/kg), WGI-0301+Lenvatinib (8+10 mg\/kg), WGI-0301+Sorafenib (8+20 mg\/kg), and WGI-0301+Cabozantinib (8+20 mg\/kg). We administered treatments via tail vein injection (vehicle\/WGI-0301, QW4 weeks) or oral administration (Lenvatinib\/Sorafenib\/Cabozantinib, QD28 days). We monitored body weight twice weekly and measured tumor burden using bioluminescence with an IVIS (Lumina III) imaging system twice weekly as well. Treatment was suspended between Day 29 and Day 70 for survival observation.<br \/>Results: The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rates of the combination of WGI-0301 with Lenvatinib\/Sorafenib\/Cabozantinib were 66.05%, 86.81%, and 75.89%, respectively. These values were higher than those of the Lenvatinib\/Sorafenib\/Cabozantinib single drug group with TGI rate of 50.84%, 55.68%, and 47.84%. The tumor bioluminescence signal intensities of the two drugs combination (56.74*108, 22.28*108, and 40.40*108 photon\/s) were slightly lower than that of the Lenvatinib\/Sorafenib\/Cabozantinib single drug group (81.97*108, 73.95*108, and 86.96*108 photon\/s). The median survival time was 35.0, 46.0, 55.5, and 51.5 days in the vehicle, WGI-0301+Lenvatinib, WGI-0301+Sorafenib and WGI-0301+Cabozantinib, respectively. The median survival time of Sorafenib, the two-drug combinations were 55.5, 55.5, 58.0, and 53.5 days, which was significantly prolonged compared to the vehicle in the mice bearing the Hep3B-luc orthotopic tumor model. No severe adverse effects were observed in the drug combination groups.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of WGI-0301 with TKIs demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy over TKI monotherapy in the absence of substantial increase in toxicity.

However, they still show little efficacy for many solid tumors, because of their immune suppressive microenvironment. BC-PIV is a replication-deficient viral vector derived from human parainfluenza virus type 2, that can convey two ectopic genes simuoltaneously and uniquely display ectopic proteins with intact steric structure on the surface of viral particles. Furthermore, BC-PIV itself can induce maturation of dendritic cells with efficient induction of CD80\/86. These unique characteristics of BC-PIV make it an attractive tool for improving anti-tumor responses under immunesuppressive milieu of solid tumors.<br \/>Aim and Methods: To develop novel immunotherapy using BC-PIV, we have introduced various immunomodulatory molecules into BC-PIV and tested their anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. To activate CD4\/8 positive T cells, we introduced genes for OX-40L, 4-1BBL, GITRL, CD30L, OX40L\/4-1BBL, OX40L\/GITRL, or 4-1BBL\/GITRL (collectively, TNFRSF ligands) to BC-PIV. All gene products were effectively presented on BC-PIV envelope. For expansion of T, B, and NK cells, or for promoting migration of immune cells, genes for IL-7, CCL19, IL-7\/CCL19, IL-7\/CCL21, or IL-12 (P40\/P35) were introduced. CT-26 murine colon cancer cells (5X10<sup>5<\/sup>) were implanted into syngeneic Balb\/c mice at one or both side(s) of their ventral wall. Approximately 10<sup>7 <\/sup>viral particles derived from BC-PIV carrying immunomodulatory molecules were directly injected into tumors that had grown to 5-7mm in diameter, and the anti-tumor efficacy was assessed by monitoring the tumor size.<br \/>Results: In the mice treated with BC-PIV carrying TNFRSF ligands, tumor regression was observed at the virus administered site, but also at the non-treated, distant site, possibly due to the Abscopal effect. Moreover, these mice maintained efficient anti-tumor responses and rejected tumors when they were re-challenged with CT-26 cells at 8 months after the initial BC-PIV treatment, showing that BC-PIV\/ TNFRSF ligands induced sustained anti-tumor immunity. In the BC-PIV\/IL-7\/CCL19-treated mice, the tumors began to shrink about six days after the single injection of the virus. This effect was even more enhanced by concurrent administration of anti-PD-1 antibody.<br \/>Conclusions: BC-PIV carrying TNFRSF ligands, cytokines or chemokines induced efficient, sustained anti-tumor immunity and eradicated tumors in <i>in vivo<\/i> solid tumor model.

Personalized mRNA vaccines containing patient-derived tumor mutations are now entering the clinic and have shown promise. Delivery of mRNA-encoded therapeutic proteins (e.g., antibodies) is also under development. mRNA drug substance is typically generated by in vitro transcription (IVT). One byproduct and contaminant of IVT is the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is highly immunogenic, can induce inflammation and cell death, and inhibit protein translation, including the protein encoded by the therapeutic mRNA. As such, dsRNA must be measured for all IVT products to ensure safety and efficacy. However, existing dot bot and ELISA technology to detect dsRNA is neither sensitive nor quantitative. Herein, we describe the development of novel assays for sensitive and specific quantitation of dsRNA in IVT products and following encapsulation of IVT products in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). First, NanoBiT&#174; split luciferase technology was applied to detect dsRNA in IVT products. dsRNA binding domains were genetically attached to either SmBiT or LgBiT. In the presence of dsRNA, the SmBiT and LgBiT constructs bind via the dsRNA binding domains, resulting in dimerization and the complementation of functional NanoBiT&#174; luciferase. NanoBiT&#174; then generates light which is proportional to the amount of dsRNA in the sample. The assay detects dsRNA greater than or equal to 30 base pairs and is independent of the size and sequence of the dsRNA contaminant. The assay does not cross-react with single-stranded RNA or DNA and is highly sensitive, with a limit of detection less than 100 pg\/ml. As a complementary tool to the biochemical assay, we developed a cell-based bioassay to detect dsRNA encapsulated in LNPs. dsRNA\/LNPs are taken up by endocytosis where Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) detects dsRNA. Activation of TLR3 initiates a signaling pathway that is detected by a TLR3 pathway-specific promoter driving luciferase expression. This pathway likely represents the most physiologically-relevant readout of dsRNA bioactivity. Both assays are developed in &#8220;add-mix-read&#8221; format with no wash steps or media transfer, and exhibit robust, sensitive, and repeatable performance for specific detection of dsRNA in mixed solutions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mRNA,Vaccines,Assay development,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

We tested five murine FANA in 2 murine tumor models (TC1, MC38) and studied 19 human FANA FOXP3 in vitro with human healthy donor PBMC, followed by use of clinical samples from lung cancer patients and patients with mesothelioma, as well as testing in humanized mice (hu-PBMC-NSG). In murine studies, we treated mice on day 7 after tumor inoculation with Scramble control or murine FANA FOXP3, 50 mg\/kg for 14 days, i.p. In the TC1 lung tumor model, we found an average 38% decrease of tumor volumes, p = 0.0007, and 22% of tumors were completely resorbed. In the MC38 colon carcinoma model, we found a 49% decrease of tumor volumes, p = 0.0182, and 13.6% of tumors were completely resorbed. In both tumor models, we observed an ~50% decrease of Foxp3 mRNA by qPCR, and decreased numbers of intratumoral Tregs by flow cytometry. This was accompanied by significant decreases (p&#60;0.05) of the mRNA and protein intratumoral levels of multiple exhaustion markers: LAG-3, CTLA-4, PD-1, Tim-3, Tigit, CD244, CD160 and VISTA, and increased expression of perforin and granzyme-b by intratumoral T cells. In addition, there were no changes in FOXP3 mRNA expression or in the numbers of Tregs in draining lymph nodes and in spleens of tumor bearing mice, suggesting that intratumoral Treg have enhanced sensitivity to FANA FOXP3 in vivo. We identified the best 5 of 19 human FANA FOXP3 and showed these had no toxic effects on cell viability or division, and downregulated FOXP3 expression over 50% in PBMC from healthy donors (p&#60;0.05). Human Treg, pre-incubated with FANA FOXP3 for 3 hours, retained only 60.3% of their suppressive function in vitro. FANA FOXP3 treatment of lung cancer tumor samples and mesothelioma pleural effusion samples resulted in a 56.4% decrease in FOXP3 mRNA expression and a 61.5% decrease in Treg numbers (all p&#60;0.05). Moreover, tumor FOXP3+ Treg had 36.7% less FOXP3 protein per cell, and downregulated CD39 expression compared to Scramble control. Targeting of cancer samples with human FANA FOXP3 in vitro was associated with increased division of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and with downregulation of multiple exhaustion molecules, including CTLA-4, Tim-3, PD-1, LAG-3 and TIGIT. Humanized mice, treated with two human FANA FOXP3 compounds (50 mg\/kg, 7days), demonstrated an absence of apparent toxic effects and human FOXP3 mRNA was downregulated by 47.4% in the blood, by 74.2% in lymph nodes and by 51.8% in the spleens (all p&#60;0.05). Hence, targeting of intratumoral Tregs using FANA FOXP3 results in enhanced immune responses to solid tumors without inducing autoimmunity, and studies are underway in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and\/or CAR-T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Immunotherapy,Immunomodulation,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

Currently, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) using small-molecule binders represent the TPD field, and PROTAC-induced proximity between target proteins and E3 ligases enables specific degradation of target proteins. However, substantial amounts of clinically relevant cancer targets such as transcription factors lack active sites or allosteric binding pockets for small molecules which challenges the development of classical PROTACs for these targets. SOX2 is one of the pluripotency transcription factors and has been well-known for its crucial role in tumor development through promoting cancer cell survival, metastasis, stemness, and drug resistance. Numerous studies have also reported SOX2 amplification and overexpression in various tumor tissues. Thus, SOX2 has been validated as an attractive anticancer target, but directly targeting SOX2 has been proved to be difficult since SOX2 is an &#8220;undruggable&#8221; transcription factor. EPD Biotherapeutics develops EPDeg<sup>TM<\/sup>, a next-generation engineered protein degrader platform in order to overcome the limitations of small molecule-based PROTAC. Here we report a series of SOX2-targeting bioPROTACs, being composed of a nanobody against SOX2 with high affinity and several ubiquitin E3 ligases with deletion of natural substrate binding domain to allow highly selective degradation of SOX2 protein. To evaluate the in vitro efficacy, SOX2 bioPROTACs were generated by mRNA IVT with CleanCap <sup>&#174;<\/sup> and modified uridine. First, robust degradation of SOX2 with a half-maximal degradation concentration (DC<sub>50<\/sub>) of the picomolar range was observed with the treatment of SOX2 bioPROTACs in multiple SOX2-overexpressing cancer cell lines. The degradation was ubiquitin- and proteosome-dependent manner, and neither nanobody nor ubiquitin E3 ligase alone affected SOX2 protein level. Then, SOX2 bioPROTACs led to significant cancer cell growth inhibition caused by apoptotic cell death with a half-maximal growth inhibition concentration (GI<sub>50<\/sub>) of the picomolar range. Notably, chemo-resistant cancer cell lines expressing SOX2 protein in high levels were sensitized to chemotherapy in combination with our SOX2 bioPROTACs. Furthermore, i.v. injection of one of our lead candidates formulated with LNP significantly inhibited tumor growth in the A549 xenograft model, proving the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of SOX2 degraders for the first time in the world. Taken together, EPD&#8217;s SOX2 bioPROTACs show potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy as first-in-class SOX2 degraders and provide new insights for the therapeutic potential of transcription factor-degrading strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-02 Gene therapy and radiation studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,SOX2,bioPROTAC,TPD (Targeted Protein Degradation),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Thus, there is a critical need to advance our understanding of melanoma immune evasion mechanisms and identify novel targets capable of enhancing ICB responses. MZB1 (Marginal Zone B and B1 Cell Specific Protein), an immune regulator gene, is differentially expressed in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma or normal skin. In a limited number of cancers, MZB1 has been shown to function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. However, its role and significance in melanoma is not known. In this study, we determined the functional significance and immunoregulatory mechanisms of MZB1 in human melanoma cell lines using MZB1 overexpression (OE) (in SK-MEL-2, and SK-MEL-28) and CRISPR knockout (KO) (in A375 and Hs294T) lines. MZB1 OE significantly increased melanoma cell proliferation and expression of the proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA, while MZB1 KO yielded the opposite effect. To identify immunoregulatory mechanisms associated with MZB1, we performed differential gene expression analysis of 770 immune-related genes using NanoString nCounter technology. nSolver analysis identified 153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as a result of MZB1 knockout in Hs294T cells (adjusted p &#60;0.05, 1.5-fold change cutoff). MZB1 KO strongly reduced the expression of the HLA class-II family genes and altered the expression of various cytokines, suggesting an immunoregulatory role of MZB1. Further, MZB1 KO significantly downregulated genes related to cancer progression and metastasis promotion. Additionally, MZB1 KO reduced expression of common &#8220;cancer stem cell&#8221; genes, such as RXRG, ALDH1A1, AQP1, NFATC2, LPAR1, indicating MZB1 expression in melanoma may promote a dedifferentiated or neural crest-like state. In addition, an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the DEGs revealed many cancer-related functions altered upon MZB1 KO (p adjusted &#60; 0.05) and displayed a negative enrichment for cancer-promoting pathways including tumor growth, metastasis, and proliferation. IPA regulatory analysis predicted MZB1 KO to decrease the activation of oncogenic signaling components including PI3K, MEK, and ERK1\/2. Further, IPA predicted that MZB1 inhibition could positively sensitize melanoma cells towards higher immune responses by activating mechanisms associated with T cell proliferation and activation, leukocyte migration, and macrophage activation. Overall, our study suggests MZB1 promotes oncogenic signaling in melanoma to drive proliferation and dedifferentiation, as well as regulates a wide range of immune-related genes that may be responsible for immune evasion in melanoma cells. Thus, MZB1 merits further investigation to determine if the immune consequences yielded by targeting MZB1 can complement ICB approaches in the management of melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Oncogene,Immunomodulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.
