[{"Abstract":"Agonist antibodies targeting CD28 have proven to be effective against cancer, but also faced challenges due to severe adverse events triggered by its activation. Human (hCD28) and mouse CD28 (mCD28) have different signaling responses, with CD28 ligands and superagonists inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation in absence of TCR ligation in humans, but not in mice. Expression of CD28i amplifier isoform, which is thought to enhanced the production of cytokines in humans, could partially explain this difference, as it is not expressed in mice. In addition, evidence suggests that the different signaling between hCD28 and mCD28 relies on one amino acid change in the intracellular domain (ICD)[1]. Herein, we describe a CD28 humanized mouse model for assessment of CD28-targeting agents. To improve translatability, we decided to keep the expression of both canonical and CD28i human isoforms to avoid undermining the biological effects of the testing agents. Although keeping the human ICD could favor the evaluation of cytokine production and therefore the safety of the test agents, we decided to keep the mouse ICD to enable a proper interaction of CD28 with its signaling partners, allowing a physiological stimulation of CD28 in efficacy studies. The hCD28 model expresses a chimeric protein, with the whole human extracellular domain, and mouse intracellular domain. Human CD28 is expressed at physiological levels on T cells, and these cells can be activated and proliferate in response to hCD28 ligands and agonist antibodies. Tumor growth inhibition and complete tumor regressions are achieved in a MC38-TAA colorectal cancer model following prophylactic treatment with CD28-TAA bispecific antibody in combination with anti-PD-1. Extension of this study and re-challenged of the tumor-free surviving animals shows that re-challenged hCD28 mice have enhanced survival compared to na&#239;ve hCD28 mice inoculated with MC38-TAA, suggesting tumor immunological memory. Furthermore, TGN1412 administration in CD28 mice induces cytokine release, and a slightly body weight loss, but no major change in body temperature. Although the model does not fully reproduce the ability of human CD28 to produce cytokines upon activation due to the mouse ICD, the expression of the amplifier isoform CD28i might contribute to the response to TGN1412. Altogether, data suggest that hCD28 model enables assessment of efficacy and safety of CD28-targeting agents. The hCD28 model was intercrossed with CD3 humanized models to enable assessment of combination therapies and bispecific antibodies targeting both CD3 and CD28.<br \/>[1] Porciello N, Grazioli P, Campese AF, et al.

By combining two distinct mechanisms of action into a single molecule, NI-3201 overcomes two major immune suppression mechanisms commonly observed in a variety of solid tumors, namely: [1] suppression of T cell response (induced by PD-L1+ cells engaging PD-1 on T cells) and [2] restricted\/limited T cell activation (due to the lack of costimulatory signal associated to the scarcity of CD28 ligands in the TME). Importantly, NI-3201 was designed to require primary T cell stimulation (&#8220;signal 1&#8221;) to afford its activity: in the absence of TCR engagement, NI-3201 is unable to activate T cells, thus preventing unintended systemic inflammation.<br \/>The single agent pharmacological activity of NI-3201 was assessed <i>in vitro<\/i> through a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) recall assay in which CMV+ PBMCs were cocultured with PD-L1+ cancer cell lines ectopically loaded with CMV-specific MHC-I peptides, thus providing &#8220;signal 1&#8221;. NI-3201 induced the activation and proliferation of CMV-specific T cells which resulted in killing of the target tumor cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the single agent activity of NI-3201 was shown in immunocompetent huCD28-transgenic mice engrafted with huPD-L1-expressing murine colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells, a model in which NI-3201 induced durable anti-tumor immunological memory response. In humanized mouse models where T cell engagers (TCEs) were ineffective, NI-3201 was able to synergize with TCEs to control tumor growth, even inducing tumor regression in one model. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability of NI-3201 were investigated in non-human primates (NHP) after single and repeated-dosing. NI-3201 demonstrated favorable PK with close to dose-proportional concentrations being achieved. Upon repeated NI-3201 administration, no hypercytokinemia was observed; only a mild and transient IL-6 release and associated increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen, with no clinical signs reported. The favorable profile seen in NHP was supported by data generated <i>in vitro<\/i> further de-risking the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) potential. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modelling integrating both<i> in vitro<\/i> and NHP data predicted a drug concentration required for optimal NI-3201 activity in the TME, and preliminary data suggests optimal patient activity at Q2W-Q3W dosing schedule.<br \/>The anti-tumor activity as a single agent or as universal combination partner for TCEs, shown <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, together with the favorable safety profile of NI-3201, support its clinical development planned to start in Q1 2025.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,CD28,PD-L1,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Here, we investigated pH-selective CD28xVISTA bsAbs to act selectively within the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). Our CD28xVISTA bsAbs are designed for tripartite &#8220;<i>trans<\/i>-activation&#8221; of CD28 in the TME, aiming for enhanced T-cell-mediated cancer cell killing while minimizing systemic T-cell activation and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) risk.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> We evaluated various CD28xVISTA bsAbs, focusing on a prototype 1+2 format with monovalent CD28 binding, bivalent VISTA binding and Fc receptor interaction null mutations (BS2). BS2 was tested for T-cell <i>trans<\/i>-activation using Jurkat-IL-2-luciferase reporter cells in the presence of HEK293 cells expressing membrane bound OKT3-scFv and CHO cells expressing human VISTA. BS2&#8217;s potency was further evaluated in an xCelligence-based human T-cell killing assay that dynamically monitors growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells co-cultured with VISTA<sup>+<\/sup> Kasumi-3 cells, alone or in combination with a CD3xPSMA bispecific T-cell engager. T-cell activation and proliferation were also measured using flow cytometry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 markers. Additionally, we modified BS2 to introduce pH-selective VISTA binding, limiting its activity to the TME, and tested this version in a syngeneic mouse model in combination with anti-murine PD-1 (anti-mPD-1). Finally, cytokine release from human PBMCs, co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and treated with the pH-selective BS2 (or TGN1412 as a positive control), was measured using a bead-based multiplex immune assay.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our data show that the combination of anti-mPD-1 and our prototype CD28xVISTA bsAb (BS2) with pH-selective VISTA binding significantly inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i>, CD28xVISTA co-stimulation in <i>trans<\/i> by BS2 potentiated the activity of a CD3xPSMA bispecific T-cell engager in our human T-cell killing assay.

This approach, which bypasses the need for tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) required by other CD28xTAA bispecifics in development, suggests a potentially safer alternative for T-cell engagement and stimulation. Moreover, our novel myeloid-directed TME-selective co-stimulation strategy with a CD28xVISTA bsAb may broaden the potential for T-cell engagement approaches in solid tumors by enabling rational combinations with existing CD3xTAA T-cell engagers without competing for the same target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Tumor microenvironment,Costimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

To determine potential markers for success, we performed a follow-up study of a HER2-pulsed dendritic cell cancer vaccine Phase I trial performed in advanced HER2+ cancer patients. Surprisingly, we found that all treated patients were alive at over 18 years post-treatment. These patients still possessed significant HER2-specific memory T cell responses, typified by CD27 expression. The expansion of HER2-specific CD27+ memory T cells was also observed in patients from a separate clinical trial, who received a HER2-expressing viral vaccine. To validate these clinical responses, we vaccinated human CD27 transgenic mice with a HER2 viral vector again observing HER2-specific CD27+ memory T cells, suggesting the significance of this axis in eliciting and maintaining effective vaccine-specific memory T cell responses. We hypothesized that CD27 expression was not just a marker of memory T cells, but represented a critical activation pathway during memory formation. To determine the potential impact of CD27 agonism in vaccination, we combined HER2 vaccination with an anti-CD27 agonist antibody (Varlilumab). The combination treatment elicited a robust increase in HER2-specific CD4+ memory T cell responses that was maintained for at least 300 days post-vaccination. Using therapeutic HER2 vaccination in combination with anti-CD27 of HER2+ tumor bearing mice, we show significantly increased anti-tumor efficacy and further enhancement in combination with PD1 inhibition. The anti-tumor response was triggered by anti-CD27 antibody during the vaccine priming phase, which enhanced HER2-specific CD4+ T cells. Critically, we found that HER2 specific CD4+ T cell responses allowed for anti-tumor responses that persisted after CD8+ T cell depletion, indicating a direct role for antigen-specific CD4+ T cells independent of CD8+ T cells. Collectively, our results support a central role for antigen-specific CD27+ CD4+ T cells in cancer vaccination. These data support the addition of CD27 agonism to improve the therapeutic index of cancer vaccines and potentially enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade in refractory cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,CD4 T cells,CD27,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.-J.

MICA\/B serve as activating signals on target cells for recognition by the NKG2D receptor, which is expressed on NK cells and a subset of T cell populations. MICA\/B expression is induced in response to stressed conditions, thereby enabling NKG2D-mediated elimination of target cells. On NK cells, NKG2D is one of many receptors in the complex network of activating and inhibitory receptors, whereby NKG2D pathway activation results in cytokine production, enhancement of ADCC and target cell death. On CD8 T cells, the NKG2D axis plays a costimulatory role in lowering the threshold for lysis upon TCR engagement, and may also drive direct CD8-mediated killing following prior TCR activation. MICA\/B is expressed broadly on a range of solid and hematological malignancies. However, tumor cells evade NKG2D-mediated elimination by shedding MICA\/B ligand from the cell surface via proteases present in the tumor microenvironment (TME). CLN-619 functions by binding to MICA\/B and preventing shedding, thereby increasing MICA\/B cell surface expression to restore the NKG2D-MICA\/B axis to promote tumor cell killing by NK cells and T cells. Additionally, CLN-619 can mediate ADCC and ADCP by NK cells and macrophages. In preclinical xenograft models, doses as low as 0.03 mg\/kg inhibited tumor outgrowth. We investigated the effects of CLN-619 on a variety of primary immune cells including NK cells, T cells and macrophages. In the evaluation of NK cells, we measured CLN-619 modulation of cytokine production and cytotoxicity in the presence of MICA\/B expressing target cells. In addition, we demonstrated the contribution of Fc-mediated functions of CLN-619. In the context of T cells, we explored the requirement of TCR co-stimulation or prior antigen exposure in the activation of the NKG2D pathway by CLN-619. In the context of macrophages, we measured the ability of CLN-619 to mediate ADCP against MICA\/B-expressing target cells. These data highlight the potential of CLN-619 to engage multiple immune cell types within the TME, which may lead to greater and broader efficacy compared to IO therapies targeting a single immune cell type.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monoclonal antibodies,Immune cells,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Primarily expressed on activated CD8+ T cells, it plays a crucial role in immune activation. Moreover, the intracellular domain of 4-1BB is leveraged to enhance the proliferation and cytotoxicity of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T (CAR-T) cells. However, the development of 4-1BB agonist antibodies has encountered challenges, with limited clinical efficacy (e.g., utomilumab) or dose-dependent liver toxicity (e.g., urelumab). Consequently, there is a significant demand for the development of next-generation 4-1BB agonist antibodies, leading to numerous ongoing preclinical R&#38;D efforts and clinical trials. Here, we introduce a novel fully humanized anti-4-1BB antibody, HLX25, and discuss the development of HLX34, a bispecific antibody targeting both 4-1BB and Her2. HLX25 boasts a unique binding epitope distinct from first-generation 4-1BB antibodies and demonstrates multiple cross-species reactivities. Additionally, HLX25 incorporates an engineered Fc region to enhance intratumoral clustering while reducing toxicity. In vitro studies reveal that HLX25 exhibits activity similar to natural 4-1BB ligands. In contrast, utolimumab shows inadequate activity, and urelumab displays superior activity, suggesting a correlation between efficacy and safety. As reported previously, (As been profiled in our Lab,) HLX25 exhibits robust dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in the MC38\/h4-1BB KI mouse model. Noteworthy is the superior safety profile of HLX25 in the h4-1BB KI model, where both HLX25 and utolimumab induce no significant AST and ALT upregulation, unlike urelumab, which demonstrates such upregulation in vivo. A comparative analysis of HLX25 with other second-generation anti-4-1BB antibodies in clinical trials in vivo reveals that HLX25 provides superior tumor inhibition without observed toxicity within the effective dose range. Furthermore, we've developed HLX34, a Her2x4-1BB bispecific antibody, derived from Trastuzumab and HLX25. Its format underwent optimization using a reporter assay, indicating superior in vitro activity. Validation through a cytokine release assay with primary PBMCs in vitro and confirmed in vivo activity in animal models, without observed toxicity, strongly supports the efficacy and safety of HLX34 in Her2-positive tumors. These results provide evidence that our novel anti-4-1BB antibody activates proper 4-1BB signaling through tumor-enriched FcgRIIB or tumor-associated antigen-mediated clustering, inhibiting tumor growth with good safety in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This underscores HLX34 as a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for next-generation cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Antibody engineering,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jen-Kuan Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jie Xue<sup><\/sup>, Chen Dong<sup><\/sup>, An Ju<sup><\/sup>, Toya Baral<sup><\/sup>, Julie Yoo<sup><\/sup>, Yanling Wang<sup><\/sup>, Marco Muda<sup><\/sup>, Qiang Liu<sup><\/sup>, Wenfeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Weidong Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Lixin Feng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Henlius USA, Milpitas, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"00ed00ab-a2f0-4401-81cf-22fa3508f5fb","ControlNumber":"5431","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

We have demonstrated that small, chemically synthetic bicyclic peptides can drive tumor-localized agonism of CD137 and anti-tumor immunity in mouse models. Here, we report the next stage of our work - delving into the mechanism of action of these novel agents and extending our program to serve patients whose tumors express EphA2. Experimental Procedures: MultiOmyx&#8482; hyperplexed immunofluorescence assay was used to evaluate the expression of CD137 and EphA2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples. Human PBMC\/tumor cell co-culture assays were used to assess CD137 <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA&#8482; in vitro bioactivity and syngeneic mouse tumor models were used to evaluate CD137 <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA anti-tumor activity as mono- or combination therapies. Pharmacodynamic activity was evaluated by transcriptional profiling using NanoString assays or single cell RNA sequencing.<br \/>Summary of the Data: Studies utilizing a syngeneic mouse model and deep RNA sequencing of tumors from CD137 <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA-treated mice implicated intratumoral dendritic cells in addition to T cells as early responders to localized CD137 agonism and potential contributors to the anti-tumor response. Furthermore, a mouse efficacy model demonstrated synergy with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Multiplex imaging revealed that EphA2 and CD137 are co-expressed in human tumors of high unmet medical need and therefore, using our highly modular <i>Bicycle<\/i> platform, we discovered BT7455, a <i>Bicycle<\/i> TICA that engages EphA2 and CD137 with high affinity, resulting in potent EphA2-dependent activity in vitro and robust anti-tumor activity in vivo with intermittent dosing in mouse models. Gene expression profiling of tumors revealed that BT7455 led to increased production of cytokines and chemokines known to drive T cell infiltration, the extent of which differentiated it from both a checkpoint inhibitor and an anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody agonist. BT7455 was well tolerated in preclinical species and liver function tests indicated no evidence of hepatic toxicity.<br \/>Statement of Conclusions: In summary, we have identified EphA2 as a promising target to pair with a CD137 agonist.

Clustering-mediated CD137 signaling enhances immune cell survival, proliferation, cytokine production and memory formation. CD40 (previously TNFRSF5) is a related superfamily member expressed primarily on B cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which upon clustering is also a key modulator of T cell responses. Mesothelin (MSLN) is highly upregulated on tumor cells in ovarian and pancreatic cancer and select other solid tumour histologies. To avoid systemic toxicity, CB699 is designed to be immunologically active in the presence of any two of its three binding targets, thus enhancing both immune-immune and tumour-immune crosstalk. We present here the preclinical pharmacology of CB699.<br \/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Binding of CB699 to CD40, CD137 or MSLN was measured by surface plasmon resonance and by flow cytometry. CD137 and\/or CD40 agonism, immune cell activation and cytokine secretion were evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> using reporter gene assays and primary cell coculture assays in the presence\/absence of MSLN-expressing tumor cells. The ability of CB699 to enhance tumor cell killing was characterized in 3D spheroid cocultures. CB699 toxicology and toxicokinetics was assessed in a dose range-finding study in cynomolgus macaques. CB699 was also assessed <i>in vivo<\/i> with a human CD34+ cell engrafted mouse model.<br \/>RESULTS: CB699 binds to primary and immortalized cells that express CD40, CD137 or MSLN, with low nanomolar affinity. CB699 also binds to cells from primary disaggregated human solid tumors. CB699 induces CD137 reporter cell activity in cocultures containing cells expressing either CD40 or MSLN. Additionally, CB699 induces CD40 reporter cell activity in cocultures containing cells expressing either CD137 or MSLN. CB699 induces IL-2 secretion and upregulation of CD86 on B cells in primary cocultures containing healthy human PBMCs and MSLN expressing cancer cells. Enhanced tumor cell killing was observed in spheroid cultures containing CB699 and was coupled with immune cell expansion. CB699 showed significant pharmacology <i>in vivo<\/i> with immune cell engrafted mice. Finally, CB699 was well tolerated in a dose range finding non-human primate toxicology study.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: CB699 is a novel MSLN-binding CD137 and CD40 dual agonist that selectively enhances immune cell activity by enhancing both T cell and APC signaling axes. CB699 is positioned to enter clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Due to its inhibitory role in the immune response, TIGIT has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for various malignancies, with several clinical trials exploring the use of anti-TIGIT blocking antibodies with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies. Recent reports have indicated elevated expression of 4-1BB within intra-tumoral Tregs. Therefore, we hypothesized that a dual targeting approach involving both TIGIT and 4-1BB could effectively enhance intra-tumoral immunity.<br \/>ABL112, a First-in-Class bispecific antibody targeting TIGIT and 4-1BB, demonstrated the induction of T cell activation by blocking the TIGIT signaling and TIGIT dependent 4-1BB clustering. By having intact Fc, ABL112 bound to Fc&#947;RI and its crosslinking with 4-1BB also induced 4-1BB activation. ABL112 selectively depleted Treg cells but not other T cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, potentially through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.<br \/>ABL112 demonstrated superior efficacy in tumor regression compared to anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody across various mouse tumor models. Additionally, combining ABL112 with pembrolizumab significantly inhibited tumor growth better than combining anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody with pembrolizumab. According to immune cell depletion assay, ABL112-mediated tumor suppressive activity was predominantly driven by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, with a partial tumor reduction by CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell or NK cell depletion. Mice with complete remission (CR) were further protected from the tumor re-challenge after 3 months of cessation of ABL112 treatment, and the proportion of tumor-specific memory T cells in the blood increased, suggesting long-term immunological memory has been established. In conclusion, ABL112 exhibited potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity through multiple mode of action including TIGIT inhibition and 4-1BB activation. These results strongly suggest that ABL112 is an innovative and promising therapeutic option with the combination of anti-PD-(L)1 therapies for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,4-1BB,Immuno-oncology,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

LILRB4 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor Subfamily B Member 4), an emerging myeloid target, is specifically expressed in tumor-associated myeloid cells and suppresses the immune response, thus promoting cancer progression and metastasis. ABL407 is a First-in-Class bispecific antibody designed to simultaneously target LILRB4 and 4-1BB, enabling LILRB4 expression-dependent 4-1BB activation. By antagonizing LILRB4 signaling, ABL407 inhibited LILRB4 mediated immunosuppression, restoring T cell activity. In addition, ABL407 inhibited fibronectin, a potential LILRB4 ligand, -mediated suppression of myeloid cells. To evaluate the efficacy of ABL407, we established EL4 murine tumor model overexpressing LILRB4 (EL4\/LILRB4) in h4-1BB transgenic mice and hLILRB1\/4-h4-1BB triple transgenic mice. We observed LILRB4 was overexpressed in M-MDSC in the blood and liver-metastasized tumors. A significant decrease of M-MDSC population and tumor growth inhibition was observed in mice treated with anti-LILRB4 antibody and ABL407. ABL407 treatment resulted in a proportion increment of T cells. However, the percentage of Treg cells and M-MDSC in the liver and blood was reduced by ABL407 treatment in hLILRB1\/4-h4-1BB triple transgenic mice. Mice with complete remission (CR) were further protected from the rechallenge of previously exposed tumor after 3 months of cessation of ABL407 treatment, implicating that immunological memory might be generated. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ABL407, LILRB4x4-1BB bispecific antibody, may be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. It can be applied as a \"LILRB4 antagonist\" as well as a \"LILRB4-dependent 4-1BB agonist\" across a broad spectrum of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,LILRB4,Tumor-associated myeloid cells ,4-1BB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The immune agonism potency of M9657 was validated through <i>in vitro<\/i> assays and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in syngeneic tumor models using the surrogate antibody FS122m. Combining CD137 agonists and antiPD(L)-1 antibodies presents a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance and enhance antitumor activity via complementary mechanisms. Anti-PD-(L)-1 antibodies can reverse the suppressive immune signals, and CD137 agonists can boost T cell activation, improving antigen presentation and cytokine release.<br \/>Methods: The antitumor immunity of M9657 + pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) combination therapy was assessed using in-vitro luciferase and ex-vivo functional assays. In vivo antitumor efficacy was investigated with the M9657 surrogate (FS122m) and anti-mPD-1 in syngeneic tumor models expressing Mesothelin (MSLN).<br \/>Results: The combination of M9657 and pembrolizumab displayed dose-dependent immune agonism potency and significantly enhanced tumor cell cytotoxicity and CD8+ T cell cytokine release relative to single agent treatments. In various syngeneic tumor models, the combination of FS122m with antimPD1 significantly increased antitumor efficacy relative to monotherapies, with more mice achieving complete tumor regression and prolonged median survival. Tumor-cured mice after combination treatment exhibited resistance to the primary tumor rechallenge, indicating the generation of tumor antigen-specific antitumor immunity and long-term immune protectivity.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of M9657 with anti-PD-(L)1 could overcome primary ICI therapy resistance and improve the antitumor efficacy of current anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in the clinic.

Checkpoint immunotherapies targeting PD\/L1 or CTLA4 have shown efficacy in immunogenic cancers but remain ineffective in PDAC, highlighting a need for novel approaches. Abrogating protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), a phosphatase in the TCR signaling cascade, has been shown to modulate multiple mechanisms of immune resistance. Furthermore, 41BB costimulatory pathway has recently been investigated as a potential strategy to enhance immunotherapy against PDAC. Using immune-resistant murine models of PDAC, we investigated PTPN22 as an immunotherapeutic target in combination with 41BB co-stimulation and PD1 inhibition against PDAC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We employed a well-characterized murine PDAC cell line expressing mutant <i>Kras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup> and <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>R172H<\/sup><i> <\/i>under the <i>Pdx1<\/i>-cre promoter (KPCY 6419c5). This tumor line is resistant to combination immuno- and chemotherapies. To determine treatment efficacy, PTPN22 deficient mice (KO) were inoculated with KPCY6419c5 cells either subcutaneously or orthotopically into the pancreas. To extend the translatability of PTPN22 targeting, we also injected PTPN22 competent mice with the same tumor cells and treated them with our novel PTPN22 inhibitor L1. Harvested tumors were processed for FFPE and mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis to track changes in the immune compartment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>When PTPN22 was abrogated, treatment with anti-PD1 and 41BB agonism led to a 10-day delay in substantial tumor formation and roughly 75% reduction in tumor volume by 21-days post treatment.<b> <\/b>These tumors showed elevated levels of OX40 and OX40L primarily in the setting of PTPN22 KO\/PD1\/41BB therapy. In a subsequent in vivo experiment using an OX40L neutralizing antibody, we found that OX40 signaling is essential for the efficacy of PTPN22 KO\/PD1\/41BB therapy. Furthermore, combining OX40 agonist with anti-PD1 in PTPN22 KO sufficiently mimicked the efficacy seen with the anti-PD-1 and 41BB combination. CyTOF analysis indicated that OX40 expression is enriched in Tregs and OX40L is enriched in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Moreover, combination therapy efficacy was reproduced using the PTPN22 inhibitor L1.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> PTPN22 abrogation enhances the success of PD-1 inhibition given with either OX-40 or 41BB agonist therapies. In addition, PTPN22 abrogation together with PD1 inhibition and 41BB costimulation reduces MDSC and Treg suppression of effector T cells via the OX40L-OX40 axis. Finally, PTPN22 can be blocked by a small molecule inhibitor strengthening its candidacy as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Mouse models,Immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Due to the hepatotoxicity of current anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibodies, tumor-associated antigens (TAA) targeting to specifically activate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is expected to enhance its safety profile. CD24 is highly expressed in many cancers, such as ovarian and breast cancer and its high expression is often related to poor prognosis. The signaling pathway of CD24\/Siglec-10 triggers a &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal that facilitates immune escape of tumor cells. Therefore, IBD0333 was designed to target CD24 overexpressed tumor cells and activate CD8+ T cells to induce T cell mediated antitumor immunity in TME of the targeted tumor tissue. To further reduce the toxicity risk, the anti-4-1BB moiety is designed to activate the signaling pathway only when IBD0333 binds to the tumor cells that overexpress CD24.<br \/>Methods: For CD24 terminus, we applied virus like particle (VLP) as antigen for immunization to obtain functional CD24 antibodies. For 4-1BB terminus, competitive ELISA\/FACS analysis as well as amino acid point mutation binding ability analysis based on the receptor crystal structure were performed to characterize the binding epitope. The in vivo mice efficacy and toxicity study, as well as cynomolgus monkey toxicity study were also conducted to describe the anti-tumor activity and safety profile. For IBD0333, we verified binding affinity by FACS to cancer cells and the 4-1BB activity in reporter-gene assay. IL2 and INF-&#947; secretion assay were performed to evaluate the PBMC activation. C57BL\/6J-h4-1BB humanized mice bearing MC38-hCD24 colon cancer cells were used to validate the anti-tumor efficacy of IBD0333. Preclinical PK and toxicity study was also performed in cynomolgus monkeys to describe the safety profile of IBD0333.<br \/>Results: IBD0333 showed excellent binding and PBMC stimulation activities. In toxicology studies of IBD0333, no obvious abnormality in mice or cynomolgus monkeys administered with IBD0333 was observed. The MTD was estimated to be greater than 200 mg\/kg with no severe side effects observed in the study, showing that IBD0333 has great potential to achieve significantly improved safety profile. As to efficacy, IBD0333 showed excellent tumor inhibition activities in mice model with 99% tumor growth inhibition at 1 mg\/kg and 100% at 3 mg\/kg.<br \/>Conclusion: IBD0333 is a clinical stage, potential first-in-class, 4-1BB\/CD24 bsAb that simultaneously stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity to achieve strong synergistic effects with reduced hepatotoxicity. The IND approvals from the FDA and the NMPA have been obtained and the Phase I clinical trial of IBD0333 in locally advanced\/metastatic solid tumors or non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma is currently on-going.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,CD24,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"X.

A promising therapeutic modality that can elicit transient antitumor responses in a subset of metastatic PDAs is chemotherapy + CD40 agonist +\/- anti-PD-1. A deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms that mediate the initial responses will inform new strategies to enhance the durability of this therapy. Our prior studies demonstrated that tumor-specific CD4 T cells are critical for mitigating tumor growth in a syngeneic KPC orthotopic tumor model of PDA that expresses a model neoantigen, click beetle red luciferase (CBR). CD4 T cells direct tumor antigen recognition by tumor-associated macrophages and host interferon-gamma receptor (Ifngr1) signaling. Here, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells are required for the antitumor effects of anti-CD40 agonist indicating that this therapy fails to compensate for a lack of CD4 T cell help. We sought to test the hypothesis that host Ifngr1 signaling acts in a CD4 T cell intrinsic manner to promote antitumor responses. As such, we develop and validate a novel MHC class II tetramer (CBR54-62:I-Ab) to track the fate of endogenous CD4 T cells during tumor growth. We demonstrate that tumor-specific CD4 T cell abundance and Th1 polarization is decreased in orthotopic tumors, particularly between day 14 and day 21 post tumor implantation. Combination agonistic anti-CD40 + anti-PD-L1 maintained tumor-specific CD4 T cell numbers in the spleen and pancreas-draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice. Intriguingly, Th1 polarized tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells were decreased by aPD-L1, but were restored by anti-CD40, a finding further corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing. Further, agonistic anti-CD40 + anti-PD-L1 alone or in combination robustly decreased Treg polarized tumor-specific CD4 T cells. Using a mixed bone marrow chimeric approach, we show immunotherapy&#8217;s Treg-depletion effect is dependent on Ifngr1 on antigen-specific CD4 T cells. In contrast, Ifngr1 signaling on tumor-specific CD8 T cells appeared inconsequential to CD8 T cell fate following immunotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to interrogate tumor-specific CD4 T cells in PDA and uncover novel interplay between CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and myeloid cells that are critical for immunotherapy response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,CD40,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

ATOR-4066 induces a neoantigen specific T-cell response by simultaneous binding to CD40 on myeloid cells such as antigen presenting cells (APCs) and to CEACAM5 on tumor cells. CEACAM5 is a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed on several cancer indications such as colorectal and gastric cancer, as well as on tumor-derived material. ATOR-4066 treatment results in (1) CEACAM5-conditional CD40-mediated activation of APCs and (2) enhanced uptake of tumor-derived material, leading to cross-presentation of neoantigen and priming of neoantigen-specific T cells, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing. We have previously shown evidence of a potent anti-tumor effect of ATOR-4066 <i>in vivo<\/i>, superior to the effects observed with the corresponding CD40 mAb. Moreover, we have demonstrated CEACAM5-dependent activation of CD40-expressing cells<i> in vitro<\/i>, and an ability to mediate co-localization of CEACAM5-expressing tumor debris and CD40 expressing APCs. In addition, ATOR-4066 was shown to induce CEACAM5-conditional activation of tumor-infiltrating CD40-expressing immune cells in dissociated primary human tumor material from colorectal and gastric cancer patients. Here we present data further elucidating the mode of action of ATOR-4066 <i>in vivo<\/i>. Following ATOR-4066 treatment, tumors and lymph nodes were isolated from human CD40 transgenic mice bearing MC38 tumors expressing human CEACAM5. Flow cytometry analysis shows an increased number of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in mice treated with ATOR-4066 compared to treatments with CD40 mAb or vehicle. The study also reveals upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86 on DCs and macrophages after treatment with ATOR-4066 compared to groups treated with CD40 mAb or vehicle. The effect was localized to the tumor microenvironment and not observed in tumor draining lymph nodes, confirming previous <i>in vitro<\/i> results demonstrating CEACAM5-conditional immune activation. Moreover, RNA-sequencing of tumor samples displayed distinct transcriptomic alterations following ATOR-4066 treatment vs. CD40 mAb or vehicle treatment <i>in vivo<\/i>. In contrast, RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood in ATOR-4066 treated mice showed only small transcriptomic differences compared to the vehicle treated group, but distinct from mice treated with a CD40 mAb, further demonstrating the CEACAM5 dependent response of ATOR-4066. In summary, these preclinical data demonstrate that ATOR-4066 activates infiltrating myeloid cells resulting in increases in activated tumor infiltrating T cells, thus creating a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which strongly supports further development and clinical testing of ATOR-4066.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Preclinical,CD40,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hampus Andersson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ida UddbÃ¤ck<sup>1<\/sup>, Mona Celander<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Johansson<sup>1<\/sup>, Lill Ljung<sup>1<\/sup>, Anneli Nilsson<sup>1<\/sup>, Amulya Krishna Shetty<sup>1<\/sup>, David Gomez Jimenez<sup>1<\/sup>, Mattias Levin<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Fritzell<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura von Schantz<sup>1<\/sup>, Malin Lindstedt<sup>2<\/sup>, Karin HÃ¤gerbrand<sup>1<\/sup>, Anette Sundstedt<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Ellmark<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Alligator Bioscience AB, Lund, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"997549e7-3939-44df-b07b-1e0b4c56e914","ControlNumber":"6224","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

Although CD40 agonists have been investigated in clinical trials, systemic toxicities have limited their full potential in providing adequate antitumor effects. To overcome this limitation, we developed KK2269, a bispecific antibody, using REGULGENT&#8482; technology. KK2269 binds to CD40 and tumor-expressed epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) to allow activation of CD40+ APCs only at EpCAM+ tumor sites, thus avoiding systemic toxicity. EpCAM is overexpressed in many types of epithelial cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KK2269 exerts synergistic antitumor activity and tumor-specific immune responses in combination with docetaxel, a common chemotherapy for NSCLC, in an EpCAM-expressing tumor mouse model. Hence, we aimed to evaluate KK2269 for the treatment of NSCLC. Docetaxel is used as a combination therapy with ramucirumab, an anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antibody, for previously treated advanced NSCLC. In addition, many clinical studies are evaluating the add-on effects of PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade combined with standard chemotherapies (including docetaxel) in NSCLC, which may become the standard of care for advanced NSCLC in the future. Therefore, we investigated the antitumor effect of KK2269 in combination with docetaxel + anti-mouse VEGFR2 (study 1) and with docetaxel + anti-mouse PD-1 (study 2) using a mouse EpCAM-expressing B16F10 tumor-bearing human CD40 transgenic mouse model. The prolongation of TTP5X (the day on which the tumor volume is observed to be &#8805;5-fold of that observed on day 0) was evaluated. In study 1, the median TTP5X (95% confidence interval [CI]) with the control, docetaxel + anti-VEGFR2, and triple combination (KK2269, docetaxel, anti-VEGFR2) was 10.0 days (7.0, 10.0), 26.0 days (17.0, 28.0), and 52.0 days (42.0, not calculable), respectively. The TTP5X was significantly prolonged with the triple combination compared with the control (p=0.000007, log-rank test) and docetaxel + anti-VEGFR2 (p=0.000004, log-rank test). In study 2, the median TTP5X (95% CI) was 7.0 days (not calculable), 9.0 days (6.0, 11.0), 16.0 days (7.0, 18.0), and 26.5 days (7.0, 32.0) with the control, KK2269, docetaxel + anti-PD-1, and triple combination (KK2269, docetaxel, anti-PD-1), respectively. TTP5X was significantly prolonged with the triple combination compared with the control, KK2269, and docetaxel + anti-PD-1 (p&#60;0.0001, p=0.0003, and p=0.0023, respectively, log-rank test). Thus, a significant antitumor effect was demonstrated when KK2269 was added to the standard treatment of NSCLC (docetaxel + anti-VEGFR2 antibody) and to docetaxel + anti-PD-1 antibody. Our findings strongly suggest that KK2269 provides improved treatment options for patients with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CD40,Antibody engineering,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, conventional monospecific anti-CD40 agonist antibodies have faced limitations in terms of safety margins and clinical efficacy. To address this problem, we developed KK2269, a novel bispecific antibody (REGULGENT&#8482; format) that binds to both CD40 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is highly expressed in several types of tumors. KK2269 demonstrated EpCAM-dependent activation of CD40 signals both in vitro and in vivo, confirming that it is a tumor-targeting CD40 agonist. Liver metastasis is common in EpCAM-positive cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung cancers. Intrahepatic tumors can attenuate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors due to the liver tumor-specific suppressive immune milieu. Although CD40 agonists are expected to overcome the immunosuppressive environment, non-tumor-targeting CD40 agonists cause hepatotoxicity. In the present study, we used a syngeneic intrahepatic tumor model to examine whether KK2269 exhibits antitumor efficacy without causing hepatotoxicity. Firstly, we confirmed that KK2269 administration did not increase aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or cause pathological abnormalities in the liver despite Il12b induction in the EpCAM-positive tumor. Additionally, gene expression analysis of peritumoral normal liver revealed that KK2269 did not induce inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, a conventional anti-CD40 agonist antibody increased AST, caused pathological abnormalities, and upregulated inflammatory cytokines in peritumoral normal liver, as reported in the clinical setting. Secondly, the antitumor effect of KK2269 in combination with docetaxel was evaluated. The combination therapy synergistically reduced intrahepatic tumor volume, and the effect persisted even 21 days after the administration. Gene expression analysis revealed a lower immune infiltration in the intrahepatic tumor versus subcutaneous tumor and that KK2269 in combination with docetaxel increased T-cell infiltration and activation even in the immunosuppressive intrahepatic tumor. In summary, our study demonstrated that KK2269 activated dendritic cells in an EpCAM-positive tumor in the liver but did not affect peritumoral normal liver tissues. In addition, KK2269 in combination with docetaxel showed potent antitumor effect accompanied by T-cell infiltration and activation against the intrahepatic tumor, which has a lower immune infiltration. These results suggest that the combination therapy of KK2269 and docetaxel is promising for metastatic EpCAM-positive tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Immunotherapy,Liver,CD40,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The potent CD137 agonist urelumab has shown clinical promise as a cancer immunotherapeutic but development has been hampered by on-target off-tumour toxicities. A CD137 agonist targeted to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), frequently and highly expressed on castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC) tumour cells, could bring effective immunotherapy to this immunologically challenging to address disease.<br \/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: We designed and manufactured CB307, a novel half-life extended bispecific costimulatory Humabody<sup>&#174;<\/sup> V<sub>H<\/sub> therapeutic to elicit CD137 agonism exclusively in a PSMA-high tumour microenvironment (TME). The functional activity of CB307 was assessed in cell-based assays and in syngeneic mouse anti-tumour pharmacology studies. Non-clinical toxicology and toxicokinetic properties of CB307 were assessed in a good laboratory practice (GLP) compliant study in cynomolgus macaques.<br \/>RESULTS: CB307 provides effective CD137 agonism in a PSMA-dependent manner, with anti-tumour activity both in vitro and in vivo, and additional activity when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. A validated novel PSMA\/CD137 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay demonstrated a higher prevalence of CD137-postive cells in the PSMA-expressing human mCRPC TME with respect to primary lesions. CB307 did not show substantial toxicity in non-human primates and exhibited a plasma half-life supporting weekly clinical administration.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: CB307 is a first-in-class immunotherapeutic that triggers potent PSMA-dependent T cell activation thereby alleviating toxicological concerns against unrestricted CD137 agonism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Defective antigen presentation has been shown to play a contributory role in deficient anti-tumor immunity in breast cancers. Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) is a growth factor that increases differentiation into DC1 dendritic cells. CD40 agonist (CD40a) activates all 3 classes of antigen presenting cells - DCs, B cells, and macrophages. Synergy with chemotherapy and CD40a has been seen in other cancers but not explored in breast cancers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> C57BL\/6 mice (aged 6-8 weeks) were injected with 150,000 E0771 breast cancer cells within the mammary fat pad. Tumors were allowed to grow to a volume of ~50 mm<sup>3 <\/sup>before randomization into treatment groups. Mice were treated with triplet therapy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) via tail vein followed by Flt3L intraperitoneal (IP) daily for 5 days and CD40a IP 1 week later as well as monotherapy and doublet therapy controls. Tumor growth and survival were monitored throughout the experiment. Tumors were harvested for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and immunohistochemistry. To further study subset specific effects on efficacy of the immunotherapy, CD8 and CD4 T-cells were systemically depleted with anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 antibodies administered IP every 4 days starting 2 days before PLD treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Triplet therapy led to improved tumor control compared to no treatment, monotherapy, and doublet controls (p&#60;0.0001). Increased tumor infiltration with CD8 T cells was observed with triplet therapy via immunohistochemistry. scRNAseq showed increased cDC1 subset with Flt3L treatment. Contrastingly, CD40a decreased DC subsets likely due to activation and emigration out of the tumor, remodeled macrophage populations, and decreased T regulatory cells. CD8 depletion led to faster tumor growth whereas CD4 depletion reduced tumor growth. Triplet therapy maintained efficacy over PLD with both CD8 and CD4 depletion but showed reduced magnitude of benefit with CD8 T cell depletion suggesting a partial CD8 mediated process. CD4 T cell depletion did not hinder triplet therapy efficacy compared to PLD but depletion further enhanced tumor control in combination with triplet therapy, with 20% (2\/10) of animals achieving complete regression.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Triplet therapy with PLD, Flt3L, and CD40a improved tumor control and survival in syngeneic E0771 breast cancer mouse model. Added benefit of immunotherapy to PLD is partially CD8 T cell mediated. CD4 depletion further enhances tumor control in combination with triplet therapy. Experiments to explore the interactive effect of triplet therapy with other pertinent immune subsets are ongoing.

Among these, the emergent class of bispecific antibodies has exhibited remarkable potential compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies, marked by their targeting precision, expanded therapeutic scope, and personalized medicine prospects. Presently, eight bispecific antibodies are approved, with over 100 in varying clinical trial phases. Using a bispecific targeting HER-2 and NKG2D, we outline a comprehensive end-to-end platform for bispecific antibody discovery and characterization, designed to facilitate the progression of novel bispecific antibodies through the antibody discovery pipeline. To secure the most optimal binders tailored to specific targets, our methodology capitalizes on an extensive repertoire of phage display libraries. This strategy is instrumental in the identification of antibody candidates with exceptional binding affinity, broad cross-species compatibility, and enhanced drug-like properties. From the anti-HER2 chimeric antigen receptor ML39 and anti-NKG2D Fab KYK2.0, we synthesized four distinct bispecific formats by fusing single-chain variable fragments (scFv) to immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. These formats varied in terms of valency and scFv positioning, allowing us to assess their impact on antibody expression, binding kinetics, and functional efficacy. Subsequently, the bispecific antibodies underwent comprehensive in vitro efficacy and safety characterization, employing multiple innovative technologies. Utilizing a distinctive label-free approach with the xCELLigence system, we elucidated the kinetics of immune cell-mediated target cell killing upon antigen-antibody complex recognition in specific cancer cells. Safety assessments, with a focus on on-target\/off-tumor effects, were conducted using the Retrogenix platform. Furthermore, cytokine profiling was utilized to evaluate potential risks associated with enhanced cytokine levels, reinforcing the specificity and safety profile of the bispecific antibody. Finally, pertinent in vivo models, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and immune cell transfer models, facilitated the translation of preclinical bispecific antibody evaluations into clinically relevant contexts. This comprehensive platform for bispecific antibody discovery and functional characterization serves as a robust foundation for supporting Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, thus facilitating the transition of novel bispecific antibodies from the pre-clinical to the clinical phase of the drug discovery process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Immuno-oncology,Antibody engineering,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

However, their clinical development as monotherapy has been hindered by dose-related liver toxicity, leading to limited efficacy at safe doses. To address this challenge and bolster tumor-specific immunity by orchestrating the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and cytotoxic T cells, we introduce SM2256 - a bispecific conditional CD40 and 4-1BB dual agonist. SM2256 physically bridges DCs and T cells, enhancing T cell priming and reactivation. In preclinical animal studies, SM2256 exhibited both excellent tolerability and potent anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Methods: SM2256 was engineered by fusing high-affinity, non-ligand-blocking VHH domains targeting 4-1BB and CD40 to a silenced IgG1 Fc backbone. This fusion resulted in a tetravalent bispecific antibody capable of conditionally activating CD40 and 4-1BB upon mutual receptor binding. We assessed the binding specificity and affinity of SM2256 to human CD40 and 4-1BB using ELISA and flow cytometry. The target-dependent activation of CD40 and 4-1BB was confirmed via reporter assays and co-culture systems using primary DCs and T cells. In vivo safety and anti-tumor efficacy were evaluated in a syngeneic transplantation model using the MC38 cancer cell line in B-h41BB\/B-hCD40 double humanized mice.<br \/>Results: SM2256 exhibited sub-nanomolar binding affinity to recombinant human and cynomolgus monkey CD40 and 4-1BB, activating 4-1BB-NF&#954;B-luc and CD40-NF&#954;B-luc reporter cell lines at picomolar concentrations in a strictly target-dependent manner. Furthermore, SM2256 physically facilitated the interaction between DCs and T cells, leading to increased expression of DC co-stimulatory ligands and elevated secretion of cytokines by T cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures. In a syngeneic tumor transplantation model, SM2256 significantly restrained the growth of MC38 tumors in B-h41BB\/B-hCD40 double humanized mice.<br \/>Conclusions: SM2256 is a novel conditional CD40 and 4-1BB dual agonist that demonstrates promising preclinical efficacy against solid tumors while boasting an improved safety profile when compared to existing monoclonal antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD40,4-1BB,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"W.

CD28 is a signal 2 co-stimulatory receptor and activating CD28 increases T cell sensitivity, cytokine production and T cell survival. PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling attenuates the T cells functional activity by inhibiting CD28 co-stimulation in the presence of TCR stimulation. Therefore, we developed SM2275, a tetraspecific VHH antibody against EGFR, PD-L1, CD28 and HSA, for the treatment of EGFR+\/PD-L1+ solid tumors. Preclinical study demonstrated promising efficacy and favorable safety profile via a unique mechanism of action.<br \/>Methods: SM2275 was developed using StarMab&#8217;s proprietary Quadbody multifunctional VHH antibody platform. It features two monovalent, low-affinity binding domains for EGFR and PD-L1, along with nanomolar low affinity CD28 binding domains arranged in a tandem format, followed by a half-life extending HSA binding domain. Differential binding affinities of SM2275 to EGFR\/PD-L1 single-expressing versus double-expressing cell lines were analyzed by flow cytometry. Avidity-enhanced blockade of PD-1 on EGFR+PD-L1+ double-positive compared to PD-L1+ single-positive cells was analyzed via competitive binding assay and Jurkat PD1 NFAT Luciferase reporter assay. EGFR\/PD-L1 dual-target-dependent CD28 activation was confirmed using a primary human T cell IL2 &#38; IFN-&#947; release assay in the presence of TCR stimulation. In vivo efficacy against EGFR+\/PD-L1+ double-positive human tumors were evaluated using a syngeneic tumor transplantation model of MC38-hEGFR\/hPDL1 cell line into hPD-L1\/hCD28 humanized mice.<br \/>Results: SM2275 displays dramatically increased affinity for cancer cells co-expressing EGFR\/PD-L1 compared to single-expressing cells. This leads to an avidity-enhanced PD-L1 blockade specifically on the surface of EGFR+PD-L1+ double-positive cancer cells, enabling localized reactivation of tumor-infiltrating T cells without systemic immune toxicity. Simultaneously blocking the PD-L1 signaling unleashed the inhibition of CD28 co-stimulation for the full T cell activation. In the presence of SM2275, EGFR \/PD-L1 double-positive cancer cells induce significantly enhanced CD28 activation and cytokine secretion compared to single-antigen-expressing cells. In a syngeneic tumor transplantation model, SM2275 effectively inhibits the growth of MC38-hEGFR\/hPDL1 tumors in hPD-L1-hCD28 humanized mice, with no apparent cytokine release and immune toxicity.<br \/>Conclusions: SM2275 is a novel dual-EGFR &#38; PD-L1-targeting, conditional CD28 agonistic antibody. It demonstrated promising efficacy and favorable safety profile in preclinical studies via a unique mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,PD-L1,CD28,Tetraspecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.
