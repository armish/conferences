[{"Abstract":"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds to the extracellular matrix including hyaluronic acid. Human CD44 has 19 exons, 10 of which are commonly present in all isoforms. CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) is composed of the common exons, and is expressed in many cell types. CD44 variants (CD44v) are produced by alternative splicing, in which the remaining nine variant exons are inserted into the CD44 standard isoform in various combinations. The CD44 isoforms have overlapping and unique functions. Both CD44s and CD44v harbor hyaluronan-binding motifs that promote interaction with the tumor microenvironment, which activate various signaling pathways in tumor cells. CD44v is mainly expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and survival. Overexpression of CD44v is observed in many solid tumors and plays an important role in invasion, metastasis, and acquisition of stemness. In this study, we employed the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening method (CBIS method), and established highly sensitive anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using CD44v3-10-overexpressed cell lines as immunogens. After that, we determined the epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and investigated their applications. As a result, we successfully established eight mAbs against each CD44v (v3 to v10), which can be used for flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, some of them exhibited cancer specificity against pancreatic cancers, colorectal cancers, gastric cancers, or oral cancers, indicating that established anti-CD44v mAbs are useful for the antibody therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,CD44,Pancreatic cancer,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yukinari Kato<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hiroyuki Suzuki<sup><\/sup>, Mika  K.

In adult tissues, ROR1 is expressed at very low levels but its increased expression is observed in hematological cancers and a broad range of solid tumors. AT86474 is a highly homogeneous antibody drug conjugate incorporating AxcynCYS<sup>TM<\/sup> technology that allows reproducible site-specific conjugation with DAR4 composition greater than 97%. AT86474 utilizes a proprietary payload derived from an FDA approved drug that was optimized in-house for increased potency and with altered PK properties to limit systemic exposure. In vitro, the payload displays broad sub-nanomolar activity across multiple cancer cell lines, including those resistant to paclitaxel, DM1, MMAE and DXd. The payload is conjugated via an enzyme-cleavable linker optimized for solubility, stability, and high drug to antibody ratios. AT86474 uses a humanized and optimized monoclonal antibody that demonstrates selective binding to ROR1-positive cells and subsequent internalization, sub-nanomolar potency in vitro and strong bystander effects. AT86474 was evaluated in a preclinical CDX mouse model of ovarian cancer, where substantial tumor growth inhibition was observed with two weekly doses at as low as 1 mg\/kg. As ROR1 over-expression is also observed in many solid tumors, such as pancreatic, gastric, breast and lung cancers, the use of AT86474 can be expanded to benefit a large patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Proprietary payload,ROR1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Our diverse panel of CD28-binding antibodies add co-stimulatory building blocks to our TCE repertoire. Using single B cell-screening, we identified fully human IgG and HCAb binders to human and non-human primate CD28 with a high degree of sequence diversity. We selected a subset of antibodies for expression and assessed binding to both human and cynomolgus CD28-expressing cells. These antibodies displayed a wide range of binding avidities in the sub-nanomolar to micromolar range, and epitope binning analysis identified seven epitope communities. Co-stimulatory activity for a subset of molecules was assessed <i>in vitro<\/i>. Antibodies displayed a wide range of crosslinked T-cell activation with the majority showing no activation independent of crosslinking.

Due to FR&#945;&#8217;s favorable expression profile, multiple antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are being explored in this setting. Here we present the preclinical characterization of a new anti-FR&#945; ADC, ZW191. ZW191 is a bystander active antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a humanized IgG1 antibody conjugated to a novel camptothecin-based topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOPO1i) payload, ZD06519, via a maleimidocaproyl (MC) anchor and a glycyl glycyl phenylalanyl glycyl (GGFG)-aminomethyl (AM) cleavable linker at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. ZW191 is projected to undergo IND submission in 2024.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The novel antibody and drug-linker components of ZW191 were generated, characterized, and optimally integrated. The apparent binding affinity and cellular internalization of the ZW191 antibody were determined in FR&#945;-expressing cells. Tumor spheroid cancer cell cultures were utilized to determine ZW191&#8217;s degree of tissue penetration and its cytotoxicity. The bystander activity of ZW191 was assessed using antigen positive and negative co-culture experiments. The anti-tumor activity of ZW191 was evaluated in a panel of ovarian cancer, NSCLC, endometrial cancer and TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) spanning a range of FR&#945; expression. ZW191 was evaluated in toxicology and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies performed in non-human primates (NHP).<br \/>Results: The antibody component of ZW191 features a favorable binding profile with strong binding to FR&#945;, and drives superior tumor spheroid penetration, cellular internalization, and payload delivery compared to FR&#945; targeted antibodies used in multiple other ADCs. ZW191 demonstrates potent activity in FR&#945; expressing cell cultures and effective bystander activity. In a panel of PDX models representing a range of FR&#945; expression, ZW191 demonstrates compelling anti-tumor activity across ovarian and endometrial cancers, NSCLC and TNBC. ZW191 demonstrates an encouraging tolerability profile in NHP, with favorable PK. The promising efficacy, tolerability, and PK support the potential of ZW191 as a novel therapeutic agent that may help address unmet need in patients with high and low FR&#945; expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Folate receptor,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Limited treatment options such as chemotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy are available for SCLC patients, very often followed by rapid recurrence and metastasis. Thus, new effective treatment options for SCLC remain high unmet medical needs. Overexpression of claudin-3 (CLDN3), one of the tight junction proteins, is observed in various types of cancers. The abnormal conformation of tumor cell growth leads to the external exposure of CLDN3, in contrast, the normal cells that maintain high polarity do not expose CLDN3 externally. Therefore, CLDN3 could be a potential therapeutic target and biomarker. Based on the analysis of the expression pattern of CLDN3 using a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset derived from SCLC patients, we found that CLDN3 could be a superior and unique target of SCLC compared to others (e.g., DLL3 and B7H3). Hence, we developed a fully human monoclonal antibody, afucosylated ABN501 (&#945;-ABN501), which has high specificity and strong affinity to CLDN3-expressing cells. The &#945;-ABN501 antibody showed CLDN3-dependent killing effects against the SCLC cells, expressing different levels of CLDN3, as assessed via the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay wherein using NK cells expressing CD16a (NK-92MI-CD16a), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and primary NK cells. Further, the efficacy study in the CLDN3-expressing SCLC cell derived xenograft mouse model revealed that &#945;-ABN501 was highly efficacious in inhibition of tumor growth. Collectively, we elucidated that the ADCC activity of &#945;-ABN501 was dependent on the expression level of CLDN3 and especially specific to the SCLC cells, which underlines significant suppression of tumor growth. Present study data sets suggest that the &#945;-ABN501 can be a potential new therapeutic option for SCLC. In addition, the &#945;-ABN501 antibody is currently under way of development into new drug platforms for further applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Lung cancer: small cell,ADCC,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Identifying novel targeted therapies to potentiate standard of care (SOC) therapy, remains an unmet need. In the past 4 years, numerous targeted therapies in Oncology have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the identification of targeted therapies against direct tumor biological drivers remains important. Progranulin (PGRN\/GP88) is a biological driver of tumorigenesis, survival, and drug resistance in multiple cancers including breast and lung cancers. PGRN\/GP88 tissue expression is an independent prognostic factor of recurrence and mortality while elevated serum PGRN\/GP88 level is associated with poor outcomes such as progression of disease and shortened survival. The importance of inhibiting PGRN\/GP88 expression or action effect on the proliferation and tumor growth of several cancers has been established by several laboratories including ours. In the current study, in association with Precision Antibody, we developed anti-PGRN\/GP88 fully human monoclonal antibodies by immunizing TC transgenic humanized mice with recombinant human progranulin. Within 60 days following the start of immunization, several fully human anti-progranulin monoclonal antibodies were developed, characterized by several functional assays including neutralization, inhibition of PGRN\/GP88 cell surface binding, proliferation, migration <i>in vitro <\/i>and tumor formation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Results: The inhibition of PGRN\/GP88 action by fully human monoclonal antibodies inhibited cell proliferation and migration in a dose-and time-dependent fashion. Octet analysis determined Kd in the range of 10<sup>-11<\/sup> M to<sup> <\/sup>10<sup>-10<\/sup> M. Transwell assay showed that anti-PGRN treatment inhibited migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells such as H1299 and A549 cells. In vivo xenograft studies with H1299 cells injected in athymic nude mice showed that fully human anti-PGRN antibodies inhibited tumor growth when compared to antibody control treated mice. Conclusion: PGRN\/GP88 represents a therapeutic target for non-small cell carcinoma with two companion diagnostics (tissue test and ELISA to measure GP88 circulating levels). The use of the TC transgenic mice allows for the rapid development of fully human high affinity monoclonal antibodies bypassing the need for chimerization or humanization and affinity maturation of monoclonal antibodies raised in mice or other humanized systems.

Most ADCs are based on cytotoxic warheads targeting only proliferating cells. In contrast, HDP&#180;s proprietary ATAC platform utilizes amatoxins as payload. Amatoxins are specific inhibitors of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, suppressing a key function in the protein metabolism not limiting their cytotoxicity to proliferating cells. Furthermore, there are no known resistance mechanisms against amatoxins in mammalian cells (i.e. multi drug resistance transporters), making ATACs a promising new class of anti-cancer ADCs. Here we present pre-clinical data on the anti-CD37 ATAC HDP-102. CD37 is a transmembrane protein expressed exclusively on immune cells, mainly mature B-cells, and in many B-cell malignancies, including Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (NHL).<br \/>Material and Methods: HDP-102: anti-CD37 ADC based on cysteine-reactive, site-specific amatoxin-linker constructs produced by HDP<br \/>Cytotoxicity assays: CellTiter Glo 2.0 (Promega) assays on CD37<sup>pos<\/sup> cell lines MEC-2, Raji-luc, Ramos and CD37<sup>neg<\/sup> Nalm-6 cells<br \/>Efficacy studies: Disseminated MEC-2 and Raji-Luc mouse xenograft tumor models in single dose experiments<br \/>Tolerability study in Cynomolgus monkeys: i.v. HDP-102 treatment on days 1 and 22; blood sampling for PK analysis; necropsy and histopathology on days 28 and 64<br \/>Results: HDP-102 showed full-blown cytotoxicity with EC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the low nanomolar range in all CD37<sup>pos<\/sup> cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> but no cytotoxicity on CD37<sup>neg<\/sup> cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the anti-tumor efficacy of HDP-102 was evaluated in disseminated CDX models of NHL. A single dose of 0.5 mg\/kg HDP-102 already led to complete tumor remission in all animals in a Raji-luc model and 60% survival on day 100 in a MEC-2 model, demonstrating the high potency of HDP-102 in NHL models. In a tolerability study in Cynomolgus monkeys, i.v. administration of HDP-102 was well tolerated up to 2.5 mg\/kg without clinical signs of toxicity. Microscopically, decreased cellularity in lymphoid tissue was the main finding, caused by the targeted effect of HDP-102 on CD37<sup>pos<\/sup> cells. The HNSTD of 2.5 mg\/kg together with the potent anti-tumor efficacy of HDP-102 leads to a therapeutic window of ~200 for HDP-102.<br \/>Conclusion: CD37 is an ideal target for ADCs due to its high prevalence in B-cell malignancies and limited expression on healthy cells. We have demonstrated that the anti-CD37 ATAC HDP-102 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of NHL. HDP-102 showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy in CDX models even after single doses. Pharmacological activity of HDP-102 was also seen in Cynomolgus monkeys as evidenced by depletion of B-cells in lymphoid organs. Furthermore, HDP-102 was well tolerated in monkeys. Taken together, based on pre-clinical data, HDP-102 is a promising new treatment option for NHL patients combining a good safety profile with strong anti-tumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CD37,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Amanitin based ADCs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-J.

In contrast to intracellular protein degraders, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues which require ubiquitin-proteosome cellular degradation pathways, extracellular protein degraders can additionally harness endosomal-lysosomal protein degradation. Two recently published examples of extracellular protein degraders include AbTACs (antibody-based PROTAC) which co-engage a protein of interest (POI) and transmembrane E3 ligases, and KineTACs (cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras) which utilize endogenous cytokine receptors to degrade extracellular POIs. These bispecific antibody degrader platforms not only have advantageous pharmacological and drug-like manufacturing properties, but can also be engineered for tissue-specificity and to address multiple complementary targets, with the goal of increased efficacy and decreased toxicity. To that end, we have greatly expanded the extracellular degrader repertoire beyond AbTACs and KineTACs, with a novel bispecific antibody degrader platform called TrainTACs (tissue receptor antigen internalization targeting chimeras). To demonstrate the potential of this novel extracellular degrading platform, we developed degraders for the canonical receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is an oncogenic driver, that has been clinically validated in lung, colorectal and head and neck cancers, but patient benefit has been limited by treatment-related acquired resistance mutations and on-target\/off-tumor dose-limiting toxicities. The potential of our TrainTACs, AbTACs and KineTACs to overcome the limitations of current therapeutic modalities was assessed. Gene expression profiles from tumor and normal tissues were evaluated to identify potential degraders co-expressed with EGFR in tumors. More than 70 unique bispecific antibody constructs spanning 20 receptors were generated and screened in tumor cell-based assays to evaluate EGFR antagonism, internalization, and degradation. TrainTACs, AbTACs and KineTACs degraded EGFR in multiple tumor cell lines covering a range of EGFR mutations. Degradation of EGFR led to deep inhibition of EGFR signaling, robust inhibitory effects on tumor spheroids, and in xenograft mouse tumor models. In conclusion, eTPD represents a promising new drug modality, and TrainTACs, AbTACs and KineTACs have expanded the toolbox of extracellular targeted protein degraders that can be utilized in a target-, tissue- and disease-specific manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Targeted therapy,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) belongs to the transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;) superfamily. GDF15 can bind to the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor &#945;-like (GFRAL) protein, which is primarily expressed in the hindbrain. This interaction activates the GFRAL-RET signaling pathway, which transmits anorectic neural signals, leading to weight loss, affecting fat and muscle degradation, and inducing cachexia. Anti-GDF-15\/GFRAL antibodies have the potential to reverse this response, making them vital therapeutic targets for cachexia. Herein, a novel humanized GDF-15 neutralizing antibody (LBL-049) was developed with higher efficacy and better specificity than ponsegromab, the same target antibody from Pfizer, in pre-clinical studies.<br \/>Methods: LBL-049 was generated from mouse hybridoma, humanized by CDR grafting, the Fc region was further engineered to silence Fc effector. The binding affinity and specificity were detected by Fortebio and ELISA respectively. The function of blocking GDF15\/GFRAL\/RET signaling was examined in the reporter-gene cell assays. The in vivo efficacy of restoring cachexia was demonstrated in both tumor-induced and cisplatin-induced mouse cachexia models, in which preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies were also conducted. And a single-dose PK study was conducted in rats.<br \/>Results: LBL-049 had high binding affinities to both human and cynomolgus GDF-15 proteins with high specificity, did not bind with other TGF family members as compared with ponsegromab. In reporter-gene cell assays, LBL-049 blocked GDF15\/GFRAL signaling more potently than ponsegromab. In HT1080 tumor-induced or cisplatin-induced mouse cachexia model, LBL-049 prevented weight loss by neutralizing circulating GDF-15 in a dose dependent manner, at low dose of 1 mpk in HT1080 cachexia model, LBL-049 was more efficacious than ponsegromab to restore the body weight loss. The PK profile was excellent after single dosing of LBL-049 in rats. LBL-049 also showed good developability, i.e., low viscosity and good stability.<br \/>Conclusion: LBL-049, a novel GDF15 neutralizing antibody with high affinity and specificity, showed great potency to inhibit GDF15\/GFRAL\/RET signaling in vitro and prevent weight loss in various mouse cachexia models, which are encouraging for future development for the treatment of cachexia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Cachexia,GDF15,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Baohui Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiao Huang<sup><\/sup>, Mi Ding<sup><\/sup>, Jing Huang<sup><\/sup>, Yurong Qin<sup><\/sup>, Fengxia Li<sup><\/sup>, Jing Guan<sup><\/sup>, Jianming Sun<sup><\/sup>, Guojin Wu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoxiao Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jordan Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Shoupeng Lai<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqiang Kang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Hong Ling<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nanjing Leads Biolabs Co.,Ltd., Nan Jing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0dca5870-7173-4000-a4cc-d264f4528698","ControlNumber":"4440","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

By aggregating tumor-cell killing and cytokine data across four tumor targets with different properties and target expression levels, we have gained novel insights into target-specific considerations for the development of CD3 TCEs. TCEs recapitulate a synapse between T cells and target cells. T cell function downstream of this synapse is determined by the complex interplay between multiple independent factors. These include properties of the CD3- and tumor-binding arms, such as binding kinetics and epitope, as well as target-dependent factors such as cell type and target density. We used our diverse CD3 antibodies to engineer bispecific TCEs against four solid tumor targets: PSMA, B7-H4, 5T4, and the peptide-MHC target MAGE-A4. For each target, we engineered and characterized hundreds of bispecific molecules using high-throughput assays, including T-cell dependent tumor-cell killing, cytokine release, developability assessments, and structural studies. Here, we compare data from across these programs to elucidate the impact of target-dependent parameters on TCE function.

Since they do not have a light chain, HCAbs have a small antigen-binding domain that can unlock new functionalities by reaching epitopes that are inaccessible to classical antibodies. HCAbs can be obtained by immunizing camelids, but this approach is expensive, time-consuming, and results in a limited antibody repertoire. Previously, we engineered the KisoMouse&#8482;- a transgenic mouse with multi-camelid species VHH\/VH genes and the complete alpaca D and J gene segments integrated into the mouse IgH locus, along with a functional loss of the heavy chain CH1 domain to eliminate light chain pairing. KisoMouse&#8482; are healthy and generate a robust serum HCAb response against a diverse range of immunogens.<br \/>Trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 (TROP2) is a membrane protein overexpressed in numerous solid tumor types such as breast, colon, and lung cancers. TROP2 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and decreased survival and has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. An anti-TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate has been approved for breast and bladder cancer, but challenges related to payload toxicity and resistance highlight the need for alternative therapeutics.<br \/>We had previously identified an anti-TROP2 HCAb with high potency in <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical models of human breast and colorectal cancer. Conventional antibody discovery approaches are resource-intensive and can fail to identify rare antibodies. To overcome such limitations, we developed the KisoSeek&#8482; platform, a proprietary AI-powered toolkit that categorizes antibodies in an immune response based on their structural and biophysical features. With KisoSeek&#8482;, we analyzed the entire antibody repertoire generated from KisoMouse&#8482; immunized with TROP2 and rapidly identified HCAbs with similar features as the high potency reference antibody described above. We selected three additional antibodies based on their <i>in vitro<\/i> TROP2 affinity, competitiveness for the reference antibody&#8217;s epitope, and yield in CHO cells. These candidates showed comparable potent efficacy in inducing regression in human breast and colorectal xenograft models, akin to the original reference antibody.<br \/>In summary, the KisoSeek&#8482; platform identified novel anti-TROP2 HCAbs out of the KisoMouse&#8482; antibody repertoire that were similar to our original reference antibody. This demonstrates how KisoMouse&#8482; and KisoSeek&#8482; are two powerful complementary platforms for novel clinical antibody discovery. By categorizing the entire antibody repertoire and identifying antibodies with similar characteristics as known functional antibodies, KisoSeek&#8482; has the potential to leverage existing discovery efforts to uncover many more rare yet potent therapeutic antibodies - the proverbial needles in a haystack.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Trop-2,Transgenic mice,Artificial Intelligence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) can lead to disease relapse despite achieving complete remission through targeted therapy, and tumor heterogeneity is responsible for MRD and compromises the efficacy of targeted therapy, especially in B-cell malignancies. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) play a crucial role in oncology indications, and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) represent one of the fastest-growing classes of next generation antibody therapeutics for cancer therapy. Several advantages of targeting dual tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) with BsAbs and bi-specific antibody drug conjugates (BsADCs) have been proposed, including improved efficacy, heightened tumor cell specificity, and reduced side effects in normal tissues. Notably, the ability of BsADCs to bind to cancer cells expressing even just one antigen has prompted further investigation into their efficacy in heterogeneous cancer models. LCB36 is a BsADC composed of a BsAb targeting both clinically validated CD20 and CD22, which are expressed in B-Cell malignancy, and a proprietary DNA cross-linking PBD prodrug that is site-specifically conjugated to the BsAb using ConjuAll technology. We assessed the expression levels of CD20 and CD22 in the cancer cell lines. While most cells expressed both antigens, some populations showed a low expression level of CD20 and a high expression level of CD22, while others exhibited the opposite pattern, suggesting heterogeneous expression of the two antigens within the same cell line. To confirm the heterogeneity of the two antigens in blood cancer patients, we analyzed single-cell sequencing data [GSE132509]. Each patient had CD20 and CD22 double-positive cells along with CD20 or CD22 single-positive cells, suggesting the possibility of relapse due to MRD following CD20 or CD22 single-targeted therapy. LCB36 demonstrated superior efficacy in CD20 and CD22 double-positive cell lines and cell-line derived xenografts (CDXs) models compared to ADCs targeting either CD20 or CD22, while showing comparable efficacy to single-target ADCs in CD20 or CD22 single-positive cancer cell lines and CDXs. Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies of LCB36 were analyzed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, respectively, using LC-MS\/MS bioanalysis. Preliminary toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that LCB36 is well tolerated. In conclusion, LCB36, composed of a BsAb that binds to two clinically validated targets, showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses and has the potential to increase event-free survival periods by reducing MRD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bispecific antibody,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Wihak Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Namjeong Choi<sup><\/sup>, Cul-Woong Chung<sup><\/sup>, Hwanhee Oh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>LegoChem Biosciences, Inc, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6d465e6c-1a82-4201-8761-f1f6fc9a9a6a","ControlNumber":"4285","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

EGFR&#215;cMET bispecific antibody has been approved for the treatment of NSCLC, supporting a simultaneous targeting strategy. In addition to this dual targeting benefit, bispecific antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting EGFR and cMET have also been developed to further improve anti-tumor activity and tissue selectivity. Sufficient target affinity, good cellular internalization and high tumor infiltration are critical for an ADC to mediate therapeutic activity. To this end, we developed the first EGFR&#215;cMET bispecific nanobody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as payload (NXV01c). Lead nanobodies against EGFR and cMET were respectively selected from immune libraries by phage display, followed by highly efficient humanization and optimization by neoX&#8217;s computation platform. The bispecific nanobody with Fc (NXV01) was constructed by &#8220;knobs-into-holes&#8221; heterodimerization and then homogeneously conjugated with MMAE via a lysosomal cleavable valine-citrulline dipeptide linker. The resulting bispecific nanobody drug conjugate (NDC), NXV01c, was evaluated in multiple tumor cell lines and tumor xenograft models. NXV01, the pre-conjugate bispecific nanobody, bound EGFR and cMET with nanomolar potency (BLI) and inhibited the phosphorylation of cellular EGFR and cMET with nanomolar IC50 (ELISA). Moreover, it did not activate cellular cMET. Importantly, the NDC NXV01c is highly homogeneous: it has an average DAR of 3.87 and &#62;95% of NXV01c has a DAR of 4. To examine stability of conjugation, NXV01C was incubated in human plasma (37&#8451;) for 14 days, the maximum free drug release rate (by LC\/MS\/MS) is 0.68%, which is much lower than that of DS8201. In vitro, NXV01c was rapidly internalized into H1975 cells which co-expressed EGFR and cMET. It inhibited the growth of H1975 (lung) and SNU5 (gastric) cancer cells with picomolar activity but spared normal keratinocytes. NXV01c also inhibited the proliferation of additional cell lines derived from lung, gastric, esophageal, and liver cancer, and the level of inhibition positively associated with the expression density of both targets. In an H1975 cell line-derived xenograft model, NXV01C exhibited potent and dose-dependent anti-tumor activity. Treatments at 3 and 10 mg\/kg once per week for 2 weeks led to shrinkage and complete regression of tumor, respectively. In patient-derived xenograft models of NSCLC and esophageal cancer, NXV01C led to tumor regression and elimination without noticeable toxic effects. EGFR&#215;cMET bispecific nanobody drug conjugate NXV01c has favorable drug-like properties and demonstrated superior anti-tumor effect in vitro and in vivo. The results suggest NXV01C can be an effective solution for EGFR\/cMET bearing tumors commonly found in diverse malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),EGFR,c-Met,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

Normal tissues including skin, salivary glands, bladder and esophagus express only low to medium levels of Nectin-4 making the protein an attractive target for cancer therapies. The approval of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, an anti-Nectin-4 based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a microtubule inhibitor payload, either as a single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement in the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. We have developed a novel anti-Nectin-4 ADC with a novel topoisomerase I (TOPO 1) inhibitor drug payload. Topoisomerase inhibitor payload-based ADCs offer potential advantages compared to microtubule payload-based ADCs including a different toxicity profile and the differentiated susceptibility to resistance mechanisms, such as P-gp mediated drug efflux.

This pathway enables cellular adaptation and survival under stress conditions by activating specific genes that reduce protein synthesis. Tumors exist in a state characterized by heightened intrinsic and extrinsic stress, heavily relying on a balanced ISR to manage the metabolic demands for rapid growth. ISR (Integrated Stress Response) consists of four major kinases: GCN2, PERK, HRI, and PKR. GCN2 is activated by stress due to amino acid deprivation. Amino acids are crucial for cell survival, and cancer cells, require higher amounts than normal cells, particularly depending on conditionally essential amino acids like glutamine, asparagine, and arginine. GCN2 activation acts as a key mechanism for cancer cells to overcome amino acid deficiencies, making GCN2 a potential target, especially in conjunction with anticancer drugs like asparaginase. In this study, we aimed to identify a potential GCN2 inhibitor to explore a promising anti-cancer approach in sarcoma, a rare cancer with no new therapeutic alternatives.<br \/><b><i>Method<\/i><\/b> The activity verification of ISR kinases was characterized using <i>in-vitro<\/i> enzyme assays. <i>In-vitro<\/i> panel assays were employed to determine the selectivity profiling for oncology kinases. The modulation of the ISR pathway was validated using a sarcoma cell line (HT-1080) and a cell line derived from sarcoma patients. Western blot or ELISA assays were employed to measure phospho-GCN2, ATF4, phospho-eIF2a, and CHOP under both basal conditions and amino acid starvation conditions. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of sarcoma patient tissue samples(n=17) was conducted through RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis.<br \/><b><i>Results<\/i><\/b> AST-05X is a selective and potent GCN2 inhibitor.

Using robust stem cell cloning technologies, we have cloned stem cells from patient-matched biopsies of BE, low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) from multiple patients. Whole exome sequencing of these stem cells reveals the mutational maturation along the sequence of BE, LGD, HGD, and EAC at unprecedented resolution of both copy number and single nucleotide variation. In vitro differentiation and xenografting of these clones recapitulates their original histology and shows that only the EAC stem cells yield robust tumors in immunodeficient mice. Leveraging the intrinsic immortality of these stem cells, we have performed high-throughput screens for small molecules that selectively kill BE stem cells without harming patient-matched normal esophageal stem cells. These screening efforts evolved into synthetic lethal strategies that identified drug combinations that selectively eliminate, in vitro, BE stem cells from 20 of 23 cases. Remarkably, this same synthetic lethal drug combination also eliminated in vitro stem cells of LGD, HGD, and EAC that were not components of the original screens. We have used synthetic chemistry to generate a series of novel molecules based on the identified drug combination that significantly improved the in vitro efficacy to sub-nanomolar levels. These novel molecules directed to the stem cell component of BE, LGD, HGD, and EAC also show potent effects against tumors generated from EAC stem cells in immunodeficient mice.

AOH1996 does this by inserting into the PCNA-interacting protein-box (PIP-box) pocket that is, in part, defined by the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL), the site of interaction between PCNA and most of its many binding partners. As a result, AOH1996 inhibits PCNA functions such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription-replication conflict (TRC) resolution leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These effects are cancer specific and AOH1996 has little effect on non-cancerous cells even at 6-fold the effective dose in cancer cells. AOH1996 was developed in our lab and is currently in Phase I human clinical trials. Six patients have been enrolled in the trial and <u>have not<\/u> experienced AOH1996-related toxicities as the doses have been escalated to levels found to be efficacious in preclinical animal studies. Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) poses a significant challenge in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR activating mutations. Initially, EGFR TKIs like gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and osimertinib deliver remarkable responses, inducing tumor regression and improving overall survival. However, the emergence of resistance mechanisms, such as secondary EGFR mutations and bypass signaling pathway activation, hampers the efficacy of these drugs over time. The functional relationship between PCNA and EGFR has implications for the treatment of lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations. Membrane-localized EGFR modulates the PCNA-centric process of DNA replication through signaling pathways such as the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk, PI3K\/AKT, and PLC&#947;1\/PKC signaling pathways. Nucleus-localized EGFR enhances PCNA stability by phosphorylating PCNA on tyrosine 211 (Y211), which prevents its degradation. In addition, phosphorylation at Y211 by EGFR results in decreased association of PCNA with MutS, which results in reduced mismatch repair (MMR). In this study, we combine AOH1996 and osimertinib as an innovative approach to treating NSCLC cancers with activating EGFR mutations and find that the drug combination: 1.) enhances the killing of NSCLC cell lines with activating EGFR mutations and acquired resistance to TKIs; 2.) enhances the destabilization of PCNA on chromatin; and 3.) causes changes in the localization and colocalization of PCNA and EGFR. We conclude that the combination of AOH1996 and osimertinib holds much potential as an improved treatment regimen for lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,PCNA,AOH1996,osimertinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Targeting the cancer-specific glucose transporter GLUT-1 is a promising approach to restrict glucose uptake and challenge the metabolic needs of tumor cells. Antibodies, as opposed to small molecule inhibitors, are an attractive modality to therapeutically target complex muti-pass membrane transporters. Here we report the development of antibodies that very specifically block the function of only GLUT-1.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Monoclonal antibodies against GLUT-1 were generated using virus-like particles. For immunization, chickens were used as they are evolutionarily distant from mammals and can produce antibodies with prolonged CDR3-s in VH, which could facilitate their binding to the limited extracellular region of GLUT-1. Antibody discovery was performed with HybriFree B cell cloning technology followed by functional screens with 2-deoxyglucose uptake interference or cell proliferation measurements.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The discovered antibodies specifically bind to GLUT-1 with low nanomolar EC50 values and do not target other glucose transporters. The lead candidate, ICO-33, inhibits glucose uptake and rewires the metabolism of GLUT-1-dependent cancer cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation. This results in a significantly synergistic cancer proliferation inhibition with ICO-33 and OXPHOS inhibitor combinations in doses that do not inhibit proliferation as single agents. ICO-33 and OXPHOS inhibitor treatment is well-tolerated and demonstrates a drastic tumor growth inhibition in <i>in vivo<\/i> colorectal and pancreatic cancer models.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>We describe the discovery of highly specific monoclonal antibodies targeting GLUT-1. We further demonstrate that the restriction of the much-needed glucose uptake by ICO-33 makes cancer cells highly susceptible to OXPHOS inhibitor co-therapy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, validating the antibody as a promising candidate for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Therapeutics,Glucose metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted agents, recurrence is frequent and survival rates for patients with advanced metastatic disease are dismal. These realities highlight the need to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic vulnerabilities in such tumors and to develop alternative treatment strategies. We took an unbiased approach to tackle this problem in which we leveraged publically available (DepMap) and in-house generated genome-wide CRISPR screens conducted in over 1000 cancer cell lines. We initially focused on the identification of essential genes that were unique to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and whose expression levels were associated with worse patient outcomes. This interrogation revealed six genes (CTPS1, RHOA, PRKRA, RAD9A, HUS1, and RAD1) meeting these initial criteria. The essentiality of these genes was validated using gene-specific siRNAs in a panel of TNBC cells and knockdown of CTPS1 was shown to elicit the most inhibitory effect. CTPS1 depletion resulted in a rapid S-phase cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis, not only in TNBC cells but also in highly aggressive ovarian cancer cells which share many molecular features with TNBC. CTPS1 converts uridine triphosphate to cytidine triphosphate, forming an essential nucleic acid required for multiple cellular processes. CTPS1 mRNA expression was substantially elevated in tumor vs. normal tissue, for both breast and ovarian cancer. Using over 40 breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, RT-PCR analyses confirmed increased expression of CTPS1 in TNBC and most ovarian cancer cell lines compared to other disease sub-types and &#8220;normal&#8221; cell line\/tissue controls. Interestingly, chemoresistant and PARP inhibitor-resistant models exhibited the highest levels of CTPS1 among all cells analyzed. We subsequently identified and acquired STP938, a first-in-class highly selective CTPS1 inhibitor being developed by Step-Pharma. STP938 was found to elicit potent anti-cancer effects at nM concentrations across many cell line and patient-derived models, in both 2D and 3D culture systems. RNAseq analysis in aggressive cell line models following STP938 treatment or CTPS1 knockdown revealed significant regulation of genes related to DNA replication and the cell cycle pathways suggesting that combinatorial\/sequential treatments of STP938 with replication stress\/DNA damage response related drugs may be synergistic. STP938 is currently being developed for the treatment of lymphoma, and our findings support the repurposing of STP938 for breast and ovarian cancer, an avenue that we are currently developing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Biomarkers,Novel anticancer agents,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

These challenges include significant obstacles surrounding the delivery of pre-clinical studies, safety, clinical trial design, and routes to commercialization. Recognizing that this journey is difficult, in 2023 the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission launched the Brain Tumor Research Novel Therapeutics Accelerator (BTR-NTA). The BTR-NTA is a new international accelerator program that provides independent and comprehensive expert guidance to de-risk therapeutic development through systematic, multidisciplinary evaluation and feedback for academic or industry researchers who are developing a therapeutic or technology for brain tumors. The BTR-NTA was modeled on the TREAT-NMD Advisory Committee for Therapeutics, which has yielded impressive results in the neuromuscular disease field. The ultimate goal of the BTR-NTA program is to enable researchers with a potential therapy or technology for brain tumors to navigate the development journey and successfully make it to the clinic in an efficient and timely way. The international, multidisciplinary BTR-NTA Expert Committee spans the entire therapeutic development pathway to avoid a siloed approach to research. Thanks to charitable funding, the BTR-NTA is free for academics and available at low cost for industry. Researchers at any stage of pre-clinical or clinical work can apply to the BTR-NTA, and, if accepted, their application will proceed as follows: 1. The applicant completes an application form covering work to date and future plans under a strict confidentiality agreement that protects the applicant; 2. Depending on the types of applicants, additional experts are recruited to ensure that each applicant gets a robust and tailored review 3. The applicant&#8217;s work is reviewed by an international, multidisciplinary committee 4. The applicant and BTR-NTA Expert Committee meet in-person to further discuss the applicant&#8217;s work; and 5. The applicant receives a comprehensive written report from the BTR-NTA Expert Committee, with feedback on strengths and weaknesses and guidance on next steps. The BTR-NTA Expert Committee dedicates half a day to review the applicant&#8217;s work in-person, and extensive time pre- and post-meeting. This is a low cost to applicant, high impact process designed to provide valuable feedback and support. The BTR-NTA aims to help overcome barriers for applicants by highlighting potential pitfalls or risks, providing multi-disciplinary feedback on work to date and constructive guidance on next steps, and by strengthening international collaboration in the brain tumor field. Following the launch of the BTR-NTA program in 2023 and review of the first group of therapeutics and technologies, we report on our early learnings, impact, and how we hope to grow the program to help accelerate new brain tumor therapies globally.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Drug discovery,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Charlotte Kate Aitken<sup>1<\/sup>, Katie Bushby<sup>1<\/sup>, Petra Hamerlik<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicky Huskens<sup>1<\/sup>, Edward Kaye<sup>3<\/sup>, Dione Kobayashi<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Juanita Lopez<\/b><sup>5<\/sup>, Ryan Mathew<sup>6<\/sup>, John McCall<sup>7<\/sup>, Javad Nazarian<sup>8<\/sup>, Ruth Plummer<sup>9<\/sup>, Steven Pollard<sup>10<\/sup>, Ruman Rahman<sup>11<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission C.I.C., London, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Stoke Therapeutics, Bedford, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Mass General Brigham, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom,<sup>6<\/sup>University of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom,<sup>7<\/sup>University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI,<sup>8<\/sup>University Children’s Hospital,, Zurich, Switzerland,<sup>9<\/sup>Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom,<sup>10<\/sup>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom,<sup>11<\/sup>University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7f767cf-8645-4953-b34e-0c8a55f591bf","ControlNumber":"3034","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups, the Wilcoxon test to compare to baseline.<br \/>Results: ECU and PM54 caused TV shrinkage in UZLX-STS134, while TV in other groups grew significantly on day 16 (Table 1). VEH treatment led to the largest TV increase on day 16, compared to any treatment. PM54 treatment showed TV stabilization in UZLX-STS22_2, and significantly smaller tumors than VEH and TRA treated tumors (p&#60;0.05 and p&#60;0.01,<br \/>respectively).

The development of effective targeted therapy to prevent and treat metastasis has been challenging. Homologous Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are viable metastasis targets because they have a crucial role in the signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and migration, so dysregulation of these proteins leads to cancer progression and metastasis of diverse cancer types. Therefore, targeting these regulatory proteins results in anticancer and antimetastatic activity, as observed with our dual Rac\/Cdc42 inhibitor, MBQ-167, in triple-negative breast cancer. MBQ-167 has an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~100nM for Rac and Cdc42 activation inhibition and a GI<sub>50<\/sub> of 130nM. MBQ-167 inhibits the binding of guanine nucleotides to Rac and Cdc42 with similar efficacy. The purpose of this study was to identify MBQ-167 derivatives with similar or greater efficacy and specificity, with a range of inhibitory mechanisms, that may be specific to the different guanine nucleotide exchange factors expressed in distinct cancer cell types. Currently, over 30 different compounds with potential Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibitory activity are being evaluated. So far, some of the evaluated compounds have shown comparable GI<sub>50<\/sub> values to MBQ-167 in metastatic breast cancer cell lines. From this screening, CPV-337 was selected as a compound with a GI<sub>50<\/sub> of ~55nM and ~70% Rac activation inhibition at 50nM, therefore being 2X more effective than our leading compound MBQ-167. However, evaluation of CPV-337 in the viability of the MCF-10 non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line demonstrated a GI<sub>50<\/sub> of ~63nM, which is similar to that of breast cancer cells. Therefore, CPV-337 may have cytotoxic effects on breast cancer. We are continuing to screen the library of MBQ-167 derivatives in breast, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rac,GTPase,Breast cancer,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in a wide diversity of epithelial tumors, promoting cell proliferation and survival pathways. Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Trop2) is also expressed in a wide range of solid tumors and has been used as a transport gate for cytotoxic agents into cells in antibody-drug conjugate constructions for clinic applications. However, the approved Trop2 ADC, sacituzumab govitecan, only showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 17% and median OS of 9.5 months for lung cancers. In addition, both EGFR-ADC and Trop2-ADC had exhibited strong side effects in clinical trials due to their expression on some normal tissues, such as skin, mouth, eyes, etc. We generated bispecific Fab\/scFv antibodies targeting both TROP2 and EGFR using the knob-into-hole technology, which presumably have wider efficacy, less on-target toxicity in comparison to the ADCs constructed based on the fully individual EGFR and Trop2 IgG antibodies having strong affinity to either EGFR or Trop2 antigens. Indeed, many of generated anti-TROP2\/EGFR BsAbs showed strong binding activity in TROP2<sup>high<\/sup>EGFR<sup>high<\/sup> cells and demonstrated over 60% internalization rate within 60 min in vitro. The selected BsAbs were subsequently conjugated with tubulysin B analogs with varieties of peptidyl linkers to generate bispecific ADC (DXC024) candidates, two of which exhibited strong killing activity in A431, MDA-MB-468, Calu3, MCF-7 cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of single to ten digital pM. In vivo, they showed very good durable antitumor response at dose as low as 4.6 mg\/Kg for one injection in Calu3 (TROP2<sup>high<\/sup>EGFR<sup>moderate<\/sup>) xenograft model, and demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in comparison to those of the same payload conjugated to the monoclonal TROP2 or EGFR ADCs. These results indicated that DXC024 would be a promising ADC candidate for targeted treatment of highly either TROP2- or EGFR-expressing tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bispecific antibody,Solid tumors,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Jingjing Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Junxiang Jia<sup><\/sup>, Huihui Guo<sup><\/sup>, Xiangfei Kong<sup><\/sup>, Yong Du<sup><\/sup>, Zhicang Ye<sup><\/sup>, Lingli Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Yongxiang Chen<sup><\/sup>, Lu Bai<sup><\/sup>, Yunxia Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Juan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Wenjun Li<sup><\/sup>, Yuanyuan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Zhongliang Fan<sup><\/sup>, Mengmeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, Binbin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Meng Dai<sup><\/sup>, Fang Du<sup><\/sup>, Miaomiao Chen<sup><\/sup>, Zhixiang Guo<sup><\/sup>, Qingliang Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Robert Y.

It is difficult to diagnose and detect in the early stage, with low surgical resection rate and high recurrence and metastasis rate after surgery. At present, the clinical therapeutic strategy is extremely limited. The first-line Standard of Care (SOC) for unresectable pancreatic cancer is chemotherapy. The preferred regimen includes gemcitabine combined with albumin paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX (5-FU+Oxaliplatin+Irinotecan). Due to the limited long-term benefits and toxic side effects of chemotherapy, targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy has become a new therapeutic strategy. MUC1 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane mucin located on the lumen surface of epithelial cells. It can protect cells from extreme factors and plays an important role in tumor cell metabolism, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Previous studies have confirmed that MUC1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including pancreatic cancer, and is closely related to poor prognosis. DXC005 is a novel MUC1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), generated by conjugating a Tubulysin B analogue to a recombinant humanized anti-Muc1 monoclonal antibody. DXC005 is the first MUC1-ADC IND in China, and is currently in phase I clinical trials. Preclinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of DXC005 monotherapy (2.5 mg\/kg, 5 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg in one administration) in the HuPrime &#174; pancreatic cancer PDX model (PA1194). The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was 42.53 %, 70.77 %, and 95.58 %, respectively. We want to further clarify whether DXC005 combined with chemotherapeutic drug Gemcitabine can ensure or even improve the efficacy while reducing the dosage of Gemcitabine. In PA1194 xenograft model, DXC005 (3 mg\/kg or 6 mg\/kg) in combination with Gemcitabine (10 mg\/kg) showed significant anti-tumor efficacy with 58.77% and 93.17% TGIs, respectively. In contrast, the treatment with 10 mg\/kg of Gemcitabine alone exhibited much less TGI. Furthermore, complete response (CR) was observed in some animals after treatment with DXC005 (6 mg\/kg) plus Gemcitabine (10 mg\/kg). All groups of treatment are tolerated well, no abnormal animal behavior and body weight loss were observed in the study. The above results concluded that DXC005 combined with Gemcitabine can achieve synergistic effect even with reduced dose of Gemcitabine, which will serve as a support for synergistic application in clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Pancreatic cancer,MUC1,Gemcitabine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Xiaobo Cai<sup><\/sup>, Min Cao<sup><\/sup>, Huihui Guo<sup><\/sup>, Qingliang Yang<sup><\/sup>, Yongxiang Chen<sup><\/sup>, Xiangfei Kong<sup><\/sup>, Yong Du<sup><\/sup>, <b>Zhicang Ye<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhixiang Guo<sup><\/sup>, Lingli Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Lu Bai<sup><\/sup>, Junxiang Jia<sup><\/sup>, Yunxia Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wenjun Li<sup><\/sup>, Yuanyuan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Zhongliang Fan<sup><\/sup>, Binbin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yanlei Yang<sup><\/sup>, Meng Dai<sup><\/sup>, Robert Y.

It is overexpressed in almost all neuroblastomas, 95% of small cell lung cancers and 78% of multiple myeloma patients<sup> [1]<\/sup>, whereas CD56 is less frequently or less abundantly expressed in normal tissues, making it a potential target for tumor therapy. So far, no CD56-targeting ADCs have entered late-stage clinical trials.DXC006 is an antibody-drug conjugate of a humanized anti-CD56 antibody (DXA006) linked to the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT113 through a cleavable peptidyl linker and CROSSCONJU&#8482; technology. The pharmacologic activity and mechanism of action of DXC006 were investigated in several human cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models. Pharmacokinetic and safety profiles were also assessed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys.DXC006 binds specifically to CD56 and internalizes into tumor cells, after intracellular trafficking to lysosome and CPT113 releasing, induces DNA damage. In vitro cell based assays showed that DXC006 remarkably inhibited the cell growth of CD56-positive cell lines of IMR-32 (neuroblastoma), NCI-H526 (small cell lung cancer), and NCI-H929 (multiple myeloma), with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.0046~0.061 nmol\/L. Although DXC006 also binds to CD56 expressed NK cells, we found that the inhibition of DXC006 to human NK cells was much less effective, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> higher than 675 nmol\/L, which is ten thousand-folds less potent than that of targeted abnormal cells. In vivo, DXC006 demonstrated good durable antitumor activities in three CD56-positive xenograft models of IMR-32, NCI-H526 and NCI-H929 cell lines, with a single dose of 2 mg\/Kg, 3 mg\/Kg, and 5 mg\/Kg, respectively. No animal death or moribund outcome was observed in two months during preclinical safety studies in 150 mg\/Kg Q2W dosed rats. For cynomolgus monkeys, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of DXC006 was 20 mg\/Kg, in Q2W, four times of administration.

It is a receptor for Wnt family signaling molecules Wnt5a, and plays a critical role in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Being an oncofetal protein, ROR1 exhibits limited expression in most normal tissues. However, it is abnormally expressed in various hematological and solid cancers, contributing to the development and progression of many types of cancer. Due to its overexpression in cancer, ROR1 presents as a highly attractive target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. The current clinical results of ROR1 ADCs have been promising in treating patients with relapsed and\/or refractory (R\/R) hematologic malignancies.<br \/>BR111 is anti-ROR1 ADC that consists of a biparatopic antibody, stably conjugated to an antimitotic agent. The biparatopic antibodies demonstrate superior binding affinity to ROR1-expressing cancer cells compared to single epitope antibodies. Notably, our unique and innovative conjugation platform CysX&#8482;, not only prevents payload detachment during circulation and reducing the off-target toxicity, but also enables a uniformed drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.<br \/>Both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>In vivo<\/i> studies have highlighted the remarkable antitumor activity of BR111. Preclinical data have shown great safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys. BR111 demonstrated a wider therapeutic window for cancer treatment, outperforming the lead anti-ROR1 ADC currently in phase II\/IIl trial. The promising outcome holds great potential as a therapeutic treatment for hematological and solid cancers, offering a better safety profile. BR111 has great potential in further clinical evaluations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),ROR1,Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis have revealed escalated LIV-1 expression in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), hormone-treated tumors (both primary and metastatic sites) as well as ER-\/PR-\/Her2- (triple-negative) breast cancers. Notably, healthy human tissues exhibit limited LIV-1 expression, primarily in hormone regulated organs (prostate, uterus, and breast). The escalated expression of LIV-1 in breast and prostate cancer, as well as melanoma and other tumors, positions LIV-1 as an excellent target for ADC therapeutics.<br \/>BRY812 is a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-conjugated humanized IgG1 ADC against LIV-1. With Bioray&#8217;s irreversible conjugation method CysLink<sup>TM<\/sup>, BRY812 enables superior <i>in vivo<\/i> stability and eliminates off-target payload migration. The PK studies in rat and monkey demonstrated that the free MMAE released from ADC is 1 to 2 logs lower compared with approved ADCs prepared by the standard conjugation method. BRY812 is well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with repeated doses. With best-in-class anti-tumor efficacy in various models, BRY812 demonstrated a wider therapeutic window for cancer treatment. BRY812 is currently in Phase Ia dose escalation stage clinical trial to explore the maximum tolerate dosage (MTD) from 0.25 to 3.6 mg\/kg Q3W in patients with advanced malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.
