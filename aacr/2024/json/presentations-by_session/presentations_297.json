[{"Abstract":"Background: Resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PI) bortezomib (BTZ) and carfilzomib (CFZ) is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of multiple myeloma (MM); thus, identification of novel therapeutic options is an unmet medical need. ALK inhibitors have been shown to exhibit anti-MM activity in monotherapy or in combination with CFZ. Our data showed that MM cells were negative for ALK; thus, we aimed to identify the mechanism of action of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib in MM cells and the mechanism of synergy between ceritinib and CFZ.<br \/>Methods: A set of PI-na&#239;ve and PI-resistant MM cells was used in this study. Genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9-based screening using the Brunello library was performed in the AMO-1 cell line. Kinase inhibitor selectivity data were retrieved from ChEMBL, v30 database. RNA sequencing was used to determine expression changes after treatment, and RNA-seq data from patients included in the CoMMpass study were analyzed. Western blotting was performed to assess the levels of total and phosphorylated protein. Unbiased LC-MS\/MS was performed to determine the effects of ceritinib and CFZ on the intracellular metabolites. An <i>in vivo <\/i>mouse model based on the orthotopic injection of AMO-BTZ cells into the femur of NSG mice was used to determine the effect of the drug combination <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Among approved ALK inhibitors, ceritinib has been identified as the most synergistic cytotoxic combination with CFZ in PI-na&#239;ve and PI-resistant MM cells. An in silico search of the ChEMBL database identified InsR and IGF1R as receptor tyrosine kinase that are inhibited by ceritinib. PI-na&#239;ve, PI-resistant cell lines, as well as MM patients were negative for ALK, but positive for InsR and IGF1R expression. CRISPR\/Cas9-screening identified genes involved in the negative regulation of mTORC signaling (DDIT4, NPRL2\/3, TSC1\/2) and the transcription factor FOXO1 as the major resistance candidates to ceritinib. Subsequently, FOXO1 inhibition using a selective chemical inhibitor protected the cells from ceritinib-induced cytotoxicity. Next, ceritinib inhibited mTORC signaling and induced the expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest, which are downstream of FOXO1. Likewise, ceritinib, by targeting the InsR\/IGF1R, impaired purine-pyrimidine and amino acid homeostasis, suggesting metabolic and proliferation shut-down and amino acid starvation due to downstream mTORC and Akt inhibition and FOXO1 induction. The combination of ceritinib and CFZ was superior to CFZ in PI-resistant MM in vivo and showed strong synergistic cytotoxicity in primary cells from MM patients progressing under or after PI-containing therapy.<br \/>Conclusion<u>:<\/u> Ceritinib, an FDA-approved drug, overcomes PI resistance in MM by inhibiting InsR\/IGF1R and downstream Akt signaling. Therefore, ceritinib is a promising treatment option for PI-resistant MM.<br \/>Supported by the project National Institute for Cancer Research (Programme EXCELES, ID Project No. LX22NPO5102) - Funded by the European Union - Next Generation EU.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug synergy,Proteasome inhibitors,Multiple myeloma,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Hence, developing strategies to overcome such chemoresistance is essential. Teriflunomide, an active metabolite of leflunomide, has been widely utilized in managing autoimmune disorders, and emerging evidence suggests that it can augment the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer. We investigated the therapeutic effect of teriflunomide in overcoming resistance to Gemcitabine-based therapy in PC.<br \/>Methods: We performed docking and genomewide transcriptomic profiling analyses to identify therapeutic targets of Teriflunomide associated with Gemcitabine resistance (Gem-R) in PC. Subsequently, we analyzed the TCGA dataset to determine the prognostic significance of candidate genes in PC patients. A series of experiments were performed in PC cells, and the key findings were validated in patient-derived 3D organoids and a Gem-R Mia-PaCa2 xenograft model.<br \/>Results: Docking and transcriptomic profiling studies identified GSK3&#946;, MAPK8, and MAPK9 as potential targets of Teriflunomide, which were significantly upregulated in Gem-R cell lines (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05). GSK3&#946; was independently associated with poor overall and disease-free survival in PC patients. Combined Teriflunomide and Gemcitabine treatment exhibited superior synergistic anti-tumor potential, as evidenced by reducing PC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, invasion, and migration. The combined treatment with Teriflunomide and Gemcitabine primarily inhibited GSK3&#946; phosphorylation, resulting in the silencing of the downstream AKT\/mTOR pathway. Lentiviral-based silencing of GSK3&#946; inhibited the AKT\/mTOR pathway and reduced the IC50s of Gemcitabine in PC cells. Furthermore, co-administrating both drugs to Gem-R Mia-PaCa-2 xenograft mice significantly reduced tumor growth rates and volumes. These findings were recapitulated in patient-derived 3D-organoids, where the combined treatment resulted in fewer and smaller organoids vs. each drug individually (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: We provide novel evidence that Teriflunomide helps overcome resistance to Gemcitabine by inhibiting the GSK3&#946;\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, which could improve treatment outcomes in PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Gemcitabine,Pancreatic cancer,Teriflunomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

ABCB1 is one such transporter that actively pumps out chemotherapeutic drugs and it is one of the reasons for multidrug resistance (MDR). In the last few years, activation of p53 has been targeted as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of cancers. Siremadlin (NVP-HDM201) is a potent and selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction. The objective of this study was to explore the ability of HDM201 to reverse tumor MDR attributable to overexpression of ABC transporters. According to our findings, HDM201 significantly increased the sensitivity of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to ABCB1 substrates, such as colchicine and doxorubicin. We found that HDM201 reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR by interacting with ABCB1 and blocking its function without affecting the expression and cellular localization of ABCB1. Moreover, HDM201 promoted the accumulation of paclitaxel in cell lines that overexpress ABCB1. At both high and low doses, HDM201 increased the ATPase activity of ABCB1. The computational support for the cross-reactivity of this p53 inhibitor with human ABCB1 comes from docking simulation results that align with the binding conformation of HDM201 within the vast cavity of the transmembrane region of ABCB1. In conclusion, by blocking the transport function of ABCB1, HDM201 can reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR <i>in vitro<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multidrug resistance,P-glycoprotein,ABC transporters,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, after various periods of therapeutic intervention, most patients eventually acquire resistance to lazertinib. A potential therapeutic approach to address this clinical issue is to overcome the initial drug resistance mechanism. To determine the underlying adaptive lazertinib resistance mechanisms, we evaluated signal transduction, cell apoptosis, and drug sensitivity in mutant EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells treated with lazertinib. The siRNA screening assay demonstrated that AXL knockdown significantly inhibited cell viability in the presence of lazertinib, indicating that AXL activation contributes to lazertinib resistance. However, long-term culture with a combination of lazertinib and AXL inhibitors eventually led to the proliferation of residual cells and increased MCL-1 expression, which was mediated by the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor YAP. Cell-based assays showed that triple therapy with an MCL-1 or YAP inhibitor, in combination with EGFR-TKI lazertinib, an AXL inhibitor, significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. These results demonstrate that AXL and YAP\/MCL-1 signals contribute to the adaptive lazertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, suggesting that the initial dual inhibition of AXL and YAP\/MCL-1 might be highly effective in eliminating lazertinib-resistant cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Drug resistance,Axl,Mcl-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

However, drug resistance is severely limiting its clinical efficacy. Aberrant MET activation is an important mechanism causing osimertinib resistance. There is no effective therapeutic option after osimertinib failure. This study investigated the repurposing of non-oncology MET inhibiting drug to overcome osimertinib resistance.<br \/>Method: A few clinically-approved drugs with putative MET inhibitory effects were identified by a computational drug repurposing tool called &#8220;DRAR-CPI&#8221; via analysis of the chemical-protein interactome of known MET inhibitors (crizotinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and tivantinib). Fexofenadine (FEX), originally indicated for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, was chosen for detailed investigation in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines that exhibit aberrant MET activation with\/without other EGFR-dependent osimertinib resistance mechanisms. The selectivity of kinase inhibition by FEX was evaluated by a KINOME profiling assay against a panel of human protein kinases. Western blot analysis was conducted to examine the activation status of Met and EGFR downstream signaling. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) triggered by the most promising repurposed drug, presumably contributing to osimertinib resistance circumvention. Sulforhodamine B assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The circumvention of osimertinib resistance by FEX was further verified in a patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) from an advanced-stage osimertinib-refractory NSCLC patient.<br \/>Result: FEX was found to inhibit recombinant MET kinase in cell-free assays in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also inhibited MET phosphorylation and other downstream signaling molecules in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR T790M+MET amplification or EGFR T790M loss+MET amplification. KINOME profiling revealed a similar kinase inhibition profile between FEX and cabozantinib using Spearman rank order correlation analysis. Among the tested osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines, FEX showed the highest effectiveness in potentiating the anticancer effect of osimertinib in H820 cells (having MET amplification &#38; EGFR T790M mutation). Transcriptome profiling analysis in H820 cells before and after FEX treatment revealed that the majority of DEGs were enriched in EMT-related biological processes and pathways. FEX was further shown to significantly potentiate the antitumor effect of osimertinib in a drug refractory PDX model, without inducing notable weight loss in the animals.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings advocate the clinical evaluation of repurposing FEX to overcome osimertinib resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osimertinib,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

One resistance mechanism involves cross talk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways, resulting in increased ER signaling and tumor proliferation. This is mitigated by mTOR inhibition as demonstrated by improved outcomes with exemestane plus the mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) everolimus in pts with HR+ advanced BC. While PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki [e.g. alpelisib]) are efficacious in pts with HR+, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutated BC, resistance can occur due to acquired genomic alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Combination therapy that targets a critical downstream node, mTOR, could delay or overcome acquired resistance due to activation of upstream components of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. <i>nab<\/i>-Sirolimus is an intravenously administered, albumin-bound nanoparticle form of the mTORi sirolimus, with significantly greater tumor accumulation, mTOR target suppression, and improved antitumor effects than oral mTORis in nonclinical tumor models.

Results were similar with alpelisib (1 uM) plus <i>nab<\/i>-sirolimus (20 or 80 nM).

Globally, liver cancer is one of the most frequent fatal malignancies; in the United States, liver cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. Generally, there is a poor prognosis for liver cancer. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the best available treatment options. This research aims to provide an alternative treatment option with drugs that specifically attack liver cancer cells. Protein Kinase C (PKCs) are signaling molecules that have been reported to be associated with multiple cellular processes and cancer. PKC activity reportedly is elevated in colorectal cancer cells and metastasizes to the liver. 5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA-1S) is a PKC-&#953; specific inhibitor we have previously shown to be effective against some cancer cell lines by decreasing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of ICA-1S against liver cancer cell lines; HEPG2 and PLC5\/PRF\/5. An equal number of HEPG2 and PLC5\/PRF\/5 cell lines were seeded into 6 well plates, treated with different concentrations (0.1&#181;M, 0.5&#181;M, 1&#181;M, 5&#181;M, and 10&#181;M) of ICA-1s every 24 hours for three days after which the media was discarded, and cells were counted. The percentage inhibition of ICA-1S on HEPG2 and PLC5\/PRF\/5 cell lines was calculated. To investigate the resistance inflection, the proliferation assay was also conducted with a combination of an efflux pump inhibitor, Elacridar(10&#181;M), and different concentrations (0.1&#181;M to 10&#181;M) of ICA-1S. The expression of PKC-&#953; was investigated across all treatments. The dose-response result for treatment with ICA-1S for both HEPG2 and PLC5\/PRF\/5 cell lines showed a resistance inflection point at 0.5&#181;M and 1&#181;M, where the proliferation rate of the cells declined by 50% and 79% for HEPG2, and 41% and 54% for PLC5\/PRF\/5 respectively; beyond these points, the cell proliferation rate significantly rises. The results of dose-response for treatment with a combination of ICA-1S and Elacridar showed a continuous decline in cell proliferation rate up to 78% and 84% for HEPG2 and PLC5\/PRF\/5 respectively as the concentrations of ICA-1S increased from 0.1&#181;M to 10&#181;M. The PKC-&#953; level was downregulated in the combination treatment. We have shown in this study that liver cancer cells exhibit resistance to PKC inhibitor, ICA-1S, at high concentrations. This resistance inflection may be due to several factors including the activation of drug-efflux proteins. Thus, we proved that the introduction of an efflux pump inhibitor, Elacridar, sensitizes the liver cancer cells to ICA-1S, offsets the resistance of the liver cancer cells to ICA-1S at high concentrations, and enables ICA-1S to be effective in downregulating PKC-&#953; and decreasing cell growth of liver cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C,Multidrug resistance,Drug sensitivity,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We and others reported that the aberrant expression of neurogenic locus Notch homolog protein 1 (Notch1) serves as a molecular signature for TNBC. Hence, we postulated that pharmacologically targeting Notch1 in conjunction with a standard chemotherapeutic agent (Doxorubicin: DXR) may completely eradicate TNBC growth and overcome systemic and debilitating toxicity. Hence, this study aims to elucidate the role of our recently discovered notch1 inhibitor ASR490 and its ability to chemosensitize TNBC without significant systemic toxicity.<br \/>In our results, pretreatment of 1\/<sub>10<\/sub><sup>th<\/sup> of the <i>inhibitory concentration of <\/i>ASR490 combined with 1\/<sub>10<\/sub><sup>th<\/sup> or 1\/<sub>20th <\/sub>of DXR significantly inhibited the growth of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT549). Notably, DXR treatment induced Notch1 activation which led to chemoresistance in TNBC; however, co-treatment with the Notch1 inhibitor ASR490, led to the downregulation of Notch1 activation and eradication of the cell viability and clonogenicity of the TNBC cells. Further, molecular analysis suggested that pretreatment of 1\/10th of ASR490 facilitates DXR-mediated sensitivity, by inhibiting the DNA repair pathway and upregulating (cleaved) caspase 3, (cleaved) caspase-9 and poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated apoptosis. Similarly, the combination effectively blocked the epithelial and mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators and suppressed metastatic properties of MDA-MB231 and BT-549 cells. Moreover, combining ASR490(1\/<sub>10<\/sub>th) and DXR (1\/<sub>20<\/sub>th) significantly eradicated xenotransplanted TNBC tumors compared to ASR490 or DXR alone. In addition to being effective at inhibiting tumor growth, the significantly lower dose requirements of DXR and ASR490 in combination makes it a highly safe therapeutic modality. These findings suggest that aberrant activation of Notch1 is responsible for TNBC chemoresistance and concomitantly inhibiting Notch1 activation is an effective therapeutic strategy to restore chemosensitivity in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Chemosensitization,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Trabectedin (ET) is a marine drug able to displace FUS-DDTI3 from the promoters of its target genes, restoring adipogenesis and leading to long-lasting clinical responses in MLS patients. However, after prolonged treatments with ET, resistance occurs, and no further therapies are available. Recent studies indicate that the PPAR&#947; agonist pioglitazone (PIO) reactivates adipocytic differentiation in MLS preclinical models resistant to ET, restoring treatment efficacy. While the combination of ET and PIO is being studied clinically, our goal here is to further potentiate the stimulation of adipocytic differentiation to obtain even better tumor growth inhibition. Since the PPAR&#947; and the RXR heterodimerize, and the heterodimer is permissive, we will exploit this property by combining PIO with the RXR agonist IRX4204.<b><\/b> The DL221 human MLS cell line was treated with PIO or IRX4204. To assess adipocytic differentiation, cells were stained with LD540 and DAPI for fluorescence microscopy. FABP4 and ADIPOQ expression was measured using RT-PCR. Drug efficacy and tolerability were evaluated in MLS patient-derived xenografts ML017 (sensitive) and ML017\/ET (trabectedin-resistant). Mice were randomized to receive PIO (150 mg\/kg p.o. qdx28), ET (0.15 mg\/kg i.v. q14dx2), IRX4204 (10 mg\/kg i.p. qdx28), or their combinations.<b> <\/b> PIO and IRX4204 induced mature adipocyte-like morphological alterations and lipid droplet accumulation in the DL221 cell cytoplasm, and when PIO and IRX4204 were combined, these effects were more evident.

Novel therapeutics, such as Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) ligand therapy, are emerging as effective treatment strategies for metastatic prostate cancer. However, most men succumb to Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) due to treatment resistance. MAGMAS, a 13.8 kDa mitochondrial protein, imports nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. MAGMAS is overexpressed in several aggressive tumors, such as breast cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer. When overexpressed, MAGMAS plays a role as a cytoprotective protein by acting as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger that maintains sufficient ROS levels to promote cell proliferation but below the threshold levels that could lead to apoptosis. This study was designed to investigate the pro-survival and therapy-resistance functions of MAGMAS in treatment-resistant PCa cells. Predictively, we observed that the docetaxel (DTX)-resistant PC3-DR and DU145-DR PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MAGMAS compared to their drug-sensitive parental cell lines. We hypothesized that inhibiting Magmas reduces the aggressive properties of highly proliferative DTX-resistant metastatic PCa cell lines and re-sensitizes them to DTX. MAGMAS knockdown in DTX-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells in the presence of increasing DTX treatments enhanced sensitivity to DTX. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of MAGMAS with the novel BT#9 inhibitor in combination with increasing DTX concentrations also enhanced sensitivity to DTX in these cell lines. Additional studies using cell migration\/invasion assays and tumor-sphere formation assays are underway to further establish MAGMAS as a potential therapeutic target to attenuate the aggressive properties of chemo-resistant PCa cells. Lastly, we will investigate the diagnostic potential of MAGMAS as a biomarker for advanced PCa and BT#9 as an imaging\/therapeutic-specific agent for treatment-resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Chemoresistance,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We developed a unique gene signature based on the transcriptomic changes following TAZ or YAP1 depletion. Expression of active TAZ was sufficient to mediate tolerance to BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. In WM983B cells, depletion of TAZ significantly reduced cell growth, whereas YAP1 knockdown resulted in little to no effect.

To treating PC patients, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is common and effective for PC, acquired gemcitabine resistance is one of the major reasons for treatment failure. Therefore, there is a need to suggest effective strategies and novel therapeutic approach for gemcitabine-resistant PC. Protein Kinase C &#946;1 (PKC &#946;1) is known as involved in multiple signal transduction related to oncogenic functions in cancer. We suggested that PKC &#946; as one of the novel biomarker of drug resistance and further investigated the molecular mechanism. Among the natural products as small molecule inhibitor, we found that evodiamine has potent antitumor activity and various biological activities. Based on various biological activities of evodiamine, the scaffold was synthesized and investigated for antiproliferative and antitumor activities against gemcitabine resistant PANC-1 (PANC-GR) cells. Also, target validation experiment was employed to elucidate the molecular mechanism and verifying the target to overcoming gemcitabine resistance. Mechanistically, evodiamine derivatives have shown that inhibition of PKC &#946;1 can modulate the proliferation of PANC-GR cells and exhibited tumor growth inhibitory activity in xenograft mouse model.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Keywords:<\/b> Pancreatic cancer cell, Gemcitabine resistance, Protein Kinase C &#946;1 (PKC &#946;1), Molecular mechanism<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> <i>This research was supported by the<\/i><i> <\/i><i>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (RS-2023-00273240).<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Molecular targets,Protein kinase C,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

EGFR-targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a standard of care for those patients who developed metastatic or recurrent diseases. However, despite having an 80% initial response rate, most patients had partial tumor regression and their disease would progress when acquired resistance emerges. Thus, developing more effective treatment is an unmet need. The clinical response of these patients can be recapitulated in mouse models of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor bearing sensitizing EGFR mutations. In this study, treating established PDX tumors with osimertinib, a third generation EGFR TKI, induced partial tumor regression (50% to 70% size reduction from baseline) followed by progression with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 26 to 28 days. Interestingly, co-administering an antibody against hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) with osimertinib resulted in enhanced tumor regression (98% to 100% size reduction from baseline) which translated into significantly extended animal survival with a median PFS of 103 or 135 days. Immunohistochemical and western blot examination of tumors collected at different treatment timepoints indicated that AKT\/mTOR and MAPK pathways were reactivated after initial suppression in TKI monotherapy arm despite persistent EGFR inhibition. Since AKT\/mTOR and MAPK pathways are key survival and proliferative signaling pathways, their reactivation can promote TKI tolerance of tumor cells and the emergence of TKI resistance. However, blocking HDGF attenuated the reactivation of these pathways which could partially explain the enhanced efficacy of osimertinib plus anti-HDGF antibody combination treatment seen in this study. Our results suggest tumor-derived HDGF could play a crucial role in the rise of acquired resistance to osimertinib. Identifying the exact cells and molecular pathways utilized by HDGF to promote tumor cell tolerance to TKI will help us understand how TKI sensitive tumor cells survive EGFR blockade and emerge as resistant cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Lung cancer: non-small cell,Antibody,Hepatoma-derived growth factor ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Temozolomide (TMZ) has been the basis for current standard of care and represents the control-arm in GBM trials. Despite the use of TMZ having shown promising results in improving patient survival, drug resistance and tumor relapse is almost inevitable. Current literature has provided strong evidence on autophagy modulation as an adjuvant therapy to cytotoxic treatments. By using in vitro and in vivo GBM models, combination regimen with TMZ and an autophagy activator significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect in tumors that were resistant to chemotherapy. Combined treatment readily induced a mortal autophagy flux in chemo-resistant GBM cells resulted from its high intrinsic autophagy. Our findings suggest that treatment resistant tumors are more sensitive to autophagy activation when compared to treatment-naive tumors. As they often exhibit higher basal level of autophagy after long-term chemotherapy, a mortal autophagy flux can be readily achieved. In conclusion, combination therapy of a cytotoxic drug with autophagy modulator is emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy in the adjuvant setting for cancer patients.<sup> <\/sup>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Chemoresistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

These cancers remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women globally. This has fostered a major effort to discover actionable molecular targets to treat these patients. Polo-like Kinase (PLK1) is one of these molecular targets that are under comprehensive investigation for the treatment of such tumors. However, its role in the pathogenesis of BC from Middle Eastern ethnicity has not been explored. Therefore, we examined the expression of PLK1 protein in a large cohort of more than 1500 Middle Eastern ethnicity BC by immunohistochemistry. Correlation with clinico-pathological parameters and the prognosis was performed. PLK1 overexpression was observed in 27.4% of all BC and was significantly associated with aggressive clinico-pathological markers. The antitumor effect of PLK1 and PARP inhibitors either alone or in combination was tested in two BRCA mutated, and one BRCA proficient TNBC cell lines. We showed that combined inhibition significantly reduced cell survival and induced apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, our data suggest that PLK1 inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in TNBC cell lines. These findings would pave the way to explore the future use of PLK1 inhibitors in the clinical setting of PARPi-resistant patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Polo-like kinase,PARP,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Thus, targeting nucleotide metabolism, specifically de novo<i> <\/i>nucleotide biosynthesis, is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Hyperactivation of Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase (CAD), a key enzyme catalyzing the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, is a common event in tumors and has been associated with chemoresistance in tumors. Our analysis, using TCGA data, revealed that increased expression of CAD is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated significant benefits to patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations; however, acquired resistance limits their long-term efficacy. Therefore, it remains urgent to discover the underlying mechanisms for discovering novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming TKI resistance. Our previous findings demonstrated that blockade of S6K1 overcomes acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. It was reported that S6K1 is involved in de novo<i> <\/i>pyrimidine biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether CAD mediates S6K1-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry analysis on a tissue microarray of lung adenocarcinoma tissues indicated that increased co-expression of p-CAD and S6K1 proteins is associated with clinicopathological parameters and poor survival outcomes. Our in vitro results showed an increased expression level of CAD and p-CAD proteins in TKI-resistant cells compared with parental cells upon TKI treatment. Knockdown of CAD by siRNA led to sensitizing TKI-resistant cells to osimertinib, as indicated by BrdU cell proliferation assay. Inhibition of S6K1 by a siRNA or specific inhibitors PF-470867 and LY2584702 effectively reduced the phosphorylation levels of CAD protein in TKI-resistant cells, suggesting that S6K1 may serve as an upstream regulator of CAD for TKI resistance. The String database predicted a protein-protein interaction between S6K1 and CAD. Indeed, our co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) results revealed a direct association between S6K1 and CAD proteins. Importantly, TKI treatment enhanced the binding between S6K1 and CAD. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that CAD may mediate S6K1-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Our ongoing and future work will assess whether inhibition of CAD sensitizes resistant cells to TKI <i>in vivo<\/i> and elucidate the associated mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,S6 Kinase,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Temozolomide-sensitive and temozolomide-resistant U87 and U251 GBM human cell lines were previously established. Temozolomide-resistant cells were maintained in low-dose temozolomide. Here, we investigate whether Hippo signaling contributes to temozolomide chemoresistance. By modulating the Hippo signaling pathway through YAP gene knockdown, the outcome on cell proliferation was studied by cell viability assay (in vitro) and mouse orthotopic xenograft (in vivo). Finally, the therapeutic effect of YAP inhibitor is studied in vitro and in vivo respectively. Our data showed that YAP is overexpressed in temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cells. Nuclear translocation of YAP (which becomes its active state) is increased in temozolomide-resistant cells. In fact, YAP inhibition show decreased cell viability and higher susceptibility to temozolomide. In addition, mice with tumor injection of the YAP knockdown cells reduced tumor size with temozolomide treatment. Similarly, YAP inhibitor resensitizes temozolomide-resistant cells to temozolomide. Combinational treatment of YAP inhibitor and temozolomide is effective in shrinking tumor size in mouse xenograft models. In conclusion, our data suggest dysregulated Hippo signaling pathway contributes to temozolomide chemoresistance, thus targeting the Hippo signaling pathway resensitizes GBM cells to temozolomide.

While HGSOC usually responds to initial treatment, most cases eventually relapse and develop platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). The molecular definition of PROC is still unclear, and overcoming PROC has been the biggest challenges. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have an essential role in cell-to-cell communication within both the primary and distant microenvironments. In this study. we aimed to identify molecular mechanisms of PROC via EVs to suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Platinum responses were categorized by primary treatment-free interval of platinum less than 6 months as PROC, and more than 36 months as platinum good response. Ascites and tumor tissues have been collected prior to initial chemotherapy in patients with HGSOC for analysis according to platinum response. mRNA sequencing in tumor tissues identified significantly upregulated JAK\/STAT pathways in PROC. The JAK\/STAT family was highly expressed in PROC than the good response group, and also increased than adjusted normal ovaries and fallopian tubes. In addition, PROC cell lines and PROC patient-derived xenograft model tumor tissues showed high JAK expression. Small RNA sequencing for HGSOC tissues and ascites-EVs revealed that miR-135a-5p and miR-221-5p were highly expressed in both PROC tissues and ascites, and the expression of the two miRNAs had a positive correlation between tissues and ascites. Overexpression of the two miRNAs in HGSOC cell lines resulted in higher JAK family expression and resistance to cisplatin. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) had equivalent efficacy for platinum-sensitive\/resistant HGSOC cell lines and JAKi highly suppress tumor growth in the PROC mouse model. In addition, suppression of JAK family expression in PROC cell lines significantly increased sensitivity to cisplatin. JAKi also had a synergistic effect with cisplatin for PROC cell lines. IPA analyses in mRNA sequencing in tumor tissues, TGF-&#946; was highly expressed in upstream regulators in PROC, and TGF-&#946; stimulation resulted in the upregulation of the two miRNAs in mesothelial cells, but not in HGSOC cell lines and fibroblasts. In summary, we here demonstrate novel molecular mechanisms of PROC via EVs and provided the rationale for JAK-targeted therapy for PROC. EV-miRNAs can regulate the PROC activated JAK\/STAT pathway and can be diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for PROC definition or JAKi indications, suggesting that patient stratification in precision medicine for initial treatment of HGSOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Extracellular vesicles,Drug resistance,JAK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.
