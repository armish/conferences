[{"Abstract":"This study addresses the current lack of small molecules targeting SOX2, a pivotal protein in cancer, through an examination of the effectiveness of FDA-approved drugs and proteasome inhibitors. Building on prior research demonstrating the proteasome inhibitor CFZ's capacity to diminish the expression of ITGB4 and PXN in LUAD effectively, our investigation highlights CFZ and IXA as potent inhibitors at nanomolar concentrations. Notably, CFZ treatment enhances sensitivity to cisplatin by suppressing the expression of ITGB4 and the stemness-associated gene SOX2.At a mechanistic level, CFZ hinders histone acetylation at the SOX2 promoter site, leading to rapid and specific downregulation. RNA-seq analysis of COH2 cells treated with CFZ unveils substantial downregulation of genes related to transcription and DNA binding. Z score analysis further reveals a noteworthy inhibition of key transcription factors (TFs), including SOX2, NANOG, POU5F1, SALL4, and KLF4. This TF inhibition extends to neuroendocrine cell lines, identifying 16 overlapping targets of SOX2 associated with stemness. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for targeting cisplatin-resistant cancer stem cells across various cancer types. Moreover, the study proposes a synergistic effect of cisplatin and CFZ in mitigating the growth of neuroendocrine phenotype, SCLC. Given the limited medical options currently available for this phenotype, this insight holds particular significance. In conclusion, our study unveils CFZ as a potent transcriptional suppressor of SOX2, providing a novel strategy to sensitize cisplatin-resistant cancer stem cells. The results underscore the interplay of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms in drug resistance, emphasizing the significance of repurposing drugs for other indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Drug resistance,Proteasome inhibitors,SOX2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

As a major downstream effector, the transcription factor TEAD is activated by forming a complex with YAP\/TAZ. Hippo pathway aberrations leading to TEAD activation have been reported in many cancers. Inhibiting TEAD function by directly blocking the palmitoylation pocket of TEAD is a potential therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Betta Pharma has discovered a selective, covalent and irreversible TEAD inhibitor known as BPI-460372. The discovery of BPI-460372 was first reported in AACR 2023. Here we present additional preclinical and clinical data characterizing BPI-460372 as a promising candidate drug. In the dose-escalating part of the Phase &#921; study, the exposure of BPI-460372 increased proportionally over 10 to 80 mg dose range after oral administration and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with a clearance rate suitable for once-daily dosing. The compound is generally well tolerated, with no drug-related Grade &#8805;3 adverse event observed. Remarkably, we have not seen renal toxicities that was perceived as a potential risk associated with certain TEAD inhibitors. Preliminary efficacy was observed in a few subjects. In preclinical studies, we found that intermittent dosing schedule of 3 days on\/4 days off, compared with continuous dosing at equivalent weekly exposure, can ameliorate kidney damage and improve early renal injury biomarkers while maintaining anti-<br \/>tumor activity. Thus, alternative dosing schedule could further improve the therapeutic window and enable combination studies in clinical development. Collectively, these results support further development of BPI-460372 for the treatment of cancers harboring Hippo pathway alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"X.

Exemestane (Aromasin<sup>&#8482;<\/sup>) is currently the only steroidal aromatase inactivator widely used in clinical routine treatment of ER+ breast cancer in all phases of the disease in a global perspective. However, the complex mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects, besides being an aromatase inhibitor, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed a combination of human samples and in vitro data to unveil a compelling insight: Exemestane (EXE) and its primary metabolite, 17&#946;-hydroxyexemestane (HEXE), exhibit potent inhibitory effects on tumor growth when present together in patient serum. Our biochemical analysis establishes a critical threshold&#8212;20% HEXE metabolite of the total EXE in patient serum&#8212;to trigger a tumor growth inhibition exceeding 90%, as evidenced by Ki67 staining. Mechanistically, our data reveals that both HEXE and EXE bind to the Androgen Receptor (AR), triggering a synergistic activation that induces a transcriptional program leading to cell death while diminishing the intracellular signaling activated by the oncogene Ras. Notably, patients with tumors characterized by a minimum of 20% AR+ epithelial cancer cells stand to benefit the most from exemestane and HEXE. Intriguingly, the binding of AR to chromatin in tumors gives rise to a molecular signature capable of distinguishing responsive from non-responsive patients to both EXE and HEXE. Collectively, our findings elucidate a dual therapeutic role for Exemestane in selected patients: it not only restrains estrogen-driven proliferation by estrogen suppression but also stimulates cell death by establishing a specific interactome with the AR at the genomic level. These insights suggest that both EXE and HEXE are necessary to achieve the best therapeutic effects in ER+\/AR+<br \/>breast cancer tumors. Moreover, our findings suggest that AR-expression and targeting should be investigated further to potentially add novel strategies to our existing algorithms in ER+\/AR+ MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Antiestrogens,Sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

Uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation, as well as immune suppressive macrophage proliferation, contribute to tumor growth and spread. Effort to suppress tumor cell growth using Inhibitors of PI3K or MEK signaling pathways can initially inhibit tumor growth, but resistance develops due to upregulation of the alternative pathway. We identified a novel series of allosteric tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors that induce synthetic lethality in AML, lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and other tumor cells and in proliferating macrophages in vitro and in vivo by simultaneously inhibiting cMyc and Tor and activating the stress activated kinase JNK, leading to p53 mediated cell cycle arrest. Select kinase inhibitors with a unique positioning of a single side chain inhibited CDK8\/19 and thereby Myc while stimulating phosphorylation and activation of JNK and p38. JNK activation promoted sustained ATF-2 and cJun-mediated p53 and Chk1\/Chk2 activation, thereby promoting cell cycle arrest in G2\/M and ultimately, apoptosis. These inhibitors potently suppressed tumor growth in vivo by halting both tumor cell and macrophage proliferation in G2\/M. They synergized with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 and led to tumor eradication and immunological memory formation. These studies identify novel allosteric inhibitors with potent synthetically lethal anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Drug discovery,Myc,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Given the tumor's location, surgery has a restricted role, and it is insensitive to most chemotherapies. Although fractionated radiation is the standard of therapy for DIPG, the cancer invariably worsens in 6-12 months. TP53 tumor suppressor protein mutations are found in 70-80% of DIPG tumors. These TP53 mutations have been linked to radiation resistance in DIPG patients. Our goal was to find new pharmacological compounds that would improve the radiation sensitivity of p53 mutant DIPG cell lines and to determine their molecular mechanism of action. Numerous bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitors have entered clinical trials in recent years, yielding promising outcomes in tumor treatment since BRD4 expression in DIPG is substantially higher than in neighboring normal brain tissue. So consequently, BRD4 is a target for DIPG treatment. ARV-825 is an emerging PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) compound which can cause rapid and persistent BRD4 protein degradation. However, delivering ARV-825 to pons is a major challenge owing to poor oral bioavailability of PROTACS. In this study, we used camel milk derived exosomes (CME) for delivery of ARV-825 to pons by both nasal and oral routes. To begin with, goat milk exosomes were also considered but CME was chosen because of its innate cytotoxicity against DIPG cell lines. CME were isolated using ultracentrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis and revealed a size distribution of 112.5 &#177; 2.8 nm, zeta potential of -26.38 &#177; 0.12 mV. CME (1*10<sup>11<\/sup>) were cytotoxic to both SF8628 (with a H3.3 K27M mutation) and SF188 (grade IV pediatric glioblastoma with wild type H3.3) cell lines and had 51% and 44% cell viability respectively. ARV-825 showed IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 546.58 &#177; 22.14 nM and 608.94 &#177; 30.04 nM in SF8628 cells and SF188 cells respectively. ARV-825&#8217;s IC<sub>50 <\/sub>was lowered when ARV-825 loaded CME were used. ARV-825 was loaded using sonication and entrapment efficiency was found to be 42.96 &#177; 2.14 % by HPLC analysis. CME were labelled with Vybrant DiO (CME-DIO) and instilled into each nostril of Sprague Dawley rats daily. Brain sections were viewed with fluorescent microscope and CME-DIO were seen in olfactory region after 3 days and in the pons region after 5 days demonstrating the ability of CME to reach the target site. <i>In-vitro<\/i> permeability studies using MDCK cells showed approximately 9&#181;g\/mL (60%), 15&#181;g\/mL (80%) and 16&#181;g\/mL (100%) of ARV-825 permeation in 2, 4 and 24 hours respectively when loaded into CME. The results of the present study suggest the possibility of using CME as a viable delivery strategy for ARV-825 against DIPG. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are currently undergoing to validate the results and understand kinetics and the molecular mechanisms of ARV-825 loaded CME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Glioma,Drug delivery,BRD4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

EZH2 is a crucial part of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). It, along with its homolog EZH1, is a focus for cancer therapeutic targets. Dysregulation of EZH1\/2 can cause cancer development due to significant changes in geneexpression. The current study aims to investigate the interaction between EZH1\/2 and oncogenic signals responsible for HCC progression and pyroptosis induction. Two cell lines, HepG2 and SK-Hep1, were subjected to two FDA-approved drugs, Valemetostat (Val) and Docetaxel (Doc), to determine the impact of EZH1\/2 on tumorigenicity and drug resistance. The WST-1 assay was utilized to gauge cell proliferation. The results indisputablydemonstrated a synergistic effect of the drugs after 48 h of treatment. The inhibition of viability was attributed to apoptosis induction in both tested cell lines, and the maximum effect was observed in the combined treatment as compared to either the control or each drug alone. Furthermore, our datashowed activation of caspase-3, upregulation of BAX, indicating apoptotic induction, and downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, AKT, S6k, oncogenic &#946;-catenin, and Stat3 protein expression levels, suggesting a modulation of oncogenic signaling pathways at the protein level. After 24 h of Val\/Doc treatment, pyroptosis was observed, characterized by cell swelling and bubbles on themembrane and a significant release of lactate dehydrogenase, indicating pyroptotic cell cytotoxicity. The antitumor effects and pyroptosis were enhanced by using a dual inhibitor, UNC1999, for EZH1\/2, resulting in a marked increase in the sensitivity of tested cells to the Val\/Doc treatment invitro. The present study unequivocally demonstrated that dual inhibition of EZH1\/2 acts as a potent sensitizer of HCC cells to Val\/Doc treatment, which might be a promising therapeutic approach for inducing cellular pyroptosis in HCC cell lines.<u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,EZH2,Pyrpotosis ,UNC1999,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In general, these tumors do not respond to conventional therapies, which stresses the importance of developing new therapeutical approaches. To date, several TFE3 fusion gene partners have been identified. However, the mechanism driving TFE3 cooperation with various gene partners remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown the vulnerability of dimerization domain of multiple TFE3-fusion proteins, and we have screened the FDA approved drugs library LOPAC and a small molecule library (Microsource) to identify compounds that inhibit TFE3 dimerization. The antihistamine terfenadine was found to inhibit TFE3 dimerization and had antiproliferative activity in different models of tRCC, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, our more recent data show that terfenadine reduced the amount of TFE3 in the nuclei. We have also observed enhanced antiproliferative activity of terfenadine in HEK293 cells overexpressing PRCC-TFE3, SPFQ-TFE3 or NONO-TFE3 compared to TFE3 alone or vector control, suggesting a targeted effect of terfenadine on cells driven by these TFE3-SF fusions. In addition, knock-down of SFPQ-TFE3 in HEK293 partially reversed this enhanced sensitivity to terfenadine. Cell proliferation and combination index analysis were performed in cell lines endogenously expressing the most common TFE3-fusion proteins cells to determinate the combination with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to assess the impact on TFE3 fusion protein levels. The combination of terfenadine with sunitinib showed a synergistic effect in cells endogenously expressing PRCC-TFE3 (IC50=1.5&#181;M; Fraction Affected &#62; 0.05) and NONO-TFE3 (IC50=1.8&#181;M; Fraction Affected&#60;0.7) fusions. The combination of terfenadine with crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in cells expressing SFPQ-TFE3 fusion (IC50=0.7&#181;M; Fraction Affected&#62;0.7). The combination of terfenadine with dovitinib showed a synergistic effect in cells expressing PRCC-TFE3 fusion (IC50=1&#181;M; Fraction Affected&#62;0.4). These preliminary data suggest a different response to the combination with different TKIs. This observation underlines the importance of identifying the TFE3 partner gene for targeted therapy. Overall, our results suggest that targeting the dimerization domain along with different oncogenic pathways activated in tRCC cells may represent a new therapeutic approach for this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translocation,Targeted therapy,Kidney cancer,Tyrosine kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Nicotine, which is one of the main chemicals from the tobacco smoke, is identified as carcinogen for lung cancer, especially for squamous carcinoma (LUSC). This study aims to investigates the intricate molecular mechanisms by which nicotine facilitates proliferation and migration in NSCLC through the c-Myc\/EZH2 signaling pathway.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: Clinical tissue specimens were procured from surgical patients with lung cancer for immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, public databases were scrutinized to compare EZH2 expression between smokers and non-smokers. NSCLC cell lines underwent treatment with nicotine in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and the impact on EZH2 was corroborated through Western Blot, Real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence staining. Proliferation and migration assays, encompassing CCK8 experiments, colony formation assays, EdU staining, and Transwell assays, were conducted to discern the effects of nicotine on NSCLC. Experimental techniques such as si-RNA and CHIP were deployed to investigate changes in c-Myc-mediated regulation of EZH2, elucidating the intricate role of the c-Myc\/EZH2 pathway in nicotine-induced NSCLC proliferation and migration.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: Smokers exhibited heightened EZH2 expression in tumor tissue compared to non-smokers. Nicotine treatment induced a concentration- and time-dependent upregulation of EZH2 in NSCLC cell lines. In 10 &#956;M nicotine-treated NSCLC cells, concurrent treatment with 10 &#956;M DZNep (EZH2 inhibitor) or si-EZH2 significantly augmented proliferation and migration. Moreover, the upregulation of EZH2 correlated with increased c-Myc expression, and siRNA-mediated c-Myc inhibition resulted in a corresponding reduction in EZH2 expression. Nicotine was identified as a promoter of NSCLC proliferation and migration through the c-Myc\/EZH2 signaling pathway. This study establishes a robust association between nicotine and EZH2 in NSCLC cells, unveiling the novel regulatory axis of c-Myc\/EZH2. Combined treatment with c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in suppressing nicotine-induced promotion of NSCLC proliferation and migration.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: In summary, this study elucidates the mechanisms through which nicotine propels NSCLC development via the c-Myc\/EZH2 pathway, providing a theoretical underpinning for future NSCLC treatment paradigms. The combined use of c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, poised to inhibit nicotine-induced NSCLC proliferation and migration, offering enhanced treatment modalities for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nicotine,EZH2,Myc,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Liver metastases (mets) have been associated with poor response. Mutations in genes encoding DNA damage repair (DDR) and TP53 affect radiosensitivity. Here we describe a cohort of patients with mCRPC and liver metastases treated on clinical trials of PSMA-TRT.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 39 patients with liver mets were enrolled on phase I\/II PSMA-TRT studies between Jan 2006 to Apr 2022. Patients received alpha therapy (225Ac-J591), beta therapy (fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617, single-dose and fractionated 177Lu-J591) or a combination of both (225Ac-591 and 177Lu-PSMA-I&#38;T). All patients included in this analysis had CT imaging; patients enrolled after 2017 had PSMA-PET imaging. 15 patients also had genomic analysis completed.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Median age was 69 (range 55-93), PSA 85.7 (2.45-9614). 39 (100%) bone mets, 33 (84.6%) LN, 9 (23.1%) lung. 22 (56.4%) greater than 1 ARPI, 23 (59.0%) greater thanc 1 chemo, 13 (33.3%) sip-T, 7 (17.9%) Ra-223, 4 (10.2%) prior TRT (with concurrent liver mets). Of the 19 with both CT and PSMA PET, 18 (94.7%) were identified on PSMA PET (including 8 PET only), 10 (55.6%) on CT (1 CT only, i.e. non-PSMA PET avid). Median whole body PSMA-imaging score (PSMA-IS) was 4 (range 1-4), with 7 (17.9%) 1-2 and 32 (82.1%) 3-4. 9 (23.0%) received alpha-TRT, 26 (66.7%) beta-TRT, and 4 (10.3%) combo-TRT. Somatic or germline analysis was completed in 15 (38.5%) of 39 patients. 8 (53.3%) had mutations in DNA repair pathways (3 in BRCA2, 3 in CHEK 2, 1 in FANC, 1 in MSH2). 7 (46.7%) had mutations in TP53. 31 patients (79.5%) had PSA decline, with 15 (38.5%) achieving PSA 50. 26 (66.7%) had baseline CTC measured; 19 (73.0%) had detectable CTC at baseline. Of these 19, 3 (15.8%) converted to undetectable after therapy and 2 (10.5%) converted to favorable CTC. PSA50 rate in alpha-TRT was 4 (44.4%), beta-TRT 8 (30.7%), combo-TRT 3 (75%). PSA50 in patients with PSMA-IS 1-2 was 1 (14.2%) compared to 14 (43.9%) in PSMA-IS 3-4. 3 (37.5%) of 8 patients with mutDDR achieved PSA50, compared to 3 (42.9%) with mutTP53.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This dataset adds to the collective literature of two subgroups of patients with mCRPC receiving TRT: those with liver disease and those with mutations in DNA repair pathways. The results of this study suggest higher rates of response in patients receiving alpha therapy, either alone or in combination with beta therapy, and in patients with high radiotracer uptake on PSMA-PET, based on PSMA-imaging score of 3 or 4.

Inhibiting of MALT1 is considered a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of several non&#8208;Hodgkin B&#8208;cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel potent MALT1 allosteric inhibitor, BPI-530616, which strongly inhibited MALT1 protease activity with subnanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>, and low off-target activity on other proteases. BPI-530616 can inhibit the proliferation of B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cell line, OCI-ly3, bearing CD79b and CARD11 mutations. The cell line is intrinsically resistant to covalent and non-covalent Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors. Meanwhile, BPI-530616 suppressed the cellular cytokine secretion (e.g.IL-10, IL-2) or MALT1 direct substrate cleavage (e.g. CYLD). <i>In vivo<\/i>, BPI-530616 dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth and inhibited the cleavage of CYLD in OCI-ly3 xenograft mouse model. To address the role of MALT1 inhibitor in the contest of immune-oncology, a CT26 syngeneic mouse model was set up. Oral administration of BPI-530616 exhibited a good antitumor effect comparable to that of the anti-PD1 antibody, with no observable adverse effects. Additionally, BPI-530616 displayed desirable drug-like properties, including low clearance and good oral bioavailability across multiple pre-clinical species. Taken<br \/>together, our research has led to the discovery of a novel, potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule MALT1 inhibitor, BPI-530616. It demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in the DLBCL animal model and showed promising effects in an immune-oncology animal model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

TKIs are effective drugs for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but intrinsic\/acquired resistance remains a major hurdle. One of the proposed models for TKI resistance is drug sequestration by lysosomes. The solute transporter xCT is a cystine\/glutamate antiporter that plays a role in the production of antioxidants in cancer cells. Our lab has found that SLC7A11, the gene that encodes xCT, is overexpressed in sunitinib resistant RCC cells. LAMP1 expression was also increased in sunitinib resistant RCC cells, suggesting an upregulation of lysosome biogenesis. The biochemical knock down of SLC7A11 by shRNA showed a decrease in LAMP1 expression, suggesting a decrease in lysosome biogenesis. SEC24D is a key catalytic component of COPII complex involved in formation of exosomes and secretory pathways. Our preliminary data showed that reduction in xCT expression was associated with a decrease in SEC24D protein levels which was associated with a reduction in the extracellular export and, consequently, an increase in intracytoplasmic levels of miRNA 605, a known tumor suppressor. We are currently testing the hypothesis that xCT may modulate lysosomes biogenesis and micro-RNA trafficking in several clear cell and translation renal cell carcinoma models. In summary, a better understanding of the role of xCT in the regulation of intracytoplasmic organelles may lead to the identification of a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome TKI resistance in RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,Transporters,MicroRNA,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, the molecular mechanisms between cholesterol biosynthesis and head and neck cancer have not yet been studied. In this study, we identified upregulation of dehydrocholesterol reductase such as DHCR7 or DHCR24 in HNSCC compared with adjacent normal tissues from the same patients using RNA sequencing data. We observed protein expression level of DHCR7 or DHCR24 in head and neck cancer cell lines through Western blotting. We also checked high expression of DHCR7 or DHCR24 in HNSCC tissues from patients using immunohistochemistry assays. Yet, when DHCR7 or DHCR24 was knocked down using siRNA, the viability of HNSCC cells was decreased in MTT assays. In parallel, we adapted small inhibitory drugs; AY9944 for DHCR7 inhibition and Triparanol or SH-42 for DHCR24 inhibition. Treatment of AY9944, Triparanol, or SH-42 also resulted in decreased viability of HNSCC cells. Moreover, when we used a cholesterol blocker, MCD, the cell viability was decreased, whereas the cells overcame cell death by adding the combination of cholesterol and LDL. Taken together, we concluded that head and neck cancer requires DHCR7 and DHCR24 activity involved in cholesterol metabolism for cancer growth. Our data suggest that targeting DHCR7 or DHCR24 using AY9944, Triparanol or SH-42 is one of the potential strategies that will definitely help with cancer treatment for head and neck cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cholesterol,Metabolism,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.-S.

The ABC-DLBCL subtype, characterized by activation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and downstream NF-kB pathway, carries a poor outcome. Up to 30% of ABC-DLBCL present TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> mutations, suggesting that TOX function as a tumor suppressor. Our analysis of TOX expression along the germinal center B-cell differentiation program (na&#239;ve &#8594; GCB &#8594; plasma cells) showed that TOX expression paralleled NF-kB activity with highest levels in plasma cells (P&#60;0.001, vs. either na&#239;ve and GCB). We thus propose that TOX acts as a transcriptional gatekeeper in GCB cells to prevent early activation of NF-kB thus enabling differentiation into plasma cells while restraining lymphomagenesis. We generated a conditional GCB TOX KO mouse model, induced the GC reaction with a T-cell antigen and found that TOX KO (vs. TOX WT, 10 mice per condition) had impaired differentiation of plasma cells (p&#60;0.001) and hyperproliferative Ki67+ GCB cells (p&#60;0.05). We then generated (by CRISPR) an isogenic TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> ABC-DLBCL cell line (TMD8) and found upregulation of genes in the NF-kB pathway (q-value &#60;0.05, vs. TMD8). Furthermore, TMD8-TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> cells showed increased secretion of autocrine cytokines IL6 and IL10, and higher STAT3 phosphorylation (p&#60;0.05 for all comparisons, vs. TMD8-TOX<sup>WT<\/sup> cells) all compatible with NF-kB activation. Tumor microenvironmental cues can hyperactivate BCR and downstream NF-kB in ABC-DLBCL. We thus implanted isogenic TMD8 cells in mice (n = 10) and determined pathway activation by phospho-flow. We found massive activation of SYK, BTK, PLCG2 (from the BCR) and p65 (from NF-kB) in TMD8-TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> vs. TMD8-TOX<sup>WT<\/sup> tumors (all p&#60;0.01), and vs. these cell lines cultured in vitro (all p&#60;0.01). To determine whether these features can be therapeutically exploited, we conducted a viability screening using a panel of 20 clinical-phase targeted therapies relevant to ABC-DLBCL. We found that BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (BCR pathway) and MALT1 inhibitor JNJ67690246 (NF-kB pathway) were 2-3 fold more active in TMD8-TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> vs. TMD8-TOX<sup>WT<\/sup> cells (all p&#60;0.05). We then xenografted isogenic TMD8 cells (n = 10 mice per condition) and, when tumors reached 150 mm3, we randomized mice to vehicle vs. acalabrutinib 30 mg\/kg\/day by oral gavage (human dose equivalent). Acalabrutinib was significantly more active in TMD8-TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> tumors (vs. TMD8-TOX<sup>WT<\/sup>, p=0.0008), which translated into significantly prolonged survival (p&#60;0.05). This acalabrutinib effect was accompanied by significant reduction of BTK, SYK and PLCG2 phosphorylation in TMD8-TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> tumors (p&#60;0.0001, all comparisons). Thus, TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> leads to hyperactivation of the BCR and NF-kB signaling pathways in ABC-DLBCL cells, rendering them hypersensitive to BCR-targeted therapies, delineating a potential mechanism-based therapeutic approach for ABC-DLBCL TOX<sup>LOF<\/sup> patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Phosphorylation,BTK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Especially, the consensus molecular subtypes 4 (CMS4)-CRC shows extremely poor prognosis and high chemo-resistance rate, in compared with the other types of CRC. CMS4-CRC is histologically characteristic for the extensive stromal infiltration with poorly differentiated cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have reported that sessile serrated adenomas, which is characterized by disorganized crypt architecture and irregular serrations with high malignant potential such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF&#946; signaling, might be closely associated with CMS4-CRC. Fascin-1 is an actin-binding protein supposed to be associated with sessile serrated adenomas. However, the expression and clinical significance of fascin-1 in CMS4 CRC remains to be unclear.<br \/>Aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the clinic-pathological significance of fascin-1 in colorectal cancer, and to evaluate the effects of fascin-1 inhibitors on the invasion and migration ability of CMS4 cancer cell lines.<br \/>Materials and Methods: We conducted an immunohistochemical study on 351 colorectal cancer patients, where we examined the expression levels of Fascin-1 and analyzed their correlation with the patients&#8217; clinicopathologic features. Using two human CMS4-CRC cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, we investigated the effects of the fascin-1 inhibitors, NP-G2-044 and BDP-13176, on the proliferation and the migration activity of CMS4-CRC cells via MTT assay and a wound-healing assay.<br \/>Results: Fascin-1 is expressed both on cancer cells and on stromal cells, but mainly expressed on cancer cells. Significance of fascin-1 expression on cancer cells was evaluated in this study. Fascin-1 expression is significantly associated with histologically poorly differentiation (p &#60; 0.001), deeper T invasion (p = 0.003), and proximal colon cancer (p &#60; 0.001). High fascin-1 expression is significantly associated with worse prognosis (p = 0.0085, log-rank) and higher recurrence rates (p = 0.018). Univariate analysis demonstrated that overall survival of patients was significantly associated with Fascin1 expression in cancer cells, age &#8805;65 years old, poor histological type, lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, and venous invasion. Multivariate analysis revealed that fascin1 expression (p = 0.037), poor histological type (p = 0.022), venous invasion (p = 0.078), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.009) were significantly correlated with the overall survival rate of CRC patients. Both fascin-1 inhibitors significantly reduced the invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells at the concentration of 100 nM.<br \/>Conclusions: Fascin-1 is one of key molecules for the development of CRC. Fascin-1 might be a promising molecular target for CMS4-CRC patients at advanced stage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Molecular targets,Invasion,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

One of its substrates is TANK binding kinases 1 (TBK1), whose MARylation by PARP7 inhibits its activation and thereby represses the type I IFN response to cytosolic nucleic acid. PARP7 is upregulated in many kinds of cancers and acts as a brake in cytosolic nucleic acid sensing, which leads to the suppression of type I IFN signaling and immune response. Therefore, PARP7 is a novel and promising target in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we describe the discovery of a novel small molecule NSP-5033 as a dual PARP7\/PARP12 inhibitor, which potently inhibits PARP7 and PARP12 enzymes with sub-nanomolar and low nanomolar activities, respectively. It displayed potent anti-proliferative activities against a number of cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. NSP-5033 also increased the mRNA level of IFN&#946; and CXCL10 and stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation, suggesting that it restored the type I IFN response in tumor cells. With excellent ADME and pharmacokinetic properties, NSP-5033 demonstrated potent <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy in human lung cancer xenografts with tumor regression and induced antitumor immunity in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. NSP-5033 has been nominated as a preclinival candidate for treatment of solid tumors and is undergoing IND-enabling studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,PARP inhibitors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

The present study has brought together two FDA-approved drugs with antineoplastic properties to create a complex that promises to revolutionize the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). By combining C-Phycocyanin extract (PCE), a pigment-protein complex synthesized by blue-green microalgae <i>platensis<\/i>, with the immunostimulatory doxorubicin (DOX) loaded Bacterial Ghosts (BGs), the present study aims to achieve enhanced dual-chemotherapy and remarkable inhibition of DOX-chemoresistance. The BG delivery system uses purified bacterial cell evacuation and safe confirmed <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae<\/i> BGs (KPBG) for safe and effective delivery, overcoming issues with resistance and poor delivery. The complex &#8206;delivery system of KPBG-PCE\/DOX was tested on two NSCLC cell lines, wild-P53, A549, and &#8206;mutant-P53, NCI\/H358, respectively. Our data showed &#8206;that the loaded combined treatment significantly induced morphological changes with signs of apoptosis induction in the tested &#8206;cell lines compared with the control. The WST-1 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. Data indicates that PCE and DOX have a synergistic effect at low concentrations when loaded on KPBGs for a constant count of BGs CFU\/ml after 48 h of treatment. The viability &#8206;inhibition and apoptosis induction of A549 and NCI\/H358 cells were &#8206;amplified in the combined treatment of 48 h compared to the control or either each drug alone. At the protein levels, our data showed activation of caspase-3, upregulation of BAX, and downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, m-TOR, S6k, oncogenic &#946;-catenin, and cyclin-D1 protein expression levels after treatment with (KPBG-PCE\/DOX) for 48 h, indicating apoptotic induction and modulating oncogenic signaling pathways. In conclusion, the current study presents a promising outcome of a synergistic delivery system of KPBG-PCE\/DOX that can inhibit lung cancer cell line proliferation, induce apoptosis, and increase cell sensitivity to DOX. The KPBG delivery system offers an appealing approach for a successful combination of targeted therapy for lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug delivery,Doxorubicin&#8206;,C-Phycocyanin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

A major problem in CRC management is relapse and progression to metastatic disease leading to poor overall survival. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in most CRCs and often drives metastasis and therapy resistance. Current therapeutic options targeting p53 mutant cancers show poor efficacy and frequently exhibit high toxicity. To address this clinical problem, we developed a novel therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of p53 mutant cancers. The strategy combines a thymidine analogue (e.g., trifluorthymidine\/TFT, a component of TAS102) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). We observed that TAS102 does not block DNA replication, but rather prompts post-replicative base-excision DNA repair (BER), and PARPi increases double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in p53 mutant cancer cells. Normal p53 wild type (p53wt) cells are arrested in the G1 phase and repair DNA. Thus, the TAS102-PARPi combination selectively targets p53-mutant cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of DSBs and cell death. This novel strategy was examined in p53wt and p53-mutant tumor cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The drug combination was significantly more effective in inhibiting p53 mutant tumor growth and in prolonging survival compared to monotherapies. This strategy is currently being tested in a first-in-human dose-escalation Phase I study (NCT04511039) in patients with advanced CRC. Further investigation revealed that the TAS102-PARPi combination induced DNA damage response (DDR) and the G2 checkpoint, leading to G2 arrest in p53 mutant cancer cells. We observed that TAS102-PARPi induced phosphorylation of CDC2 (also known as CDK1) but did not increase phosphorylation of histone H3 (a marker of mitosis), therefore indicating activation of the G2 checkpoint. Furthermore, the roles of ATM and ATR kinases in the DDR and G2 responses were clarified using highly specific kinase inhibitors. The analysis of the DDR\/G2 signaling response in isogenic p53wt and mutant CRC cell lines showed that inhibition of WEE1 kinase can selectively abrogate the G2 checkpoint in p53-mutant cells, resulting in marked DNA damage and cell death. Importantly, the blockade of WEE1 strongly synergized with the TAS102-PARPi combination, further enhancing its potency and efficacy against p53-mutant cancer cells. In summary, our research provides a foundation for a novel therapeutic strategy for p53 mutant cancers that may provide a paradigm shift in the treatment of these deadly cancers, increasing efficacy while minimizing toxic adverse effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,TAS102,PARPi,WEE1i,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of breast cancer, is usually treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Tumor Treating Fields therapy are FDA-approved for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM ).TT Fields use alternating electric fields to inhibit tumor growth through mitotic disruption, cellular damage, integrated stress response activation, and immune mechanisms and inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell death, and cause cell cycle arrest.TT Fields can induce BRCAness and when combined with PARP inhibition, this combination may result in synthetic lethality. We explored the effect of TTFields on two TNBC cell lines MDA-MB436 (BRCA1-mutant, p53-null) and MDA-MB468 (BRCA1 wild-type, p53-mutant) treated with TTFields (150 kHz) for 24 hours. Western blot analysis showed elevation of p21 independent of p53 mutational status. We examined the combination of PARP inhibitor (Talazoparib) with TTFields in MDA-MB468 cells to determine the effect of the combination in BRCA wild-type cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed p21 upregulation after 24 hours in combination without an increase in p53. p21 acts as a G1-checkpoint protein and loss of p21 expression has been observed in a high percentage of human breast cancer cells. Our results suggest a rational and potentially effective therapy that could be further developed and used for the treatment of breast cancer. Our ongoing studies are exploring potential mechanisms of synergy between PARP inhibitor Talazoparib and TTFields using various TNBC models, and the effect of the combination on cell cycle arrest in cell culture and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the most effective combination of CDK4\/6, AR, and PI3K-AKT inhibitors in preclinical models of LAR TNBC. The MDAMB453 and MFM223 (AR positive\/Rb intact\/PIK3CAmutant) LAR TNBC cells were treated with each inhibitor alone or in combination. Drug sensitivity was assessed using colony formation, cell viability, and live-cell analysis. The Loewe additivity equation was used to measure the additive drug effects. Immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate cell cycle and PI3K-AKT signaling and ARE luciferase assay was used to assess AR transcriptional activity. MDAMB453 and MFM223 cells were sensitive to the single agents palbociclib, alpelisib, and capivasertib (IC50, ~500 nM), which inhibited CDK4\/6, PI3K&#945;, and AKT, respectively. Enzalutamide, an AR antagonist, exerted no growth inhibitory activity (IC50, 15-25 &#956;M). Treatment with palbociclib, alpelisib, or capivasertib did not alter the AR protein levels or transcriptional activity. The combination of palbociclib+capivasertib synergistically inhibited the proliferation of MDAMB453 and MFM223 cells (synergistic scores 7.34, p=5.81-11, and 4.78, p=0.012, respectively) better than palbociclib+alpelisib. Enzalutamide did not enhance either combination. Palbociclib+capivasertib inhibited PI3KCA-mutant and Rb-intact LAR TNBC PDX growth more potently than palbociclib+alpelisib (p=0.046). Treatment of LAR TNBC cells with palbociclib suppressed Rb phosphorylation and resulted in adaptive activation of P-AKT<sup>S473\/T308 <\/sup>and the AKT substrates GSK3&#946;, PRAS40, and FoxO3a after 24 h. Capivasertib inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and AKT substrates, following CDK4\/6 blockade with palbociclib, more potently than alpelisib. PI3K&#946; inhibitors (TGX221, GSK2636771) did not block AKT substrate upregulation, suggesting PI3K&#946; does not mediate adaptive responses. Rictor knockdown failed to reduce AKT activation following palbociclib treatment, suggesting an mTORC2-independent mechanism. Human Phospho-kinase Array of MDA-MB-453 cells treated with palbociclib showed time dependent upregulation of GSK3&#946;<sup>S9<\/sup>, STAT3<sup>Y727<\/sup> and PDFGR&#946;<sup>Y751<\/sup>. PDGFR&#946; activation after palbociclib treatment was confirmed in MFM223 cells. PDGFR&#946; siRNAs in MDAMB453 cells blocked P-AKT<sup>S473<\/sup> upregulation after palbociclib treatment. Treatment with palbociclib and the PDGFR&#946; small-molecule antagonist CP673451 arrested LAR TNBC growth similar to palbociclib+capivasertib, suggesting an adaptive response involving PDGFR&#946; signaling. In conclusion, this study supports the clinical testing of the palbociclib and capivasertib combination for LAR TNBC patients and reveals adaptive responses after palbociclib treatment through PDGFR&#946; signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Androgen receptor,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,AKT\/PKB activation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which exploits the light-activated potential of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), emerges as a promising avenue to combat GBM. In this study, primary patient-derived cell lines, Ox5 core, and G7, served as critical subjects, exposed to light excitation at wavelengths of 410 nm, 528 nm, and 810 nm, both with and without 5-ALA (protoporphyrin IX). The central objective was to rigorously assess the efficacy of PDT, either with or without 5-ALA, in reducing cell viability and curtailing clonogenic expansion. This evaluation was performed within the context of the existing standard of care for GBM, encompassing Temozolomide (TMZ) and Radiotherapy. Our results unveiled striking insights into the potential of PDT as an innovative therapeutic strategy. Notably, Ox5 cells exhibited a remarkable reduction in viability, exceeding 70%, following exposure to PDT with 410 nm light and 5-ALA at a concentration of 50&#956;M. A similar, albeit slightly less profound, effect was observed in G7 cells, with a viability decrease of more than 53%. These outcomes, meticulously quantified through the MTT viability assay (n=4), were reinforced by statistical significance, as indicated by p-values falling below 0.05 and, lower 0.001. Furthermore, clonogenic assays employing G7 cells provided an additional layer of evidence, demonstrating a substantial inhibition of clonogenic potential following PDT treatment with 410 nm light and 5-ALA. Immunohistochemistry techniques, particularly focusing on the cleaved caspase-3 marker, in both Ox5 core and G7 cells, underscoring the mechanistic basis of the observed cell death. In stark contrast, the conventional standard of care, involving TMZ monotherapy, was tested, and the results across four biological replicates were less significant. The relative viability of Ox5 and G7 cells exhibited no statistical significance, with p-values exceeding 0.05, implying a limited impact of this regimen on cell viability. Moreover, clonogenic assays conducted under the standard of care protocol (TMZ+\/-Radiotherapy) unveiled the persistence of colonies, even at higher radiation doses of 4 and 6 Gy.In summary, PDT, specifically when implemented with 410 nm light and 5-ALA, represents a breakthrough strategy that leads to substantial cell death in both Ox5 and G7 cells. This compelling alternative therapy shines a hopeful light on the horizon of GBM treatment, providing a potentially transformative approach that can augment the current standard of care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Photodynamic Therapy,TMZ ,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) DNA repair enzymes, have been approved for treating only a subset of TNBC patients with a specific genetic landscape (<i>BRCA1<\/i> mutation). However, TNBC patients with wildtype <i>BRCA1 (BRCA1<sup>WT<\/sup>)<\/i> are still lacking targeted therapy and chemotherapy remains their main treatment strategy. High expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer and PRMT5 alone or via its interacting proteins plays an oncogenic role in breast cancer. Recent evidence suggests that PRMT5 is a key player in regulating the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) either through homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) depending on the PRMT5 expression level within the cell. This dependency of cancer cells on PRMT5 expression levels in deciding the repair pathway of choice can be exploited for developing therapies. We hypothesize that in <i>BRCA1<\/i> wildtype TNBC cells, inhibiting PRMT5 activity will force the cells to rely on NHEJ rather than HR to repair DNA DSBs, and introducing PARP inhibitors in this setting will inactivate NHEJ as well, causing synthetic lethality and cell death. In this study, we evaluated the pre-clinical benefit of combining PARP inhibitors with a PRMT5 inhibitor in TNBC cells.<br \/>Methods: Human TNBC cell lines with wildtype <i>BRCA1<\/i> (MDA-MB-468, HCC1806) and mutant <i>BRCA1<\/i> (MDA-MB-436, SUM149-PT) were treated with varying doses of two PARP inhibitors (Olaparib, Talazoparib) and a PRMT5 inhibitor (GSK3326595) as single agents or in combination. MTT-based cell viability assay was used to determine cytotoxicity of the treatments. mRNA expression was determined by RT-qPCR after drug treatment.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: We report that PRMT5 inhibition synergizes with both Olaparib and Talazoparib, to potentiate cell death in two <i>BRCA1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> but not in <i>BRCA1<\/i><sup><i>mut<\/i><\/sup> TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, we show that inhibiting PRMT5 in <i>BRCA1<\/i><sup>WT <\/sup>cells upregulates the mRNA expression of <i>RAD50<\/i>, a DNA damage sensing gene in the HR pathway. Our ongoing study is to delineate the molecular mechanism of action for the observed synergy and whether PRMT5 inhibition can overcome resistance to PARP inhibitors. Through this study, we will identify a novel treatment strategy for the majority of TNBC patients (<i>BRCA1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i>) who currently lack targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,PARP inhibitors,Drug synergy,Protein arginine methyltransferase 5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is available for the treatment of both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma and represents a new category of treatment modalities in oncologic therapy. Despite decades of study, few FDA approved modalities are available for GBM and provide limited survival improvements for patients. AKT functions as a key serine\/threonine kinase in the RTK\/PTEN\/PI3K pathway, and extensive genomic analysis of GBM has revealed that this pathway is mutated in a significant majority of GBM cases. Activation of this pathway ultimately leads to the activation of AKT, and p-AKT levels are elevated in the majority of GBM tumor samples and cell lines. Studies have shown that increased p-AKT levels contribute to uncontrolled growth, resistance to apoptosis, and enhanced invasive capabilities of glioma cells, which are characteristics of tumor progression in GBM. AKT serves as a critical hub in this pathway, enabling the amplification of growth signals, thereby making the inhibition of AKT an appealing and promising therapeutic target for treating GBM. Imipridone ONC206 is under clinical development for treatment of pediatric and adult patients with primary brain tumors (NCT04732065 and NCT04541082). Here we show inhibition of p-AKT as well as upregulation of CHOP and caspase-10 following cotreatment of ONC206 and TTFields.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: We investigated the effect of ONC206 (at IC50s) plus TTFields in U251 and T98G human GBM cell lines at different time points. Effect of treatment on cPARP, BCL-2, CHOP, caspase-10, and p-AKT were investigated using western blot. Neurospheres were generated using mentioned cell lines and used for investigating effect of co-treatment on 3D structure.<br \/>Results: Treatment with ONC206 at the IC50 in T98G cells with TTFields at 24h showed synergistic upregulation of cPARP as well as inhibition of BCL-2. At 96hour time point, inhibition of p-AKT was observed following all treatments (ONC206, TTFields, and co-application compared to control. In U251 cells, following treatment of ONC206 and TTFields, inhibition of BCL-2 was observed at 24h time point at all treatment conditions. Upregulation of CHOP and Casapse-10 at 96h time point was seen, as well as inhibition of p-AKT. Spheroid models showed structure disruption and growth arrest following combination treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Here we showed cotreatment results in inhibition of p-AKT, the key node in GBM growth pathway. Also, the upregulation of CHOP and caspase-10 that has not been discussed before can be the key to focus on novel therapeutic targets for GBM More studies are needed to elaborate the exact mechanism of synergy but these new findings can be used to develop novel treatment combination","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Glioblastoma multiforme,Imipridone,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Lenvatinib is one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for first-line treatment of advanced HCC, but its efficacy remains modest. Growing evidence suggest that the unsatisfactory survival benefits of lenvatinib could be attributed to the acquired drug resistance developed in HCC patients. In this study, we aim to explore the intrinsic metabolic vulnerability which could be exploited to enhance the treatment efficacy of lenvatinib in HCC. Our previous study showed that loss of tyrosine catabolism accompanied with a reduced downstream ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supports HCC initiation. To explore the therapeutic value of BHB in potentiating lenvatinib treatment in HCC, tyrosine catabolism-suppressing HCC cells were treated with BHB. We found that BHB treatment suppressed cell proliferation, increased cellular reactive oxygen species and potentiated the efficacy of lenvatinib treatment. Similar tumor-suppressive effect was observed when BHB was administered in vivo in mice bearing HCC patient derived xenograft. Combination treatment of lenvatinib and ketogenic diet which induces BHB level could drastically attenuate tumor development in immunocompetent mice bearing hepatic tumors. This study presents a potentially translatable combination treatment regimen to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of lenvatinib in advanced HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

MYC is an oncogene which proliferation the cells and BCL2 inhibit cell death. These combinations could be a cause of highly aggressive clinical features and poor survival of DLBCL. The WHO-HAEM5 renames the entity DLBCL\/high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements. Despite the dismal prognosis, no widely accepted standard treatment exists to the management of DHL. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for these patients are urgently needed. Previously, we looked at the eIf4A inhibition was shown to downregulate MYC expression in lymphoma cell lines. Venetoclax, a highly selective inhibitor of BCL2, shows clinical activity for patients with DLBCL although there are concerns about increasing toxicity. Our hypothesis in the following: If eIF4A inhibitor preferentially inhibit the translation of oncogenes such as cMyc and venetoclax inhibit the BCL2 in DHL, then the combination of eIF4A inhibitor and BCL2 inhibitor will be highly effective for DHL and potentially safe for animals and humans. We tested the anti-lymphoma effect of CR-1-31-B, in combination with Venetoclax in lymphoma cell lines using flow cytometry. We performed cell apoptosis assays in increasing concentrations of Venetoclax, CR-1-31-B and a combination of the two drugs at 48 hours. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying the observed synergistic effect in DLBCL-DHL, RNA-seq profiling was performed on cells treated with single drugs and their combinations, respectively. Venetoclax and CR1-31-B exhibited concentration and time dependent cytotoxicity in lymphoma cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations. Overall, the combination of eIF4A inhibitor and BCL2 inhibitor showed synergy in all kinds of DLBCL cell lines. Especially DHL cell lines were more sensitive to the drug combination and showed enhanced synergy compared to the non-DHL cell lines(<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). We analyzed RNA-seq profiling of cells treated with single drugs and their combinations and found that the transcriptional signature of the synergistic combination was unique relative to that of either constituent monotherapy. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed in the DHL and non-DHL group. The analysis demonstrates that known Unfolded protein response(UPR) part and metabolism, are enriched in DHL groups. This suggests that the UPR and metabolism pathway are closely related to the combination effect in DHL. These findings suggest that the combination of eIF4A inhibitor and BCL2 inhibitor have potent pharmacological activity in DHL lines, it was closely related with UPR. These combination is promising and novel treatment for high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements. Further pre-clinical investigations of this combination for these patients are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,c-Myc,BCL2,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

Statistics indicate that approximately 80% to 90% of lung cancer cases fall under the classification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For several decades, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has often been treated with chemotherapy drugs. However, lung cancer has high incidence and recurrence rates, mainly due to drug resistance and side effects during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This is the hinder problem in the treatment of NSCLC, which highlight the necessity of developing new drugs or new treatments for NSCLC. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that can treat about 50% of solid tumors, but the cisplatin-induced cytoprotective autophagy is the resistance to clinical treatment. It is urgent to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating cisplatin resistance to improve its therapeutic value in lung cancer. Magnolol is a phenolic component isolated from the roots and bark of <i>Magnolia officinalis<\/i> and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. With a wide range of pharmacological activities, various studies have focused on the anti-cancer properties of magnolol in recent years. The effect of the drug is to keep cells in the G2\/M phase, induce mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, affect the supply of cellular energy, and then lead to cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the ability of magnolol enhance cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, showing dose dependence in NSCLC cell by MTT assay. We utilized the immunofluorescence staining and western blotting assay to confirm the downgrade expression of LC3B and the upregulate expression of p62 that define magnolol is able to suppress cisplatin-induced cytoprotective autophagy in NSCLC. We also detected the extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis induction ability of magnolol combined with cisplatin in NSCLC. In the result, the cisplatin combined with magnolol have more significantly triggered the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activate more protein cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9 than monotherapy. We also used western blotting assay to confirm the expression of apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax to measure the degree of apoptosis. The migration and invasion effects of magnolol and cisplatin were identified by transwell invasion and wound healing on NSCLC. The magnolol combined with cisplatin extended the mouse survival rate and can inhibit tumor progression. These results suggest that combinational therapy of cisplatin and magnolol could be a promising treatment strategy for NSCLC. The potential regulation of magnolol on NSCLC is associated with triggering cisplatin-induced apoptosis and diminishing cisplatin-induce cytoprotective autophagy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Autophagy,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.-E.

While novel KRAS target strategies are in development, few agents have been investigated to target the transcriptional machinery for global inhibition of expression. Recent small molecule inhibitors targeting transcription (i.e., CDK7) have shown preliminary evidence of disease control; however, combination therapies have lagged, likely due to uncertainty in clinical toxicity. Text mining analysis suggests combination BET and CDK9 inhibition may be promising against PDAC. Here, we present preclinical evidence of synergistic activity for the combination of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitor (ZEN3694) and CDK9 inhibitor (VIP152) using patient derived cancer organoids (PCOs).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Dose response curves were generated for ZEN3694 and VIP152 to assess their single agent activity against PCOs using a low volume format. ZEN3694 was treated continuously while VIP152 was removed after 24h to mimic pharmacokinetics with assay endpoint at 144h. Synergy assays were designed using a combination dose titration grid. Viability was determined in all assays using 3D CellTiter Glo (CTG, 50% v\/v). Synergy scores were produced using SynergyFinder 3.0 including Zero Interaction Potency (ZIP), Bliss Independence (Bliss), Highest Single Agent (HSA), and Loewe Additivity (Loewe). Western blot analysis was performed against global markers of active RNA polymerase II (phosphorylation at serine 2, 5, 7) and antiapoptotic protein, BCL xL, and MCL 1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>ZEN3694 was observed to have a single agent IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the single uM range across 3 independent PDAC PCO lines (PDAC1 3.7uM, PDAC2 1.1uM, PDAC3 2.9uM). VIP152 showed significant potency in the same 3 PDAC PCO lines (PDAC1 140.2nM, PDAC2 30.5nM, PDAC3 43.4nM). The combination of ZEN3694 and VIP152 was found to have increased therapeutic activity with double digit synergy scores across all reference models: PDAC1 (Loewe 17.3, HSA 19.8, ZIP 20.2, and Bliss 17.2) and PDAC2 (Loewe 34.7, HSA 28.3, ZIP 19.7, and Bliss 19.6). Western blots of protein collected from organoids treated for 48h showed on target activity, including decrease in the phosphorylation of Rbp1 (Ser 2, Ser 5, and Ser 7) compared to both control and single agents and decreased expression in antiapoptotic proteins (MCL 1 and BCL xL).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Here, we show the activity of dual transcription targeting with BET and CDK9 inhibition in patient derived pancreatic cancer organoid models. The combination of ZEN3694 and VIP152 has i<i>n vitro<\/i> synergy in PDAC PCO models with on target activity.

Recent studies shown that MTAP deletions in cancer create vulnerability to synthetic lethal with the MAT2A\/PRMT5\/RIOK1 axis. Herein, we report the discovery of a PRMT5 inhibitor GH56, and an MAT2A inhibitor GH31, both showed promising single agent efficacy and synergy in MTAP loss tumor models. GH56 is an MTA-Cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor. <i>In vitro<\/i>, GH56 showed potent SDMA inhibition in MTAP-deleted cancer cells with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> from 0.8&#8210;3 nM. It also showed excellent selectivity with more than 100-folds in MTAP-WT cells. In a cell panel with more than 100 cell-lines, GH56 selectively inhibited the growth of cells with MTAP-deletion while separated the cells with MTAP-WT. In the safety panel and kinase panel, GH56 all showed good selectivity. In addition, GH56 had an IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 10 &#956;M for hERG. <i>In vivo<\/i>, GH56 showed dose-dependent efficacy in a series MTAP-deleted models and were well tolerated. In U87MG glioblastoma CDX model, NCI-H838 NSCLC CDX model, BXPC-3\/HupT4 PDAC CDX models and RT112-84 BLCA model, TGI for GH56 at high dose were all &#62;100%.

The combination of GH56 and GH31 showed synergy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The low dose GH31 combination with low-dose GH56 achieved the similar efficacy as high dose GH56 and a more rapid tumor regression. In view of the delayed onset of the tumor response and high dose needed by PRMT5 inhibitor (reported by clinic stage compounds), the combination of PRMT5i and MAT2Ai will be advantageous. Furthermore, both GH56 and GH31 are brain penetrant, especially for GH31, with a <i>K<\/i><sub>puu<\/sub> &#62; 0.6 and B\/P &#62; 2. The combination of GH56 and GH31 in a brain metastasis model and a glioblastoma <i>in situ<\/i> model all showed strong synergy, demonstrated the potential for the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancer with brain metastasis. In summary, we discovered potent, selective and brain penetrant PRMT5 inhibitor GH56 and MAT2A inhibitor GH31.
