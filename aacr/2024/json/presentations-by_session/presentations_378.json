[{"Abstract":"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has become a significant clinical challenge due to rapid increase in the incidence during the past four decades in the USA and Western countries. However, the prognosis of EAC patients is still poor with 5-year overall survival rate about 20%. There is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets associated with EAC biology. NEK2 is the first identified human NEK (Never in mitosis A (NIMA) related kinase) gene among the 11 serine\/threonine kinases family. Aberrant NEK2 expression is reported in a variety of human cancers and plays important roles in tumorigenesis, progression, and drug-resistance. However, the expression of the NEK2 in EAC and its precancerous condition (Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, BE) has not been investigated. Using bioinformatic approaches, we first analyzed the TCGA and 9 GEO databases (a total of 10 databases in which eight contain EAC and 6 contain BE) and found that NEK2 was significantly upregulated in EAC as compared to normal esophagus in 7 of the 8 databases. Meanwhile, genomic alterations of NEK2 are only found in 1.2% of EAC. We validated the overexpression of NEK2 using qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry in EAC cell lines and in primary EAC tissues. Functionally, we demonstrated that overexpression of NEK2 in EAC cells promoted tumor cell growth. Targeting NEK2 in EAC cells significantly inhibited EAC tumor growth. Our data suggests that frequent overexpression of NEK2 plays an important role in EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Gene expression,Tumor growth,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"L.

The H2AZ1 and H2AZ2 isoforms, collectively known as H2A.Z, are histone variants that regulate gene expression, stem cell identity, and differentiation during development and in homeostatic tissue. Most tumors originate from epithelial tissues. We utilize skin epidermis, an accessible model of epithelial tissue, to understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling proliferation and differentiation. Primary human epidermal keratinocytes retain their abilities to proliferate, differentiate, and stratify in vitro. First, we observed that progenitor keratinocytes express high levels of H2A.Z mRNA and protein, and that H2A.Z levels significantly and progressively decrease during four days of calcium-induced differentiation. Using ChIP-sequencing, we find a significant, genome-wide decrease in H2A.Z chromatin occupancy in differentiated keratinocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that H2A.Z is critical for progenitor function. Knock down of either H2AZ1 or H2AZ2 significantly impaired keratinocyte proliferation in holoclone assays. Furthermore, H2AZ1 or H2AZ2 knockdown inhibited epidermal stratification in organotypic culture. Canonically, two chromatin remodeling complexes, SRCAP and EP400, deposit H2A.Z into nucleosomes. While both SRCAP and EP400 knockdown diminish keratinocyte proliferation, only SRCAP knockdown decreases H2A.Z deposition in epidermal keratinocytes. Finally, we find that MEK and ERK signaling is required to sustain expression of SRCAP, H2AZ1, and H2AZ2. MEK or ERK inhibition is sufficient to significantly decrease H2A.Z occupancy genome-wide in progenitor keratinocytes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Proliferation,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In general, SS is refractory to chemotherapy and other therapeutic approaches. SS18-SSX does not directly bind to DNA but instead alters BAF complexes away from a wild-type SS18-containing cBAF complex towards a SS18-SSX- containing ncBAF complex to drive a SS-specific transcription program. Small molecule targeted therapies are expanding beyond the kinome, providing additional tools to treat cancers that are not yet amenable to targeted therapies. Here we demonstrate that SS18-SSX activates the SUMOylation program and SS are sensitive to the small molecule SAE1\/2 inhibitor, subasumstat (TAK-981). Mechanistically, we demonstrate TAK-981 de-SUMOylates the cBAF\/PBAF complex member, SMARCE1, leading to stabilization and restoration of cBAF complexes. This phenotypic shift leads to a DNA damage and cell death response, resulting in tumor inhibition across mouse models of SS. As such, TAK-981 combined with standard-of-care chemotherapy enhances SOC-induced DNA damage, leading to tumor regressions. Targeting the SUMOylation pathway in SS restores cBAF complexes, positioning it as a clinical candidate to treat this refractory cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Sumoylation,DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The significance of MYC acetylation and functions of specific acetylated lysine (K) residues have remained unclear. Here, we show that the major p300-acetylated K148(149) and K157(158) sites in human (or mouse) MYC and the main GCN5-acetylated K323 residue are reversibly acetylated in various malignant and non-malignant cells. Oncogenic overexpression of MYC enhances its acetylation and alters regulation of site-specific acetylation by proteasome and deacetylase inhibitors. Acetylation of MYC at different K residues differentially affects its stability in a cell type- dependent manner. Lysine-to-arginine substitutions indicate that although none of the acetylated K (AcK) residues is required for MYC stimulation of adherent cell proliferation, individual AcK sites have gene-specific functions controlling select MYC-regulated processes in cell adhesion, contact inhibition, apoptosis, and\/or metabolism, and are required for the malignant cell transformation activity of MYC. Each AcK site is required for anchorage-independent growth of MYC-overexpressing cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, and both the AcK148(149) and AcK157(158) residues are also important for the tumorigenic activity of MYC-transformed cells in vivo. These AcK residues may also preferentially activate transcription via facilitating MYC binding to several cancer-associated target gene promoters and via enhancing RNAP II recruitment. With the knowledge that MYC lysine residues can be acetylated by HATs GCN5 and P300, some HATs and HAT associated cofactors (i.e. YEATS2 and PIN1) are important for MYC recruitment to DNA binding. By identifying MYC acetylation-dependent coregulators and their oncogenic function, we proposed to understand whether and how MYC acetylation residues cooperate with its cofactors and influence malignant transformation in breast cancer cells.Overall, this study will uncover the functions and mechanisms of MYC acetylation in regulation of malignant transformation and the impact on breast cancer initiation and progression. By analyzing deregulated target genes and MYC-relevant coactivators, the MYC AcK site-specific signaling pathways identified may offer new avenues for selective therapeutic targeting of MYC oncogenic activities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Acetylation,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Malignant Transformation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Targeting eIF4E has long been considered a promising anticancer strategy but it has remained undruggable using conventional screening approaches. Fragment-based crystallographic screening is a powerful technique for probing the surface of proteins to identify potentially druggable binding sites. Here, we describe fragment-based screening using a combination of Xray crystallography and NMR to identify low affinity fragment hits binding to the mRNA cap-binding site or at an additional site of unknown functional relevance (site 2). Subsequent rounds of iterative structure-based design yielded a lead molecule, with 100nM binding potency for site 2, that could disrupt the eIF4E:eIF4G interaction and inhibit cap-dependent translation in cell lysates. To explore the functional relevance of site 2 we established a cell model expressing an eIF4E-FKBP12F36V fusion protein that was sensitive to degradation following treatment with the heterobifunctional dTAGV-1 molecule. Degradation of eIF4E resulted in inhibition of cell growth and reduced expression of MCL1 protein, that were rescued by re-expression of a non-degradable wild-type eIF4E. A mutation reported to block canonical eIF4G binding (W73F) disrupted binding to eIF4G but to our surprise retained the ability to rescue the eIF4E degradation phenotype. Mutation of site 2 (L85R and L134R) also disrupted the eIF4E:eIF4G interaction. The L85R mutant remained able to partially rescue the cellular responses, in contrast to the L134R mutant that could not rescue eIF4E loss. The W73F\/L85R double mutant resulted in a combinatorial loss of eIF4E function. Despite disrupting eIF4E function in lysates, there was a significant drop-off of compound activity in cells. However, treatment of the W73F mutant with compound recapitulated the combination of the W73F canonical eIF4G binding mutation with the L85R site 2 mutation. This approach demonstrates the power of coupling fragment screening with target-degradation and genetic rescue approaches to find and explore novel functional pockets. Our data suggest it may be necessary to disrupt the extended protein-protein interaction made by both the canonical and non-canonical regions of eIF4E to drive a strong functional effect in cells. However, the discovery of a lead compound, the associated structural understanding, and the knowledge that one site 2 mutation inactivates eIF4E provides hope that a significantly more potent small molecule inhibitor or degrader could drive a more profound cellular effect which may lead to improved cellular activity and a deeper understanding of eIF4E biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translation,EIF4E,Inhibitors,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Mutations that drive ccRCC in conjunction with near ubiquitous and early VHL loss include, PBRM1 (33 - 45%), BAP1 (15%) and SETD2 (13%). Loss of SETD2 leads to diminished occupancy of H3K36me3 in active gene bodies, which is progressively deregulated in primary RCC and metastasis, linking loss of H3K36me to tumor progression and metastasis. N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is an important post-transcriptional regulator of RNA transcript stability and half-life. Preliminary findings have shown H3K36me3 (deposited by SETD2), targeting the core m6A methyltransferase machinery (METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP) to the mRNA by virtue of its interaction to METTL14 subunit. The goal of this study is to investigate if H3K36me3 depletion as observed in SETD2 mutant ccRCC, leads to a deregulated m6A methylome. We further investigate how deregulated methylome in key pathways leads to cancer initiation and progression in ccRCC. To accomplish our goals, we generated isogenic ccRCC cell lines with H3K36me3 depletion by knocking out SETD2. RNA-immunoprecipitation and sequencing for m6A (MeRIP) showed global deregulation of m6A methylome in SETD2KO isogenic ccRCC cell lines. We also show a number of pro-tumorigenic genes and pathways including cell invasion, inflammation and stemness being differentially methylated and expressed in SETD2KO ccRCC cell lines. Furthermore, we show SETD2KO cells being more sensitive to METTL3 inhibition suggesting the relevance of m6A hypermethylated transcripts in promoting pro-tumorigenic and growth promoting processes in SETD2KO ccRCC cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing,Tumor progression,Post-transcriptional regulation,Kidney cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

SIM2SV was significantly correlated with YTHDF1 m6A-readers and m6A-NTMT1 writer, suggesting important roles of SIM2SV in CRC oncogenicity. m6A-sequencing identified m6A enrichment in 5&#8217;-UTR of SIM2SV gene which further verified. siNTMT1 and siYTHDF1 manipulation in HCT116 and RKO cell lines verified a decrease in SIM2SV gene\/protein expression, and m6A level. Knockdown effects also showed decrease in cell proliferation, clonogenicity and induced cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase for NTMT1 and YTHDF1 versus SIM2 Knockdown showed cell cycle arrest in S\/G2 phase. Our investigation revealed the role of new writer NTMT1 for methylated SIM2SV gene expression in colorectal cancer proliferation via m6A-YTHDF1(as &#8220;decoder&#8221;) dependent manner. Further investigation on m6A modification specifically on SIM2 mRNA revealed the essential roles of its writer NTMT1 and its reader YTHDF1 in CRC development, evidently supporting the importance of the unique landscape of m6A epigenetic modification in colorectal neoplasm, which not only advance our understanding of CRC pathobiology but also provides a new set of molecular targets for building up effective tools to fight CRC.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Colorectal cancer,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

ERG is not normally expressed in the adult prostate. The normal function of ERG is confined to hematopoietic stem cells and blood vessels. Aberrant expression of ERG in prostate epithelial cells is oncogenic when combined with mutations that activate the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway. The RAS\/MAPK pathway can also regulate ERG function through direct phosphorylation of ERG by ERK. The function of these regulatory events and how they can be exploited to develop therapy for ERG-positive prostate cancer remains unclear. Here we find that ERG expression in prostate epithelial cells with low PI3K\/AKT pathway activity drives epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stemness properties. This function requires ERG phosphorylation via a positive feedback loop with the TLR4 signaling pathway, and can be repressed by a TLR4 inhibitor. However, activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway rearranges the ERG cistrome and alters ERG function, where ERG now promotes luminal epithelial differentiation. In the presence of activated AKT, new ERG targets include genes involved in vascular development and ERG phosphorylation is regulated through a positive feedback loop with the VEGF signaling pathway. Despite these differences in cellular differentiation, we find that ERG can promote stemness and tumorigenesis in both AKT-high and AKT-low cellular backgrounds. ERG functions in prostate epithelial cells appear to mirror ERG functions in hematopoietic stem cells and blood vessels. These findings suggest strategies of combinatorial inhibition of ERG function through signaling pathway inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Transcription factor,Akt,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Saranya Rajendran<sup><\/sup>, <b>Peter C.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) is a key regulator of ribosomal subunit association that is over expressed in many cancers including lung, colon, ovarian and breast cancers, and deregulation of eIF6 is correlated with a poor cancer prognosis. Association of eIF6 with 60S is critical for 60S assembly. However, eIF6 must be released from 60S prior to translation to permit inter subunit interactions between 60S and 40S and to facilitate the formation of translationally proficient 80S monosome. Release of eIF6 is deregulated in the ribosomopathy- Shwachman Diamond Syndrome that is predisposed to leukemias. Also, loss of eIF6 markedly delays tumorigenesis without affecting normal growth, which presents eIF6 as a viable therapeutic target. A potential therapeutic strategy is to target the eIF6 and 60S ribosomal interaction interface. Through biophysical analyses we had identified residues that are critical for the interaction between eIF6 and 60S ribosomal subunit. We show that targeting these key residues in the eIF6-60S interaction interface markedly delays colonic cancer growth and inhibits protein synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the levels of other eIFs and the release factors: SBDS, and EFL1-GTPase are unaltered in the mutant cells suggesting that the translational inhibition is primarily attributed to the deregulation of eIF6. Interestingly, targeting eIF6 leads to an upregulation of p53 independent of the DNA damage response, suggesting that ribosomal stress contributes to the stabilization of p53. Previously, it was shown that translation of Cdc42 was upregulated by eIF6 to promote invasiveness. However, Cdc42 levels were unaltered in the mutant cells. Future studies will determine the mRNA substrates that are translationally deregulated in the mutants. We will also determine the effect of disrupting eIF6 function in inhibiting tumor growth and progression <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Category: MCB, Subcategory: MCB07-Gene regulation sub classification: Translational Control","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translation,Gene regulation,Cancer therapy,p53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The activated signaling causes nuclear accumulation of &#946;-catenin, which leads to the elevated expression of target genes of TCF\/LEF (T-cell factor\/lymphoid enhancer factor) transcription factors through their interaction with nuclear &#946;-catenin. Recent studies have identified a lot of genes induced by this pathway such as <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>CCND1<\/i>,<i> AXIN2<\/i>, and <i>LGR5<\/i>, and clarified their roles in tumorigenesis. However, the roles of the genes down-regulated by the pathway remain to be elucidated. Our previous study revealed that the histidine ammonia-lyase gene (<i>HAL<\/i>) encoding an enzyme involved in the catabolism of histidine was down-regulated by the signaling pathway in liver cancer. In addition, we identified a region that is involved in the Wnt-dependent regulation of <i>HAL<\/i>. To clarify the regulatory mechanism of <i>HAL<\/i> by the pathway, we searched for transcription factors that are associated with the regulatory region, and identified CEBPA and FOXA1, two liver-enriched transcription factors. It is of note that the expression of these factors was reduced by the TCF\/&#946;-catenin complex. Further investigation identified arginase 1 (<i>ARG1<\/i>) encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine as another target gene of CEBPA and FOXA1. Consistent with these data, inhibition of the Wnt signaling increased the expression of ARG1 as well as HAL in liver cancer cells. Furthermore, the up-regulation of HAL and ARG1 by the inhibition of this pathway decreased intracellular concentrations of histidine and arginine, suggesting that the Wnt signaling plays an important role in cellular metabolism through the regulation of the two transcription factors. These findings shed light on the role of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway in the metabolism of amino acids in liver cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Saya Nakagawa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kiyoshi Yamaguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kiyoko Takane<sup>1<\/sup>, Sho Tabata<sup>2<\/sup>, Tsuneo Ikenoue<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoichi Furukawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Cancer Center, Yamagata, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50fce246-6e43-4e8d-83b3-5da949c7e6ad","ControlNumber":"6341","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

In addition, my preliminary studies show that NAT10 is a stress response that promotes the resilience of cancer cells to anti-tumor drugs. However, the underlying mechanisms by which NAT10 promotes cancer growth and drug resistance are unknown.&nbsp;NAT10 is an RNA acetyltransferase, where it acetylates cytidines in rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, and lncRNAs. Our previous work demonstrated that NAT10 promotes translation efficiency and mRNA stability through the acetylation of cytidines in mRNA.&nbsp;However, NAT10 is a multifunctional protein.&nbsp;Besides acetylating&nbsp;RNA, NAT10 also acetylates proteins at lysine residues, has RNA helicase activity,&nbsp;and can serve as a scaffold in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Based on this complexity, it is imperative to elucidate whether NAT10 exerts its oncogenic activity via RNA acetylation, protein acetylation,&nbsp;disruption of RNA structures,&nbsp;or non-catalytic functions. Strikingly, our preliminary results indicate that the acetyltransferase function of NAT10 is dispensable for cell proliferation. To evaluate NAT10&#8217;s oncogenic activity unbiasedly, we are now performing a deep mutagenesis scanning (DMS) assay. For this purpose, we generated a library of mutants in hundreds of NAT10 residues. This library was transduced in multiple cell lines from acute myeloid leukemia and liver cancer carrying a PROTAC system, which allow us to deplete NAT10 in a rapid and controlled manner while expressing ectopically thousands of NAT10 mutants. In this conference, I will talk about, my results, how DMS is a powerful tool to delineate the molecular functions of candidate oncoproteins, and the implications of our results for the potential drugging of NAT10 in cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>Keywords: Cell proliferation, NAT10, RNA modifications, Deep mutagenesis scanning.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,NAT10,Cell Proliferation,Deep Mutagenesis Scanning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Multiple GWAS signals are detected within the <i>TERT<\/i> genomic region at chr 5p15.33. As a potential proxy for these signals, we investigated a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)2-1 within intron 2 of <i>TERT, <\/i>with 57-143 copies of a 42 bp repeat unit per allele. By functional annotation of VNTR2-1, we predicted that it generates an intronic transcript antisense to <i>TERT<\/i> with a variable-size open reading frame (ORF) of 2502-5211 bp (834-2038 aa).<br \/>Specific to the <i>TERT<\/i>-antisense transcript, we predicted N6-methyladenosine (m6A) consensus motifs within each 42 bp unit of VNTR2-1, with longer VNTR2-1 regions carrying more m6A motifs. In a stranded RNA-seq dataset of African pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL) tumors, which have high <i>TERT<\/i> expression, we detected the VNTR2-1-containing <i>TERT<\/i>-antisense transcript in a subset of tumors (n=35\/113, 30.9%), confirming the expression of this novel transcript. VNTR2-1 expression was also experimentally validated by 5&#8217;-RACE\/Nanopore-seq in Raji (BL cell line) and UMUC3 (bladder cancer cell line). Additionally, the VNTR2-1 transcript was visualized in UMUC3 cells using RNA-FISH.<br \/>The consensus 42 bp VNTR2-1 repeat sequence and its m6A-deficient variants were cloned into a m6A-deficient dual-luciferase reporter vector (m-psiCHECK-2) and expressed in UMUC3 cells, showing an m6A-motif dose-dependent response driving luciferase protein expression. Transient treatment with STM2457, an inhibitor of the m6A writer METTL3, reduced the expression of the luciferase reporter, confirming that m6A motifs within VNTR2-1 are methylated by METTL3. Additionally, Long-term cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) treatment of UMUC3 reduced luciferase expression, suggesting alterations of VNTR2-1 m6A due to smoke exposure.<br \/>We explored potential peptides produced from VNTR2-1 transcript by analysis of public mass spectrometry datasets using PepQuery and identified several unique VNTR2-1 peptide fragments in human tumors. Next, we cloned a synthetic FLAG-tagged gene containing three VNTR2-1 consensus repeats with native Kozak sequence and translation start\/stop codons. Western blotting confirmed the translation of the VNTR2-1 peptide that was ablated by start codon mutation, suggesting that the native Kozak sequence is sufficient for VNTR2-1 translation. These results support VNTR2-1 as a peptide-producing transcript.<br \/>In conclusion, we identified a novel intronic transcript produced by VNTR2-1 antisense to <i>TERT. <\/i>This m6A-regulated transcript could function through several mechanisms, such as a lncRNA or translated peptide, potentially regulating <i>TERT<\/i> expression and telomerase function in health and disease conditions, including cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TERT,Epitranscriptomics,Structural Variation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.
