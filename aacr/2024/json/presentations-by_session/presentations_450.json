In the TME, macrophages adopt diverse phenotypic alterations, giving rise to heterogeneous immune activation states and induction of cell cycle. While the transcriptional profiles of these activation states are well-annotated across human cancers, the underlying signals that regulate macrophage heterogeneity and accumulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged a novel ex vivo organotypic TME (oTME) model of breast cancer, in vivo murine models, and human samples to map the determinants of functional heterogeneity of TME macrophages. We identified a subset of F4\/80high Sca-1+ self-renewing macrophages maintained by type-I interferon (IFN) signaling and requiring physical contact with cancer-associated fibroblasts. We discovered that the contact-dependent self-renewal of TME macrophages is mediated via Notch4, and its inhibition abrogated tumor growth of breast and ovarian carcinomas in vivo, as well as lung dissemination in a PDX model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Through spatial multi-omic profiling of protein markers and transcriptomes, we found that the localization of macrophages further dictates functionally distinct but reversible phenotypes, regardless of their ontogeny. Whereas immune-stimulatory macrophages (CD11C+CD86+) populated the tumor epithelial nests, the stroma-associated macrophages (SAMs) were proliferative, immunosuppressive (Sca-1+CD206+PD-L1+), resistant to CSF-1R depletion, and associated with worse patient outcomes. Notably, following cessation of CSF-1R depletion, macrophages rebounded primarily to the SAM phenotype, which was associated with accelerated growth of mammary tumors. Our work reveals the spatial determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in breast cancer and highlights the disruption of macrophage self-renewal as a potential new therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor associated macrophages,Immunomodulation,Stromal-epithelial interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Nir Ben Chetrit<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Niu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesus Sotelo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ariel  D.

This TME is characterized by a fibrotic stroma and an abundance of immunosuppressive cells, notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs crucially hinder effector T cell activity and contribute to T cell exhaustion. Redirecting TAMs toward an immunostimulatory state has emerged as a promising approach in PDAC treatment. Recent investigations, including our own studies, reveal a profound influence of metabolic pathways on the immune phenotype of TAMs. Specifically, dysregulation in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism has been observed in PDAC patients, manifesting as elevated circulating BCAA levels correlating with a doubled risk of PDAC development. However, the extent to which BCAA metabolism influences TAM phenotype and anti-tumor immune responses remains a largely unexplored territory, presenting a challenge for PDAC treatment. Our focus revolves around understanding how heightened BCAA levels in PDAC affect TAM phenotype, the immunosuppressive tumor environment, and tumor progression. Employing an orthotopic PDAC model and genetically modified mice, specifically BCKDKfl\/fl BCKDK LysMcre\/+ (mimicking increased BCAA oxidation), alongside a BCKDK-targeting pharmacological inhibitor (BT-2), multicolor flow cytometry, and in vitro models, our research has revealed crucial insights. We found a diminished expression of BCAA oxidation genes in TAMs compared to normal pancreatic macrophages. Interestingly, M1 and M2 macrophages seemed to utilize BCAAs differently, reflected in varying levels of TCA cycle intermediates derived from BCAA oxidation. Notably, boosting BCAA oxidation specifically in TAMs through genetic modifications resulted in reduced PDAC growth associated with an enhanced immunostimulatory TAM phenotype and activation of CD8+ T cells in the TME. Conversely, administering BCAAs induced an immunosuppressive TAM phenotype, fostering PDAC growth, suggesting a direct influence of BCAAs on TAM phenotype. Pharmacologically enhancing BCAA oxidation via BT-2 bolstered immune activation within the tumor environment and reduced PDAC growth. Intriguingly, our analysis of publicly available data unveiled a significant correlation between high BCAA oxidation and favorable responses to anti-PD1 therapy in cancer patients. Our findings emphasize the pivotal role of BCAA metabolism in shaping the immune landscape of PDAC, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting TAMs and mitigating TME immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Neural invasion (NI) is a common feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), accounting for distant metastasis and local recurrence. However, the mechanism by which tumor associated nerves (TANs) regulate anti-tumor immunity remains largely elusive. Here, we investigated the association between TANs and immunosuppressive TME to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for PDAC. Using tumor samples of PDAC patients, we identified that the nerves invaded by cancer cells showed increased adrenergic activation accompanied with no parasympathetic or sensory innervation changes. Patients with severe NI were associated with increased catecholamine levels. Additionally, single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptome analysis of tumors from patients with PDAC revealed that peri-neural niches of severe NI patients were characterized by decreased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and increased activity of M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T (Treg) cells, which was validated by multiplexed immunofluorescence staining. We further identified that CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing &#946;-adrenaline receptors (&#946;-ARs) reduced proliferation and cytokine production when exposure to catecholamines in a dose-dependent manner or co-cultured with dorsal root ganglia pretreated with cancer cells. Kras<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup>; p53<sup>LoxP<\/sup>; Pdx1-CreER (KPC) mice treated with catecholamines accelerated tumor progression by inhibiting T cell-mediated antitumor responses, which was abrogated by surgical sympathectomy of KPC mice.

We suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of inhibiting anti-tumor immunity that can promote cancer progression mediated by TANs invasion.

Using ContactTracing&#8212;a newly developed, validated and benchmarked tool to infer the nature and conditional dependence of cell-cell interactions from single-cell transcriptomic data&#8212;we show that CIN-induced chronic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway promotes downstream signal re-wiring in cancer cells, leading to a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment. This re-wiring is manifested by type I interferon tachyphylaxis selectively downstream of STING and a corresponding increase in cancer cell-derived endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Reversal of CIN, depletion of cancer cell STING or inhibition of ER stress response signaling abrogates CIN-dependent effects on the tumor microenvironment and suppresses metastasis in immune competent, but not severely immune compromised, settings. Treatment with STING inhibitors reduces CIN-driven metastasis in melanoma, breast and colorectal cancers in a manner dependent on tumor cell-intrinsic STING. Finally, we show that CIN and pervasive cGAS activation in micronuclei are associated with ER stress signaling, immune suppression and metastasis in human triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting a viable strategy to identify and therapeutically intervene in tumors spurred by CIN-induced inflammation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Tumor microenvironment,Innate immunity,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

PDACs are typically immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and do not often respond to currently approved immunotherapy treatment approaches. How aging may alter non-malignant cells, such as fibroblasts and immune cell populations, in the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) to decrease anti-tumor immune responses is not understood.<br \/>We identified that aged microenvironments significantly alter the growth and progression of PDAC tumors. Orthotopic KPC and Panc02 mouse PDAC cell line injections into the pancreata of aged (&#62;64-week-old) compared to young (6-8-week-old) C57BL\/6 mice result in more rapid tumor growth and increased frequency of liver metastases <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumors from aged mice have high expression of the TGF&#946; family member GDF-15 and hyperactivation of AKT signaling driven by the release of secreted factors from aged pancreatic fibroblasts.<br \/>We found that in aged microenvironments there is a marked reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells and an increase in FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in primary orthotopic pancreatic tumors using the KPC and Panc02 models. In addition, we performed portal vein injections to establish liver metastases to study the differences in immune cell infiltration in metastases from young vs. aged microenvironments. Aged mice form more and larger liver metastases compared to young mice, and metastatic lesions in aged mice have decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration when compared to young mice.<br \/>Since tumors in aged microenvironments have increased AKT activation compared to young microenvironments, we next tested if AKT signaling was sufficient to alter immune cell infiltration in PDAC tumors. In young mice, treatment with recombinant GDF-15, which activates AKT signaling, reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumors. Conversely, in KPC tumors grown in aged mice treated with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206, there was a trend toward increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and a significant reduction in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ Tregs.<br \/>Together, these data highlight age-dependent differences in the immune infiltration in PDAC tumors. They suggest that activation of AKT signaling can drive features of immunosuppression in PDAC, providing the rationale for targeting AKT signaling to improve antitumor immune responses in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Aging,Pancreatic cancer,Akt,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

Unfortunately, there are few clinical features that predict which patients will recur, relegating patients and their doctors to a wait-and-see approach where they must remain vigilant. Recent studies have reported that the presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow of early-stage breast cancer patients predicts a higher chance of recurrence and that obese patients experience 35%-40% higher rates of recurrence than lean patients. Interestingly, in addition to increased adipocyte size, obese patients experience higher rates of adipocyte apoptosis, macrophage recruitment to adipocyte tissue, and increased inflammation, shown as the formation of crown-like structures (CLSs). Given the rising prevalence of obesity, the need for mechanistic studies to elucidate its contribution to breast cancer dormancy and recurrence is urgent. To investigate how microenvironmental changes associated with obesity affect breast cancer dormancy, we utilized a well-established syngeneic mouse model of ER+ breast cancer dormancy (D2.0R). We found that D2.0R cells remained dormant in the visceral fat of wildtype mice but were reactivated upon adipocyte death due to obesity or genetic manipulation, and this reactivation required the recruitment of macrophages. To understand why macrophages were recruited to the adipose tissue and how they led to dormant tumor cell reactivation, we profiled the microenvironmental changes in visceral fat using single-cell RNA-sequencing and found that the infiltrating macrophages exhibited unique pro-inflammatory and lipid regulatory phenotypes. Further investigation revealed that macrophages activated the integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway in dormant D2.0R cells and the inhibition of integrin and FAK inhibited this activation. Given tumor cells can metastasize to visceral fat depots in breast cancer patients, our findings provide an important model to determine what drives dormant tumor cell growth in adipose tissue. Our study provides novel insights into how tumor microenvironment (TME) impacts breast cancer dormancy and also highlights the importance of adipose tissue as a unique reservoir that potentiates cancer relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Dormancy,Microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Current methods, such as enzymatic labeling and proximity-based tagging, allow the experimental tracking of these interactions but are not compatible with sequencing-based readouts, which are essential for high-throughput analyses. We have developed a highly scalable intercellular barcode transfer technology that bridges this gap. Our novel &#8220;Relay&#8221; technology offers a scalable solution to monitor cell-cell interactions with unprecedented single-cell resolution, seamlessly integrating with existing high-throughput and sequencing platforms. Relay employs RNA barcodes to mark and track cell interaction events, providing definitive quantitative data on cell interaction partners. We used Relay to track interactions between cancer cells and T cells, capturing both potent antigen-specific engagements and subtler contacts involved in antigen sampling. Additionally, by integrating CRISPR libraries with Relay, we pioneered a novel approach for pooled CRISPR screens, focusing on intercellular interactions across different cell types. In this context, the cell harboring genetic perturbation may differ from the cell under analysis. To demonstrate this, we are conducting genome-wide perturbations in cancer cells and interrogating cancer cell factors that affect antigen sampling and trogocytosis by T cells and macrophages. Beyond its application in CRISPR screening, Relay can also be used with single-cell RNA sequencing to directly track and measure immune-cancer and immune-immune cell interactions at the single cell level. We applied single-cell Relay to a dendritic cell-T cell system to link dendritic cell signatures to T cell signatures based on direct cell contact and regulatory signaling. The design of Relay as a highly modular system extends its utility beyond cancer research, making it broadly applicable across various biological models and systems where cell-cell communication is a fundamental property in complex multicellular settings. This tool promises to accelerate the transition from theoretical understanding to practical exploration of cell-cell interactions, with profound implications for immunology, oncology, and beyond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Single cell,T cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.
