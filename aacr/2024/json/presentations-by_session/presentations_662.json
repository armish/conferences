In preclinical models of PDA, the HDAC inhibitor entinostat modulated the transcriptional programming of myeloid cells, reducing their capacity for immunosuppression and sensitizing tumors to ICI therapy.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We conducted a single-center, open-label, Simon two-stage, phase II study of entinostat in combination with the PD1 inhibitor nivolumab in patients with advanced PDA. Patients received oral entinostat 5 mg once a week. After a 14-day lead-in with entinostat monotherapy, patients concurrently receive entinostat 5 mg orally once a week plus nivolumab 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks. After 4 months, therapy was continued with entinostat 5 mg weekly plus nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg fixed dose every 4 weeks until the time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Peripheral immune profiles at baseline and on treatment were assessed by high-dimensional mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and by Luminex of chemokines in the plasma, and changes in the TME were performed on paired baseline and on treatment biopsies by multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC), image cytometry-based quantification, and bulk RNA-seq analysis.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>From November 2017 to November 2020, 27 evaluable patients were enrolled. Three patients had a partial response (PR) by RECIST v1.1 criteria (objective response rate (ORR)) of 11%, 95% CI, 0.024-0.292), with a median duration of response of 10.2 months. Grade &#8805;3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 19 (63%) patients. The most common grade &#8805;3 TRAEs were decreased lymphocyte count, anemia hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. Dendritic cell (DC) activation, maturation, migration, antigen processing, and presentation were increased in the periphery after entinostat treatment, consistent with HDAC inhibitor mediated myeloid reprogramming. Gene expression analysis of paired baseline and on treatment tumors demonstrated an enrichment in inflammatory response signaling pathways with combination treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Entinostat and nivolumab demonstrated durable radiological responses in a subset of patients with PDA. Paired tissue and peripheral analysis showed immunomodulation of myeloid cell populations, consistent with the preclinical hypothesis supporting the trial. This study creates a roadmap for this strategy with future combinatorial therapeutic approaches to enhance the clinical benefit in PDA patients further.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Prior FLAURA analyses showed detected BL plasma EGFRm to be prognostic and early clearance of plasma EGFRm correlated with improved outcomes. We explored correlation of BL plasma EGFRm detection, and its clearance, with PFS in FLAURA2 to determine its potential to identify pts who derive particular benefit from osi + CTx.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Treatment-na&#239;ve pts with EGFRm (Ex19del or L858R) advanced NSCLC were randomized to osi + CTx (osi 80 mg once daily [QD] + pemetrexed 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> + cisplatin 75 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> or carboplatin AUC5 every 3 wks [Q3W] for 4 cycles, followed by osi 80 mg QD + pemetrexed 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> Q3W) or osi alone (80 mg QD). BL and wk 3\/6 plasma EGFRm were analyzed by ddPCR (Biodesix). Clearance was defined as undetected EGFRm circulating tumor DNA at wk 3\/6, where it was detected at BL. Median PFS (mPFS) was investigator-assessed per RECIST 1.1.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>In total, 421\/557 pts had an evaluable BL plasma ddPCR result, of who 308 had detected BL plasma EGFRm. Of pts randomized to osi alone, pts with non-detected BL plasma EGFRm had longer mPFS* vs those with detected BL plasma EGFRm. Of pts with evaluable BL and wk 3\/6 plasma ddPCR results, plasma EGFRm was detected at wk 3\/6 in 19\/12% of osi + CTx-treated pts, and 29\/11% of osi-treated pts, respectively (Table).<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>In this exploratory analysis, detected BL plasma EGFRm was prognostic and appeared predictive of clinical benefit with osi + CTx vs osi alone. Detection of BL plasma EGFRm may identify a subgroup of pts deriving most benefit from the addition of CTx to osi. Although within each treatment arm plasma EGFRm wk3 clearance correlated with improved PFS, the relative benefit of osi + CTx vs osi alone was similar, suggestive that on-treatment EGFRm clearance is only prognostic in this setting.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{F83870F8-0FD8-4CAB-A8DA-B1E9C7293F0C}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Osimertinib + CTx&nbsp;<\/b><b>(evaluable BL ddPCR, n = 212)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Osimertinib (evaluable BL ddPCR, n = 209)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Osimertinib + CTx vs osimertinib <\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mPFS (mo)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mPFS (mo)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><b>Baseline plasma EGFRm<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Detected<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">147<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">161<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.9*<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.60 (0.45, 0.80)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not detected<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">65<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.3*<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.93 (0.51, 1.72)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><b>EGFRm clearance \/ non-clearance at 3 weeks<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Clearance<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.51 (0.35, 0.75)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No clearance<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">40<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.62 (0.33, 1.14)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\">*Not detected vs detected in the osimertinib arm: mPFS HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.35, 0.76).

TALA + ENZA significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Previous analyses focused on the association of tumor HRR gene muts with outcome; here, we examined TALA + ENZA efficacy in pts with &#8805;1 non-HRR gene mut with\/without HRR gene muts.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is a post-hoc exploratory agnostic analysis of a TALAPRO-2 dataset of prospectively collected\/retrospectively analyzed plasma ctDNA (FoundationOne&#174;Liquid CDx). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Overall, 616 pts in the intent-to-treat population had non-HRR gene muts with\/without HRR gene muts; 98 (16%) pts had <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> fusions. In these 616 pts, TALA + ENZA improved rPFS vs PBO + ENZA (Table). TALA + ENZA improved rPFS in pts with <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i>, <i>RB1,<\/i> or <i>MLL2<\/i> muts, and objective response rates (ORR) in pts with <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> or <i>RB1<\/i> muts and measurable disease at baseline (the association of <i>MLL2<\/i> with enhanced rPFS was lost without <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i>, not shown).<br \/>In pts with non-HRR gene muts and no HRR gene muts (n=427), TALA + ENZA showed improvement in rPFS vs PBO + ENZA. Enhanced rPFS benefit with TALA + ENZA vs PBO + ENZA was noted in pts with <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, or <i>MLL2<\/i> muts, but <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> ORRs were similar across treatment arms.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>TALA + ENZA improved outcomes compared with PBO + ENZA in patients with muts in specific non-HRR genes (regardless of HRR gene muts). <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i> and <i>RB1<\/i> emerged as candidate predictive biomarkers for differential efficacy favoring TALA + ENZA vs PBO + ENZA. PARP inhibitors may induce a synthetically lethal interaction with <i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i>-mediated inhibition of non-homologous end joining and help overcome <i>RB1<\/i>-mediated ENZA resistance.<br \/><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{8D2614FE-D4FF-4182-AA5D-528161E0D521}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b> &#8805;1 non-HRR gene muts<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>&#8805;1 non-HRR gene muts with no HRR gene muts<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Median rPFS, mo<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>Median rPFS, mo<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>HR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Gene mutation<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TALA + ENZA (N=310)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBO + ENZA (N=306)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TALA + ENZA (N=218)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBO + ENZA (N=209)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Any non-HRR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.63 (0.50&#8211;0.80)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.66 (0.49&#8211;0.89)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>TMPRSS2-ERG, [n]<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25.9 [n=43]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.0 [n=55]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.36 (0.20&#8211;0.64)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.4 [n=32]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.0 [n=44]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.40 (0.20&#8211;0.76)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>MLL2, [n]<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.2 [n=20]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.8 [n=20]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.43 (0.19&#8211;0.98)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR [n=8]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.2 [n=11]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.50 (0.14&#8211;1.74)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RB1, [n]<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.8 [n=14]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.9 [n=8]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.22 (0.07&#8211;0.73)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.8 [n=6]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.8 [n=3]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.40 (0.05&#8211;2.92)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>ORR, % (n\/N)<sup>a<\/sup><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>OR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\"><b>ORR, % (n\/N)<sup>a<\/sup><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>OR (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TALA + ENZA (N=96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBO + ENZA (N=105)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TALA + ENZA (N=62)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PBO + ENZA (N=75)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>TMPRSS2-ERG<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">56 (13\/23)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">41 (7\/17)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.54 (0.12&#8211;2.27)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">53 (9\/17)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">47 (7\/15)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.78 (0.16&#8211;3.85)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>MLL2<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">64 (7\/11)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">70 (7\/10)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.33 (0.15&#8211;12.60)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i>RB1<\/i><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62 (5\/8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0\/6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.00 (0.00&#8211;0.75)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ND<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\">CI, confidence interval;

In preclinical studies, we showed that sequential administration of bortezomib (BTZ) prior to TMZ depleted MGMT protein, abrogated autophagic flux and sensitized uMGMT GBM cells to TMZ. Thus, a phase I\/II was launched to investigate clinical benefit. An interim analysis based on Simon&#180;s MinMax design (where at least 2 patients should show clinical benefit amongst the first 15 evaluable patients) would allow the study to continue to full recruitment. Clinical benefit, was defined by progression free survival and or objective radiological complete (CR), partial (PR) responses or stable disease (SD) based on RANO criteria at 6 months and 1-year follow-up. This study aimed to identify the biological mechanisms underlying the objective responses in the initial 15 recurrent GBM patients treated in this trial.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Adult recurrent GBM patients with uMGMT promoter, progressing &#8805;12 weeks after radiotherapy, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &#8805;70 and with measurable lesions were enrolled. They received BTZ 1.3mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> IV on days 1,4,7, during each 4-week cycle starting on day 3 with per oral TMZ at 200mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> 5 days\/week. The sample size was powered for n=63 patients. Quantitative LC-MS\/MS was used to identify novel biomarkers that correlate with objective treatment responses by determining proteomic changes in plasma collected on days 1,4,7,11,15 and 22 during first cycle of treatment. Targeted sequencing of 360 cancer genes and whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor DNA were conducted to identify associated molecular genetic changes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The 15 patients had median age 52 yrs (range 25-62 yrs), 10 male and 5 female treated at Haukeland University Hospital in Norway. Median KPS was 90 (70-100) and median NANO score was 1 (0-7). 27% (n=4\/15) of patients obtained objective radiological responses, where 2\/4 (50%) obtained PR and 2\/4 (50%) had SD. LC-MS\/MS revealed significantly increased (p&#60;0.05) levels of proteins important for regulation of cell death and apoptosis (ADAMTS13, HPR, HBD, CLU and APOE) in objective responders compared to the rest of the patients. Sequential BTZ+ TMZ therapy was safe, tolerated and platelet nadirs consistently normalized by day 22 of each cycle. Proteins associated with platelet activation, aggregation and degranulation (ACTN1, ITGB3, PLEK, PPBP, THBS1, TF, TAGLN2, TLN1, PFN1, VCL and FERMT3) were significantly upregulated (1.6-4.8 fold, p&#60;0.05) on day 15 and 22 compared to baseline in patient plasma. Preliminary analysis of sequencing data identified EGFR gain-of-function mutation in 3 of the 4 responder patients; potentially distinguishing this as a molecular biomarker for the objective treatment responders.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Sequential BTZ+TMZ therapy is safe and effective as indicated by objective radiological response. Activation of tumor cell death and apoptosis pathways was observed specifically in objective responders. The interim criteria were fulfilled as 4 amongst the first 15 patients showed clinical benefit.
