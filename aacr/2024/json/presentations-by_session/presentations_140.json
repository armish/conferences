As many cancer drivers are epigenetically deregulated master regulators of tissue specification, there is a paucity of mutated oncogenic drivers limiting kinase inhibition and immune checkpoint inhibition therapeutic strategies. The childhood cancer research community has collaborated over the past decade to develop new immunoncology (IO) strategies as many of these will be pediatric cancer specific and the likelihood that most therapies being developed for adult cancers will be applicable to children with cancer. This presentation will focus on our comprehensive strategy to discover novel pediatric cancer IO targets on the plasma membrane both in terms of novel lineage restricted oncoproteins as well as peptides derived from key intracellular driver oncoproteins presented on common HLA alleles. We use the term oncoprotein as one of the key prioritization principles in selecting targets to develop into IO therapies is their essentiality to tumor, thus reducing the likelihood of immune escape via antigen downregulation. Clinical development of the first of the first in each class of IO target will be discussed and future opportunities presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Immuno-oncology,CAR T cells,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John M.
