For these reasons, interpreting the functional impact of mutations in pediatric cancer patients has remained difficult. One approach to interpreting rare coding mutations is to analyze the convergence of these mutations on larger structural and functional units, such as protein complexes, super assemblies, biomolecular condensates, and organelles. Towards this aim, we created a cancer cell map in the osteosarcoma cell line based on proteome-wide integration of protein interactions and immunofluorescent imaging in U-2 OS pediatric bone cancer cells. This multiscale integrated cell map of U-2 OS cell organizes 5,254 proteins into 270 protein assemblies. Using this multiscale cell map, we analyze 772 genomes from 18 cancer types reported in the DKFZ pan-pediatric cancer study to identify 25 protein assemblies in the map under mutational pressure. This analysis reveals mutated protein assemblies involved with chromatin maintenance and remodeling as well as cell integrity and mobility. For example, we identify a Collagen Biosynthesis and Remodeling Complex, as mutated in 9 cancer types and 15 patients in the dataset, indicating extracellular matrix remodeling is associated with pediatric cancer progression. We also identify a putative biological condensate, which we call the Nuclear Transcription Suppression Complex (NTSC). This protein assembly is found mutated in 20 patients across 10 cancer types, implicating intrinsically disordered proteins in development of pediatric cancer. Overall, this work illustrates how a global multiscale map of cell architecture enables a mechanistic understanding of clinical patient genomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Systems biology,Genomics,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Resistance eventually develops, such as through AR-activating alterations, leaving few targeted options for patients. Here, we utilize data from 4,509 prostate cancer patients with longitudinal clinical and DNA\/RNA sequencing data to elucidate mechanisms of resistance and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in resistant disease. By constructing comprehensive regulatory networks, termed hybrid networks, built across different disease stages, combining features from WGCNA, causal mediation analysis, probabilistic causal network inference, and public knowledge graphs, we uncover subnetworks strongly associated with disease progression and resistance. These subnetworks reflect biological processes for cell cycle, E2F, DNA repair, MYC, and AR, comprehensively identifying broad transcriptional changes that drive disease progression and resistance.<br \/>Selected subnetwork scores, derived from RNA expression, were significantly associated with outcomes in both the hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant settings, demonstrating that the subnetworks capture early and late resistance. The hybrid networks identified the transcriptional co-activators CREBBP and EP300 as key modulators of these subnetworks, suggesting that targeting CREBBP\/EP300 may be effective in treating both early and late-stage disease. Prostate cancer cell lines were treated with FT-6876, a small molecule inhibitor of CREBBP\/EP300, and growth inhibition was measured in both enzalutamide sensitive and resistant cell lines, covering a wide range of resistance mechanisms. The selected subnetworks were enriched for genes down-regulated following treatment with FT-6876, suggesting that targeting CREBBP\/P300 addresses multiple resistance-related pathways. Differential changes in protein abundance and protein acetylation between enzalutamide sensitive and resistant cell lines identified changes in fatty acid metabolism as a common, downstream event in response to treatment with FT-6876, suggesting an additional mechanism for response to FT-6876.<br \/>Together, our integrated theoretical and experimental analyses support the hypothesis that targeting CREBBP\/EP300 may provide therapeutic benefits to prostate cancer patients. Further, the subnetworks identified may serve as mechanistically-informed biomarkers for identifying patients who may benefit from inhibition of CREBBP\/EP300.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

In several cancers, tumor cells become plastic in response to target inhibition, changing their identity and molecular programs without acquiring further mutations. In the case of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with standard-of-care, next-generation anti-androgens enzalutamide, tumor cells often switch lineage to survive drug pressure, acquiring neuroendocrine (NE) features and thereby transforming into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE). Existing targeted therapies for CRPC and CRPC-NE provide limited benefit, representing an unmet clinical need. Hence, the elucidation of tumor plasticity and consequent heterogeneity that contribute to drug resistance is of paramount importance to identify novel therapeutic opportunities.<br \/>We have recently developed a network-based precision cancer medicine framework to characterize molecular and drug sensitivity profiles of ~100 Genetically-Engineered Mouse Models (GEMM)-derived tumors of prostate cancer (Vasciaveo, et al. 2023). This study revealed that tumors derived from GEMMs with the loss of function of both Pten and Trp53 (NPp53) align with CRPC patients and exhibit high heterogeneity in regulatory programs and histopathologic features, including NE differentiation. We then adopted the NPp53 model to generate several 3D organoid lines in order to study tumor plasticity and heterogeneity. To elucidate their tumors&#8217; regulatory programs, we reverse-engineered genome-wide regulatory networks using multimodal single-cell RNASeq and ATACSeq data to identify Master Regulator (MR) proteins implementing tumor cell identities and characterize their epigenetic landscape.<br \/>Our network-based regulatory analysis identified several distinct cell populations, including cells activating epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) programs and NE differentiation, all resistant to enzalutamide treatment. Cross-species analysis aligned these cells to human CRPC and CRPC-NE tumors. In particular, our analyses have shed light into the roles of NSD2, a known MR of lethal prostate cancer, whose ablation restored sensitivity to enzalutamide.<br \/>In summary, we leveraged single-cell, multimodal data from CRPC and CRPC-NE 3D mouse organoids to elucidate regulatory programs of drug resistant, lethal prostate cancer and characterize its heterogeneity. Importantly, we also identified a mechanism that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention to restore tumor cells&#8217; sensitivity","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Drug resistance,Single cell,Neuroendocrine differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Treatment options for TNBCs are limited due to lack of tumor-specific targeted therapies, resulting in poor prognosis and patient survival. This is exacerbated by lack of prognostic markers of response. While current studies suggest tumor immune interactions are important, current immune activity quantifications, such as scores quantifying abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are not sufficient to define tumor immune status. We used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to measure 33 markers on primary tumors of 100 patients undergone chemotherapy with long-term follow-up to explore the tumor immune microenvironment of TNBCs. Concordant with previous studies, a higher ratio of T-cells was associated with response to chemotherapy and longer overall survival (adjusted p-value&#60;0.05). Moreover, using Kmeans clustering we identified 13 distinct cellular neighborhoods, reflective of the heterogenous nature of TNBCs. Among others, we identified a neighborhood, characterized by low CD14+ expression, low cytokeratin, high vimentin expression and high CD45RO, that contributes highest impact on correlation with overall survival (adjusted p-value&#60;0.01). These results suggest an important role for memory T cells in the stroma. Thus, resolving spatial organization of the tissue is important to understanding patient response to therapy in TNBCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Image analysis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and FGFR-targeted therapeutics have had limited success in bladder cancer when used as monotherapy. Emerging data suggests that the combination of these two therapies could lead to improved clinical outcomes. The optimal strategy for combining these agents remains uncertain. Mathematical models, and more specifically agent-based models (ABMs), have shown recent successes in uncovering the multiscale dynamics that shape the trajectory of cancer. They have enabled the optimization of treatment methods and identification of novel therapeutic strategies. To assess the combined effects of anti-PD-1 antibodies and anti-FGFR3 small molecule inhibitors (SMI) on tumor growth and the immune response, we built an ABM that captures key facets of tumor heterogeneity and CD8+ T cell compartments, their spatial interactions, and their response to therapeutic pressures.&nbsp; With our model, we quantify how tumor antigenicity and FGFR3 activating mutations impact disease trajectory and response to anti-PD-1 antibodies and anti-FGFR3 SMI. We find that even a small population of weakly antigenic tumor cells bearing an FGFR3 mutation can render the tumor resistant to combination therapy. However, highly antigenic tumors can overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by FGFR3 mutation. The optimal therapy depends on the strength of the FGFR3 signaling pathway. Under certain conditions, ICI alone is optimal; in others, ICI followed by anti-FGFR3 therapy is best.

As different tissue-specific working groups reviewed all of the available data, these patient samples were separated into distinct molecular subtypes, and these clusters were reported in various marker papers. While these assignments provided invaluable information about the common patterns of molecular characteristics in different types of cancer there was no consistent methodology for assigning new samples to these defined molecular subtypes.The NCI's Tumor Molecular Pathology group was formulated to create machine learning-based models that could be applied to non-TCGA samples and determine their TCGA mapped subtypes. Five modeling systems, JADBio, SKGrid by the Oregon Health and Science University, CloudForest by the Institute of Systems Biology, AKLIMATE by University of California Santa Cruz and subSCOPE by BC Cancer&#8217;s Genome Sciences Centre, were trained to recognize TCGA subtypes using multi-omic measurements from gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, copy number, and somatic mutation calls. While the TCGA samples were profiled using multi-omic technologies, single platform and\/or compact feature set models also were assessed for their ability to assign these classifications. Each machine learning system created predictive models for 106 subtypes from 26 cancer types using as few features as possible, with a maximum of 100 features allowed for scored models. A set of 411,706 models was developed, composed of results of each of the learning methods across the various omic platforms. Top models, both multi-omic and single platform, were selected for each cancer type. On average, models were able to achieve an overall weighted F1 score of 0.895 with 42 features. While the top models for each cancer type had an overall weighted F1 mean performance of 0.936 with a mean of 29 features, in 20 of the 26 cancer types models using only gene expression provided the best performance. Analysis of features selected by the models showed some known onco-drivers were selected by many models, but many times different models would utilize features of different genes with similar levels of performance. Network-level analysis revealed that many genes of these selected features operated within the same pathways.Transferability of these models to external datasets was tested, taking TCGA breast cancer trained models and applying them to AURORA and METABRIC datasets. Interestingly, despite the data platform difference between TCGA (RNAseq) and METABRIC (microarray), model performance saw only minimal degradation of F1 values in transfer. This set of models and the training dataset will provide new opportunities for researchers and translational scientists to connect new tumors to the subtypes seen in the TCGA cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Molecular subtypes,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Drug combinations can overcome heterogeneity by increasing the probability that a patient will have response to one or more drugs. This approach is successful in numerous disease settings, but technological advances have led to new approach to addressing heterogeneity: precision approaches to stratify patients into subpopulations with more uniform, stronger responses to specific drugs. These strategies can be implemented together to improve patient outcomes. We have developed computational mechanistic models of cancer treatment in the context of both sources of heterogeneity which explain and predict clinical outcomes of treatment of LBCL with combination therapy and CAR T-cell therapy.<br \/><b>Combination therapy:<\/b> Our novel population tumor kinetics (pop-TK) model simulates clinical combination therapy outcomes by implementing multidrug dose response functions in heterogeneous populations of tumor cells, within heterogeneous cohorts of patients. Informed by the outcomes of novel drugs in phase 2 trials in relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) patients, the pop-TK model accurately predicted of outcomes of seven first-line phase 3 trials of novel combinations. Most notably, informed by treatment of r\/r LBCL with polatuzumab-vedotin (pola), the pop-TK predicted the success of modifying the standard treatment regimen (RCHOP) with pola before the clinical trial results were published. The pola combination improves overall survival (OS) and PFS in Activated B-Cell (ABC) LBCL (hazard ratio (HR): OS 0.3, PFS 0.4), but reduces OS (HR: 1.6) and does not improve PFS (HR: 1.0) in Germinal Center B-Cell (GCB) LBCL. The subtype specific difference in PFS was also predictable based on subtype results of r\/r trials (predicted HR: ABC 0.3, GCB 0.9).<br \/><b>CAR T-cell therapy:<\/b> We used a population pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (pop-PK\/PD) model of CAR T-cell therapy to reproduce the PFS distribution and the distribution CAR T-cell abundance for CAR T therapy in r\/r LBCL patients. The impact of tumor size on patient outcome in our model and in clinical studies led us to computationally explore the impact treating smaller tumors with CAR T-cell therapy on treatment outcomes. We found that using detectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for administering CAR T-cell therapy immediately after RCHOP increased the proportion of simulated patients without a second disease progression event by 30% (HR: 0.43 [0.34, 0.55]).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The pop-TK model supports LBCL subtype biomarker for pola performance, and the pop-PK\/PD model demonstrates that detectable ctDNA is a potential biomarker for early CAR T-cell administration. These examples of model-driven precision trial design have the potential to improve outcomes using readily-available biomarkers and existing therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Combination therapy,CAR T cells,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
