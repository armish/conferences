[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> IMM0306 is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRP&#945; on both heavy chains. It exerts excellent cancer killing efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockade of CD47-SIRP&#945; interaction and Fc&#611;R engagement. Here, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy results of phase I in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R\/R) CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Eligible pts with R\/R CD20-positive B-NHL were enrolled in this open-label, multicenter phase I\/II study (NCT05805943). IMM0306 was administered as monotherapy at escalating doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 mg\/kg intravenously once a week after a 2-week single-dose observation period, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0, PK and PD analysis were also assessed, tumor assessments performed once every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As of Nov 21, 2023, 48 pts were enrolled. The median age was 56 years with 30 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy was 2. All pts received previous anti-CD20 therapy. No DLTs were observed. Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined as 2.0 mg\/kg. The most frequent treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were WBC decreased (66.7%), anemia (64.6%), lymphocyte decreased (58.3%), ANC decreased (47.9%), PLT decreased (45.8%), infusion-related reactions (35.4%). Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs occurred in 33 (68.8%) pts, the most frequent grade &#8805; 3 TRAEs were lymphocyte decreased (56.3%), WBC decreased (18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%). Eight (16.7%) pts experienced treatment related serious adverse event, including PLT decreased, chest pain and pneumonia. Drug discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 1 pt (G4 PLT decreased occurred at 1.6mg\/kg without any bleeding). No AE led to death. IMM0306 exhibited approximate dose-proportional increase in PK exposure from 0.5 to 2.0 mg\/kg and no obvious accumulation was observed after repeated dosing. At 1.2 mg\/kg, CD47 receptor occupancy on peripheral lymphocytes was saturated, suggesting IMM0306 is well tolerated from perspective of CD47 engagement in high dose cohorts. B-cell counts depleted rapidly at doses &#8805; 0.8 mg\/kg. Elevated cytokines levels were observed after first dosing of IMM0306, but multiple dosing did not stimulate further cytokine activation. Among 33 pts who received active doses &#8805; 0.8 mg\/kg, 5 CR (4 follicular lymphoma [FL], 1 marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), 5 PR (3 FL, 1 MZL, 1 diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and 11 SD were seen. Among 17 FL pts, 7 (41%) responded including 4 CR and 3 PR; among 6 MZL pts, 2 (33.3%) responded including 1 CR and 1 PR.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> IMM0306 was well-tolerated and with a robust preliminary anti-tumor activity especially in pts with R\/R FL and MZL.

JBH492 is a first-in-class CCR7-targeting ADC, comprising a humanized, Fc-silenced anti-CCR7 IgG1 antibody conjugated to maytansinoid microtubule inhibitor DM4 via a cleavable linker. Preclinical studies support avidity-driven differential binding in CCR7-high tumor cells compared to CCR7-low healthy immune cells, and <i>in vivo<\/i> animal studies demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in multiple clinically relevant lymphoma models (Dang et al. 2022).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is an ongoing first-in-human, open-label, phase I\/Ib, multi-center study in patients (pts) with relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) (NCT04240704), which completed enrollment for dose-escalation phase. Five dose levels of JBH492 monotherapy ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 mg\/kg (intravenous administration every 3 weeks [q3W]) were tested with 3 - 7 pts enrolled per dose level. Preclinical data from xenografts predicted tumor stasis at 1.6 mg\/kg q3W. The objective of dose escalation was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of JBH492 and to determine maximum tolerated and recommended doses. Pts with r\/r CLL and NHL, who failed standard of care therapy (at least 2 prior regimens) and who were intolerant\/ ineligible to approved therapies, were included; CCR7 expression confirmation was not required prior enrollment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Total 25 pts with r\/r stage II-IV NHL (n = 24, [adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, 3; cutaneous T cell lymphoma, 4; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 7; follicular lymphoma, 1; Mantle cell lymphoma, 1; marginal zone lymphoma, 2; peripheral T cell lymphoma, 3; others, 3]) and CLL (n = 1) with median age 69.0 y (43 - 85) were enrolled. Mean duration of exposure was 13.5 wks. One pt had dose-limiting toxicity &#8212; grade (G) 3 thrombocytopenia lasting for 13 d. Overall, 23 (92%) pts had at least 1 adverse event (AE) (G &#8805; 3, n = 11). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 15 (60%) pts (G &#8805; 3, n = 3). Of 6 (24%) pts who had serious AEs (SAEs) (G &#8805; 3, n = 3), 2 (8%) had TRSAE. The most frequent AEs (&#8805; 20%) included anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia and dry eye (20% each). Two deaths due to underlying disease were reported. PK for total ADC was roughly dose proportional.<br \/>Four NHL pts (2 T-NHL and 2 B-NHL) had partial response (PR) and 2 had stable disease, with PRs observed at doses between 2.4 and 3.6 mg\/kg q3W.

Investigational unengineered TIL cell therapy has shown promising activity in this setting, but co-administration of systemic high-dose IL2 limits pt eligibility and is associated with safety risks. OBX-115 is an investigational, autologous TIL cell therapy engineered to express membrane-bound IL15 (mbIL15) under pharmacologic regulation by the FDA-approved small-molecule drug acetazolamide (ACZ) using cytoDRiVE&#174; technology, to induce cytokine-driven TIL expansion and persistence without co-administration of IL2.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This Phase 1 first-in-human study (NCT05470283) is assessing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the OBX-115 regimen in pts with unresectable or metastatic melanoma progressing after ICI. Initial pts are enrolled into dose-escalation cohorts (n=3 each; maximum doses: Cohort 1 [C1], 30 &#215; 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells + ACZ 125 mg; Cohort 2b [C2b], 100 &#215; 10<sup>9<\/sup> cells + ACZ 125 mg). OBX-115 is manufactured using the pt&#8217;s tumor tissue (procured by surgical excision or core needle biopsy) and infused after completion of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion. ACZ is administered orally once daily for up to 7 days, with redosing (Week 6, up to 7 days) permitted for pts without radiographic response at Week 6. No systemic IL2 is administered. The primary objective is to evaluate safety (dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] and treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of<b> <\/b>1 December 2023, 6 pts (age, 28-64 y; C1, n=3; C2b, n=3) with ICI-resistant metastatic melanoma completed the DLT-evaluation period.

However, clinical benefit is limited by BRAF dimer-promoting resistance mutations, toxicity from paradoxical activation of signaling in BRAF wild-type cells, and poor brain penetration. Further, current RAF inhibitors are ineffective against non-V600 BRAF mutants. Next-generation agents that cause pan-RAF inhibition may more broadly target BRAF mutants but are limited by a narrow therapeutic index. PF-07799933 (ARRY-440) is a brain-penetrant BRAF-selective monomer\/dimer inhibitor that spares ARAF and CRAF.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b> We characterized PF-07799933 in patient (pt)-derived BRAF-mutant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We investigated PF-07799933 in pts with refractory BRAF-mutant solid tumors using a novel first-in-patient phase 1 design that enabled flexible, rapid dose escalation based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) assessments.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b> PF-07799933 inhibited signaling in vitro, disrupted BRAF-containing homo- and heterodimers, and caused less paradoxical signaling than approved agents. PF-07799933 alone and in combination with binimetinib inhibited tumor growth systemically and in the brain in mouse xenografts harboring de novo and acquired BRAF dimer-forming mutations. As of August 24, 2023 data cutoff, 30 pts with BRAF-mutant cancers started PF-07799933 treatment at 50 mg QD-450 mg BID as monotherapy (60%) or combination with binimetinib (27%) or cetuximab (all colorectal cancer [CRC]) (13%). Tumor types were melanoma (mel) (43%), CRC (17%), primary brain (PBT) (13%), thyroid (10%), and other (n=1\/3% each). BRAF mutations were class I (V600E) (73%), Class II (13%), and class III (13%). All BRAF V600E+ cancer pts were previously treated with &#8805;1 approved BRAFi and all BRAF V600E+ mel pts also were previously treated with &#8805;1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. PF-07799933 was well-tolerated as monotherapy or combination. There were no DLTs and the MTD was not reached. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in &#8805;3 pts for monotherapy were fatigue (any grade 44%\/grade &#8805;3 0%), headache (28%\/0%), vision blurred (22%\/6%), and lipase increased (16%\/0%). The most common TEAEs for combination were peripheral edema (33%\/0%), acneiform rash, diarrhea, and fatigue (each 28%\/0%). The AE profile was consistent with less paradoxical signaling activation. PK-guided dose escalation enabled PF-07799933 efficacious concentrations to be reached by dose level 3 (225 mg BID), together with multiple confirmed responses in BRAF V600E+ cancer pts (n=4\/7 at 225 mg BID &#177; binimetinib, includes 1 complete response [CR] in a BRAF V600E+ PBT pt) systemically, in the brain, and all after failure of approved BRAF inhibitors. A 5<sup>th<\/sup> confirmed response (2nd BRAF V600E+ PBT pt) occurred after data cutoff. This includes, to our knowledge, the first evidence of efficacy in a BRAF V600E+ pt with a dimerizing BRAF splice variant. A BRAF G466E+ (class III) adenoid cystic carcinoma pt had a molecular CR in ctDNA.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b> PF-07799933 treatment was associated with anti-tumor activity against BRAF V600- and non-V600-mutant cancers preclinically and in treatment-refractory pts. The novel, rapid PK-informed dose escalation design provides a new paradigm for accelerating testing of next-generation targeted therapies early in clinical development.<br \/><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER<\/b> NCT05355701","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Targeted therapy,Phase I,Novel clinical trial design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

The last treated patient achieved CR. Three other post-transplant patients, including two active CNS diseases, eventually died of the infection. One of the patients achieved minimal residual disease negative CR. The other two patients did not undergo laboratory evaluation, but their CNS symptoms disappeared. Once the expansion of CAR-T cells was detected, the proportion of CD8+T cell in CD3+T cells increased dramatically, rapidly reaching 77.8~91.2% and maintaining above 50% for a long time in all treated patients.

VISTA has been shown to maintain tumor microenvironment (TME) in an immunosuppressive state. Its expression is reported as a resistance mechanism to immune checkpoint blockers, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. Preclinical data showed that VISTA blockade mediates antitumor activity by activating the antitumor immune response and is enhanced in combination with anti-PD-1. W0180 is a humanized, Fc competent, IgG1 antibody targeting VISTA with high affinity. This study investigates W0180 with\/ without pembrolizumab (pembro) in patients (pts) with solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts initially received W0180 monotherapy in dose escalation (3.5-600 mg weekly (QW)). Following evaluation of the first 3 dose levels in monotherapy, dose escalation of W0180 (60 to 300 mg QW) in combination with pembro (200 mg Q3W) started in pts treated with prior anti-PD-(L)1. Objectives were to characterize safety and tolerability of W0180, determine RDE and PK\/PD on blood and paired tumor biopsies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> By October 2023, 33 pts were treated in dose escalation, 24 pts with W0180 monotherapy and 9 pts with W0180 + pembro. Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed, Grade 2 subacute cerebral infarction and Grade 3 infusion related reaction (IRR). Overall, 33 pts experienced &#8805;1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). Most common TEAEs were IRR (32\/33), fatigue (14\/33), and anemia (11\/33). Grade 3\/4 TEAEs occurred in 23 pts, neutropenia (6\/23) and anemia (6\/23) were the most common. There was no treatment-related death. 6 (18%) pts discontinued due to AEs. Following the observation of Grade 3 arterial thromboembolism (n=1) and Grade 2 subacute cerebral infarction (n=1), eligibility criteria were amended to require adequate lipid profile, troponin and exclude pts with history of arterial thrombotic events and current smoking. W0180 PK was nonlinear with a rapid clearance at 3.5-600 mg doses. No objective response was observed but 5 pts had stable disease (SD) lasting for &#62;16 weeks. One pt with appendix cancer treated at 600mg monotherapy had SD for &#62;15 months. One pt with head and neck cancer treated at 300mg in combination had SD for 13 months.

CF33-hNIS selectively replicates in tumor cells and promotes anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report results on a first-in-human phase 1 dose escalation study of CF33-hNIS, administered intratumorally (IT) or intravenously (IV) in adult patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors (MAST).<br \/>Methods: The MAST study is evaluating the safety of CF33-hNIS administered IT or IV, alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with &#8805; 2 prior lines of therapy (NCT05346484). CF33-hNIS is administered in 21-day cycles on C1D1 and C1D8, then D1 of each cycle thereafter. Pembrolizumab begins C2D1 for the combination groups and is administered Q3W. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 follows a 3+3 dose escalation scheme independent of each route of CF33-hNIS administration (IT and IV) and for each therapy regimen (monotherapy and combination therapy) with up to 7 dose levels of CF33-hNIS ranging from 8.6x105 to 3.0x109 PFU. Part 2 is a cohort expansion in select indications at the optimal dose. The co-primary endpoints are safety and identification of the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, and assessment of viral replication in tumor lesions via Single-Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT).<br \/>Results: As of Dec 2023, 36 patients have been treated in Part 1 of the study with a median age of 59 (range 23-81). Twenty-two (61%) patients were heavily pretreated with &#8805;3 prior lines of systemic therapy, and 14 (39%) received prior treatment with checkpoint blockade. Treatment-related adverse events consisted predominantly of &#8216;flu-like&#8217; symptoms, such as grade 1\/2: fatigue (31%), pyrexia (22%), and chills (14%). No dose-limiting toxicities have occurred. The highest dose treated to date is 1.1x108 PFU by IT and IV delivery; dose escalation continues. In the IT cohorts (14 patients), 7 of 15 (47%) injected lesions had a reduction in tumor burden, three lesions were completely eradicated. Three patients (21%) had an objective response: one complete response by iRECIST in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma; and two partial responses in patients with melanoma by RECIST. In IV cohorts (17 patients), 53% of patients achieved stable disease as their best response. Patients who received prior checkpoint blockade therapy derived clinical benefit with and without pembrolizumab. Viral replication, assessed by SPECT was higher in patients that saw a reduction in tumor burden. Immunological changes in peripheral blood and tumor biopsies will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: CF33-hNIS alone or in combination with pembrolizumab is a safe treatment option for advanced cancer patients. Encouraging efficacy has warranted advancement to part 2 of this study with a cohort expansion of patients with cholangiocarcinoma and other tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

During Phase 1a, subjects are enrolled in a 3+3 dose escalation to STK-012 as monotherapy (QW or Q3W) or STK-012 + pembrolizumab (Q3W) followed by Phase 1b expansions.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Phase 1a and preliminary Phase 1b data are being presented for STK-012 monotherapy. As of Oct 23rd, 2023, 45 subjects were treated at 7 dose levels (DL) across 2 schedules (QW at 0.375 mg and 0.75mg; Q3W at 0.75mg-3mg). The most common tumors were NSCLC (35.6%) and RCC (20%). The most common treatment related AEs (TRAEs) were maculo-papular rash (38%), injection site reactions (28.9%), fatigue (28.9%), and nausea (24.4%). Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 12 subjects (26.6%) and included maculo-papular rash (4), vomiting (2), nausea (1), diarrhea (1), enterocolitis (1), arthralgia (1), urticaria (1), periorbital edema (1), blood creatinine increase (1) and leukocytosis (1). One subject had a Grade 4 TRAE of anaphylaxis in Cycle 9 after the data extract date. TRAEs were reversible, and no subjects had Grade 5 TRAEs. No subjects had capillary leak syndrome and &#60;5% experienced other IL-2 hallmark TRAEs (hypotension [4.4%], AST\/ALT increase [0%], pyrexia [4.4%], peripheral edema [4.4%]). No DLTs were observed. The maximum administered dose of STK-012 was 3mg Q3W. A DL of 2.25mg Q3W was advanced into Phase 1b based on safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data.<br \/>Peripheral PD data showed STAT5 phosphorylation in CD25+ T cells and a dose dependent increase in activated T cells (Ki-67+CD38+CD8+) and serum IFN&#947;. Expansion of NK cells and Tregs was limited. STK-012 has a half-life<sub> <\/sub>of 4 days. Of 38 efficacy evaluable subjects, 3 had a partial response (PR) and 17 had stable disease as best overall response by RECIST V1.1. The PRs included 2 confirmed (anti-PD-1 r\/r NSCLC and RCC) and 1 unconfirmed (anti-PD-1 r\/r SCCHN) with the RCC subject in response for over 9 months with treatment ongoing. After the data extract date, a fourth subject achieved a PR (confirmed) with 80% reduction in target lesions (anti-PD-1\/CTLA-4 and TKI r\/r RCC) with treatment ongoing.

In preclinical studies, M6223 combined with BA (a bifunctional fusion protein that simultaneously targets the TGF&#8209;&#946; and PD-(L)1 pathways) enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to either agent alone.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This first-in-human, dose escalation study of M6223 as monotherapy (M6223; Part 1A) or in combination with BA (M622&#173;&#173;3+BA; Part 1B) included pts with advanced solid tumors (aged &#8805;18 years, ECOG PS &#8804;1) (NCT04457778). In Part 1A, pts received M6223 at 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg, 900 mg, 1600 mg, 2400 mg (all Q2W) or M6223 2400 mg Q3W. In Part 1B, pts received M6223 at 300 mg, 900 mg, or 1600 mg, all in combination with BA 1200 mg (both Q2W, IV). Dose escalation decisions by the Safety Monitoring Committee were assisted by a Bayesian 2-parameter logistic regression model. Primary objectives were safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Additional objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and clinical activity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> At final analysis, 40 pts (21 male, age range 24-79 years) had received M6223 (Q2W: n=32; Q3W: n=8), and 18 pts (7 male, age range 34-80 years) had received M6223+BA. Overall, two dose-limiting toxicities were observed: a grade 3 adrenal insufficiency (M6223, 900 mg) and a grade 3 anemia (M6223+BA, 300 mg; unrelated to M6223). In the M6223 group, grade &#8805;3 TEAEs were observed in 14 (35.0%) pts and M6223-related grade &#8805;3 TEAEs in 2 (5.0%) pts. In the M6223+BA group, grade &#8805;3 TEAEs were observed in 14 (77.8%) pts and M6223-related grade &#8805;3 TEAEs in 4 (22.2%) pts. No MTD was identified. RDEs were 1600 mg Q2W or 2400 mg Q3W for M6223 monotherapy, and 1600 mg+1200 mg Q2W for M6223+BA. Half-life for the two monotherapy RDEs were 9.0 and 14.6 days, respectively, with moderate accumulation at the selected RDEs. Linear PK was observed for M6223 at 100-2400 mg Q2W and at 2400 mg Q3W; co-administration with BA did not change the PK profile of M6223. PD analyses in blood showed full and sustained TIGIT target occupancy, and depletion of suppressive Tregs at M6223 &#8805;900 mg. Paired biopsies in the M6223 group (900 mg Q2W, 1600 mg Q2W, 2400 mg Q3W; n=12) showed a trend of decrease in TIGIT<sup>+<\/sup> and increase in CD226<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Median overall survival was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.9, 12.0) and median progression-free survival was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). No pt achieved an objective response (per RECIST v1.1); stable disease as the best response was observed in 13 (32.5%) pts in M6223 and 5 (27.8%) pts in M6223+BA.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> M6223 monotherapy and in combination with BA had a manageable safety profile, and RDEs for both mono- and combination therapy were defined.

In preclinical studies in immunocompetent cancers, BC3402 demonstrated synergy when combined with mAbs to PD-1 and\/or CTLA-4, supporting a rationale for combination strategies in the clinic. As a first step, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BC3402 monotherapy was evaluated in patients (pts) with advanced solid malignancies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In this phase I, open-label study, multiple doses of BC3402 were explored in pts with advanced solid cancers who had been previously treated with standard therapies to evaluate its safety and tolerability and recommend doses for further development. An accelerated titration design was used to select doses in the first two dose levels (0.02 and 0.2mg\/kg IV Q3W) followed by a standard &#8220;3+3&#8221; design in the remainder of the study (1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg\/kg IV Q3W).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Nineteen pts (median [range] age: 59 [29-73]; 63.2% male; 94.7% ECOG 1) were treated with at least one 3-week cycle of BC3402. DLT was not observed, and adverse events (AEs) were not dose related. The most common TEAEs (incidence &#8805;20%) and TRAEs (incidence &#8805;10%) were grade 1-2. The most common (incidence &#8805;10%) TEAE &#8805; grade 3 was dysphagia (2\/19 pts, 10.5%), which occurred in the 5 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg dose cohorts. Two pts reported grade 3 or above TRAEs -- grade 3 hypertension (5 mg\/kg) and grade 3 gamma-glutamyl transferase increase (10 mg\/kg), There were neither dose interruptions nor treatment discontinuation due to AEs.

Preclinical studies have shown that RC402 remodels the tumor immune microenvironments and elicits potent anti-tumor immunity, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: This Phase I clinical trial (ACTRN12620000777998) was designed to evaluate the safety profiles and antitumor efficacy of intratumoral (IT) RC402 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy and with accessible tumor lesions for IT injection of RC402. For the dose-escalation part (Phase 1a), the RC402 monotherapy dose was evaluated at 3 dose levels in Part A and the RC402 combination therapy dose with pembrolizumab was evaluated at 2 dose levels in part B using an accelerated titration method followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation. In the dose-expansion part (Phase 1b), patients were treated with IT RC402 in combination with pembrolizumab at the recommended dose selected from the dose escalation part. RC402 was IT injected on day 1 of each treatment cycle. Fixed-dose pembrolizumab (200mg Q3W) was intravenously administered on day 8 of each treatment cycle for Phase 1a Part B and Phase 1b.

All patients showed an initial increase in antireoviral antibody titers on day 1 of cycle 2, followed by a decrease in subsequent cycles.<br \/>Conclusion: This first-in-human study demonstrated IT RC402 is well tolerated and has a manageable safety profile with preliminary clinical activity as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

FAP is selectively overexpressed in many solid tumors. The peptide moiety linker (pre|CISION<sup>TM<\/sup>) prevents cellular entry of doxorubicin unless cleaved by FAP, thus enabling targeted delivery of doxorubicin to tumors.<br \/><b>Design<\/b>: The safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of AVA6000 was studied in a first-in-man, multicenter dose escalation phase I trial. AVA6000 was administered intravenously q3w using a standard 3+3 design in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors reported to be FAP-positive. PK (AUC) based dosing was implemented to calculate maximum cycles of AVA6000 with the cumulative limit of 550 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Forty patients (median age 65 years, range 30-79), with median 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 0-7) received escalating AVA6000 doses from 80mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (51 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> doxorubicin; molar equivalent, 0.675) to 385 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (260 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> doxorubicin equivalent). Tumor types included soft tissue sarcoma (30%), colorectal cancer (27.5%), pancreatic cancer (20%), cancers of the biliary tract (7.5%). The safety profile was favorable, the most frequent adverse events (any grade) being fatigue (50%), alopecia (42.5%), and nausea (32.5%), with rare grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities of neutropenia (7.5%), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and WBC decreased (5% each). Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities included mucositis, fatigue and hematemesis (n=1 each). No grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities were reported. Two DLTs were observed of grade 2 cardiac failure (120 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>; LVEF decrease 61 to 39%) and grade 4 neutropenia\/ thrombocytopenia (200 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). AVA6000 distributes rapidly with a t<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>of 45 min. The Cmax of released doxorubicin was reduced as compared to standard dose doxorubicin (range 78-93% reduction) across dose cohorts. Tumor biopsy data demonstrate concentration of doxorubicin in the TME of mean 860 ng\/gm (range 76-2310 ng\/gm, n=9). In contrast, blood samples taken with the biopsy demonstrate a circulating free doxorubicin of 8.3 ng\/ml (range 2.4-15.9), indicating concentration of doxorubicin in the tumor relative to plasma. Using RECISTv.1.1, one PR (-65%) with duration of 6 months was observed in a patient with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma at 160 mg\/m2, and a mixed response in a patient with angiosarcoma (SLD -22%) at 200 mg\/m2. The disease control rate was 50%, at 12 wks. In each case, SD &#62; 4 months or PR was associated with high FAP enzyme activity in the on-study tumor biopsy compared to observed disease progression as best response (n=6).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: AVA6000 delivers high concentration of doxorubicin to the TME relative to plasma which results in antitumor activity in tumors with high FAP activity.

Tislelizumab 200 mg IV was given on Day 8 of the 28&#8209;day Cycle 1 and Day 1 of all subsequent 21&#8209;day cycles. Primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of BGB&#8209;10188 + tislelizumab.

The median age was 61 years. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-11) and 97.7% of patients had metastatic disease at study entry. 84.1% (37 of 44) of patients had &#8805;1 adverse event (AE) related to either study drug. 81.8% (36) of patients had &#8805;1 BGB&#8209;10188-related AE, of which the most common (&#8805;10%) were nausea (22.7%, n=10), decreased appetite (18.2%, n=8), fatigue (18.2%, n=8), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (13.6%, n=6), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (11.4%, n=5), and rash (11.4%, n=5). Two patients discontinued study drug treatment due to BGB&#8209;10188-related AEs. Three dose-limiting toxicities for BGB&#8209;10188 + tislelizumab were observed: grade (Gr) 5 pneumonia and Gr 5 intracranial hemorrhage at 160 mg, Gr 3 ALT\/AST increase at 320 mg, and Gr 3 rash at 540 mg. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The confirmed objective response rate was 9.1% (4 of 44) and the disease control rate was 31.8% (14 of 44). The plasma exposure to BGB-10188 exhibited a dose-dependent increase across a range of 20 mg to 540 mg. The peak concentration of BGB-10188 typically occurred ~2 hours post dose.

Targeting PD-L1 expressing tumor cells may directly drive tumor regression, whereas targeting PD-L1 expressing immune cells may release immunosuppression and drive tumor immune recognition. MT-6402 also delivers an HLA-A*02 restricted cytomegalovirus (CMV) class I antigen into PD-L1 expressing cells (antigen seeding) that can be recognized by existing CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells. A first-in-human dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part B) study with a weekly intravenous administration of MT-6402 in 4-week cycles was initiated in 2021. Safety and tolerability are primary objectives. Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic data are also collected. As of 10Dec2023, 53 total patients (pts) with PD-L1-expressing advanced solid tumors received &#8805; 1 dose of MT-6402: 48 pts in Part A ranging in dose 16 to 100 &#181;g\/kg and 5 pts in Part B at 63 &#181;g\/kg, just below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 83 &#181;g\/kg. MT-6402 was well tolerated in Part A, completed Sept2023. 5 dose limiting toxicities have been reported: a Grade (G)3 maculopapular rash at 24 &#181;g\/kg, a G3 infusion related reaction at 63 &#181;g\/kg, a G1 cardiac troponin T increase leading to dosing hold for &#8805;2 weeks at 83 &#181;g\/kg, a G3 maculopapular rash at 100 &#181;g\/kg, and a G1 cardiac troponin T increase at 100 &#181;g\/kg. There were no G4 or G5 drug-related adverse events. In Part B, pts with PD-L1 scores of TPS &#8805; 50% will be treated at MTD or lower and 5 pts have been treated at 63 &#181;g\/kg. Signs of antitumor activity have been reported including a long-lasting PR with 70% tumor reduction have been observed in a pt with CPI-refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma on treatment 14+ cycles at 63 &#181;g\/kg. This pt has a PD-L1 TPS score of 2% indicating immune cell clearance may have driven the response. The most common cancer in Part A is Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (10 pts). Pharmacodynamic effects include a significant reduction in peripheral PD-L1+ immune cells, indicating a PD-L1 target-specific effect. Substantial alterations in serum cytokines associated with the tumor microenvironment were noted after each dose in most pts in a dose dependent manner. Most pts display increased CD8\/CD4 ratios with IL-2 and TNF&#945; cytokine release, indicative of immune activation due to elimination of immune cells. CMV-specific CD8 T-cells exhibited a pattern of extravasation from the periphery in HLA-A*02+\/CMV+ pts suggesting antigen seeding.<b><\/b> These results describe a novel approach to checkpoint modulation by MT-6402 with targeted cell killing and altered tumor immunophenotype, particularly in HLA-A*02\/CMV+ pts.

TQB2916, a humanized IgG2 CD40 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated CD40 agonistic activity and promising anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies. A first-in-human study of TQB2916 single agent in advanced solid tumors and lymphomas is ongoing (NCT05213767).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, adequate hematologic and organ function and refractory to standard therapies met inclusion criteria. TQB2916 was given intravenously every 3 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The objective is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TQB2916.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>From April 2022 to November 2023, 18 patients with solid tumors and 2 with lymphoma have been treated with TQB2916 monotherapy, and were assigned to 7 cohorts (0.5 mg n=1, 2.5 mg n=1, 12.5 mg n=3, 60 mg n=3, 200 mg n=7, 300 mg n=2, and 400 mg n=3). Three dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed: one with grade 3 pneumonia and one with grade 4 lipase\/amylase increase in the 400 mg cohort; one with grade 3 pancreatitis in the 300 mg cohort. All patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The most common TRAEs were lipase increase (n=15, 75%), amylase increase (n=14, 70%), lymphocyte count decrease (n=13, 65%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (n=12, 60%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increase (n=12, 60%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase (n=11, 55%), hypoalbuminemia (n=11, 55%), and anorexia (n=11, 55%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 5 (25%) patients. Most of TRAEs were of grade 1 or grade 2 and manageable. Sixteen patients were evaluated for efficacy, and 3 of them achieved stable disease as per immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (iRECIST) and lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC). The pharmacokinetics were well-behaved with increasing exposure dose-proportionally and no accumulation occurred after repeated dosing. The C<sub>max<\/sub>, AUC<sub>(0-t)<\/sub> and T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> of<sub> <\/sub>400 mg single dosing<sub> <\/sub>were 109&#177;21.8 &#956;g\/ml, 611&#177;228 d*&#181;g\/mL and 5.54&#177;3.37 d.

Both peptides serve as antigenic determinants for HSP90 and act as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) inducing activation of type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Th1 cell immunologically elicited by AST-021p secrete cytokines, including IFN-&#947;, and activate local antigen presenting cells (APC) enhancing cross priming at the tumor site. This immunological activity, through the mechanism of cross priming, sequentially leads to the activation of cytotoxic T cells and epitope spreading. In preclinical studies using the MMTV neu gene overexpressing mouse model, the administration of the HSP90 peptide vaccine, AST-021p, significantly inhibited tumor growth. Based on these scientific rationales, The first-in-human (FIH) study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of AST-021p in advanced solid tumor patients have no treatment option.<br \/>Methods: Phase 1 study (CornerStone-002, NCT No.: 04864418) was conducted on patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors for whom applicable standard treatment options were unavailable (patient enrollment period: June 9, 2021, to June 14, 2023). Four-dose cohorts of AST-021p (Cohort 1: 1.2mg, Cohort 2: 2.4mg, Cohort 3: 3.6mg, Cohort 4: 4.8mg) received three vaccinations at 2-week intervals (Priming immunization) followed by boosting immunization with 4-week interval based on PI's discretion. Enrolling one patient initially in the lowest dose cohort, Cohort 1 (1.2mg), dose escalation occurred sequentially after confirming safety and tolerability. Subsequently, each dose cohort (Cohort 2: 2.4mg, Cohort 3: 3.6mg, Cohort 4: 4.8mg) enrolled six patients each for vaccination. Antigen-specific immune response was assessed by IFN&#947; ELISPOT using PBMCs from the subjects at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.<br \/>Results: During the study period, a total of 22 patients were enrolled (Cohort 1: 1, Cohort 2: 6, Cohort 3: 8, Cohort 4: 7). The median age of the patients was 66, with a gender distribution of 14 males and 8 females. Among the 22 patients, 20 completed the priming immunization with 3 vaccinations, and 7 of them proceeded with the boosting immunization. A total of 75 adverse events were reported in 21 patients (95.5%). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 15 patients (68.2%), accounting for 92 cases. The most common ADR was injection site reaction (ISR), observed in 15 patients (68.2%), with 35 cases and all reactions were graded as 1 or 2. Serious adverse events (SAEs), including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, vomiting, and aspiration, were observed in 3 patients (13.6%), totaling 3 cases. However, these events were unrelated to AST-021p.<br \/>Conclusions: This study, as the first-in-human (FIH) administration of the AST-021p, demonstrated safety and tolerability across all four dose groups. Plus, optimal immunogenic dose (OID) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) were confirmed based on AST-021p-specific immunogenicity and safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Vaccines,T cell engager,Hsp90,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

These include Src family kinases and c-Abl. Inhibition of N-myristoylation by zelenirstat leads to the degradation of non-myristoylated proteins and cancer cell death. We conducted a phase I trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of zelenirstat in patients with refractory cancer.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b><b><\/b>Differential mass spectrometry was performed in <i>NMT1<\/i> and <i>NMT2<\/i> CRISPR\/Cas9 KOs or zelenirstat-treated HAP1 cells to identify N-myristoylation-regulated proteins. Fully consented patients with advanced solid malignancies or refractory B-cell lymphomas were administered escalating doses of zelenirstat in 28-day cycles until progression or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).<br \/><b>Results. <\/b><b><\/b>Proteomic analysis of cells with genetic or pharmacological NMT inhibition was performed to gain insights into NMT substrates and function. In addition to the rapid degradation of SFKs, which disrupts the pro-survival signaling of RTKs, we identified multiple respiratory complex I proteins as the most degraded, including NDUFAF4. <i>NMT1<\/i> KO and zelenirstat treatment disrupted complex I leading to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibition, which is essential for both cancer stem cell survival and metastasis. Continuous once-daily zelenirstat at 20 mg to 210 mg was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities in 24 patients up to and including 210 mg. Gastrointestinal DLTs were observed in the 280 mg cohort, establishing 210 mg as the MTD. Oral absorption was rapid, and pharmacokinetics were suitable for once daily dosing. Seven patients had stable disease as best response, including pancreatic, ovarian and colon cancer patients; one colon cancer patient with 5 prior lines of therapy continues 210 mg beyond 11 cycles with reduction in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and tumor dimensions. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed longer progression-free survival (log-rank p=0.033) and overall survival (p=0.026) in the patients treated at 210 mg (n=7) when compared with patients treated in lower dose cohorts (n=17).<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b><b><\/b>Zelenirstat has a unique dual impact on growth signaling and OXPHOS.

Increased selectivity for WEE1 may reduce the myelosuppressive toxicity (e.g., limiting Grade 3 toxicities) reported with other WEE1 inhibitors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The primary aim of this multi-center, open-label Phase I study is to characterize the safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\/maximum administered dose (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APR-1051 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring cancer-associated gene alterations. Secondary objectives include evaluating the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of APR-1051, assessing the effect of food on its PK, and its preliminary efficacy per RECIST version 1.1. The exploratory objective is to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of APR-1051. For dose escalation, an accelerated titration followed by a BOIN design will be utilized to determine the MAD\/MTD. Upon completion of the dose escalation, two suitable doses and schedules of single-agent APR-1051 will be determined for further investigation in dose selection optimization. Key inclusion criteria are age at least 18 years with advanced solid tumor and cancer-associated gene alterations (e.g., amplification\/overexpression of<i> CCNE1<\/i> or <i>CCNE2<\/i>, deleterious mutations in <i>FBXW7<\/i> or <i>PPP2R1A<\/i>), ECOG PS 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Key exclusion criteria are cancer therapy within 3 weeks or at least 5 half-lives, prior radiation therapy at the target lesion except if evidence of disease progression, unresolved therapy-related AEs, investigational agent within 5 half-lives or 30 days of study drug, prior WEE1 inhibitor, CNS metastases or unstable involvement, secondary malignancies that are active and\/or require therapy, and concomitant moderate\/strong inhibitors\/inducers of CYP3A4\/5, MDR1, or BCRP. Up to 79 patients will be enrolled at 3 to 5 sites in the United States.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,DNA damage response,Solid tumors,CCNE1 amplification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Timothy  A.

As the master regulator of DNA damage response (DDR), ATR orchestrates cellular response to DNA replication stress to preserve DNA replication fork integrity. Cancer cells with markedly increased oncogenic stress or dysfunctional DDR are more reliant on ATR for genome stabilization. Thus, inhibition of ATR can result in cancer cell-selective replication fork collapse and cancer cell death.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This ongoing, first-in-human, multi-site phase 1\/2a trial (NCT04905914) is investigating ATRN-119 safety and pharmacokinetic properties (primary objectives), preliminary efficacy in various solid tumors (secondary objective), and biomarker profile (exploratory objective). This study uses an open-label, standard 3+3 dose escalation and dose expansion study design. Key inclusion criteria include: advanced solid tumor, measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), tumor with at least 1 DDR mutation by next-generation-sequencing, at least 1 failed standard-of-care therapy, ECOG PS 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Key exclusion criteria are cancer therapy within 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives, unresolved therapy-related AEs, investigational agent within 5 half-lives or 30 days of study drug, CNS metastases or unstable involvement, and concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>This trial is currently enrolling at Dose level 5 (550 mg). Among 12 patients in the first four dose levels, the median age is 62 years (range: 48 to 79), where 67% (n=8) are female, 75% (n=9) are White, and 25% (n=3) are Black. The median number of prior treatments is 3 (range: 1 to 6, and 92% have received platinum-based chemotherapy). The majority of tumors, 75% (n=9), had a <i>TP53<\/i> mutation. There have been no reports of dose-limiting toxicities, treatment-related serious adverse events (AE), and treatment-related AEs Grade 3 or higher in these cohorts. The three most commonly reported all-cause AEs are fatigue (33%, n=4), nausea (25%, n=3), and diarrhea (25%, n=3). Increasing exposure and maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) were observed by dose level. The half-life of ATRN-119 is ~5 hours. Two of 12 patients achieved stable disease (SD): one patient from Dose level 1 (50 mg) who progressed on Day 112 and one patient from Dose level 3 (200 mg) who remains on treatment as of Day 118 (data cut off date: January 2, 2024).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In these early cohorts, once-daily oral ATRN-119 appears to be well tolerated with a manageable safety profile, exhibits near dose proportionality, and demonstrates disease stabilization warranting further investigation. Further studies to explore a twice-daily schedule are being considered.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,DNA damage response,Solid tumors,Macrocyclic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.
