Three mutational hotspots are described in different cancers, including glioma, chondrosarcoma, or hematological diseases, resulting in single amino acid substitutions in two of the <i>IDH<\/i> genes (<i>IDH1R132<\/i>, <i>IDH2R172 <\/i>and <i>IDH2R140<\/i>). Wild-type IDH1\/2 catalyze the conversion of isocitrate into &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;-KG), and their mutations confer neomorphic activity to this metabolic enzyme, reducing &#945;-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG is a potent inhibitor of several dioxygenases that normally use &#945;-KG as a cofactor. Among them is the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of methylated cytosine bases in the DNA. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as <i>IDH<\/i>, are commonly found in hematological malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), and especially angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). Despite many advances, these hematologic diseases still have significant unmet medical needs, and require novel approaches to patient selection and therapy. IDH inhibitors are currently under investigation in MDS, AML and PTCL and have shown promise in early clinical trials for AML and MDS. However, not all<i> IDH<\/i>-mutant patients respond, and resistance frequently develops. Changes to epigenetic regulation and diversity driven by <i>IDH1\/2<\/i> mutations likely contribute to these effects, but our incomplete understanding of the underlying biology limits therapeutic intervention. Establishing the relationship between tumor genetics and human diseases in the context of <i>IDH<\/i> mutations is challenging. The distribution of the three hotspot mutations among the different pathologies is complex and not yet fully understood. An intriguing fact is that <i>IDH2R140 <\/i>mutation is exclusively found in myeloid malignancies. Furthermore, clinical data indicate that the co-mutational pattern of <i>IDH1\/2<\/i> mutations is associated differently in hematological disorders. For instance, <i>IDH1\/2<\/i> and <i>TET2<\/i> mutations are essentially mutually exclusive in myeloid context but frequently co-occur in AITL, suggesting that their effects in specific cell types and disease contexts may differ. Understanding how <i>IDH1\/2 and TET2 <\/i>mutations drive malignancy and why they cooperate differently in myeloid<b> <\/b>and lymphoid diseases can help distinguish common from specific mechanisms in myeloid and lymphoid compartments, revealing specific tumor cell vulnerabilities, which could be targeted to improve patient outcomes. The laboratory of Professor Mak has generated three strains of <i>Idh<\/i> knock-in mice, each bearing one of the three hotspot mutations and has assembled a multidisciplinary team in epigenetics and clinical investigation to explore their role and set the stage for further mechanistic insight into mutant <i>IDH<\/i>, both in myeloid or lymphoid contexts. 2-HG levels differ between the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of each strain and may explain the variations in the mutational spectrum associated with different cellular contexts. Even within the myeloid lineage, analyses of these three <i>Idh<\/i>-mutant mice suggest that these alleles produce phenotypes of varying severity, correlating with 2-HG levels, with <i>Idh2R172<\/i> exhibiting the most severe phenotype. We showed that altered DNA and histone methylation; partially block hematopoietic cell differentiation at the hematopoietic stem cell\/progenitor stage; resulting in a hematopoietic phenotype reminiscent of human MDS. Given the mutual exclusivity of <i>IDH1\/2 <\/i>and <i>TET2<\/i> mutations in myeloid neoplasms, it has been hypothesized that they converge on a common oncogenic pathway. However, in a first study, we demonstrated that mutant <i>Idh1<\/i> impairs DNA repair via a mechanism independent of <i>Tet2<\/i> at the stem cell stage. Then, in a second study, we showed that these alterations have distinct, and even opposite, effects on hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Epigenetic and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that <i>Idh2R172<\/i> and <i>Tet2<\/i> mutations had diverging consequences. Our data argue against a simple equivalence <i>of Idh1\/2<\/i> and <i>Tet2 <\/i>mutations, and may help to explain some of the clinical differences between <i>TET2-<\/i> and <i>IDH<\/i>-mutant in a myeloid context. In PTCL, the neoplastic cells represent a minor part of the tumor, a truth that is even more pronounced in AITL, where the microenvironment frequently accounts for 90% of the tumoral mass. Using molecular and histological approaches, it has been shown that driving mutations, such as <i>TET2,<\/i><b> <\/b>occur in hematopoietic stem cells, and are found in both malignant and non-malignant cells. On the other hand, others alterations, such as <i>IDH2<\/i>, occur in mature T cells, specifically in T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and are restrictive to malignant cells. Our team, in collaboration with a group of researchers led by Drs. Philippe Gaulard and Fran&#231;ois Lemonnier, demonstrated that <i>TET<\/i> and <i>IDH<\/i> mutations co-occur in TFH malignant cells. We showed increased levels of 2-HG both in tissue samples and serum of <i>IDH2R172<\/i>-mutated AITL patients, although these levels are lower than in AML patients. This difference could either be attributed to a lower tumor burden in AITL than in AML, or to the difference of the mutant enzyme ability to produce 2-HG based on the cellular context (myeloid cells versus lymphoid cells). Notably, <i>IDH2 <\/i>mutation without <i>TET2<\/i> mutation is really rare in AITL. However, the reason why <i>IDH2<\/i> mutation drives oncogenesis only in the presence of <i>TET2<\/i> mutation is still not fully defined. After generating the first AITL mouse model mutated for <i>Idh2<\/i> and <i>Tet2<\/i>, we demonstrated that the double mutant T cells produce more 2-HG than the single<i> Idh2<\/i>-mutated T cells, potentially resulting in a greater inhibition of &#945;KG-dependent dioxygenases. This heightened ability to synthesize 2-HG could be linked to the altered metabolic gene expression programs in <i>Tet2<\/i>-mutated Tfh cells, although this hypothesis requires further confirmation. Ultimately, the combination of <i>Idh2<\/i> and <i>Tet2<\/i> mutations in TFH cells driving this disease undergoes extensive genetic and epigenetic reprogramming, mainly affecting their interactions with nearby cells in the microenvironment. Particularly, these mutations profoundly impact the crosstalk between neoplastic Tfh cells and the surrounding B cells, leading to the expansion of B and plasma cells in these mice, sometimes clonally. This recently discovered crosstalk among various immune cell types within the tumor microenvironment highlights the need to define how this cooperation occurs and what might disrupt its occurrence to forestall disease progression. Understanding the involvement of immune cells in the microenvironment in hematopoietic diseases holds the potential for significant advances in their treatment. In conclusion, genetically engineered mouse models serve as powerful tools to comprehend the implications of <i>IDH <\/i>mutations in myeloid or T cell biology. Our research shed new light on the mechanisms by which mutations in <i>Idh1\/2<\/i> and <i>Tet2<\/i> drive the development and progression of leukemias and lymphomas. Through a multifaceted approach conducted in our genetically engineered mouse models, we have identified mutation-specific and disease-specific effects. This innovative approach has led to significant basic research discoveries which can now be evaluated in patient samples. These findings may help to select patients and devise additional treatment strategies using existing and investigational therapies, which can then be translated to preclinical testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Lymphoma,IDH,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie Leca<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
