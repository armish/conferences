[{"Abstract":"Proteases are an important component of many biological processes in the human body, and as such makes them a well-known subject to explore when investigating a variety of disease states from cancer to cardiovascular disease. In all stages of cancer, including early development, proteases play critical roles in almost every aspect for processes such as invasion, promotion of tumor growth, and metastasis. This makes screening of circulating proteases a potentially powerful tool for early detection and prognosis for a variety of cancers. The human proteome, however, is very complex, with around 600 proteases in total, and at least 234 of them found in circulation. Additionally, proteases often act on more than one substrate, cross reactively cleaving several substrates at different rates, further adding to the complexity of cleavage patterns of the human proteome. Previous liquid biopsies for cancer detection based on protease cleavage patterns focused mainly on detecting the activities of specific proteases, using single substrates to examine the effects of well-studied cancer-related proteases such as MMPs and cathepsins. In this study, we developed a method for screening cleavage patterns of proteases active in plasma samples that deviated from this norm. Due to the complexity of the human proteome, rather than developing a specific substrate for a specific protease, we utilized a large array of substrates to screen for cleavage patterns in plasma samples of cancer patients aimed at not one specific protease, but a wide range that may be present. In this proof of concept study, we used a commercially available internally quenched set of 360 substrates composed of 8 amino acids and a FRET pair. Initially, we optimized this assay to measure protease activity in the complex plasma environment. Next, we screened several plasma samples collected from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or pancreatitis, and screen negative samples using the 360 substrate set assay and identified 5 top substrates that were proficient in identifying PDAC from other conditions. Finally, we performed a validation study with a larger cohort (45 screen negative, 26 PDAC, 19 pancreatitis) using the selected substrates to determine the diagnostic performance of the assay. All five of the selected substrates showed 1.3-1.8-fold increase in fluorescence signal in PDAC compared to screen negative and pancreatitis. Amongst the cancer samples, the substrates showed no significant difference between stage, supporting possible applications for early detection. Additionally, area under the curve analysis of the five substrates gave a score of 0.8. In summary, in this study, we reported a novel approach for the detection of cancer exploiting the protease cleavage patterns in plasma samples. We believe that this approach holds great potential for detecting substrates and proteases for early detection of PDAC and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Proteomics,Fluorescence,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Some patients, particularly those with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), only undergo surgery to obtain a diagnosis and do not derive any therapeutic benefit from surgical resection or debulking. Less-invasive techniques for diagnosis, such as liquid biopsy, therefore provides an opportunity to mitigate surgical risk in these patients.<br \/>Methods: Patients with histopathology confirmed glioblastoma (GBM, IDH wild type), brain metastases (BM), and PCNSL with accompanying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were included in our study. Cell-free DNA methylation profiling and shotgun proteomics were obtained for all patients and used to train classifiers to distinguish each tumour entity from others. Specifically, binomial elastic net regression models were built by combining both data modalities using established early and late integration paradigms and performance was compared to classifiers built from individual data types alone. Each model was repeated 100 fold and performance assessed on an untouched testing subset.<br \/>Results: Our cohort includes 20 patients with GBM, 17 with BM, and 14 with PCNSL, each with matching CSF cell-free DNA methylation and shotgun proteomic profiling. We show that these data can be integrated to fully discriminate PCNSL from its major diagnostic counterparts with a perfect median AUC of 1.00 (95% CI 1-1) and 100% specificity. Integrated \"lymphoma vs other\" models significantly outperform models trained on methylation or protein data alone, though the same dramatic improvement was not demonstrated in GBM or BM, suggesting synergistic biological information is specific to lymphoma.<br \/>Conclusions: There is a critical need to diagnose patients with intra-axial tumours, particularly PCNSL, without relying on invasive and costly surgery. We present the most specific and accurate CNS lymphoma classifier to date by integrating the methylome and proteome of CSF. This has the potential for immediate clinical utility, eliminating the need for biopsy in an important subset of these patients.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Its diagnosis requires invasive ultrasound endoscopic biopsy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, these methods are limited by false-positive results and complications. Liquid biopsy, which uses blood to detect <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in cancer, can be used to overcome these hurdles. However, only about 30% of cases can be detected as a diagnostic marker by <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations using plasma from patients with stage I-II pancreatic cancer, and its clinical application remains a challenge. Therefore, in this study, we focused on diagnosing pancreatic cancer using methylated DNA in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from pancreatic cancer and non-cancer patients.<br \/>Subjects: Plasma was collected before the start of the treatment from six patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2019 to 2023 at our hospital, and six non-cancer patients simultaneously.<br \/>Methods: Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using the cfDNA obtained from the plasma of pancreatic cancer and non-cancer patients.<br \/>Results: The cfDNA fragments obtained by WGBS revealed that promoter regions were mostly deleted, and no difference was observed between cancer and non-cancer patients. The methylation rate of cfDNA fragments by WGBS differed between cancer and non-cancer patients, with multiple methylation sites (&#62;100 sites) in intergenic regions.<br \/>Discussion: Although attempts have been made to diagnose cancer using genetic mutations and liquid biopsy, only a few studies are available on using methylation markers in the plasma cfDNA of pancreatic cancer patients, and the effectiveness of this method remains unclear. In the present study, we found that promoter regions were deleted by WGBS, and several distinct hypermethylated regions were present in the intergenic region between pancreatic cancer and non-cancer samples, suggesting the presence of certain markers that can distinguish between pancreatic cancer and non-cancer patients.<br \/>Conclusion: This small number of cases suggests that hypermethylation of the intergenic regions could be helpful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We will need more cases in the future to verify the usefulness of hypermethylation of intergenic regions in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Liquid biopsies,Methylation,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

About 60-70% of CRC cases are found at advanced stages (III\/IV), suggesting limited adherence to available screening methods. Several molecular biomarkers have been identified as discriminatory for CRC (e.g., KRAS, NRAS, MSI), improving CRC management and patient outcomes. This study evaluates the differential expression patterns of DKK3, PKM2, IGFBP2, and SEPT9 genes between matched CRC tumors and adjacent mucosa samples. The secondary outcome was to examine the association between the presence of the selected biomarkers in tissue compared to blood samples. Using a retrospective study design, we examined 112 tissue samples of Hispanic individuals with a pathology-confirmed CRC diagnosis recruited throughout the Puerto Rico Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry (PURIFICAR). We quantified expression levels of target genes by RT-qPCR normalized with endogenous control GAPDH, using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay in the QuantStudio 3 (Applied Biosystems). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to calculate differences between gene expression from tumor and adjacent mucosal tissue samples. Additionally, 39 paired blood and tissue samples were analyzed to explore the association between biomarkers in these two types of samples. Protein biomarkers were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit according to manufacturer protocols (Thermo Scientific Federick, MD and Biosource San Diego, CA). mSEPT9 was measured using the Epi proColon&#174; 2.0 CE test. The association between biomarker presence in tissue and blood samples was assessed using the Chi-square test of independence, with biomarker concentrations dichotomized at the median value. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17 and R version 4.3.1. DKK3 and IGFBP2 expression levels were higher among CRC tumor samples. However, expression levels of PKM2 and SEPT9 genes were slightly lower. DKK3 was the only target gene significantly different (p&#60;0.05) when comparing overall gene expression between the matched samples. Upon comparison between early and advanced CRC stages, DKK3 expression levels were higher in advanced-stage tumor samples when compared to adjacent mucosal tissue samples (p&#60;0.05). Moreover, a significant association between IGFBG2 presence in tissue compared to blood was detected at a 90% confidence level (p-value&#60;0.10). This association was evident in early-stage CRC cases; there is a relationship between IGFBG2 biomarker presence in tissue and IGFBG2 biomarker presence in blood (p&#60;0.05). Our findings indicate DKK3 and IGFBP2 as potential biomarkers for CRC progression and early detection. The study&#8217;s insights into the differential expression patterns of these biomarkers can inform targeted screening strategies. Further research is needed to assess their potential to enhance early tumor detection in Hispanics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Colorectal cancer,Hispanic,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

In an effort to enhance pretreatment decision making, we developed and validated an AI model (specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based deep learning model) to predict radiologic NM and pathologic ENE in HPV-associated OPSCC patients.<br \/>Methods: Radiographic CT scans for 290 OPSCC patients treated with definitive chemoradiation were acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and divided into training (D<sub>1<\/sub>) and validation (D<sub>2<\/sub>) cohorts for NM prediction. Radiologic NM for D<sub>1<\/sub> and D<sub>2<\/sub> were reviewed by two radiologists. Only nodes with concordant NM judgments from both radiologists were included for analysis. An additional 46 OPSCC patients treated with surgery at Emory Winship Cancer Institute were collected to form the test cohorts (D<sub>3<\/sub>) for ENE prediction. The largest metastatic or normal nodes were annotated for D<sub>1<\/sub> and D<sub>2<\/sub> while all visible nodes with pathology confirmation of ENE from D<sub>3<\/sub> were annotated.

Indeed, the post-surgery dynamics of cirDNA have been largely overlooked to date, despite their importance in determining the optimal timing for assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). Since cirDNA levels were recently found to be associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in various cancers, we investigated NETs and cirDNA post-surgery.We conducted two clinical studies to explore the dynamics of cirDNA quantity and of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) markers: (1) a peri-surgery study over a duration of up to 72 hours, which involved stage I-III colon (n=10), prostate (n=10), and breast (n=9) cancer patients; and (2) a post-surgery study that extended up to two years post-surgery, and which involved 74 stage III colon cancer patients. We assessed plasma levels of cirDNA using qPCR, and assessed two protein markers of NETs using ELISA, in both cancer patients and control group of healthy individuals (HI) (N=114). This second study is the first prospective, multicenter, blinded study of the dynamics of the total cirDNA post-surgery, for a period of up to two years.We observed that (i), NETs formation contributes to post-surgery conditions; (ii), peri- and post-surgery cirDNA levels were highly associated with NETs formation in colon cancer; (iii), each tumor type showed a specific pattern of the peri-surgery dynamics of cirDNA and NETs markers; peri-operative levels of these markers are significantly lower in breast cancer patients as compared to prostate and colorectal cancer patients; (iv), a significant proportion of patients showed pre- (58.1%) and post-surgery (80.4%) median marker values higher than in HI, even after 2 years following tumor resection, (v) these markers were either equal to or greater (23.2%) than their pre-surgery counterparts; and (vi), elevated values of these markers did not derive from chemotherapy toxicity.We provide evidence that, for cancer patients in the post-surgery period, cirDNA originates mainly from NETs. This finding calls into question the current method of assessing MRD according to the fraction of mutant cirDNA, given that the level of NETs formation appears to be patient dependant. The peri-surgery dynamics of NETs formation and cirDNA release vary according to the surgical procedure and cancer type. In a significant part of patients with colon cancer, NETs continue to persist for more than a year after surgery, irrespective of disease progression or chemotherapy use. Nevertheless, cirDNA and NETs marker levels vary in cases with post-surgery inflammatory\/thrombotic adverse events. Our work highlights the existence of long-lasting &#8220;sequelae&#8221; effects of cancer, previously unreported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Liquid biopsies,Circulating cell-free DNA,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

The OX40-OX40L (ligand of OX40) interaction plays a crucial role in the enhancement of T-cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, including those in tumor microenvironment (TME) leading to increased anti-tumor immunity<sup>1<\/sup>. OX40 agonist antibodies have been widely tested for immunotherapy for solid tumors<sup>2,3<\/sup>. Interestingly, in the treatment of lymphoma, the situation may become more complicate, where OX40 could also be found to be expressed on lymphoma cells, in addition to TME. This phenomenon might or might not impact OX40 agonist therapy. This report aims at developing an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to assess tumor-associated OX40 by utilizing morphology approach to understand OX40 expression in lymphoma cells, as opposed on tumor-infiltrate T-lymphocytes (TILs) present in TME. FFPE samples from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), recapitulating the main pathological features of the original tumors, but exclusive of human TILs, were used as the first stage of the assay development, avoiding TIL interference prior to human sample testing.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. Ninety leukemia and lymphoma PDXs are comprehensively annotated, including RNAseq and histopathology (HuBase<sup>TM<\/sup><i>: https:\/\/hubase.crownbio.com<\/i>). IHC staining of PDX FFPE slides or TMA (tissue microarray) of various cancers was performed using a commercial OX40 antibody (CST, #61637) and Bond RX Automated IHC\/ISH Staining System (Leica Biosystems), followed by whole slide imaging by NanoZoomer NDP2.0-HT Digital Slide System (Hamamatsu) and quantitative analysis by HALO<sup>TM<\/sup> image analysis software (Indica labs). OX40 IHC scores were also compared to the RNA expression determined by RNAseq.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>A total of 90 leukemia and lymphoma PDXs were comprehensively evaluated. RNASeq data (human mRNA) indeed revealed OX40 gene expression (cutoff as Log2 (FPKM)&#62;3) in 8.9% of models (8\/90 models); on the other hand, IHC data also confirmed these OX40 protein expression; and the IHC scores largely correlated with the RNA data. Together, our data firmly confirmed the expression of OX40 in certain hematological cancers, beyond just in TME. The ongoing studies is investigating the characteristics of the OX40 positive lymphoma\/leukemia, and the preliminary data will be presented in the annual conference. Furthermore, we are also using the same assay to explore other cancer types beyond hematological cancers.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>.

The application of a robust urine-based multiplex assay, Oncuria-Detect<sup>&#174;<\/sup>, to aid in the detection of UTUC has the potential to address this deficiency and to assist with accurate, non-invasive diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate the performance of Oncuria-Detect<sup>&#174;<\/sup>, a multiplex immunoassay capable of querying a voided urine sample for 10 protein biomarkers associated with urothelial carcinoma (A1AT, APOE, ANG, CA9, IL8, MMP9, MMP10, PAI1, SDC1 and VEGFA). Its application to UTUC was evaluated in a multi-institutional cohort of 35 prospectively collected subjects presenting for evaluation of upper tract mass along with 46 prospective collected matched controls (i.e., non-tumor bearing). The ability of the test to identify patients harboring UTUC was assessed. UTCU status was confirmed by endoscopy and tissue biopsy or definitive surgery.

Sensitivity values of the diagnostic panel for low-grade UTUC, high-grade UTUC, non-invasive UTUC and invasive UTUC were 86.7%, 90.9%, 88.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Urinary cytology or selective ureteral washing\/cytology was associated with an overall sensitivity of 54.2%, specificity of 100%, NPV 63.3% and PPV 100%.

Cytological examinations of bronchial washing (BW) samples, obtained during bronchoscopy, often yield inconclusive results in the diagnosis of LC. Aberrant DNA methylation has previously been shown to be a useful biomarker for LC. DNA methylation analysis in BW specimens could serve as a valuable clinical adjunct to cytology. In this study, to identify potential methylation biomarkers for LC, methylation microarray analyses were performed on primary tumors and compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues of 13 patients with LC at various stages (I - IV). A stepwise validation process using bisulfite-pyrosequencing of cell lines and tissues identified six methylated genes (<i>ADAMTS20<\/i>, <i>FOXC2<\/i>, <i>NKX2-5<\/i>, <i>OLIG3<\/i>, <i>PCDHGA12<\/i>, and <i>PRRX1<\/i>)<i> <\/i>associated with<i> <\/i>LC. To assess methylation in BW samples, a highly sensitive and accurate 3-plex Linear Target Enrichment (LTE)-quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) in a single closed tube was developed. Clinical validation was performed using BW samples from patients with LC (<i>n<\/i> = 68) and non-LC (benign) (<i>n<\/i> = 33) and identified <i>PCDHGA12 <\/i>and <i>PRRX1 <\/i>methylation<i> <\/i>as<i> <\/i>the best performing marker combination for detecting LC. The 2-marker combination exhibited a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 87.9%, with an area under the curve of 0.891. Notably, its sensitivity was 100% for small cell LC. The 2-marker combination had a positive predictive value of 93.3% and a negative predictive value of 70.7%. Its sensitivity outperformed cytology. The methylation status of the 2-marker showed no correlation with gender, age or stage, but was associated with tumor location and histology. In conclusion, we identified <i>PCDHGA12 <\/i>and <i>PRRX1 <\/i>methylation<i> <\/i>as<i> <\/i>high potential biomarkers for LC diagnosis. This study shows that these biomarkers could be used as a diagnostic adjunct to cytology in the clinical practice for diagnosing LC in BW specimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Methylation,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The VENTANA 4B5(CDx) IHC assay, now approved in the United States (US) as a companion diagnostic, was used as the clinical trial assay (CTA) in DB-04. Real-world differentiation of HER2-low vs HER2 IHC 0 BC with non-CTAs is difficult. This is the first phase of a study assessing agreement between CTA and non-CTA scores.<br \/>Methods: 50 clinical BC samples with HER2 IHC scores of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ were sent to laboratories in Europe, Canada, and the US for HER2 IHC testing per ASCO\/CAP 2018 guidelines. After routine protocol scoring, pathologists were trained and rescored the samples 2 weeks later. Post training scores were compared with reference CTA scores determined by a central laboratory and a panel of experts. The primary endpoint was positive percentage agreement (PPA) and negative percentage agreement (NPA) between CTA and non-CTA scores, assessed after training, considering HER2-low as positive and HER2 IHC 0 as negative.<br \/>Results: A total of 3449 post training non-CTA scores were available for analysis. PPA for HER2-low vs HER2 IHC 0 was 87.5% and NPA was 61.9%, with Cohen &#954; of 0.51 (Table). HER2-low vs HER2 IHC 0 agreement between CTA and non-CTA varied across subgroups. PPA &#62;95% was shown with 4B5 Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) and HercepTest (Omnis), NPA of 80% with Leica, and overall agreement &#62;80% with HercepTest (Link48), 4B5 LDTs, and German, French, and Italian laboratories.<br \/>Conclusions: The degree of concordance between the CTA and non-CTAs varied among assay types and laboratory locations.

In 2020 it lead to &#62;14 million new cases and &#62;375,000 deaths worldwide. Despite numerous detection methods, detecting PCa reliably and non-invasively continues to be challenging. PCa malignant cells (MC) express VPAC (combined for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Peptide) in high density. A VPAC specific PACAP analogues (Kd=3.1x10<sup>-8<\/sup>M) developed in our laboratory was conjugated with a fluorophore and named TP4303. The goal was to assess if TP4303 will image PCa-MC shed in voided urine and present severity of PCa as grade group (GG).<br \/>Method: Consenting PCa patients (N=110) scheduled for radical prostatectomy provided voided urine. Urine was cyto-centrifuged. Cells on glass slide were fixed, incubated with TP4303, washed, treated with DAPI (4,6-diamidodino-2-phenylindole), cover slip placed and analyzed with Zeiss Axio Observer microscope, coupled with ZENN Microscopy software. The software determined percentage of PCa MC shed by each patient. The results were corroborated as per GG, determined by post-surgical histopathology and analyzed statistically.<br \/>Results:TP4303 imaged PCa in all subjects. The percent MC shed in urine increased from 13.1&#177;14.4% for GG1 to 25.3&#177;21.07% for GG3 (p=0.05) to 50.5&#177;26.7% for GG5 (p=0.002). Similarly, the fluorescence intensity increased from 43.8&#177;2.2 for GG1 to 48.8&#177;7.0 for GG3 (p=0.01) to 51.5&#177;14.4 for GG5 (p=0.15).<br \/>Conclusions: The data strongly suggests that TP4303 may not only detect PCa reliably and noninvasively, but may also predict the severity of PCa.<br \/>Supported by NIH: NC5R01CA249921","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Currently, multiple drug modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, ADCs, and CARTs targeting CLDN18.2 are being evaluated in clinical trials. A substantial correlation exists between the expression of CLDN18.2 and the efficacy of the these therapies. However, to date, no companion diagnostic (CDx) antibodies that are specific to CLDN18.2 have been approved. Therefore, it is important to promptly develop an anti-CLDN18.2 CDx antibody with a high specificity, sensitivity, and suitability for immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this study, we present the discovery and validation of a novel, highly sensitive IHC antibody that selectively identifies CLDN18.2.<br \/>Methods: 3 CLDN18.2 specific peptide fragments from extracellular domain of human CLDN18.2 were conjugated with KLH. Antibodies were discovered by immunizing BALB\/c and SJL mice with these peptides-KLH conjugates. Screening and selection process was relied on positive ELISA results against the immunogen, as well as FACS and Acumen Explorer Microplate staining of CLDN18.2-experssing cells. Hit antibodies were evaluated for IHC on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CHOK1 cells expressing full-length CLDN18.2 or CLDN18.1. The antibodies were further validated on human gastric cancer tissue samples to establish the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the IHC assay.<br \/>Results: The mAb clone 43F11 exhibited binding to a fusion polypeptide comprising the first extracellular loop of human CLDN18.2 (aa32-53) at a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.212 nM. 43F11 showed positive cell surface IHC staining on CLDN18.2-experssing cells after fixation but demonstrated no staining on CLDN18.1-experssing cells. The IHC test method was established by utilizing clinical tumor tissues and PDX samples that had predetermined expression levels of CLDN18.2. The 43F11 antibody accurately identified the expression level of CLDN18.2 in the IHC assay, with a minimum concentration of 0.25 &#956;g\/mL. When compared to the commercial CLDN18.2 IHC antibody EPR19202, 43F11 demonstrated greater sensitivity, allowing for positive staining on cancer tissues that have significantly lower levels of CLDN18.2 expression.<br \/>Conclusion: 43F11 exhibits specific recognition of human CLDN18.2 in IHC assays, while showing no reactivity towards CLDN18.1. It demonstrated superior sensitivity compared to the benchmark antibody. These data suggest that 43F11 has the capacity to serve as an effective diagnostic tool for identifying patients who positively express CLDN18.2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Immunohistochemistry,Monoclonal antibodies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

A comprehensive screening process involving bioinformatics analysis and published studies identified a set of PCa driver genes for further investigation. Three strategies were employed to identify candidate driver genes: (1) utilizing the IntOGen database (Mart&#237;nez-Jim&#233;nez et.al, Nature Reviews Cancer 2020), nine cohorts comprising 1503 primary PCa patient samples were analyzed, resulting in the identification of 63 PCa driver genes, with the top 20 genes exhibiting high mutation rates and frequencies in these cohorts; (2) employing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, 16 driver genes that were enriched in prostate cancer pathways were identified from the initial 63 genes; (3) referring to a published article (Dietlein et.al, Nature Genetics 2020), the top 17 driver genes that highly related to prostate cancer across 28 tumor types were selected. A final set of 15 PCa driver genes, which appeared in at least two of the screening strategies, were included in subsequent analyses. ELISA was then performed to assess the presence of autoantibodies targeting proteins encoded by these 15 PCa driver genes. Autoantibodies were evaluated using serum samples from 203 PCa patients and 93 normal controls. The results revealed that seven out of the 15 autoantibodies showed significantly elevated levels in the sera of PCa patients compared to normal controls. Notably, the autoantibody targeting SPOP (speckled-type POZ protein) exhibited the highest frequency of 42.4%, followed by the autoantibody to PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) at 37.4% in the PCa group. Finally, the SPOP protein was analyzed by IHC on the prostate tissue microarray containing PCa tissues, prostate simple hyperplasia tissues, cancer adjacent prostate tissues, and normal prostate tissues further to explore the consistency of SPOP expression in antigen-antibody reactions. High expression of SPOP protein was found in the PCa tissues. These findings suggest that proteins encoded by PCa driver genes may possess immunogenic properties due to neoepitopes possibly generated by mutations, leading to the production of corresponding autoantibodies. Identifying specific autoantibodies associated with PCa driver genes could offer novel opportunities for discovering autoantibody-based biomarkers in PCa. Further validation of these autoantibodies is warranted to evaluate their diagnostic potential in PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Autoantibody,Cancer detection,Cancer markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Together, these key processes can support or restrain cancer progression and response to therapy. Nevertheless, the effect of SIGMAR1 on the modulation of oral cancer (OC) immunity is largely unknown. Here, we investigated not only the prognostic value of SIGMAR1 in OC but also, its impact on antitumor immunity response.<br \/>Methods: Were included in this study data from TCGA (Pan-Cancer analysis), multiple large datasets of OC (GSE30784; GSE42743; GSE37991, GSE31056, our cohort-based study of human OC samples and OC cell lines. Taken together, were used to performed the bioinformatics analysis and the experimental verification by several in vitro assays. The CIBERSORT analysis and Luminex assay were used to evaluate the infiltration degrees of different immune cells and also to validate the presence of chemokines and immune-stimulators, respectively, in human OC samples. To assess the role of SIGMAR1 in the modulation of the -PD-L1 expression, SIGMAR1-shRNA OC cell lines were used.<br \/>Results: We found that overexpression of SIGMAR1 was associated with poor survival rates in OC. Further, we observed that SIGMAR1 deficiency inhibited Ca2+ influx and clonogenic growth and decreased chemoresistance to cisplatin in human OC cells. Next, the SIGMAR1 expression levels were associated with infiltration degrees of M1 macrophages, Natural Killer cells and T cells (memory and helper CD4+ activated, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells). Regarding comparison of the analytes between patients with SIGMAR1 high\/low expression group, we found significant differences in the CX3CL1 (chemokine), and in immune-stimulators as CD27, CD40, and PD-L1 expression level. Importantly, this research also showed that SIGMAR1 inhibition in human OC cell lines decreases the abundance of PD-L1, both at the total protein and surface expression levels.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggests SIGMAR1 not only as an emerging biomarker with promising therapeutic values to OC patients, but also gave a new insight into a potential immunotherapy strategy.<br \/>Keywords: Oral cancer; SIGMAR1; PD-L1, Immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,shRNA,PD-L1,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

AmoyDx FGFR 1-4 NGS Panel (FGFR-P) was developed for FGFR alts detection based on both DNA and RNA. The goal of this study is to validate and assess the performance of FGFR-P in pan-cancer <i>FGFR<\/i> alts detection by comparing with an AmoyDx comprehensive genomic profiling test (CGP) and a health authority approved DNA-based NGS panel (DNA-P).<br \/>Methods: Both FGFR-P and CGP are DNA (MUT) and RNA (FUS) based for detecting <i>FGFR<\/i> alts with optimized bioinformatics pipeline to eliminate baseline noise caused by deamination events, which is commonly found in aged FFPE samples. Cell lines, cell line\/patient derived xenografts (CDXs\/PDXs) and 397 samples of 26 cancer types (90 samples &#62;10 years) were used for validation of FGFR-P. Total 382 and 50 pan-cancer samples were respectively tested to compare FGFR-P with CGP and DNA-P.<br \/>Results: To validate accuracy, 36 FFPE samples from cell lines and CDXs\/PDXs with known FGFR status (25 FUSs, 5 MUTs, 6 wild-types) were tested by FGFR-P with concordance rate 100%. In clinical sample testing, FGFR-P also showed high agreement with CGP (99.5%) and DNA-P (98.0%). Conflicting result confirmed by FISH revealed 1 FUS missed by DNA-P but detected by FGFR-P, which demonstrated advantage of <i>FGFR<\/i> alts detection by DNA+RNA. In addition, an optimized bioinformatics pipeline by mimic samples with deamination events effectively filtered out C:G&#62;T:A false positive signals. FGFR-P achieved high success rate in testing pan-tumor samples (89.9%) including samples &#62;10 years (75.6%).<br \/>Conclusions: FGFR-P provides a novel opportunity to identify <i>FGFR<\/i> alt pan-cancer patients using a robust DNA+RNA NGS platform, which shows high success rate even in aged samples and will be a potent tool for sensitive and reliable detection of <i>FGFR<\/i> alts for clinical diagnostics.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C616AA73-BC6D-4E31-B43E-A467F10AA3D8}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\"><b>CGP<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"8\" colspan=\"1\"><b>FGFR-P<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MUT<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">194<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">195<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">194<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">224<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>FUS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">137<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">137<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">138<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">158<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">The overall percent agreement<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">99.5%<\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),DNA+RNA NGS platform,Deamination signal filtering,FGFR assay validation in pan-cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Primary HE is a clonal stem cell disorder manifesting as myeloid and\/or lymphoid malignancies and is typically driven by aberrant fusion genes involving a tyrosine kinase (TK) gene (e.g., PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2, FLT3, ABL1). The precise identification of the underlying molecular genetic abnormalities is crucial for timely diagnosing and managing primary HE. There has been no HE-specific assay that can concomitantly detect all known or novel TK fusion genes. We've developed an RNA-based panel for detecting TK fusion genes in HE. This panel, developed using 5' RACE technology, allows for the identification of fusion transcripts in total RNA extracted from whole blood sample. It covers 48 known TK fusion genes and also has the capability of detecting novel gene fusions. We balanced and optimized the panel using an in-house fusion RNA mix containing 11 fusion transcripts. We additionally validated the panel using samples from five patients with hematopoietic neoplasms and two fusion-positive cell lines to ensure its accuracy. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was established by analyzing the in-house RNA mix and normal whole blood RNA. It was found that the minimum RNA input required to detect all 11 fusion transcripts was 3540 copies in the presence of a background of 10 ng normal whole blood RNA. The panel successfully identified two fusion transcripts using 10 ng of total RNA obtained from cancer cell lines. The panel was then used to test five patient RNA samples extracted from whole blood. We successfully confirmed the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion in 3 patient samples and ETV6-PDGFRB fusion in 1 patient sample, respectively. In summary, we developed HE-specific NGS panel for detecting all known and novel TK fusion genes and demonstrated its analytical accuracy and clinical effectiveness. The next phase of our study is to further validate the tests on a large patient cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Fusion genes,Tyrosine kinase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Here, we developed a clinically reliable HER2 testing method enabling ultra-fast detection of HER2 gene amplification with high accuracy by using the digital real-time PCR (drPCR) system. To test the clinical validity and standardize procedures of drPCR-based HER2 status evaluation, three independent breast cancer cohorts from different institutions were enrolled, which assigned as a training (SCHU hospital, n = 103) and two validation sets (SNU hospital, n = 170; CNUH hospital, n = 45), and the drPCR assay was compared with current standard HER2 testing methods. In the training cohort, the HER2\/CEP17 ratio values from FISH and drPCR tests were highly correlated (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.81; <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001), and the drPCR results displayed 98.1% concordance to HER2 status defined by IHC and\/or FISH with 92.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Eight samples further verified by targeted NGS showed 100% concordance of dPCR to NGS. Consistently, two validation cohorts also showed high concordance of drPCR to IHC and\/or ISH results (accuracy = 97.1% and 97.8% in SNU and CNUH cohorts, respectively). The optimal cutoff for HER2 positivity in the drPCR assay was set as a HER2\/CEP17 ratio &#8805; 1.9 with AUC of 0.963 based on the results from training cohort, and the same cut-off for drPCR was applicable to two independent validation cohorts, supporting the clinical validity of our drPCR-based HER2 assessment. In some discordant cases, low tumor purity (&#8804; 25%) was observed and microdissection partly improved the drPCR results. The discordance between drPCR and ISH results was also found in marginal HER2+ cases with HER2\/CEP17 ratio 2-3, but these cases showed inter-observer variability when re-evaluating the ISH\/IHC data due to intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity. Of note, in HER2 IHC3+ cases with negative drPCR results, re-evaluation of IHC using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based HER2 scoring system revised the HER2 IHC 3+ score to 2+, and ISH assessment also confirmed that these cases are indeed HER2-negative, proving the high accuracy of HER2 CN drPCR assay. In conclusion, given the advantages of drPCR-based HER2 assessment with high accuracy, sensitivity, and simplicity, the drPCR assay could be a complementary or alternative method to IHC and ISH to greatly improve current HER2 testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,digital PCR,HER2 testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

We investigated the proteomic profile of extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) from the colon tissue explants and plasmas in COAD. The research aims to overcome the limitations of traditional serum Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) testing and invasive procedures like colonoscopy. We analyzed EVPs sourced from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues and preoperative and postoperative plasma in COAD patients to identify potential EVP-based tumor diagnostic markers. In the Discovery phase with 50 COAD patients, we conducted a proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS), identifying approximately 50 markers each from tissue explants and plasma. These markers were validated in an independent cohort of 104 participants, including 84 COAD patients and 20 healthy controls. We utilized ELISA to quantify 11 selected EVP proteins. Notably, seven of these proteins exhibited significant differential expression in preoperative and postoperative plasma, highlighting their diagnostic relevance. These seven proteins also showed marked elevation in preoperative plasma compared to healthy controls, reinforcing their potential as diagnostic markers. The study extended to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these seven proteins, referred to as \"EV-7 levels\", across various stages of COAD. Their performance was compared with serum CEA levels and plasma cfDNA mutation rates, as detected by an FDA-approved liquid biopsy assay. The EV-7 levels demonstrated superior detection rates in the early stages of COAD, particularly in Stages I and II, in contrast to the serum CEA method. Among the 84 patients, 73 (86.9%) exhibited EV-7 levels exceeding the established cut-off. In the validation cohort, EV-7 levels were more accurate across different COAD stages than serum CEA levels and cfDNA mutation rates. CEA levels above 5 ng\/ml were 27%, 45%, 42%, and 64% for Stages I through IV. cfDNA somatic mutation rates were 60%, 80%, 75%, and 75%. EV-7 levels exceeding the cut-off were 73%, 100%, 88%, and 84%, respectively, with Stages I and II having the highest detection rate among the three methods. ROC curve analysis for EV-7 levels in Stages I to IV showed statistically significant, with AUC values of 0.913, 1.000, 0.985, and 0.984, respectively. Our findings indicate that the seven EVP proteins are significantly present in the plasma of early-stage COAD patients. Integrating these markers with current diagnostic approaches could improve early cancer detection, showing promise for practical application in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Extracellular vesicles,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, up to 95% of CRC tumors are MSS\/proficient MMR (pMMR) leading to poorer prognosis and treatment outcomes than MSI-H\/dMMR patients (PMID: 12867608, 26028255). In MSS\/pMMR metastatic CRC, multiple combination therapies are being investigated despite a lack of biomarkers to guide therapy. Therefore, we developed an RNA-based MSS-PRS with a primary objective to identify MSS tumors that have MSI-H\/dMMR molecular features indicative of ICI response.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<i> <\/i><\/b>The MSS-PRS was developed using the TCGA CRC cohort (COAD; n=268). Training labels were assigned using the MSI Mantis score and mutation status from 8 genes with reported MSI association. Samples called &#8220;activated&#8221; had both a gene mutation and an MSI Mantis score &#62; 0.4 (i.e., MSI-H), and samples called &#8220;non-activated&#8221; were wild type for all genes and had MSI Mantis score &#60; 0.4. All other samples were designated &#8220;ambiguous&#8221; and excluded from training. Two thirds of the non-ambiguous samples were assigned to the classifier training set and all remaining samples were assigned to the test set. Using ClaNC software (PMID: 16269418) and cross-validation in the training set, a nearest centroid classifier was developed from a set of high mean, high variance candidate genes to select an optimal gene set to separate activated and non-activated groups. The classifier performance was evaluated in the test set.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The MSS-PRS contained 112-genes enriched for mismatched DNA binding, DNA damage repair, PD-L1, innate and adaptive immune response, cellular immunity, and cytokines. In the test set, the classifier called 44 of 46 MSI-H samples activated; of the remaining 77 samples that were MSS tumors, 38 were called activated and 39 were called not activated. Visual inspection of heat maps of tumor by MSI\/MSS-PRS status and their association with TMB and CRC-related mutations suggest greater differences between MSS tumors called activated and MSI-H tumors than between MSS tumors called activated and MSS tumors called not activated. In contrast, immune marker expression profiles in MSS tumors called activated were markedly more similar to MSI-H tumors compared to MSS tumors called non-activated.<br \/><b>Summary and Conclusions<\/b>: Herein we described the development of a novel MSS-PRS that captures an MSI-H\/dMMR-like molecular phenotype in a subset of patients with MSS tumors despite their lack of high TMB or overt MSI defects. Based upon these initial findings, further development of the MSS-PRS and its clinical validation as a tool to select patients with MSS tumors who may benefit from ICI-containing treatment regimens is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Microsatellite instability,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"K.

We performed a PUBMED query for records up to April 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 2023, yielding 9,294 records. Our inclusion criteria included human sample studies that performed both IHC and FISH\/CISH against the same target, with a minimum of two samples. We excluded case reports, RNA ISH- and non-human studies, studies without IHC\/ISH performed on the same target, and articles not in English or inaccessible. We screened 9,294 PUBMED article abstracts using the AS Review active learning model (van de Schoot et al., 2021), and used a pre-defined threshold of 5 % consecutive irrelevant abstracts to stop screening. A total of 1,309 abstracts were manually excluded using the AS Review, directing the active learning model to automatically exclude 3,413 abstracts out of the original 9,294. Of the 4,572 articles assessed for full-article screening, 1,167 were excluded for being out of scope, 303 for access issues, 227 for language incompatibility, and 236 for imprecise information, primarily due to non-representative samples or incorrect gene\/protein target identification. Ultimately, out of 2,413 articles assessed for eligibility, 2,294 did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 119 studies for our analysis. From these articles, we manually extracted kappa values for analysis and visualization in R. We identified articles from 19 different cancers with the majority studying Breast Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Gastric Cancer, and Mesothelioma. We observed high Cohen&#8217;s Kappa values in Breast Cancer (median = 0.76), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (median = 0.91) and Mucinous Ovarian Carcinoma (median = 0.93). We identified studies from 14 different genes with majority being HER2, ALK and MYC. We observed high Cohen&#8217;s Kappa values in HER2 (median = 0.80), ALK (median = 0.80), ROS1 (median = 0.95) and MDM2 (median = 0.72). Our preliminary analysis indicates significant heterogeneity between tumor types for protein expression and copy-number alterations. To our knowledge, there are no previously reported systematic reviews that have empirically assessed the spatial concordance of proteome and genome, in human cancer samples. The authors often reported IHC\/FISH results at patient, or section level, potentially introducing selection bias by not accounting for intra-tumoral heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Future efforts are needed to spatially resolve gene-copy number and protein expression at single-cell resolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Proteomics,Immunohistochemistry,In situ hybridization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura  K.

However, high-plex immunofluorescence imaging requires the end user to painstakingly optimize antibody concentrations and image acquisition settings before producing reproducible imaging data with sufficient and quantifiable dynamic range. Mismatches of reagent concentration and camera exposures will result in under and over-saturated images, and both outcomes are detrimental for signal quantification and downstream interpretation. As the number of markers deployed in spatial biology increases, it becomes necessary to develop strategies that streamline or automate parameter setting that is needed to capture data with optimal dynamic range.<br \/>The CellScape&#8482; platform for Precise Spatial Multiplexing, featuring ChipCytometry&#8482; technology, utilizes multi-exposure high dynamic range (HDR) microscopy as a tool to produce data with consistent and reliable detection of biomarker signals. CellScape replaces the standard single exposure with an exposure series calibrated to the physical limitations of the detector system. Each exposure series captures linear data, ranging from the dimmest to the brightest signals that the system can detect, as well as everything in between. HDR capture is thus akin to capturing an image at every possible exposure length, and it thus includes data from the &#8216;optimal&#8217; matched exposure. By these means, HDR obviates the need for exposure selection by covering the entire exposure gamut.<br \/>Here, we use CellScape to collect a high-plex immunofluorescence spatial biology dataset. Analysis of the dataset highlights the extended linear dynamic range of the integrated luminance HDR data, including a calculation of the expected &#8216;best-matched&#8217; exposure. Further, we extend this analysis to show how HDR can handle biological variation and allow normalization that is not possible with single exposure imaging. Finally, we examine a reagent concentration series to demonstrate how HDR can be used to maximize the sensitivity of the assay by allowing increasing detection reagent concentration without compromising overall dynamic range for the signal. Our data demonstrates that HDR microscopy supports the deployment of spatial biology as a tool to interrogate the tumor microenvironment, unravel responsiveness to drug treatments and cell therapies, and ultimately stratify patients for targeted treatment and clinical trial enrollment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Screening,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Understanding the proteome of the IS between a target cell and a lymphocyte is crucial for advancing immuno-oncology. The low abundance of ISs and the lack of a definitive enrichment marker have limited efficient proteomic profiling. Here, we used Microscoop&#8482;, an innovative system that integrates microscopy, machine learning, and targeted photo-biotinylation to enable precise and spatially specific enrichment of IS proteins, thereby facilitating proteomic discovery of the IS. We utilized Raji B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and induced IS formation with Jurkat T cells. The system first employed immunofluorescence imaging of CD3, a common IS marker in Jurkat T cells, and used a convolutional neural network-based deep learning algorithm to train the recognition of ISs from CMTPX-stained Raji B cells. Our automated system then successfully achieved spatially-targeted biotin-tagging of proteins at ISs through thousands of fields of view of imaging, deep learning-driven pattern generation, and photochemical labeling. Subsequent streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry analysis enabled the identification of IS-specific proteins. Remarkably, our spatial proteomic approach led to the isolation and identification of hundreds of different species at the IS interface, including proteins associated with key components of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways such as the TCR\/CD3 complex, Src and Tec family tyrosine kinases, and pivotal NF-kB signaling proteins. Beyond these, we also identified a significant enrichment of proteins not previously associated with the IS. Our study not only illuminates previously unknown aspects of immune regulation at the IS interface, but also shedded light on proteins potentially important for immuno-oncology. These insights have significant implications for cancer research, particularly in understanding and manipulating immune responses for therapeutic purposes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.-M.

Ultra-high-plex immunofluorescence has transformed deep phenotyping and cell neighborhood analysis, providing unprecedented insight into complex and heterogeneous samples such as the TME. Many spatial biology platforms reduce operator hands-on time by automating image acquisition. However, determining the most appropriate markers to distinguish key cell types, finding application-compatible antibody clones and optimizing their dilution remains a tedious manual process. To streamline the panel-building process, we have developed a series of pre-defined, commercially available antibody panels for the MACSima&#8482; Imaging Cyclic Staining (MICS) technology. So far, these have covered the spectrum from ultra-high-plex screening panels with up to 205 antibodies (REAscreen&#8482; MAX) to the more focused REAscreen Immuno Oncology antibody panel with 61 cancer and immune-related antibodies for the comprehensive analysis of various different human FFPE samples. Here, we introduce a new, 20-plex, pre-defined antibody panel. Organized along essential marker groups, it can function as a stand-alone panel that allows the identification of the major tumor-infiltrating leukocyte populations with a focus on T-cells, and providing insight into TME architecture, tumor neovascularization, and cellular activity. Because it can be combined and expanded with any number of antibodies or even entire panel modules, it can be used as a standardized basis for highly multiplexed custom panels optimized for the research question at hand. We demonstrate its performance and broad applicability across several cancer types analyzed with the MICS technology. Finally, preset template examples for panel-specific data processing with MACS iQ View analysis software demonstrate the simplicity yet power of an integrated end-to-end workflow.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Biomarkers,Imaging,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

Because homozygous MTAP deletions result in a complete expression loss, MTAP immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used for detection of homozygous deleted cells. MTAP IHC is of diagnostic utility for the distinction of mesotheliomas (often 9p21 deleted) from benign mesothelial proliferations. Moreover, evidence is emerging that MTAP deficiency results in a critical vulnerability of cancer cells towards drugs targeting several different pathways that depend on a functional MTAP gene and also causes resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>To determine the prevalence of complete MTAP expression loss and to assess the diagnostic utility of MTAP IHC, a tissue microarray containing 17,078 samples from 149 different tumor entities and 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by IHC. All cases with complete MTAP loss were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).<br \/>In normal tissues, MTAP was ubiquitously expressed resulting in a cytoplasmic and nuclear MTAP staining. At least one case with a complete MTAP expression loss was observed in 87 of 149 (58%) tumor categories. MTAP staining was most commonly lost in neuroendocrine neoplasms of various sites (up to 80%), Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (38%), mesothelioma (24-30%), bilio-pancreatic adenocarcinomas (9-36%), urothelial neoplasms (19-29%), malignant melanoma (14-21%), mucinous carcinoma of the ovary (27%), squamous cell carcinomas of various organs of origin (up to 24%), various types of sarcomas (up to 20%), adenocarcinoma of the lung (11%), gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas (2.6-11%), and in various types of non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas (up to 14%). FISH validation identified homozygous 9p21 deletions in 90-98% of cases with MTAP expression loss in most tumor categories including urothelial neoplasms, mesotheliomas, and pancreatic cancers, and others. There were, however, also tumor types such as neuroendocrine tumors and Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas that always lacked 9p21 deletions.<br \/>In summary, our data provide a comprehensive overview on MTAP expression in cancer and show a strong link between MTAP expression loss and homozygous 9p21 deletions in most tumor entities. These cancers might most benefit from cancer drugs targeting MTAP deficiency. The absence of 9p21 deletions in other entities with frequent MTAP expression loss demonstrates that other mechanisms can cause significant MTAP downregulation. Whether these tumors benefit from targeting MTAT deficiency remains to be determined.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,MTAP,9p21,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"N.

TYMS is thus essential for DNA synthesis and represents an important target for several chemotherapeutic drugs including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate. It has been suggested that tumors with low-levels of TYMS may show a better response to 5-FU than those with high-level expression. Literature data on TYMS expression in different cancer types is controversial, however. To better comprehend the role of TYMS expression in cancer, TYMS was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 9,015 samples from 127 different tumor types as well as 8 samples each of 6 different normal tissue types. TYMS immunostaining was always cytoplasmic and\/or nuclear. It was only detectable in a minority of normal cell types and was strongest in a subset of lymphoid cells, especially in germinal centers and in the thymus as well as in hematopoetic cells of the bone marrow. Detectable TYMS staining occurred in 3,749 (46.7%) of the 8,030 analyzable tumors, including 2,958 (36.8%) with weak, 609 (7.6%) with moderate, and 182 (2.3%) with strong positivity. A total of 114 of 127 tumor categories showed TYMS expression in at least one case, 64 tumor categories showed TYMS staining &#8805;50% of cases, and 47 tumor categories included at least one case with strong TYMS positivity. The frequency of TYMS positivity was highest in various subtypes of B- and T-cell lymphoma (80-100%), sarcomas, carcinosarcomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas (33.3-100%), primary and metastatic malignant melanoma (70.5-90.7%), adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix (78.3%), squamous cell carcinomas of various sites of origin (57.1-77.9%), and testicular germ cell tumors (19.4-67.4%). In all four tumor entities for which clinico-pathological data could be assessed, high TYMS expression was associated with features of aggressive disease. High TYMS expression was linked to high histologic grade (p&#60;0.0001) in endometrioid endometrium carcinoma, advanced pT stage (p=0.0061) in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, poor histologic grade (p&#60;0.0001) in squamous cell carcinomas of 11 different organs of origin, and to advanced stage (p&#60;0.0001), tumor invasion in blood and lymph vessels (p&#8804;0.0064) as well as microsatellite instability (p&#60;0.0001) in colon cancers. TYMS is often overexpressed as compared to normal tissues in a broad range of different cancer entities. Our data suggest that high-level of TYMS expression is a feature of cancer aggressiveness in many different cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Biomarkers,TYMS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

Homozygous MTAP deletions result in a complete loss of expression which can be visualized by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Evidence is emerging that MTAP deficiency results in a critical vulnerability of cancer cells towards drugs targeting multiple different pathways that depend on a functional MTAP gene and causes resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of MTAP deficiency and its relationship with the tumor microenvironment in urothelial bladder carcinomas, more than 2,500 tumors were analyzed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and IHC in a tissue microarray format, and the data were compared with existing data on intratumoral lymphocyte subsets and PD-L1 expression. The cohort included 1,826 patients that underwent radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive disease (pT2-4). 9p21 deletion was homozygous in 364 (21.3%) and heterozygous in 334 (19.5%) of 1,711 analyzable tumors. The rate of 9p21 deleted tumors increased from pTa G2 low (9.2% homozygous, 25.8% heterozygous) to pTa G2 high (32.6%, 20.9%; p&#60;0.0001) but was slightly lower in pTa G3 (16.7% each). In pT2-pT4 carcinomas, 9p21 deletions were homozygous in 23.3% and heterozygous in 17.9%. Within muscle-invasive cancers, 9p21 deletions were tied to high pT (p=0.0014) and poor overall survival (p=0.0461). MTAP expression loss was strongly linked to homozygous 9p21 deletions. Complete absence of MTAP staining was seen in 96.1% of homozygous deleted cancers while only 4 of 249 MTAP negative cancers had retained at least one 9p21 copy (p&#60;0.0001). Accordingly, absence of MTAP staining was also linked to advanced pT status and poor overall survival (p&#60;0.05 each). Tumors with heterozygous 9p21 deletion did often show preserved but low-level expression of MTAP. 9p21 deletions were associated with low numbers of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (p&#60;0.0001), CD8 (p=0.01) and CD4 positive lymphocytes (p=0.009), M2-macrophages (p&#60;0.0001), and dendritic cells (p=0.0007). A similar tendency was observed for MTAP expression loss, but the level of significance was only reached for PD-L1 positive tumor cells (p&#60;0.0001), M2 macrophages (p=0.001) and dendritic cells (p=0.012). Complete MTAP expression loss is common in urinary bladder cancer and strongly tied to homozygous 9p21 loss, aggressive disease, and non-inflamed microenvironment. Drugs targeting MTAP-deficiency may be highly useful in bladder cancer. MTAP IHC is an excellent surrogate for the detection of MTAP deficiency in this tumor entity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Diagnostic marker,MTAP,9p21,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"N.

KDM6A mutations occur commonly in cancer. These are of interest because KDM6A loss results in a dependency on EZH2, a potential therapeutic target. Most data on KDM6A have been obtained by next generation sequencing (NGS). However, since most KDM6A mutations are truncating and KDM6A is located on the X chromosome, many mutations result in a complete expression loss which can be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To learn more on the prevalence of KDM6A expression loss and its role in cancer, a tissue microarray containing 6,560 samples from 114 different tumor entities and 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed. In normal tissues, KDM6A staining was rather ubiquitously seen in nuclei. In cancer, KDM6A staining was considered weak (1+) in 581 (11.2%), moderate in 1,927 (37%), and strong in 2,362 (45.4%) of 5,206 interpretable tumors. A complete loss of KDM6A staining occurred in 336 (6.5%) of tumors. At least one case with a complete KDM6A expression loss was observed in 51 of 114 tumor categories. KDM6A staining was most commonly lost in different categories of urothelial carcinomas (19.5-39.2%), squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus (27.1%), hepatocellular carcinoma (18.4%), gastric carcinoma (3.2-12.5%), papillary renal cell carcinoma (9.5%), adenocarcinoma of the prostate (5.9-9.4%), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (8.9%), Ewing sarcoma (8.3%), pheochromocytoma (8.3%), and metastatic malignant melanoma (8%). A KDM6A expression loss in less than 8% of cases was observed in 32 further tumor entities. KDM6A expression loss was more than twice as frequent in tumors from male (8.4% of 2,526) than in tumors from female patients (3.9% of 2,024; p&#60;0.0001). It is concluded that KDM6A IHC is a suitable method for the detection of truncating KDM6A mutations, especially in males. These make up for about 2\/3 of all KDM6A mutations and may exert specific biological effects than differ from the various KDM6A missense mutations known to also occur.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Therapeutic target,KDM6A,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.
