Nonetheless, multiple promising combinations have been investigated including those with MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant tumors, PI3K\/mTOR inhibition in a variety of tumor types, FLT3 inhibition in AML, and HIF-2alpha inhibition in ccRCC. In this talk, mechanistic considerations for these combinations will be reviewed, as well as early phase clinical trial data of combinations of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib with either the MEK inhibitor binimetinib or the PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor gedatolisib. The palbociclib-binimetinib combination has recently been incorporated into the NCI Precision Medicine Initiative as part of ComboMATCH, where investigation is ongoing in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other RAS-mutant tumors. Such combinations hold substantial promise for extending the use of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor drug class beyond ER+ breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,MEK inhibitor,PI3K-mTOR inhibitor,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Geoffrey I.
