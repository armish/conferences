I-SPY2 was the first randomized trial to examine the efficacy of IO therapy in high-risk HR+HER2- breast cancer, where most IO arms showed improved efficacy relative to control. We also previously showed immune-gene expression signatures associate with pathologic complete response (pCR) in HR+HER2- treated with IO; and developed a clinically applicable Immune classifier (ImPrint) predicting response to IO that is now being used in I-SPY2.2 as part of the Response Predictive Subtypes. Here we report the performance of ImPrint in HR+HER2- patients from 5 IO arms.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>204 HR+HER2- (MammaPrint high risk) patients from 5 IO arms (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1\/PARPi, anti-PD1\/TLR9 dual-IO, and anti-PD1 +\/- LAG3 dual-IO) and 191 patients from the control arm were included in this analysis. Patients were classified ImPrint+ (likely sensitive) vs. ImPrint- (likely resistant), by Agendia, Inc, using pre-treatment mRNA. Performance of ImPrint for predicting pCR to IO was characterized and compared to that of MammaPrint (ultra) High2 risk (MP2) and tumor grade (III). Based on the DRFS of pCR vs. non-pCR HR+HER2-\/ImPrint+ patients (median follow up ~4.5yr), we predicted the DRFS in the IO vs. control arms using an exponential model as a function of the pCR rates.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Overall, the pCR rate over the 5 IO arms was 33%. 28% of HR+HER2- patients were ImPrint+; and pCR rates with IO were 76% in ImPrint+ vs. 16% in ImPrint-, with the highest pCR rate &#62;90% in a dual-IO arm. In the control arm, pCR rates were 33% in ImPrint+ and 8% in ImPrint-.<br \/>Based on the pCR rates in the IO vs. control (76% vs. 33%), the predicted DRFS of HR+HER2-\/ImPrint+ patients are 91% vs 80% at 5 years, respectively. This translates to a risk reduction of 52% for the IO arm relative to standard chemotherapy in HR+HER2-\/ImPrint+ patients.<br \/>We also compared MP2 and tumor grade (III) to ImPrint+ as pCR predictors, as these markers have been used or proposed as selection markers for neoadjuvant IO trials in HR+HER2-. The pCR rates for MP2, Grade III, at 56%, 45%, respectively, are much smaller than that for ImPrint+ at 75% pCR; thus ImPrint appears to be a more precise predictive biomarker for neoadjuvant IO therapy in the HR+HER2- breast cancers.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These results suggest that a subset of high risk HR+HER2- breast cancers is highly sensitive to immunotherapy, and by using a specific and sensitive selection strategy patients could achieve pCR rates similar to what is seen with best neoadjuvant therapies in TNBC and HER2+ (i.e., pCR rate &#62; 65-70%). ImPrint, an FDA IDE-enabled assay currently being further evaluated in I-SPY2, may represent the way to identify patients for IO that best balances likely benefit vs risk of serious immune-related adverse events.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Predictive biomarkers,Breast cancer,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, clinical management is challenging. The PD-L1 biomarker does not optimally guide the choice between ICI monotherapy and combination ICI-chemotherapy, and there are currently no biomarkers to predict immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Here, we describe a versatile platform based on plasma proteomics and machine learning for generating predictive tools to support treatment decisions.<br \/>Methods: Pre-treatment plasma samples were collected from 616 NSCLC patients receiving ICI-based therapy (NCT04056247). Clinical benefit (CB) data and irAEs were recorded. Proteomic profiling of plasma samples was performed using the SomaScan&#174; assay, covering ~7000 proteins per sample. Proteins associated with Clinical Benefit (progression-free survival at 12 months) were classified as resistance-associated proteins (RAPs). Proteins associated with grade &#8805;3 irAEs occurring within the first 100 days of treatment were classified as toxicity-associated proteins (TAPs). RAPs and TAPs were integrated into two separate machine learning-based models, yielding CB and irAE probabilities, respectively. The CB model used a CB probability threshold to assign patients a PROphet-positive or PROphet-negative result. Bioinformatic analysis was performed on RAPs and TAPs.<br \/>Results: CB and irAE models displayed strong predictive performance with a high correlation between predicted probability and observed CB or irAE rate (CB model: R2=0.98; p-value&#60;0.0001; irAE model: R2= 0.92; p-value &#60;0.0001). In the CB model, patients classified as PROphet-positive achieved significantly longer overall survival (OS) than PROphet-negative patients, with a median OS of 25.9 vs. 10.8 months (hazard ratio, HR = 0.51; p-value&#60;0.001). Furthermore, patients with PD-L1 &#8805;50% tumors and a PROphet-negative result had significantly longer OS with ICI-chemotherapy in comparison to ICI monotherapy (HR=0.23, p-value = 0.0003), suggesting that combination therapy is preferable for such patients despite high PD-L1 levels. Bioinformatic analysis showed that RAPs related to immune regulation, angiogenesis, chemo-resistance, and other potential resistance mechanisms displayed higher expression levels in patients who did not benefit from treatment. Neutrophil- and inflammation-related proteins were significantly enriched in patients who experienced irAEs.<br \/>Conclusions: We describe two machine-learning based predictive tools that may be used separately or in combination to inform treatment decisions based on the patient&#8217;s likelihood to benefit from ICI therapy and to develop serious irAEs. Our findings also provide biological insights related to treatment resistance and immune-related toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Machine learning,NSCLC,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

However, depth of response and survival benefit is variable. Limitations in radiographic imaging create challenges in determining a clinical response. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising minimally-invasive, predictive biomarker. Here we explore the utility of tumor-informed, on-treatment ctDNA dynamics for early response monitoring and prognostication in patients with HER2-positive tumors of various histologies receiving trastuzumab + pertuzumab on the phase II basket trial, MyPathway (NCT02091141).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this retrospective study, 58 patients were included based on availability of tissue comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) results and baseline\/on-treatment plasma. FoundationOne&#174; Tracker was utilized to detect and quantify ctDNA, selecting 2-16 tumor-derived variants from tissue CGP and monitoring the corresponding patient&#8217;s plasma with multiplex PCR. ctDNA was assessed at baseline and Cycle 3 Day 1 (C3D1) of therapy. Correlations between ctDNA changes and objective response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were made using Kaplan Meier analyses and landmarked at C3D1. Patients ctDNA- at baseline and C3D1 were excluded.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of the 58 patients, personalized ctDNA assays were successfully designed for 52 (89.7%) representing 14 unique tumor histologies. Of 52, 48 (92.3%) had ctDNA results available for baseline analysis with a median of 100.7 mean tumor molecules per mL (MTM\/mL); 89.6% were ctDNA+ with a median of 119.5 MTM\/mL. A total of 39 patients had both baseline and C3D1 results for ctDNA response analyses. On-treatment ctDNA decline &#62;90% (N=10) was associated with longer survival compared to &#60;90% decline (N=16) or any increase (N=13) in ctDNA (OS: NR, 9.4 months (mo); P= 0.007). CtDNA dynamics remained predictive in a disease specific analysis of colorectal cancer (N=18; OS: NR, 10.2 mo; P= 0.04). Similar results were seen when stratifying patients by baseline ctDNA level (above\/below median MTM\/mL) or HER2<i> <\/i><i>(ERBB2) <\/i>mutation vs amplification. ctDNA increase at C3D1 preceded radiographic progression by a median of 1.3 mo. In patients with stable disease, &#62;90% decline in ctDNA was associated with longer OS compared to &#60;90% decline or any increase (NR, 9.4 mo; P= 0.01).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Tumor-informed ctDNA monitoring provides insight into early treatment response and survival outcomes in patients with diverse HER2 amplified or mutated tumors receiving HER2 targeted therapy. On-treatment ctDNA dynamics refine and can potentially detect response\/progression ahead of standard of care response assessments, suggesting early ctDNA monitoring as a valuable complementary tool for real-time treatment response monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,HER2,early response monitoring,pan-tumor biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

T cells dynamically undergo activation, exhaustion, expansion, phenotype switching, and cell killing. Flow cytometry is the gold standard method for characterizing these at high throughput, typically by comparing T cell populations before and at different timepoints after treatment. This approach is limited to population-level analyses and overlooks any heterogeneity of individual T cell responses over time, which may contribute to variability in response. Here, we describe the development of a novel flow cytometry-based method (Time-lapse flow<sup>TM<\/sup>) to characterize immune cell responses over time at the single cell level.<br \/>To measure the same cells repeatedly on a flow cytometer, we employed a new optical barcoding technology called laser particles (LPs) that provide individual cells with a unique spectral signature that can be tracked over the course of multiple measurements. Using a custom flow cytometer with fluorescence and LP detection, we performed a multi-day assay to capture how T cell marker expression changes over time after CD3\/CD28 activation. Specifically, we used releasable antibodies to quantify PD1, CD69 and CD25 at each time-point and correlated these expression kinetics with cell function at the end of the assay by measuring cytokine secretion (IFNg, IL2, TNFa) after PMA\/ionomycin stimulation.<br \/>We found significant cellular heterogeneity in kinetic profiles of PD1, CD69 and CD25 expression, with different dominant &#8216;kinetic modes&#8217; present for each marker. For example, while a large proportion of PD1 expression was transient (positive on day 1, but not on days 2 and 3), nearly all cells that express CD69 on day 1 retained their expression on day 2. We also found that T cells with late expression of PD1 had significantly more cytokine secretion compared to cells that were initially positive for PD1. These results were replicated with at least 3 replicate samples for multiple donors. Differences in kinetic phenotypes were not explained by conventional phenotyping with CD4, CD8, CD45RA and CCR7.<br \/>To date, immune cell phenotyping with flow cytometry involves classifying cell types through their marker expression profiles at a single time-point. Here, we introduce a novel approach for acquiring time-resolved single-cell data with a flow cytometer and applied it to study T cell activation. We found novel kinetic phenotypes of T cells defined by their marker expression over time, which also correlated to their functional potential (cytokine secretion). These kinetic phenotypes could not be identified with conventional flow cytometry. Our approach could have significant implications for immunotherapy development, particularly in identifying the most suitable cell populations to use, understanding mechanisms of exhaustion and persistence, and elucidating the basis of donor variability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Adoptive immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Immunoassay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Combination therapy with antiangiogenic agents and anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody has shown enhanced antitumor effects. EAST ENERGY is a single-arm multicenter phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and ramucirumab in patients with PD-L1-positive stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (NCT04040361). In this study, we aimed to identify biomarkers that predicts the efficacy of the neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, we aimed to elucidate the effect of the neoadjuvant therapy on the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>Methods: Patients enrolled in the EAST ENERGY trial (n=24) for whom pre- and post-treatment specimens were available (n=20) were included in this study. RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) were used to examine the association between the immunological phenotype of the TME and major pathological response (MPR), and changes in the TME before and after treatment.<br \/>Results: MPR was achieved in 50.0% (12\/24) of patients. Biomarker analyses with RNA-sequencing revealed that high expression of cancer-associated genes, and upregulation of interferon-gamma and interferon-alpha response in pre-treatment tumor were associated with MPR (q value&#60;0.001). mIHC in pre-treatment samples revealed that abundance of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the pre-treatment TME was associated with MPR (p=0.039). On the other hand, infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as Treg or M2-macrophages were not associated with resistance for the treatment (p=0.836, 0.639, respectively). Next, to clarify the effect of the neoadjuvant therapy on the TME, comparative analyses of pre- and post-treatment samples was performed. In gene set enrichment analysis, the neoadjuvant therapy enhanced gene set associated with interferon-gamma response (q value=0.051). Furthermore, angiogenesis-related gene set were downregulated after the treatment (q value=0.090). mIHC analyses revealed that the number of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the TME was significantly increased after the neoadjuvant therapy (p&#60;0.001). Notably, Tregs \/ CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells ratio and the number of M2-macrophage in the TME were significantly decreased after the neoadjuvant therapy (p=0.032, 0.003, respectively).<br \/>Conclusion: In the neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab, immune-activated status before treatment serves as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment response. Moreover, combining ramucirumab with pembrolizumab reduced immunosuppressive cells in the TME and inhibited tumor angiogenesis. These results suggest that this combination therapy modifies the TME and augments antitumor immunity. Larger clinical trial is warranted to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immune checkpoint blockade,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

In the largest cohort of advanced KRAS G12C-mutant (<i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>) NSCLC pts treated with G12Ci, we demonstrated <i>KEAP1 <\/i>and <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations are enriched in early progression to G12Ci. Yet the independent predictive role of <i>KEAP1<\/i> and <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations and the impact of enhanced NRF2 signaling in clinical outcomes to G12Ci remains incompletely characterized.<br \/>Methods: Clinico-genomic data were collected from 129 pts with advanced <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC treated with adagrasib (ada) (KRYSTAL-1 - NCT03785249). NRF2 signaling was estimated by NRF2 score (<i>HTG transcriptome panel<\/i>). Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS and OS were assessed with log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression model. <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC cell lines and CDX\/PDX models were used for pre-clinical experiments.<br \/>Results <i>KEAP1 <\/i>and <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations were each associated with significantly shorter survival upon ada treatment (<i>KEAP1<\/i>: PFS 4.1 vs 9.9 mo, HR 2.7, p&#60;0.01; OS 5.4 vs 19.0 mo, HR 3.6, p&#60;0.01; <i>STK11<\/i>: PFS 4.2 vs 11.0 mo, HR 2.2, p&#60;0.01; OS 9.8 mo vs not reached [NR], HR 2.6, p&#60;0.01). <i>KEAP1<sup>WT<\/sup>\/STK11<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> status identified a group of pts with significantly longer PFS (16.85 mo) and OS (NR) upon treatment with ada. In cell viability and colony formation assays, KEAP1 re-expression sensitized all <i>KEAP1<sup>MUT<\/sup>\/STK11<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC cell lines to ada treatment. Similar results were observed with <i>STK11<\/i>\/LKB1 re-expression. <i>KEAP1<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> was linked to limited response to ada across a broad panel of NSCLC PDX\/CDX. <i>I<\/i><i>n vivo <\/i>drug anchored CRISPR screens in the ada-sensitive LU99 cell line identified <i>KEAP1<\/i> as the most significant gene promoting resistance to ada. <i>KEAP1<\/i> KO in the LU99 model determined early onset of ada resistance. <i>In vitro<\/i> drug screens showed high synergy scores and higher anti-tumor activity for mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) and ada combinations in<i> K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> <i>KEAP1<sup>MUT<\/sup>\/STK11<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC. High NRF2 score was associated with significantly shorter survival with ada (PFS: 4.2 vs 8.4 mo, HR 2.0, p=0.02; OS: 6.5 vs 19.0 mo, HR 2.8, p&#60;0.01) even in <i>KEAP1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>NSCLC pts. Integration of <i>KEAP1<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i>, <i>STK11<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> and low NRF2 score status identified pts - 32% - with significant and meaningfully longer survival when treated with ada (PFS 12.0 vs 4.2 mo, HR 0.2, P&#60;0.01; OS NR vs 8.0 mo, HR 0.1, p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Co-mutations in <i>KEAP1<\/i> and <i>STK11<\/i> and NRF2 signaling define a subgroup of <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC pts with markedly distinct outcomes upon treatment with ada. The mTORi and ada combination shows high efficacy for targeting <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC harboring <i>KEAP1<\/i> and <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations. The clinical safety and efficacy of mTORi nab-sirolimus and ada will be determined in the ongoing KRYSTAL-19 trial (NCT05840510).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,KRAS,Nrf2,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is postulated to be a generic determinant of ICI dependent-tumor rejection. Here, we clarify the association between TMB and survival outcomes among microsatellite-stable cancers in a real-world clinicogenomic cohort including 70,698 patients distributed across 27 histologies.<br \/>Methods: Patients were segregated into mutually exclusive anti-PD-1\/L1 (N=14,736, immune checkpoint inhibitor, ICI) and non-ICI cohorts (N=55,962) if they had received pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, or cemiplimab, and non-ICI therapies, respectively, during the course of treatment for individual cancer types. Patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy combination regimens were included in the ICI cohorts, but anti-CTLA-4 agents were excluded from both cohorts. For both ICI and non-ICI cohorts, patients were reiteratively categorized as TMB-high or -low using increasing TMB thresholds up to the 90th percentile TMB for individual cancer types. Outcomes were then assessed using Cox regression analyses of overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: Across 27 histologies, 12 cancer types had at least one TMB cutoff associated with survival benefit upon ICIs (melanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, bladder, cervical, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, head and neck, vulvar cancers, as well as carcinoma of unknown primary, and sarcoma), and these associations were generally conserved across sex and age groups, although not necessarily significant in all cases. In two cancer types (cholangiocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors), TMB cutoffs were associated with worse OS with ICIs. The lowest TMB cutoff in which a survival benefit could be detected with ICIs ranged from 2 mut\/Mb in melanoma to 9 mut\/Mb in colorectal cancer. TMB thresholds with the greatest predictive value (defined as the lowest survival hazard ratio) were frequently near the highest TMB examined for individual cancer types, suggesting that TMB may scale with ICI benefit.<br \/>Conclusion: TMB was associated with survival benefit or detriment depending on tissue and treatment context. Detectable survival benefits were noted over a broad range of TMB cutoffs across cancer types, and a dose-dependent relationship between TMB and outcomes was observed in a subset of cancers. These results may have implications for cancer-agnostic and universal TMB cutoffs to guide the use of anti-PD-1\/L1 therapies, and underline the importance of tissue context in the clinical development of ICI biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Tumor mutational burden,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
