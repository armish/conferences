[{"Abstract":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been widely used in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the addition of ICIs to chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced (LA) NPC requires further investigation. We conducted a phase II, single-arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, cisplatin (GP) plus tislelizumab followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in LA-NPC. All participants received 3 cycles of GP chemotherapy plus tislelizumab (200 mg) followed by 3 cycles of cisplatin-based CCRT. The primary endpoint was the clinical complete response rate (CR) after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NAT). The secondary endpoints include pathological CR rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), etc. Pretreatment blood samples and paired (pre-\/post-NAT) tissue biopsies were collected to perform full-spectrum peripheral T-cell profiling, PD-L1 and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) staining. Among all 63 participants, the CR rate after NAT reached 41.3% (95% CI, 28.8%-53.8%), far exceeding our hypothesized CR rate of 22%. The objective response rate (ORR) and pCR rate after NAT were 88.9% (95% CI, 80.9% to 96.9%) and 74.6% (95% CI, 62.1% to 84.7%), respectively. As of July 15<sup>th<\/sup>, 2023, after the median follow-up of 25 months, the 2-year PFS and OS were 98.4% and 100%. The incidence of grade 3-4 immunotherapy-related adverse events was 1.6%. The compliance of CCRT was not compromised. Patients who achieved CR had significantly more circulating CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells (Tem), regulatory T cells (Treg) and follicular helper T cells (Tfh). The peripheral abundance of LAG3+ Tem and Tfh were independently predictive of NAT response. The number and maturation of TLS significantly increased after NAT in the CR group, but not in the Non-CR group. GP chemotherapy plus tislelizumab followed by CCRT was highly therapeutic and safe in treating LA-NPC, further randomized phase III studies are awaited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,T cell,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.-Y.

In biliary tract cancers, checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been shown to improve outcomes when combined with chemotherapy<u>.<\/u> In an effort to increase the breadth and duration of response of CTX-009, we set out to investigate the combined anti-tumor efficacy of this bispecific antibody and immunotherapy in preclinical models. Here we report the evaluation of the combination of the mouse surrogates of CTX-009 and CTX-471, an agonistic anti-mouse CD137 antibody, or monoclonal antibodies that disrupt the PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling axis. Coupling VEGF-A\/DLL4 targeting with either CD137 agonism or PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade markedly increased the anti-tumor efficacy of the individual treatments alone in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. Tumor growth inhibition was accompanied by pharmacodynamic evidence consistent with enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. Notably, the combination of CTX-009 and CTX-471 retained potent anti-tumor activity even in a tumor line (MC38) which was made MHC I deficient through the deletion of the beta 2 microglobulin gene. This system may model the clinically relevant unmet need characterized by tumor escape through the loss of antigen presentation machinery such as HLA LOH. Interestingly, the model cell lines CT26 and MC38 failed to thrive in the B2M-deficient setting and depletion of NK cells markedly increased their ability to grow. This implies that NK cells might be involved in controlling tumor growth in this setting, and that the combined action of CTX-471 and CTX-009 in the tumor stroma enhances NK cell activity. The findings presented here suggest that CTX-009 may provide enhanced clinical benefit when combined with immunomodulatory agents, such as agonistic anti-CD137 antibodies or PD-1\/PD-L1 blockers in tumors where immune checkpoint inhibitors have failed.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis inhibitor,Immunotherapy,Therapeutic proteins,Bispecific antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show promise, early clinical results indicate benefits in only a specific subset of patients with TNBC. Preclinical evidence indicates that infiltrating macrophages contribute to breast tumor progression by restricting CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration, activation, and cytotoxicity within tumor microenvironments. Preliminary data has revealed that immune-competent mammary tumor-bearing MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice have slowed tumor progression following sequential combination of a microtubule poison (paclitaxel; PTX) to enhance tumor immunogenicity, plus a macrophage-depleting\/reprogramming agent such as a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor blocking antibody (&#945;CSF1R), and undergo primary tumor regression in 60% of transgenic mice when an ICI targeting PD-1 is applied (3x therapy) by a CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-dependent mechanism. Response to 3x therapy is associated with localized CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T effector and resident memory cell expansion, and increased antigen-specific clonal expansion at primary tumor sites. We hypothesized that epigenetic plasticity was limiting T cell memory and thus impeding long-term tumor control. Using a class 1 benzamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (e.g., entinostat) sequentially added to PTX\/&#945;CSF1R\/&#945;PD-1 therapy (4x) resulted in primary tumor stasis in 100% of mice, and significantly enhanced overall survival, in two transgenic mouse models of breast cancer (MMTV-PyMT and C3-(1)-TAg). Cohorts were analyzed at distinct time points for primary and metastatic tumor burden, in addition to immunophenotyping (flow cytometry), transcriptional (bulk and scRNA-Seq), epigenetic (sciATAC-Seq), and T cell receptor (TCR) changes correlating with 4x responses. Improved outcome and tumor stasis was associated with increased presence of long-lived central and stem-like memory CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell infiltration, intra-tumoral B memory cell, and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T follicular helper cell infiltration. Tumor stasis was achieved by B and T cell-dependent mechanisms where B cell depletion led to decreased T cell cytotoxicity. Adoptive serum transfer (AST) from 4x-treated MMTV-PyMT mice into either 3x-treated or untreated MMTV-PyMT mice elicited tumor stasis and control. These preclinical studies indicate the complexity of myeloid, B cell and T cell interactions that are co-opted by tumors, and identify novel paths to therapeutic tumor control by targeting vulnerable immune communication programs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, ICI often induces immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that warrant therapy cessation, thereby limiting the overall effectiveness of this class of therapeutic agents. Currently, available therapies used to treat irAEs might also blunt the antitumor activity of the ICI themselves. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify treatments that have the potential to be administered alongside ICI to optimize their use. Using a translationally relevant murine model of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies-induced irAEs, we compared the safety and efficacy of prednisolone, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF&#593;, anti-IL-25 (IL-17E), and anti-IL-17RA (the receptor for IL-25) administration to prevent irAEs and to reduce tumor size. While all interventions were adequate to inhibit the onset of irAEs pneumonitis and hepatitis, treatment with anti-IL-25 or anti-IL-17RA antibodies also exerted significant additional antitumor activity. Mechanistically, IL-25\/IL-17RA blockade reduced the number of organ-infiltrating lymphocytes. These findings suggest that IL-25\/IL-17RA may serve as an additional target when treating ICI-responsive tumors, allowing for better tumor control while suppressing immune-related toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Interleukin-17,Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"X.

In recent years, several HPK1 inhibitors have been discovered as novel immune-oncology drugs with promising potential to improve anti-tumor immune responses. However, there has been no study showing the effects and potential application of HPK1 in gynecologic malignancies. Therefore, we investigated the expression and role of HPK1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells (CD8 TILs) and how the selective small molecule kinase inhibitor, FB849, affected the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8 TILs in gynecologic cancers. We isolated TILs from patients with newly diagnosed endometrial (<i>n<\/i>=53) and ovarian cancer (<i>n<\/i>=46). The immunological properties and HPK1 signaling pathway of CD8 TILs were explored using flow cytometry. TILs were <i>in vitro<\/i> stimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence of FB849 and\/or anti-PD-1, and their proliferation was assessed. We observed that HPK1 marked severely exhausted PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8 TILs, and high HPK1 expressers had more exhausted PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8 TILs compared to low HPK1 expressers. In addition, FB849 could successfully restore the effector function of exhausted CD8 TILs. In particular, the reinvigorating capacity of FB849 was negatively correlated with phosphorylated SLP76<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8 TILs in endometrial cancer. In addition, FB849 further enhanced anti-PD-1-mediated reinvigoration of CD8 TILs in endometrial cancer. However, there was no synergistic effect of FB849 + anti-PD-1 in terms of proliferative capacity in ovarian cancer. Overall, the results of our present study provide a rationale for clinical trials investigating the anti-tumor efficacy of FB849 &#177; anti-PD-1 tailored to the respective properties of gynecologic malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,HPK1 inhibitor,Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte,anti-PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

It is a highly angiogenic tumor exhibiting an extremely invasive nature. As such, its brain microenvironment plays a crucial role in its progression. Microglia are the brain resident immune cells that have been shown to facilitate GB cell invasion and immune suppression. The mechanism by which GB cells alter microglia behavior is yet to be fully understood. One proposed mechanism involves adhesion molecules such as the Selectins family of proteins which are expressed on the surface of endothelial and immune cells and are involved in immune modulation and cancer immunity. We have previously shown that one member of the Selectin family, P-Selectin (SELP), is expressed by GB cells. Here, we investigated the functional role of SELP in GB-microglia interactions. First, we found that microglia cells facilitate the expression and secretion of SELP by GB cells, and that GB cells facilitate the expression of P-Selectin ligand-1 (PSGL-1) by Glioma-associated microglia\/macrophages (GAMs). We then showed that SELP mediates GAMs-enhanced GB invasion and proliferation in our unique 3D-bioprinted <i>ex vitro<\/i> models and has a role in GAMs activation state. These findings were validated <i>in vivo<\/i>, showing that inhibition or downregulation of SELP leads to reduced tumor growth, increased overall survival, and improved immune response. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the tumors revealed an increase in pro-inflammatory GAMs signature, reduction in cancer cell tumorigenesis potential, and improved T cell activation. Thus, combining SELP inhibition with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, may have a synergistic effect by harnessing both the innate and the adaptive immune systems against the tumor. Furthermore, we found SELP\/PSGL-1 axis to be involved in the progression of brain metastasis originating from melanoma, and breast, and lung cancer. Thus, we have begun an investigator-initiated clinical trial, testing the efficacy of the anti-SELP antibody, Crizanlizumab, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, Nivolumab, for GB and melanoma brain metastasis patients (NCT05909618). Crizanlizumab, approved by the FDA and EMA for sickle cell pain crisis (VOC, Vaso-Occlusive Crisis) of sickle-cell anemia patients, was proven to be safe for human use, and efficient in inhibiting SELP function. As such, it has the potential to reduce tumor burden and improve patient outcomes. This work can improve our understanding of GAMs function, which may pave the way for new and effective treatments for primary and secondary brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Brain metastasis,Immunotherapy,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

While treatment options have improved with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), many patients do not respond to immunotherapy or develop resistance following initial response. A significant subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbors somatic co-mutations in <i>Kirsten rat sarcoma virus<\/i><b> <\/b><i>(KRAS) <\/i>and<i> Liver kinase 1 [LKB1, <\/i>also known as <i>serine\/threonine kinase 11 (STK11<\/i>)<i>]<\/i> genes, whose tumors are characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that are resistant to ICI. Our studies revealed that <i>all-trans<\/i> retinoic acid (ATRA), a metabolite derived from vitamin A, sensitized a murine model of NSCLC with increased tumor mutational burden (<i>Kras<\/i> <sup>G12D<\/sup> <i>P53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup><i>Lkb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>; KPL-3M) to PD-1 blockade. The ATRA and anti-PD-1 combination therapy improved local and systemic T cell activation and generated systemic tumor-specific immunity. To understand ATRA-mediated anti-tumor effects, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of KPL-3M murine tumors with or without 6 daily ATRA treatments. scRNA-seq analysis revealed a reduction of neutrophils as well as an enrichment in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations in the TME. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis revealed elevated expression of interferon (IFN) downstream genes in multiple immune subpopulations in the TME. Preliminary <i>ex vivo<\/i> studies indicated that ATRA increases NOX2 levels, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and IFN signaling in the neutrophils in KPL-3M tumors. Our findings suggest that ATRA may reshape the TME by activating IFN signaling in multiple cell subtypes to sensitize resistant tumors to ICI immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ATRA,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

All patients are administered systemic high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Many targeted and immune therapy approaches are currently in clinical trials for treating osteosarcoma, but single treatments are not showing promise. While combined targeted and immunotherapy appears to be a possible avenue, developing solutions for patients who show intolerable toxicity or lack of synergy is critical. Nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully been used to prolong the half-life of drugs, favor extended release, reduce systemic toxicity, and reach beyond biological barriers. Biomimetic NPs represent an emerging class of NPs as a system to mimic naturally occurring processes. One class of biomimetic NPs is leukosomes, leukocyte-based biomimetic NPs that target inflamed tissues. Leukosomes are synthesized by integrating proteins isolated from the membranes of circulating leukocytes in the NPs' wall. Leukosomes' biomolecular profile helps them adhere to tumor-inflamed vasculature and promotes their self-tolerance and ability to evade immune clearance from the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). We have demonstrated the feasibility of a \"one-two punch\" approach for leukosome-mediated bone cancer treatment. Specifically, the first \"punch\" (a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, mTKI) induces an immunogenic response, which is subsequently targeted by leukosomes delivering a second class of compounds (immunomodulating nucleic acids, second \"punch\"). Indeed, even a single mTKI administration increases the amount of leukosomes localized to tumors, which is amplified by a second dosage in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, leukosome infiltration was paralleled by an increase in immune infiltration, especially in Cd8+ T-cell abundance and macrophages. After several iterations and protocol adjustments, leukosome compositions and microfluidic parameters have been optimized to load either siRNA or mRNA. Current experiments are optimizing the \"second punch\" targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (siRNAs vs. PD1\/PDL-1). Interestingly, we showed the leukosomes produced using the membranes of human or mouse macrophages pre-treated with LPS show increased surface concentration of adhesion molecules (e.g., Siglec-1) that further enhance their localization at the inflamed site while decreasing filtration by the MPS. In addition to increased delivery to the tumor site, this strategy reduces the therapeutic strain because it is sequential (\"one-two punch\") and uses nucleic acids instead of antibodies to target immune checkpoints. Overall, our work describes a novel rationale-based sequential approach that can be <i>paradigm-shifting<\/i> in the field as it harnesses treatment-induced inflammation to boost intratumoral drug delivery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Nanoparticle,Immunotherapy,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

However, a substantial number of patients still relapse due to either inherent or acquired resistance to ICB therapies. In this scenario, activation of T cell co-stimulation pathways along with ICB emerges as a promising strategy to improve anti-tumor responses. Engagement of Glucocorticoid induced TNFR Related protein (GITR) costimulatory molecule, leads to enhanced activation of cytotoxic T cells while destabilizing suppressive T regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, combining GITR agonism with PD-1 blockade improves the anti-tumor response in a murine model of advanced melanoma resistant to ICB, positioning GITR as an attractive immunotherapeutic target. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of combining blockade of the immune checkpoint LAG3 with GITR agonism for treating ICB-resistant advanced melanoma, using the B16 model. The combination of LAG3 blockade with GITR agonism was well tolerated, leading to better tumor control and improved survival. Our data revealed increased B cell infiltration and activation within tumors and draining lymph nodes (LNs) of treated mice. B cell depletion diminished the anti-tumor effect of the combination therapy, suggesting that B cells play an active role in controlling tumor growth. Spleens from treated mice exhibited increased lymphocytic hyperplasia, along with more and larger germinal centers. B cell receptor sequencing revealed an increased clonality and reduced entropy. Treating B cells with GITR agonism and LAG3 blockade <i>in vitro<\/i> led to increased activation and proliferation, suggesting a direct effect of these therapies on B cells. Furthermore, adding LAG3 blockade to the dual combination of GITR agonism and PD-1 blockade resulted in superior tumor control and increased B cell activity in the draining LNs. Collectively, our findings suggest that the humoral response significantly contributes to the anti-tumor responses elicited by ICB when combined with GITR agonism. This triple combination therapy (LAG3 blockade + PD1 blockade + GITR agonism) holds promise as a safe and potent therapeutic strategy to overcome ICB resistance. Further investigation into the mechanism of action by which GITR agonism leads to enhanced B cell responses when combined with ICB is warranted in order to design more effective therapies for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Resistance,GITR,B Cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Here, we utilize a unique lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) system comprised of co-encapsulated agonists of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways (immuno-NPs) that can be safely administered in the systemic blood circulation for delivery to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and uptake by perivascular innate antigen-presenting cells (APCs). STING\/TLR4 agonists together promote the synergistic production of Type I interferon &#946; (IFN&#946;), a key activator of anti-tumor immunity from the TME itself. Here, we also focus on sitravatinib, an investigational drug shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases such as discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), which can inhibit the sustained remodeling of collagen around primary tumors. The inhibition of such is vital to treatment as sustained collagen remodeling can facilitate the metastasis of cancer cells via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesize that the downstream effects of sitravatinib treatment will augment tumor clearance and increase the therapeutic efficacy of immuno-NPs with respect to recruiting APCs. Our early pilot studies in humanized mice bearing orthotopic SH-5YSY tumors show that immuno-NPs are effective at tumor clearance. We found that mice inoculated subcutaneously with syngeneic 9464D-GD2 tumors showed decreased tumor growth when treated with our novel combination therapy in comparison to monotherapy controls. In both humanized and syngeneic tumor models, our ongoing mechanistic studies involve quantification of EMT in primary tumors, systemic nanoparticle deposition at metastatic sites, and the mechanistic impact of combination therapy on IFN&#946;-promoted elimination of metastasis. Here, we have proposed and tested an immunotherapy with great promise for treating neuroblastoma. However, the impact of nanoparticle-based immunotherapy reaches far beyond neuroblastoma: it has the potential to be a platform for the development of immunotherapies specific to other highly metastatic cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Immune agonists,Neuroblastoma,Lipid-based nanoparticles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

We herein present a translatable, modular nanoparticle platform, utilizing generation 7 (G7) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers conjugated with engineered peptides (dendrimer-peptide conjugates, DPCs). This approach capitalizes on the multivalent binding effect mediated by dendrimers. We found that DPCs functionalized with peptides targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup>), a crucial immune checkpoint protein in HNSCC, exhibit significantly lower <i>K<\/i><sub>D<\/sub> at 163 nM, which was three orders of magnitude stronger than free peptides. Furthermore, DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup> prolonged the serum half-life to 10.8 hours, approximately 14 times longer than that observed with PD-L1-binding peptide alone. The enhanced binding kinetics and plasma stability of DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup> were translated into the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy, as evidenced by a significant 40% reduction in tumor volume after four injections of DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup> at a dosage of 50 mg\/kg in mice bearing oral carcinoma (MOC1) tumors. The transcriptomic analysis of DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup>-treated tumor tissues revealed an increased population of CD4- and CD8-positive lymphocytes while decreasing the regulatory T cells and tumor cell proliferation, which is likely related to the observed efficacy. Expanding on this study, we have employed peptides designed to bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key player in the oncogenic pathways of HNSCC. These peptides were conjugated to G7 PAMAM dendrimer, forming DPC<sup>EGFR<\/sup>. Similar to DPC<sup>PD-L1<\/sup>, DPC<sup>EGFR<\/sup> displayed improved binding affinity as proven by biophysical measurements and a series of <i>in vitro<\/i> assays. All these results highlight the versatility of our DPC platform, suggesting its potential applicability not only for targeting immune checkpoint proteins but also for intervening oncogenic pathways. With its simplicity, modularity, and versatility, this platform indicates the possibility of broadening its scope to incorporate multiple targeting and therapeutic factors, paving the way for its clinical translation, and providing new avenues in HNSCC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Dendrimer,Peptide-based biologics,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Understanding how and when cytotoxics best reshape tumor immunity could help optimizing the scheduling of ICI&#8217;s.<b><\/b> <i>In vivo <\/i>studies were performed on C57BL\/6 mice grafted with LL\/2lung cancer cells. A longitudinal immunomonitoring study on tumor, spleen and blood after multiple treatments including Cisplatin, Pemetrexed and anti-VEGF as single agents and in combination was performed for up to 21 days to determine the best time-window during which immune checkpoint inhibitors should be added. Finally, an efficacy study was conducted comparing the antiproliferative performance of various schedules of anti-VEGF, Pemetrexed-Cisplatin doublet, plus anti-PD-1 (i.e., immunomonitoring-guided scheduling, concurrent dosing or a random sequence). Immunomonitoring showed marked differences between treatments, organs and time-points. However, harnessing tumor immunity (i.e., promoting CD8 lymphocytes or increasing the CD8\/Treg ratio) started on D7 and peaked on D14 with the anti-VEGF followed by cytotoxics combination. Therefore, a two-week delay between anti-VEGF\/cytotoxic and anti-PD1 administration was considered the best sequence to test. Efficacy studies then confirmed that this sequence achieved higher anti-proliferative efficacy compared to other treatment modalities (i.e. -71% in tumor volume compared to control at the end of the study). Anti-VEGF and cytotoxic agents show time-dependent immunomodulatory effects, suggesting that sequencing is a critical feature when combining these agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our efficacy study confirmed that sequencing treatments further enhances anti-proliferative effects in lung cancer models compared to concurrent dosing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Immunomodulation,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

Anti-PD-1 antibody-based combination therapies have led to a paradigm shift in cancer treatment from cytotoxic agents or targeted therapy to immunotherapy. Considering this change in the regimen, the clinical development of TU2218 aims to accelerate approval and clinical application by improving the efficacy and safety of clinically proven combination therapies. TU2218 is characterized by the following four mechanisms of action: 1) improvement of T lymphocyte activity, 2) suppression of Treg, 3) improvement of costimulatory signal defects, and 4) overcoming endothelial cell anergy. Based on the mechanisms of action, TU2218 is expected to show significant clinical effects when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors by lowering the intensity of immune evasion and changing more favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors. To test the feasibility of various combination options based on TU2218, in vivo efficacy studies were conducted in 4T1, MC38, and CT26 syngeneic tumor models. In the 4T1 of TNBC type, a level of tumor reduction was significant to p&#60;0.001 on TU2218 and anti-PD-1 antibody combination group compared to vehicle, whereas anti-PD-1 antibody alone or anti-PD-1 antibody and paclitaxel combination group was not significant. Combination therapy with anti-CTLA4 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody has been approved for some cancers but has therapeutic limitations due to safety issues such as immune-related toxicity and needs improvement. In the MC38, the effectiveness of a dose-sparing strategy of anti-CTLA4 antibody was evaluated by adding TU2218 to the anti-CTLA4 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody combination regimen to improve safety concerns. In the anti-CTLA4 antibody sparing group, co-administration of TU2218 maintained the anti-tumor activity despite reducing 90% or 60% of the original anti-CTLA4 antibody dose. In effect, the difference in anti-tumor activity between the group with a reduced dose of anti-CTLA4 antibody and the group without was not statistically significant. In CT26, the efficacy of Lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibody combination therapy was compared with the combination of Lenvatinib, anti-PD-1 antibody, and TU2218. The efficacy of the Lenvatinib anti-PD-1 antibody, and TU2218 combination group was superior to that of TGI 99% and CR 67% than the Lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibody combination group of TGI 76% and CR 17%. Moreover, a statistical difference in anti-tumor activity between the two groups was significant at p&#60;0.001. Collectively, the combination therapies using TU2218 not only improved efficacy but also showed high safety profiles without weight loss or any toxicity signs, supporting the feasibility of the combination strategy of TU2218.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,TGF-&#946;\/VEGF,Novel Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jihyun Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nam-Hoon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jeong Su Park<sup><\/sup>, Jihyun Noh<sup><\/sup>, Sowon Bae<sup><\/sup>, Hun-Taek Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>TiumBio Co., Ltd., Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"06e568dd-a3c1-4f2e-96aa-4d6dd4a99c8c","ControlNumber":"2330","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

AhR plays a crucial role in inhibiting the activation of immune cells and promoting the growth of tumor cells. Here, we propose that a best-in-class AhR inhibitor, DA-4505, improves anti-tumor efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1.<br \/>Methods: To explore the anti-tumor effects, DA-4505 was administered at a daily dose of 10 mg\/kg either alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 (10 mg\/kg) in a syngeneic mouse model. Tumor volume, survival rates, and metastasis were measured, and immune profiles were evaluated using mIHC, flow cytometry, and scRNAseq.<br \/>Results: The synergistic anti-tumor effects of the DA-4505 and aPD-1 combination therapy were observed across four mouse tumor models (CT26, 4T1, LLC, TC1). The combination group demonstrated a significant improvement in anti-tumor efficacy compared to the monotherapy groups. Despite the moderate response of aPD-1 in the CT26 colon tumor model, the combination group displayed heightened anti-tumor effects through increase in CD8 T cell activity (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). In the LLC and TC1 lung cancer models, the combination therapy demonstrated improved anti-tumor effects and survival rates (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Notably, the LLC model exhibited a significant increase in M1-type macrophages, while the TC1 model showed a significant augmentation in functional markers of CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells within the combination group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). In both models, there was a significant reduction in the ratio of immunosuppressive M-MDSC and PMN-MDSC in the combination group. Immune depletion assays elucidated that DA-4505 mediated anti-tumor effects by increase in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, NK cells, and macrophages in the CT26 model. In contrast, the LLC model exhibited the contribution of macrophages and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to anti-tumor effects in the combination group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). To assess the impact on metastasis inhibition, an orthotopic model of 4T1 mouse tumor was established, revealing a significantly increased anti-tumor effects and survival rate in the combination group, accompanied by a reduced lung metastasis ratio. H&#38;E staining confirmed diminished migration of tumor tissue to adjacent areas. scRNAseq analysis of CT26 tumor samples indicated consistent changes at the gene expression level, reflecting a decrease in metastasis-related MMP and VEGF genes in the combination group and an increasing trend in cytotoxicity-related genes following DA-4505 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: The AhR inhibitor, DA-4505, has demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy when administered in combination with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, it not only promoted tumor elimination but also demonstrated significant efficacy in inhibiting metastasis.

Through their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, Cbl-b and c-Cbl have been shown to negatively regulate multiple signaling proteins downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR), suggesting that inhibition may yield enhanced anti-tumor T cell activity. Indeed, using a dual Cbl-b\/c-Cbl small molecule inhibitor, we demonstrate that Cbl blockade enhances T cell activity under standard and sub-optimal stimulation conditions. Moreover, Cbl inhibition increases mouse syngeneic tumor control alone or in combination with &#945;-PD-1, as described below.<br \/>METHODS: Human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated from healthy human blood and activated using &#945;-CD3 or &#945;-CD3\/CD28 stimulation. Mouse OT-I splenocytes were stimulated with SIINFEKL or lower affinity ovalbumin peptides and cytokine production was assessed. For tumor studies, mice were inoculated with syngeneic cancer cells and were treated with Cbl inhibitor (30 mg\/kg, QD) +\/- &#945;-PD-1 (10 mg\/kg, Q5D) starting at a tumor volume of 75 mm<sup>3<\/sup>.<br \/>RESULTS: Human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, stimulated in the presence of a Cbl inhibitor, demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in activation hallmarks including cytokine secretion (IL-2, IFN-&#947; and granzyme B), proliferation, and the presence of highly polyfunctional cells. Furthermore, using serially stimulated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with reduced overall activity, Cbl inhibition showed a marked enhancement of IFN-&#947; production and cytotoxicity compared to controls upon re-stimulation. We then used an antigen-specific T cell assay where OT-I splenocytes were stimulated by peptides with optimal or reduced TCR affinities, Cbl inhibition produced significantly higher IFN-&#947; levels with all peptides relative to controls demonstrating that Cbl inhibition can increase the response of T cells to sub-optimal stimulation. Using mouse CT26 and MC38 tumor models, Cbl inhibition was able to significantly enhance tumor control in combination with &#945;-PD-1 and as a monotherapy in CT26 tumors. Notably, a greater number of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells were found in Cbl inhibitor-treated tumors. Higher expression levels of the co-stimulatory molecule CD226 and the TCR in these anti-tumor cells were also observed, demonstrating the unique biology of Cbl inhibition in enhancing anti-tumor responses. Finally, Cbl inhibition had no effect on the growth or survival of cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> consistent with the notion that enhanced tumor control was driven by immune activity.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data demonstrate that pharmacologic Cbl inhibition robustly enhances T cell activity <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting Cbl-b\/c-Cbl to amplify anti-tumor immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cytotoxic T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

PDAC has quickly risen to the third most deadly cancer largely due to its fibrotic, desmoplastic, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits delivery and efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapeutics. We have engineered unique lipid-based NPs that co-encapsulate agonists of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways. NPs can be safely delivered in the systemic blood circulation to achieve TME deposition, uptake by innate antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and robust, synergistic production of Type I interferons by dual STING\/TLR4 activation. Here, we hypothesize that combination therapy of proinflammatory NPs with tumor senescence-inducing RAS inhibitors, tremetinib and palbociclib, will not only augment CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recruitment to the TME but enhance their sustained activation by mitigating local immunosuppression. In mice bearing orthotopic transplant <i>KPC <\/i>tumors or <i>KPC <\/i>GEMMs, combination NP\/inhibitor treatment promoted significant NP delivery to tumors, APC and natural killer (NK) cell activation, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated clearance, compared to monotherapies and untreated controls. Unexpectedly and strikingly, these studies also showed that, besides innate immune cells, combination therapy also promoted Type I interferon and other proinflammatory cytokine production by PDAC tumor cells, which are otherwise notoriously unresponsive to current state-of-the-art treatments. Further, in <i>KPC<\/i> GEMMs, 25% of mice exhibited apparent complete responses following combination treatment, which, to our knowledge, is challenging to achieve in this model. Current studies include the mechanistic elucidation of immune- and tumor-intrinsic factors that govern efficacy of our combination therapy. In conclusion, these findings strongly corroborate the use of this NP-based system as a platform therapy for similar drugs and across other aggressive cancers. They also strongly make the case for the rational design of combination therapies to achieve synergistic therapeutic outcomes with minimal systemic toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Senescence,Nanoparticle,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Especially, antibodies targeting programmed cell death ligand1(PD-L1) promoted T cells to activate immune response against cancer cells. However, the current ICIs still have insignificant to motivate effective antitumor immunity by blocking PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway and the regulatory network of PD-L1 by cytokines in the tumor microenvironment remains to be uncovered. Previously, we have reported the anti-cancer effects of combination treatment with a natural product, poly-&#947;-glutamic acid(&#947;-PGA), and PD-1 blockade. Now, we show that combination therapy with anti PD-L1 and &#947;-PGA can overcome the limits of ICIs and enhance anticancer effect in murine colorectal cancer.<br \/>Design: <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were performed by intraperitoneal injection of antibody targeting PD-L1 and oral administration of &#947;-PGA in C57BL\/6 model transplanted with mouse tumor cell lines. Systemic changes in immunophenotype was measured by tumor volume size and body weight. The splenocyte was isolated from mice and the populations of myeloid-driven suppressor cells(MDSCs) and CD4\/CD8 T cells were analyzed by FACS. Also, the significant cytokines activated by T- cell, IFN-&#947; and IL-2, were measured by ELISA.<br \/>Results and Conclusions: In murine model of colorectal cancer, &#947;-PGA and anti PD-L1 blockade combination therapy significantly improved anti-tumor activity compared with single agents. In addition, tumoral infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and IFN-&#947; productions were increased by &#947;-PGA, and its antitumoral activity was attenuated by antibody-mediated depletion of these cells, indicating that g-PGA suppressed tumor growth in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner.

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have seenremarkable growth in complexity and application over the past two decades. Our work leveragesthese models and is specifically designed to address the pressing need for effectiveimmunochemotherapies in the context of KRAS and LKB1 (KL) mutant lung adenocarcinoma,which shows resistance to most immunotherapies. Our study centers around a preclinicalsyngeneic orthotopic mouse model we developed using mouse lung and metastatic tumor cell linesderived from KL-GEMM. This model, optimized to mimic human lung cancer closely, providesan ideal platform for exploring the intricate interplay between the immune system and tumorprogression. Furthermore, we have previously shown the LKB1 mutant cell lines and tumormodels are uniquely sensitive to FAK inhibitors, and therefore we wanted to test whether thecombination of a FAK inhibitor with anti-PD1 therapy can improve sensitivity. The combinatoryadministration of FAK inhibitor (VS-6063) with anti-PD1 mAb synergistically increased anti-tumor response and survival outcome compared with single-agent therapy in the KL-mediatedsyngeneic orthotopic lung cancer model. By using GEMM-derived syngeneic cell lines, we haveevaluated the potential for creating innovative immunochemotherapies, customized for KL co-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with promising clinical potential. Furthermore, using this modelenables a deeper understanding of the KL mutant disease's pathogenesis, the impact of sex-biasedcancer development, and the assessment of novel immunochemotherapy treatment strategies in theKL genetic sub-type of lung adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,LKB1,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We and others have previously shown that Kras mutant LUAD development and progression is associated with intrinsic inflammatory characteristics driven by epithelial NF-&#954;B activation, increased levels of IL-6 (which is transcriptionally regulated by NF-&#954;B), and activation of the IL-6-responsive transcription factor STAT3. We further demonstrated that IL-6 blockade suppresses lung tumorigenesis by reducing tumor-associated immunosuppressive myeloid populations and induction of a T cell-mediated anti-tumor response. The recent discovery of a novel SOS1-targeting compound (BI-3406) that selectively inhibits the KRAS-SOS1 interaction and leads to anti-proliferative activity has opened up the possibility to more efficiently inhibit Kras mutant lung cancer. Accordingly, in this study we used a mouse model of KRAS mutant LUAD (CC-LR) to compare the therapeutic effects of BI-3406, IL-6 blockade, and MEK inhibitor (trametinib). We also tested whether inhibiting IL-6 driven pro-tumor immune response would provide a synergistic\/additive response and increase the tumor inhibitory effect of either BI-3406 or Trametinib. Eight cohorts of 14-week-old female mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, trametinib, or BI-3406, or their combinations for 4 weeks, and their tumor burden was compared at the end of study. We observed a significant reduction in tumor multiplicity and tumor area in response to all monotherapies, with the highest effect in the trametinib treated cohort. Neither combination therapy led to decreased tumor burden over either of the monotherapy regimens in our model. However, we observed an increase in T helper 1 and CD8 T expressing IFN&#947; cell populations in the cohort treated with Trametinib and anti-IL-6 Ab combination. In addition, using qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from the whole lung we found a higher expression of IFN&#947; along with a reduced expression of IL-10 in the cohort treated with BI-3406 and anti-IL-6 Ab combination. This suggests that these combinations may have the potential to improve the anti-tumor immune responses. Hence, we conclude that further adjustment of the treatment regimen (doses, interval, duration) may allow to obtain improved anti-tumor efficacy with these combinations. Overall, this study provides a new research perspective for the improvement of currently available treatment modalities for patients with Kras mutant lung cancer that could be further explored preclinically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Interleukin-6,NF-&#954;B,MEK inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Mismatch repair deficient\/microsatellite instability-high (MSI) colorectal cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs)-based immunotherapy; however, this benefit has not been translated into microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. It has been proposed that the loss of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in tumor cells limits the use of ICB in colorectal cancer. Harmine displays a number of biological and pharmacological properties affecting the immune response and tumor phenotype. Here, we assessed the impact of combining harmine, also referred to as ACB1801 molecule, on improving the responsiveness of ICB in the mouse MSS CRC model. Our results showed that combining ACB1801 significantly improves the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in the CT26 CRC mouse model by decreasing tumor growth and improving the survival of tumor-bearing mice. The improvement of anti-PD-1-based therapy by combining ACB-1801 was associated with a modification of the immune landscape of tumors as evidenced by an increase in the CD8+ T cells and a decrease in the Treg infiltrations into the tumor microenvironment. By profiling the cytokine\/chemokine network, we showed that ACB1801 induced the expression and the release of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 by CRC tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, which could be responsible for driving CD8+ T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we showed that ACB1801 increased the expression of MHC-I genes, including TAP1 and TAPASIN, and improved the antigen loading on MHC-I in CRC cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Overall, our study highlights the value of combining ACB1801 and anti-PD-1 as a therapeutic opportunity to convert MSS colorectal cancer into an &#8220;immune hot&#8221; cancer, which may define the future treatment paradigm of colorectal cancer for which there is a great unmet need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T cell,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

However, only a subset of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly hypoxic tumor, respond to ICB. In TNBC, the immune checkpoints PD-1\/PD-L1 and adenosine receptor (A2aR) are often activated to escape anti-tumor responses. These two immune checkpoints are sensitive to hypoxia. We propose that blocking tumor oxygen consumption using deferiprone (DFP), phenformin (Phen) and metformin (Met) will improve the efficacy of PD-1\/PD-L1 and A2aR blockade. We generated two mouse breast cancer cell lines (4T1 and E0771) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to Firefly luciferase under the control of the hypoxia reporter element (HRE). This construct, which we called HRE\/TGL, serves as a hypoxia reporter, with GFP expression and luciferase activity increasing in hypoxic conditions. To induce hypoxia <i>in vitro<\/i>, we used two approaches: 1) we incubated cells in a hypoxia chamber (3% oxygen), and 2) treated cells with cobalt chloride, which chemically mimics hypoxia by inducing the expression of the hypoxia master regulator HIF1&#945;. Both 4T1-HRE\/TGL and E0771-HRE\/TGL cells exhibited increased GFP expression and luciferase activity within hypoxia conditions. We orthotopically implanted these cells into mice. We measured luciferase activity <i>in vivo<\/i> using the IVIS spectrum imaging system overtime after tumor implantation. We observed high luciferase activity in 4T1-HRE\/TGL tumors. Next, we examined the effects of DFP, Phen and Met on cell hypoxic responses by performing immunoblotting against HIF1&#945; and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) on 4T1 and E0771 cells. We observed that, unlike Phen or Met, DFP increased HIF1&#945; and p-AMPK expression. Binding of HIF1 proteins to HREs is known to activate the expression of the HRE promoter. To confirm our results, we treated 4T1-HRE\/TGL and E0771-HRE\/TGL cells with low (10&#956;M) or high (100&#956;M) doses of the drugs <i>in vitro<\/i>. We observed that, while DFP increased GFP expression and luciferase activity, Phen had no consistent measurable effect. We observed similar results <i>in vivo<\/i>. Finally, we examined the effect of DFP, Phen and Met either alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 on tumor progression and survival in mice bearing 4T1 or E0771 tumors. Contrary to what expected, we did not observe better tumor control and survival after treatment with these drugs. In addition, DFP, Phen and Met failed to improve the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-1 treatment in both TNBC models. Future experiments will focus on charactering the adenosine pathway <i>in vivo<\/i> in 4T1 and E0771 tumors and examine how drugs targeting A2aR and oxygen consumption (DFP, Phen and Met) influence the activation of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment and potentially combinate these two strategies to improve their anti-tumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Immune checkpoint blockade,Imaging,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Currently, there are no well-defined preventative approaches to uncouple anti-tumor immunity from irAEs. Currently approved immunotherapies include agents that activate T cell responses, such as antibodies blocking immune checkpoints and infusion of tumor-derived, T cell receptor-transgenic or chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells. While the beneficial and toxic effects of T cell-based therapies in the clinic are being extensively explored, the precise mechanisms underlying their activity remain the subject of investigation. In this study, we treated preclinical models of established melanomas with tumor-specific adoptive CD4+ T cell transfer in combination with T cell co-stimulation via OX40 agonism or CTLA-4 blockade. We found that, despite adequate T cell stimulation, acute local inflammation plays an important role in tumor elimination and the manifestation of irAEs. While stimulated T cells are necessary for initiating a therapeutic response, activation of endogenous neutrophils constitutes an important and necessary effector mechanism for both tumor destruction and the development of irAEs. Extensive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were associated with irAEs. Furthermore, melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade with skin rashes equivalent to irAEs found in mice showed increased survival and NETs in biopsies from both rashes and tumors. Our results bring forward a novel paradigm where T cells prime an anti-tumor immune response that is followed by an inflammatory effector mechanism provided by the innate immune system, resulting in both curative and undesirable side effects in mice and patients.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Adoptive cell therapy,Adverse events,Neutrophils,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, most patients do not show clinical benefit. This is because tumors can activate multiple checkpoints and immunosuppressive pathways to evade anti-tumor immune responses. Inhibition of these immune suppressive mechanisms and immune checkpoints or repolarizing the tumor microenvironment (TME) to become more accessible to the immune system may be necessary for maximal therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies. There is increasing evidence that tumor hypoxia can attenuate the antitumor immune response by promoting immune suppression and inhibiting direct killing by cytotoxic immune cells. We propose that blocking tumor oxygen consumption using drugs that target the mitochondrial complex I (phenformin and metformin) will enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies such as ICB in preclinical models such as B16 melanoma. In this study, we examined how low oxygen levels (hypoxia) influence T cell effector function such as cytotoxic activity and cytokine production in vitro. We co-cultured B16 melanoma cells in the presence of tumor specific T cells (Pmels) and incubated at 37&#186;C in either normoxia (~21% O2) or hypoxia (3% O<sub>2<\/sub>) and assessed killing and intracellular cytokine production 24 - 48 hours later. We show that the ability of tumor antigen-specific T cells to kill tumor cells or make effector cytokine such as IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; is significantly reduced in hypoxia settings. We also examined the effects of hypoxia targeting drugs (metformin and phenformin) on T cell priming and activation. When T cells were activated in the presence of each drug in vitro, there was enhanced expression of T cell activation markers (CD25, Granzyme B) as well as an increase in their differentiation into central memory T cells. We next determined whether these drugs could alter the TME in vivo by treating C56BL\/6J mice bearing established B16 tumors with phenformin and metformin and then examine the effects on the immune system in the tumor, tumor draining lymph nodes and spleen by flow cytometry. We found that these three drugs have differential effects on both the innate and adaptive the immune system in the tumors and periphery. Finally, we tested whether these drugs could delay B16 melanoma growth in vivo as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1. We found that while both drugs can significantly delay tumor growth as monotherapies, only metformin showed improved anti-tumor efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 in vivo. These studies show that while both drugs target tumor oxygen consumption (via inhibition of complex I), and can delay B16 tumor growth in vivo, they have differential effects on the TME and will need further considerations when combining with immune based therapies such as ICBs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Hypoxia,Immunotherapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
