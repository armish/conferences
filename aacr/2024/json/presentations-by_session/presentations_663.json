IMP was simultaneously administered by SC and IV route weekly for 6 consecutive doses. Objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed in cohort B2. We report herein preliminary efficacy results of the first 21 pts analysed when the 19<sup>th<\/sup> evaluable patient reached the 9-months PFS and the safety of 38 pts.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Out of 21, 19 pts receiving at least 5 doses of IMP and having 1 post-baseline radiological evaluation were evaluated. The median follow-up was 12.5 months. The best objective response (BOR) included 12 PR (63.2%) and 7 SD (36.8%) with ORR of 63.2% (80% CI 45.9% - 78.2%) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 94.7%. The 9mPFS according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate was 52.1% (80% CI 36.5% - 65.56%). The mPFS was 10.9 months. The median duration of response was 9.49 months. An antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response was induced against the lung antigens of the IMP in 68.4% of pts. Immune responses with remarkable expanded anti-tumor CD8+ T-cells were observed both in PR and SD. More immune response results will be available in the final analysis of the 45 pts of cohort B2. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were mostly Grade 1-2. Only 1 severe TRAE occurred, a Grade 4 allergic infusion-related reaction, leading to IMP discontinuation. Thirteen pts experienced a serious AE, of which 3 were considered causally related to the IMP.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> The BOR, ORR, DCR, PFS, duration of response and safety of PDC*lung01 in combination with anti-PD-1 showed encouraging signals suggesting that this combination may provide a clinical meaningful tumour response in stage IV NSCLC population with a mild safety profile.

As a frequent alteration identified in both PDAC and pancreatic premalignancy, mutant KRAS (mKRAS) has emerged as a potential target for immune-based interception strategies in individuals at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a single-arm, open-label, second-in-human phase I study of a pooled synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant targeting up to six mKRAS subtypes (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G13D) in patients with hereditary predisposition to developing PDAC (NCT05013216). Key inclusion: radiographic evidence of a pancreatic abnormality and eligibility under at least one of three high-risk groups based on family history of PDAC and\/or germline mutation status. Vaccination schema: mKRAS vaccine given on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 13. Peripheral blood collected at baseline and weeks 5, 13, and 17 for analysis of immunogenicity by IFN-gamma ELISpot. Co-primary endpoints: safety and mKRAS-specific T cell response.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>At the time of data cutoff (November 15, 2023), 15 out of 20 planned patients were vaccinated on study and evaluable for immunogenicity. All 15 patients achieved a mKRAS-specific T cell response, defined by the maximal fold change in the pooled average IFN-gamma-producing mKRAS-specific T cell density within 17 weeks post-vaccination (median: 12.3, range: 3.1-167). Differential immunogenicity elicited by individual mKRAS epitopes was noted in this cohort. Specifically, the mKRAS G12V peptide induced the highest fold change increase in antigen-specific T cell expansion (median: 32.6, range: 2.9-243) while the mKRAS G12D peptide was the least immunogenic (median: 7.6, range: 0.4-104). Regarding safety, all adverse events were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity per NCI CTCAE v5.0. The most frequent vaccine-related adverse events were injection site reactions (93.8%), fatigue (62.5%), chills (43.8%), and headache (37.5%). No safety signals were observed.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>For the first time, we demonstrate mKRAS-specific T cell responses induced by vaccination in a cohort of high-risk individuals with inherited predisposition to PDAC. These findings directly serve as proof-of-concept to advance vaccine strategies focused on intercepting the development of pancreatic cancer in high-risk populations.<br \/><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Support: <\/b>Stand Up To Cancer, Lustgarten Foundation, and NIH\/NCI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Premalignancy,Vaccines,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Poly-ICLC was administered intratumorally (Artemis MRI-TRUS-guided) and intramuscularly (e.g., deltoid muscle). Comprehensive transcriptional profiling of tissues, phenotypic and transcriptional analysis of longitudinally collected peripheral blood, and analysis of the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) were performed before and after poly-ICLC treatment in order to identify innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses within the tumor and in peripheral blood. This trial is the first to use human intratumoral immunotherapy instead of systemic immunomodulation for high-risk PCa patients.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b> Poly-ICLC was well tolerated (safe) in all 12 patients. There were no dose-limiting toxicities or TEAE (treatment-emergent adverse events) withdrawals during treatment. Eight of 10 evaluable patients (80%) had undetectable PSA (&#60;0.1 ng\/ml) at 1 year of follow-up post-RP. Eight of 12 evaluable patients (66.7%) and 7 of 10 patients (70%) with biopsy Gleason 8-10 had a lower Gleason score in the post-treatment RP specimen. Transcriptome profiling of paired biopsy and RP specimens showed significant upregulation of gene signatures associated with immune cell infiltration and TP53-associated metabolic genes, but downregulation of gene signatures associated with metastasis and DNA replication. Genes upregulated by poly-ICLC were associated with a good prognosis. Treatment with poly-ICLC increased systemic immune responses, as demonstrated by an increase in cytolytic signatures, T- and NK-cell signatures, and NK-cell subsets in the blood.

We previously showed that a DNA vaccine, SCIB1, incorporating T cell epitopes from TRP-2\/gp100 into an antibody framework to allow Fc targeting of activated dendritic cells, was successfully evaluated as a monotherapy in a phase 1\/2 in stage 3\/4 melanoma patients. Unresectable melanoma patients showed a 60% ORR and 88% of patients treated with SCIB1 post tumor resection, remained disease free for 5 years [1]. The current SCOPE trial tests the hypothesis that unresectable patients may have an improved response when SCIB1 is combined with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI).<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Patients were treated with nivolumab with ipilimumab and SCIB1 (8mg) i.m. using needle-free injection at a fixed dosing schedule for a total of 10 doses over 24 months. The CPI therapy was administered i.v. in accordance with their respective SmPC. ORR as measured by RECIST 1.1 in the overall intention-to-treat population was the primary endpoint. The study is designed using Simon's two stage methodology with 80% power when the true response rate is 70% with an overall type I error of 5%. In the first stage, 15 patients will be enrolled and if there are eight or fewer clinical responses (RECIST 1.1 objective response [CR or PR] within 25 weeks of the first dose of SCIB1), further recruitment will be stopped. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 27 or more responses are observed in 43 patients.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>19 patients received the combination of SCIB1 with nivolumab and ipilimumab. At study entry, all patients were stage IV. 13 patients had reached the first imaging timepoint at 13 weeks, and the objective response rate is 85%. 9\/9 responses were confirmed in a subsequent scan. Patients showed a 40-95% reduction in tumor volume between 13 and 25 weeks. Most of the SCIB1-related adverse events were Grade 1\/2. Only 1 patient reported a Grade 3 rash. No enhancement of immune-mediated adverse events was observed when SCIB1 was added to nivolumab with ipilimumab.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>SCIB1 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab as first line treatment for unresectable melanoma improved the ORR to 85% without an increase in clinically meaningful adverse events.

Our recently published study (NCT02648282) showed that increased M1\/M2 ratio and decreased PDL1+ M2-like tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in locally advanced PDA is associated with longer overall survival (OS) following combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy, GVAX and anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab (Pem). We hypothesized targeting M2-like macrophages, regulated by the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) pathway, would improve outcomes. In this pilot study we investigated the safety and intratumoral immune response of neoadjuvant\/adjuvant triplet immunotherapy: GVAX\/cyclophosphamide (CY), Pem, and CSF1 receptor blockade (IMC-CS4) in patients with resectable or borderline resectable PDA.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> After completing chemotherapy and radiation patients received two 3-week cycles of neoadjuvant triplet immunotherapy. Following surgery, patients received 4 additional cycles followed by booster Pem every 3 weeks and GVAX\/CY every 6 months, for one year. Co-primary endpoints were safety, assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AEs), and immune response (increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell density in surgical specimen as compared to pre-treatment core). Secondary endpoints included disease free survival (DFS), OS, surgical resectability, and pathologic response (PR).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Nine patients were enrolled. Two immune related grade 3\/4 AEs (diarrhea and rash) were reported. Median DFS was 12.6 months (95% CI: 7.3, NR) and median OS was 20.4 months (95% CI: 17.5, NR). All patients underwent surgery with major PR rate of 78% (defined as &#60;10% residual viable tumor), including one complete PR. Comparing paired biopsies, the study met its primary immunologic endpoint showing 6\/8 patients (75%) had a &#62;80% increase of CD8+ T cells; the increase was at least 1.8 times the baseline median absolute deviation following triple therapy (p=0.012). There was a significant increase of Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells among all patients (p=0.045). No significant change in myeloid cell density, including TAM, was observed, suggesting IMC-CS4 did not deplete macrophages, but potentially reprogrammed them. The 4 patients with greatest drop in CD66b+ granulocyte levels had major PR (grade 0 or 1).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The triplet was safe and significantly increased activated CD8+ T cells suggesting the combination can induce an effector T cell response.
