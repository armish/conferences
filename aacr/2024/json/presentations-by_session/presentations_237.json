Here, we report molecular and spatial proteomic features of biopsies collected from patients on S1616, both prior to and during therapy.<br \/>Methods: Biopsies collected from patients from both arms at baseline (N=68 patients total) and early on-therapy (N=51; 43 with paired timepoints) were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (n=185 samples), RNA sequencing (n=105), histopathologic staining (n=149), and multiplexed ion beam imaging (n=45). Multiple biopsies were available for some patients. Mutations, gene expression, and tumor microenvironment were compared across timepoints and response to combination (N=18 responders [CR\/PR], N=44 nonresponders [SD\/PD]).<br \/>Results: Baseline biopsies from patients responsive to combination had increased expression of genes (n=482, FDR&#60;0.05) associated with coagulation and complement, fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, hypoxia, and interferon gamma response gene sets (FDR&#60;0.05), compared to nonresponsive biopsies. Baseline biopsies from responders also had low levels of effector CD8 T cells (PD1+, TIM-3+, GZMB+, Ki67+) colocalized with tumor cells and myeloid populations expressing higher levels of MHC Class II.<br \/>On-therapy biopsies from responders showed decreased detection of driver mutations by genomics, reduced gene expression of pathways enriched at baseline (oxidative phosphorylation, complement) by transcriptomics, and increased CD8 T cell to tumor cell ratios by histopathology, supporting observations of tumor regression. On-therapy biopsies from responders also had increased gene expression of genes related to inflammatory cytokine signaling. This correlated with increased proportions of effector CD8 T cells, compared to paired baseline or nonresponding biopsies, and increased organization of nonactivated CD8 T cells near mature endothelial structures (SMA+, CD31+ regions) adjacent to tumor.<br \/>Biopsies from nonresponders did not demonstrate these dynamics and instead contained exhausted CD8 T cells (PD1+, TIM-3+, granzyme B-, Ki67-) colocalized with FOXP3+, CD4+ Tregs and CD163+, PD-L1+ M2 macrophages, both at baseline and on-therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: In patients with melanoma refractory to anti-PD-1, addition of anti-CTLA-4 facilitates tumor-reactive CD8 T-cell infiltration and decreased suppressor cell dynamics, resulting in regression of some tumors with distinct transcriptome features. Conversely, biopsies from patients whose tumors progress on combination therapy lack expression of metabolic pathways and show CD8 T-cells restricted in proximity to M2 macrophages and Tregs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,CTLA-4,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Here we employed a multi-omic approach to understand the effects of epigenetic priming in re-shaping the tumor microenvironment, together with genomic drivers of therapeutic response of epigenetic therapy followed by ICB in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 39 baseline tumors and bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on 18 serial tumors across 42 patients with metastatic immunotherapy-na&#239;ve NSCLC, who received azacitidine and entinostat followed by nivolumab (NCT01928576). WES was utilized to assess co-mutations, mutation signatures and genome-wide structural changes. RNAseq was utilized for gene and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and repeat element analysis. Response after nivolumab initiation was assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients who were progression-free at 6 months or alive at 2 years after initial treatment were defined as exceptional responders.<br \/>Results: We found an enrichment in inactivating mutations in homologous recombination genes in radiographic responders (Fisher&#8217;s exact, p=0.0007). Higher germline and somatic HLA class II diversity (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.05 and p=0.03 respectively), and an enrichment of smoking and DNA damage mutational signatures were noted in radiographic responders (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.03 and p=0.15 respectively). Radiographically responding tumors harbored a higher number of mutations in genomic regions that were haploid or present in multiple copies (persistent tumor mutation burden; Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.018). GSEA revealed an upregulation of inflammatory response gene sets post-epigenetic therapy in patients attaining an exceptional response. Antigen presentation, interferon-alpha, and interferon-gamma related gene sets were upregulated in exceptional responders post epigenetic priming (FDR-adjusted p=0.005, p=0.009, and p=0.011 respectively). Additionally, we observed an enrichment in interferon-alpha, cancer testis antigens, and interferon-gamma related gene sets in patients with a longer progression-free survival (FDR-adjusted p=0.007, p=0.011, and p=0.013 respectively). Repeat element analysis showed an increase in long terminal repeats on-therapy in exceptional responders, suggesting induction of repeat element expression with epigenetic therapy. A higher expression of MAGE family tumor associated antigens (MAGEA10, MAGEB1, MAGEB2) was noted post-epigenetic therapy in exceptional responders.<br \/>Conclusions: Genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal the potential of epigenetic-priming to re-shape the tumor microenvironment and highlight patients that could benefit from combination epigenetic therapy with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Epigenetic therapy,Multi-omics,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The combination of T cell costimulation and proinflammatory cytokines were developed to modulate the TME and allow a more robust immune response. Here we show evidence of the pharmacodynamic effect of ITu administration of mRNA-2752 in combination with PD-L1 antibody.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b> In this ongoing phase 1 study (NCT03739931), patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors received 0.25-8 mg mRNA-2752 alone (Arm A) or in combination with 1500 mg IV durvalumab (Arm B)<sup>1,2<\/sup>. Pre and on-treatment peripheral and tumor samples were collected to monitor changes in cytokines by ligand binding assays, gene signatures by RNA sequencing, and T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry. Tumor biopsies were taken at baseline, 24h, 15 and 28 days post treatment.<br \/><b>Results <\/b> mRNA-2752 administration in combination with durvalumab revealed &#8805;2-fold plasma level increases of IL-23 (34\/40, 85%) and IFN-&#947; (50\/65, 77%) at 24h after first injection; exposure was induced in a dose-dependent manner. We observed induction of CD8 T cell abundance (20\/49, 41%) and proliferation (23\/49, 47%), and OX40L protein expression (28\/49, 57%) in pts with evaluable post-treatment injected lesion biopsies. CD8 T cell abundance increased in 2 pts with evaluable post-treatment un-injected lesion biopsies. A positive correlation was observed between T cell abundance and T cell effector genes. All three mRNA (IL-23, IL-36&#947;, and OX40L) encoded genes were detected post treatment in tumor samples from 43 evaluable patients. In 18 pts with injected lesion biopsy samples at baseline and day 28 samples, the genes related to cytotoxic function (<i>IFN<\/i><i>G<\/i>, <i>GZMB<\/i>, <i>PRF1)<\/i>, T cell migration (<i>CCL21<\/i>, <i>CCR7, KLF2<\/i>), T cell activation\/memory phenotype (<i>TCF7<\/i>, <i>CD69<\/i>, <i>ITGAE<\/i>), and conventional type 1 dendritic cells (<i>CLEC9A, XCR1<\/i>) were induced 28 days post-treatment in pts with complete\/partial response or stable disease (CR\/PR\/SD, n=7) compared to progressive disease (PD, n=11) pts. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis showed increases in the immune inflamed gene signatures related to antitumor activity in 24\/43 (56%) pts post-treatment, and the pre-existing immune inflamed phenotype within the TME was associated with clinical benefit.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b> mRNA-2752 ITu injection induced a systemic immunomodulatory effect by elevating effector cytokines.

Analysis of 64,097 immune cells showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) induced immunosuppressive mechanisms that counteracted its potentially positive effects. We showed that while NACT enhanced phagocytosis and antigen presentation, this was counterbalanced by upregulation of Stabilin1 (STAB1) in eight out of eleven macrophage subpopulations we identified. The NACT associated increase in macrophage STAB1 expression was validated in a separate cohort of eighty HGSOC patients at the protein level. STAB1 is a macrophage scavenger receptor that transports phagocytosed targets to undergo significant lysosomal degradation reducing the efficiency of antigen presentation. In vitro anti-stabilin1 antibody (anti-stab1 ab) -treated macrophages had significantly reduced antigen degradation and higher CD11C expression than isotype-treated ones. Furthermore, T cells co-cultured with anti-stab1 ab -treated macrophages had increased T cell proliferation and killing.We identified thirteen CD4 subpopulations by scRNAseq, five of which were Tregs. We showed that NACT significantly upregulated and activated Tregs. Tregs displayed a shared developmental trajectory with na&#239;ve and effector T cells suggesting that those are induced rather than natural Tregs. This was supported by TCR clonal sharing between Tregs and other effector cells. In vitro T cells treated with FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO), AZD8701, had an anti-tumor cytokine profile and enhanced tumor cell killing. Analysis of 69,781 scRNAseq cells from control and chemotherapy-treated HGSOC syngeneic mouse model showed similar responses. In two HGSOC syngeneic mouse models (HGS2 and 30200), combinations of chemotherapy with anti-stab1 ab and\/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased median survival of mice with established peritoneal disease compared to chemotherapy alone. Bulk RNAseq of tumors treated with anti-stab1 ab were enriched with CXCL9 positive macrophages, while Foxp3-ASO treatment showed significant increase in T helper cell infiltration and activation. Potentially cured long-term survivors (300 days+) were resistant to tumor rechallenge.In a third HGSOC mouse model (60577), in which tumors relapsed after a good initial response to chemotherapy, combinations of chemotherapy with anti-stab1 ab and\/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increased the post relapse survival compared to chemotherapy alone.We believe that modulating Tregs and STAB1 could improve response to chemotherapy and can have translational potential as each AZD8701 and a humanized anti-stab1 ab are in phase I clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunotherapy,Macrophages,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Repression of the MHC-I and reduced tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is often associated with immunotherapy resistance in SCLC. Lurbinectedin is FDA-approved as a second-line treatment for SCLC and we previously showed lurbinectedin as an effective therapeutic strategy in SCLC preclinical models. There are ongoing clinical trials combining immune checkpoint blockade with lurbinectedin in ES-SCLC. However, there is no insight into the effect of lurbinectedin on the immune microenvironment in SCLC. In this study, we evaluated the effect of lurbinectedin on the immune microenvironment and the anti-tumor effect with or without PD-L1 blockade.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>To determine the effect of lurbinectedin in SCLC models, we treated immunocompetent flank RPP (<i>Rb1, Trp53, and p130<\/i>) and RPM (<i>Rb1, Trp53<\/i>, and <i>MYCT58A<\/i>) tumor-bearing mice with lurbinectedin (0.2 mg\/kg, 1\/7days) and\/or anti-PD-L1 (300&#181;g, 1\/7days) for 3 weeks. Mice treated with anti-PD-L1 alone showed no anti-tumor response, and single-agent lurbinectedin caused a delay in tumor growth. However, 6 of the 10 mice treated with the combination of lurbinectedin and anti-PD-L1, had a complete response (100% reduction) and the other 4 had 90% tumor regression. Tumors were resected and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry for changes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).<b><\/b> <b> <\/b> Furthermore, analysis of immune cells infiltrating into the tumors post- treatment showed significant induction of cytotoxic T-cells and a reduction of exhausted and regulatory T cells in the combination treatment arm. Similarly, pro-inflammatory M1 type macrophages and dendritic cells were increased, while immunosuppressive M2 type macrophages and MDSC cells were decreased. These effects are consistent with data showing that lurbinectedin treatment leads to an activation of the cGAS\/STING pathway, type I\/II interferons (IFN&#945;\/&#946;), and pro-inflammatory chemokines (CCL5, CXCL10) in tumors. Interestingly, lurbinectedin treatment led to significant upregulation of mRNA and surface expression of MHC class-I genes (HLA-A\/B\/C) <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo.<\/i> Finally, bulk RNA sequencing as well as RT-PCR of pre- and post-lurbinectedin treatment demonstrated an increase in DAMPs associated with immunogenic cell death.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We provide the first mechanistic insight into the lurbinectedin-induced multimodal immune modulation in SCLC leading to a dramatic anti-tumor activity accompanied by the establishment of a strong anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Since lurbinectedin is already approved as a second-line agent in SCLC, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for combining this regimen with inhibitors of the PD-L1 pathway and also highlight the immune subsets that the combination targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Lung cancer: small cell,Immune response,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Analysis of epithelial single-cell RNA sequencing data showed an increase in interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and inhibition of the MAPK pathway in responders. MAPK inhibition in organoids also induced ISGs. These data suggest a synergy between MAPK inhibition and induction of immune responses.<br \/>Methods<br \/>We analyzed over 100,000 immune and stromal cells from 23 paired scRNAseq profiles of pre- and day 15 on-treatment tumor biopsies. Progression free survival greater than 6 months was defined as a clinical response. We performed traditional differentially expressed gene and gene program analyses, and tracked TCR repertoire in tumor and blood. We developed a novel approach based on supervised clustering (PMID: 34675423) to identify fine-grained cell subtypes associated with response. We applied supervised clustering separately to T and myeloid cells, and tested the association of each cluster&#8217;s abundance with response.<br \/>Results<br \/>We applied supervised clustering to T cells and identified a CD74+IFNG+ CD8 T cell cluster that increased in only responders (p=0.0078). In the myeloid compartment, we identified two populations of CXCL10+ macrophages: one whose abundance increased in all patients and a CCL3+CCL4+ activation state expanded (p=0.01) only in responders. Pathway analysis of the expanded populations suggests an enrichment of ISGs in both CD74+IFNG+ CD8 T cells and CXCL10+CCL3+CCL4+ macrophages, with specific enrichment of interferon-gamma responsive genes GBP1 and GBP4 in the macrophages.<br \/>T cell analysis yielded two responders with marked clonal expansion within the CXCL13+ population, which likely represent tumor-specific T cells. Within the blood, these CXCL13+ clonotypes underwent a short-lived burst at day 15, yet represented only a minor population. We saw concomitant expansion of both CXCL13+ CD4 and CD8 populations within patients, suggesting CXCL13+ CD4s might provide help to the CXCL13+ CD8 T cells. The same two responders had increased stem-like TCF7+PD1+ CD8 T cells previously implicated in immunotherapy response and an increase in CCL19+ fibroblasts associated with stem-immunity hubs.<br \/>Conclusions<br \/>Our analysis of pre- and on-therapy biopsy scRNAseq data from our clinical trial of MAPK and PD-1 inhibition found expansion of ISG enriched CD74+IFNG+ CD8 T cells and CXCL10+CCL3+CCL4+ macrophages in responders. Both populations are enriched in ISGs: this coordinated expansion may result from a shared, interferon-rich microenvironment. Ongoing work will explore this hypothesis using spatial transcriptomics to identify these activated cells and their microenvironments.<br \/>Ethics approval<br \/>\"This study was approved by the DF\/HCC IRB as protocol 18-144 (see also ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03668431).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables these carcinomas to metastasize and acquire resistance to chemotherapy. We have recently demonstrated that the EMT program also confers resistance to immunotherapies. Specifically, epithelial tumors recruit CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells to the tumor microenvironment and are sensitive to anti-CTLA4 ICB. In contrast, mesenchymal tumors assemble an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and are resistant to the same treatment. Furthermore, mesenchymal tumors express multiple immunosuppressive paracrine factors relative to their epithelial counterparts. Of these, abrogation of CSF1 or SPP1 from mesenchymal cancer cells generates partial responses to ICB therapy. Strikingly, abrogation of CD73 from mesenchymal carcinoma cells completely sensitizes otherwise refractory tumors to immunotherapy. While targeting cancer cell-intrinsic factors can sensitize mesenchymal tumors to ICB, the mechanisms that dictate partial versus complete responses are unclear. Furthermore, whether abrogation of CD73 can also sensitize mesenchymal tumors to other forms of ICB remains unknown. By performing immunofluorescent analysis of tumor sections, we observed that knockout of CD73 promoted the greatest infiltration of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells in response to anti-CTLA4 ICB compared to tumors knocked out for CSF1 and SPP1, which showed only intermediate levels of infiltration. Moreover, treatment of mesenchymal tumor-bearing mice with anti-CD73 generated synergistic responses with anti-CTLA4 ICB, but not with anti-PD1, or combinations of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the EMT program in cancer cells is predictive of responses to ICB. Targeting CD73 in mesenchymal breast tumors promotes an influx of both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells and potentiates the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 ICB. Through mining of canine mammary tumor RNA sequencing data, we have found that canine tumors associated with EMT have increased expression of CD73, which suggests that these mechanisms of immune evasion may translate across species. These findings could promote therapies for both animals and humans that sensitize highly refractory populations of more-mesenchymal cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),CD73,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.
