In response, combination therapies, which can induce potent synthetic lethalities, bypass drug resistance, and expand treatment options, are increasingly being developed. A major hurdle limiting novel combination therapy discovery is the sheer combinatorics associated with broadly testing two or more agents. Thus, there is a practical need for methodologies that prioritize test compounds and technologies for rapid and efficient screening. Towards these ends, we have developed a novel combination drug screening workflow that integrates machine learning-based drug synergy predictions with a high throughput droplet microfluidics-based screening platform. Our physical system, or FlowMatrix, consists of 9,216 nano wells arrayed in a 96 x 96 grid in which cells are incubated and drug compounds delivered via emulsified droplets along both its rows and columns to facilitate combination screening. Following multi-day incubation, live cells are imaged with fluorescence microscopy and drug combination synergies are calculated from cellular viabilities. In our current setup, which includes four dose drug treatments with replicates and controls, we capture complete data (control, single agent, and 4x4 drug-drug combination viability measurements) for up to 100 unique drug combinations within the 9,216 dual droplet loaded wells of one FlowMatrix. Our to-date screening efforts have focused on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specifically, where we have profiled 12,700 AML cell line-drug combinations in our system. This encompasses &#62;3,700 unique drug combinations profiled in 7 distinct AML cell lines with 183 total matrix runs. Among the strongest hits observed in our screens and confirmed with validation studies (~65% confirmation rate) are combinations currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers and established therapies paired with non-cancer indicated drugs. In particular, we are interrogating combinations involving CDK12 inhibitors, which affect the transcription of DNA repair proteins, splicing, and cancer cell progression, including unexpected partner drugs that potentiate the effects of CDK12 blockade in AML cell lines. We have uncovered additional unexpected synergistic combinations with KIT inhibitors in <i>RUNX1-RUNX1T1 <\/i>altered AML lines, ATR inhibitors (including an established combination with Gemcitabine), and the BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax, including known partnerships with chemotherapies (e.g. Decitabine and Daunorubicin) and other targeted inhibitors. Deeper studies are underway to further validate and characterize these candidates towards expanding treatment options for AML. Ultimately, our platform may radically enhance drug combination screening potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Drug synergy,Microfluidics,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

LGR5 marks active stem cells in many types of solid cancers. It has been very difficult to isolate good antibodies to native LGR5 and attempts to develop ADCs targeting LGR5 have not advanced. We took the alternative approach of using a natural LGR5 ligand to target monomethylauristatin (MMAE) to LGR5-expressing CSC. An Fc domain was fused to the LGR binding domains of RSPO1 and the sortase reaction was used to conjugate a Gly<sub>3<\/sub>-val\/cit-PAB-MMAE linker at the C-terminal end to create FcF2-MMAE. We previously reported its efficacy in ovarian models here document its activity in other aggressive cancer models.<br \/>Methods: FcF2-MMAE was produced by transient transfection in HEK293E cells and purified by a sequential Ni-NTA and ion exchange chromatography. OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells were molecularly engineered to stably express an empty vector (OVCAR8\/EV) or LGR5 (OVCAR8\/LGR5.6) at a 10-fold higher level. The sortase A enzyme was produced <i>in E. coli<\/i>. Flow cytometry was used to quantify cell surface LGR5 in live cells using an anti-LGR5 antibody.<br \/>Results: DEPMAP tools were used to identify cell types with high levels of WNT signaling that drives expression of LGR5. FCM confirmed LGR5 expression in colon LoVo, gastric AGS and neuroblastoma SKNAS cells. All three lines were very sensitive to FcF2-MMAE; GI<sub>50<\/sub> values in 2D cultures were: LoVo 4.5, AGS 0.7 and SKNAS 8.6 nM. IC<sub>50<\/sub> values for stem cell-derived spheroids grown from these lines were: 11.0, 3.0 and 1.70 nM, respectively. The MTD of FcF2-MMAE was found to be &#62;1.5 nmol\/g in mice. The plasma half-life was 29.7 h. A q7dx4 IP dose schedule was found to be more effective than a q4dx4 IP schedule. FcF2-MMAE inhibited <i>in vivo<\/i> SC growth in all 3 models at a dose of 1 nmol\/g q7dx4, producing cures in a fraction of AGS tumors and delaying SKNAS growth &#62;2-fold in the absence adverse events. In addition to MMAE, we showed that FcF2-His could be conjugated to the either deruxtecan or PNU159682; FcF2-His loaded with either one of these cytotoxins had low nM or sub nM cytotoxicity and retained the same high selectivity of FcF2-MMAE when tested in isogenic OVCAR8\/EV and OVCAR8\/LGR5 cells.<br \/>Conclusions: FcF2-MMAE has activity in xenograft models of very aggressive tumors driven by high levels of WNT signaling (LoVo, AGS, and SKNAS) and LGR5 expression. Efficacy was obtained at doses well below its MTD indicating a wide therapeutic window. The FcF2 core accommodates multiple types of warheads without loss of targeting selectivity. The ability to switch out one cytotoxin for another provides versatility in targeting different diseases. FcF2-MMAE has advantages over ASCs. Its small size relative to antibodies favors better tumor penetration. The binding domains of RSPO1 also target stem cells expressing LGR4 and LGR6 as well as LGR5, something that cannot be achieved with an ADC. These features support the further development of FcF2-MMAE as a stem cell-targeted therapeutic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Stem cells,Wnt signaling,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

However, their use is still limited by nanoparticle hepatic clearance which is responsible for low delivery to the target site. Moreover, the unintended liver distribution could cause harmful side effects. Curadigm&#8217;s innovative Nanoprimer technology aims to shift the balance of therapeutics bioavailability and toxicity. The platform is designed to decrease nanomedicines' liver trapping and increase their systemic bioavailability for optimal accumulation in target tissues. This technology can redefine the benefit\/risk ratio of therapeutics, improving their clinical outcomes and treatment value. The Nanoprimer is an engineered, biocompatible liposome that transiently and specifically occupies the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system responsible for sub-optimal therapeutics bioavailability. The Nanoprimer is administered just before the therapeutic, temporarily reducing drug clearance and elimination. Proofs-of-concept were realized by combining the Nanoprimer with different therapeutic agents such as irinotecan-loaded liposomes and nucleic acid-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNP). One example is a study conducted in collaboration with the Langer Lab at MIT that shows that the Nanoprimer increases mRNA- and siRNA-based therapeutics efficiency by 32% and 49% respectively. Efficacy studies in a triple-negative breast cancer mouse model reveal that the Nanoprimer increases by 2-fold the anti-tumor efficacy of siRNA LNP therapy. Data demonstrate the safety of the Nanoprimer, along with its ability to maximize the inhibition of primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis by systemic siRNA LNP treatment. In a collaborative study with the NCL*, the Nanoprimer was shown to stimulate the immune response in a systemic vaccine model using ovalbumin-coated gold nanoparticles (GNP-OVA). Administration of the Nanoprimer before immunization of mice by intravenous injection of GNP-OVA, results in a dramatic increase in anti-OVA antibody levels with IgGs detected as early as 7 days. Furthermore, IgG and IgM antibodies remain elevated at day 28 showing a robust and sustainable immune response. Nanoprimer ability to enhance immune response shows its great potential in immunotherapy, especially for cancer vaccines. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the ubiquitous nature of the Nanoprimer mode of action allows its application to a broad spectrum of therapeutics, from nucleic acid-loaded LNP to immunotherapy. Efficacy studies conducted in mouse models highlight the potential for the Nanoprimer to empower nanotechnology for oncology treatments. *We acknowledge NCL, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research sponsored by the NCI for the help with conducting these experiments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Liposomes,Chemotherapy,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Using these large scale genetic and phenotypic datasets, we have developed a unique target discovery platform that has identified hundreds of pleiotropic genetic variants with opposing directionality of effects in cancer and immune diseases. These immune-oncology (I\/O) genetic associations point to already clinically validated immune checkpoint receptors (e.g., CTLA4) and those currently in clinical trials (e.g., CD200R1). This suggests that these I\/O genetic associations could be linked to genes that are broadly utilized by tumor cells to evade the immune system and could be used to identify novel therapeutic targets involved in regulating anti-tumor immune response. Here, we utilized expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and annotation of coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to link one of these signals to a causal gene, and identified ULBP6, a stress-induced ligand for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D found on NK and T cells. ULBP6 is known to be shed from the cell surface of tumor cells to block its interaction with NKG2D to evade immune surveillance. Expression profiling of ULBP ligands in various tumor types using MSD, IHC, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq revealed tumor-intrinsic up-regulation of ULBP6 in squamous cancer subtypes. Collectively, these data suggest that ULBP6 is a promising therapeutic target, and that can potentially enhance anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Immuno-oncology,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Here, we present a novel platform that links <u>M<\/u>ultiparameter <u>Fl<\/u>ow cytometry with high-throughput <i><u>EX<\/u> vivo<\/i> drug screening (MFLEX) in AML patient-derived cell models to simultaneously detect phenotypic changes and predict cell-subset specific drug responses in AML.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We developed a 21-color high-dimensional immune profiling panel that captures AML heterogeneity by delineating primitive and mature AML blasts along with normal hematopoietic lineages. The panel also includes markers for functional measurement of apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and expression of BCL2 family proteins in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets. <i>Ex vivo <\/i>culture conditions were optimized using physiologically relevant stroma-free cytokine-rich media that supports primary AML cells with minimal phenotypic shift, allowing for high throughput functional drug sensitivity testing. Timepoints and dosing conditions for AML standard of care (SoC) agents were optimized to support combination screens. Multi-parameter datasets were analysed for functional differences and visualized using dimension reduction methods.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We tested MFLEX on clinically annotated AML samples to understand sensitivity profiles to venetoclax and combination partners: 5-azacytidine, cytarabine, fludarabine and gilteritinib. We identified distinct drug sensitivity profiles for venetoclax in AML patients with varying leukemic differentiation states where M0\/M1 subtypes were more sensitive to therapy than M4\/M5. We also observed cell lineage specific sensitivities, with myeloid blast being more sensitive to venetoclax compared to autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and this observed difference was correlated with higher expression of BCL2. Our platform demonstrated that patients who previously failed venetoclax therapy could benefit from a combination with 5-azacytidine or fludarabine and this was patient-specific. We further evaluated MFLEX&#8217;s predictive value for patient clinical response by systematically comparing venetoclax sensitivity in patient-derived xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i> vs <i>ex vivo <\/i>and found a high correlation between drug responses.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We have established a unique, immune drug screening platform, MFLEX, that has high translational value and can be implemented in clinical trials to identify drug response patterns, novel combinations, and potential biomarkers of response for patient stratification in AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Ex vivo,Flow cytometry,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Unfortunately, outcomes of patients with metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma have remained abysmal. Moreover, patients who survive have a highly compromised quality of life due to debilitating side effects associated with chemotherapy drugs. Virtually no new drug has been approved for treating OS in the last three decades. Recently our group showed that ALKBH5 is critical for promoting OS growth and metastasis and may thus serve as a unique driver of OS. We therefore hypothesized that epigenetic changes, specifically mRNA demethylation mediated by the RNA demethylase ALKBH5, play a pivotal role in OS growth and metastasis, and hence approaches aimed at inhibiting ALKBH5 activity could prove clinical utility for patients with OS.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout were used to study the effect of depleting ALKBH5 in osteosarcoma and the effect it has on growth and metastasis. Fluorescence-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was used to identify targets of ALKBH5. FDA-approved and LOPAC compound libraries were used. SPR analysis was used to determine the Mefloquine-ALKBH5 interaction. <i>In vitro<\/i> and <i>In vivo<\/i> intratibial orthotopic models were used to test the efficacy of Mefloquine for blocking OS growth. Experiments are currently underway to test the effect of combining Mefloquine and doxorubicin in inhibiting OS growth and metastasis.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We showed that upregulation of the ALKBH5 attenuates histone H2A monoubiquitination to result in the induction of key pro-tumorigenic genes and consequently unchecked cell cycle progression, incessant DNA replication, and upregulation of DSB repair. Unbiased high throughput screening using a LOPAC library identified mefloquine as a potential ALKBH5 inhibitor. SPR analysis showed the interaction of Mefloquine with ALKBH5 catalytic domain. M<sup>6<\/sup>A dot blot confirmed that mefloquine inhibits the catalytic activity of ALKBH5. Cell-based assays showed reduced short-term and long-term growth with the treatment of mefloquine. <i>In vivo<\/i> models showed a reduction in tumor volume upon mefloquine oral treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our results establish RNA demethylase ALKBH5 as a novel driver of OS. This project has a direct translational relevance as an FDA-approved drug can be repurposed for treating OS patients as a monotherapy or in combination with doxorubicin and be formally tested in the clinic without much delay.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Chemosensitization,Drug discovery,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Many of these cues derive from the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is composed of adipocytes, vasculature, stem cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through these diverse components, the TME modulates cellular proliferation, survival, and ultimately response to therapy. Despite this high-level understanding of tumor-TME crosstalk, no existing pre-clinical models accurately capture the TME <i>in vitro<\/i>. We overcame that hurdle by developing a method to maintain healthy human breast tissue (HBT) alive <i>ex vivo<\/i> for at least 8 weeks. By culturing breast cancer cells in that HBT, we created ex vivo breast tumors (EVBTs) that retained patient-specific features relevant to breast cancer including menopause status, obesity status, and response to therapy. Using these EVBTs, we demonstrate breast cancer subtype-specific alterations in lipid accumulation, ECM remodeling, and cytokine profiles. RNA sequencing showed that breast cancer cell line signatures were retained in the EVBTs system at 1 week and 2 weeks <i>in vitro<\/i>. We demonstrated donor-specific transcriptional changes to the core matrisome gene set. Finally, we demonstrate that our EVBTs retained patient-specific heterogeneity in response to standard of care endocrine therapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapies. Our novel tumor model allows for 1) real-time examination of breast cancer interactions with HBT and the TME and 2) the isolation of breast cancer-specific factors vs. patient-specific factors in the development and progression of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Adipocytes,Breast cancer,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
