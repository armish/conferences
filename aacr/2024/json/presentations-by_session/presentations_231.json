[{"Abstract":"Background: Profiling cfDNA methylation enables early cancer detection and classification, but challenges arise from \"jagged ends\" (JEs) for ~90% of cfDNA molecules, as well as for FFPE samples and partially degraded genomic DNA. Repair of these jagged ends introduces erroneous methylation signals, especially in shorter cfDNA fragments enriched for tumor derived molecules. Separately, DNA conversions during 5mC profiling hamper accurate simultaneous ctDNA genotyping of somatic mutations. To meet these needs, we developed a method preserving double-stranded cfDNA molecules without error-prone end-repair at jagged ends. This enables superior methylation profiling including hemimethylation detection, and simultaneous ctDNA SNV genotyping.<br \/>Methods: We present JEEPERS (Jagged-End Error Polishing of Enzymatically misRepaired Sequences), a novel method for correcting errors in double-stranded library preparation for methylation profiling. JEEPERS detects and quantifies enzymatic repair errors at JEs, correcting them in silico. Leveraging duplex UMIs, it utilizes complementary strands and sibling reads from cfDNA families without jagged ends. The method exploits the 5' to 3' polarity of ER-associated errors and JE length profiles for correction. JEEPERS introduces anchor CpGs for precise correction of rare signals and enables accurate SNV calling at non CpG sites, addressing the challenge of differentiating true SNVs from conversion artifacts leading to C&#62;T\/G&#62;A changes in sequencing data.<br \/>Results: Analyzing 248 cfDNA samples (139 NSCLC patients, 109 healthy controls) by methylation profiling (EM-Seq) and ctDNA mutation genotyping (CAPP-Seq), JEEPERS correction efficiently addressed distortions, even at low tumor concentrations. Limiting dilution experiments demonstrated JEEPERS achieving a LOD95 of ~0.2% with 95% specificity (n=300). Despite ~50% lower molecular depth, JEEPERS-corrected cfDNA EM-Seq enabled accurate simultaneous methylation profiling and ctDNA genotyping, correlating strongly with CAPP-Seq genotypes (R=0.998, n=30). As expected, mutant ctDNA molecules were shorter than wild-type in both CAPP-Seq and EM-Seq data. cfDNA methylation patterns varied by oncogene vs. tumor suppressor status; EGFR mutants showed increased methylation (p&#60;0.01), while TP53 mutants had lower methylation levels (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Our method effectively corrects cfDNA methylation data, even at low tumor concentration, ensuring enhanced methylation signal accuracy and proficient SNV calling capabilities. This integrated approach offers a powerful means for investigating the link between SNVs and DNA methylation, significantly enhancing the accuracy of cancer detection using cfDNA, especially for early-stage tumors. This paves the way for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cancer initiation and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Cell-free DNA,NSCLC,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

There is unmet need for an accurate diagnostic test that predicts risk of recurrence prior to adjuvant therapy selection. We present a novel proximal assay for minimal residual disease (MRD) profiled in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (&#8220;lymph&#8221;).<br \/>Methods: Lymph, plasma, and blood were collected from 46 HPV-negative HNSCC patients postoperatively at 24 hours along with resected tumor. Cell-free DNA was extracted from lymph and plasma and sequenced using the TruSeq Oncology 500 panel to a depth of &#62;100 million reads. Somatic mutations were identified by exome sequencing (200x) tumor and blood. Five patients had &#60;2 mutations in tumor and were excluded. Two patients were censored due to lack of clinical data, yielding 18 patients with disease recurrence (REC) and 21 with no evidence of disease (NED) with &#62;1 year of follow-up. Tumor-specific variants were force-called in lymph and plasma using a custom pipeline. Patients were considered MRD positive if the mean variant allele fraction (mVAF) was greater than 0.015% (the estimated limit of detection). The Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator with log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards model were used for survival analyses. Logistic regression model was performed with 5-fold cross-validation.<br \/>Results: KM survival analyses showed lymph accurately predicts recurrence (sensitivity (SN) = 78%, specificity (SP) = 67%; p = 0.003, Hazard ratio (HR) = 4.7), while plasma was not significant (p = 0.92) at this postoperative timepoint. Performance was enhanced for locoregional relapse (SN = 92%, SP = 67%; p = 0.001, HR = 13.9. N=33). We also observed accurate recurrence prediction (SN = 83%, SP = 69%, p = 0.03, HR = 7.7) in the 19 N0 patients (node-negative by pathology). Lymph MRD outperformed individual pathology features (extranodal extension, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and nodal disease status) for recurrence prediction (HR = 3.4, 0.88, 2.5, 2.4, respectively). A logistic regression model combining lymph MRD with these 4 high-risk pathologic features showed superior performance over lymph alone or pathology alone (SN = 89%, SP = 67%; p = 0.0007, HR = 8.6).<br \/>Conclusions: ctDNA analysis of lymph from surgical drains represents a novel proximal MRD approach in HPV-negative HNSCC. Postoperative lymph significantly outperforms plasma for prediction of recurrence, particularly in patients with locoregional relapse. Accurate MRD identification in patients with lower risk pathologic features suggests that lymph MRD testing has potential to augment traditional pathology and provide more personalized adjuvant treatment decision-making in patients with HPV-negative HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Surgical resection,Cancer diagnostics,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated and sequenced from plasma samples collected at baseline (BL), during on-treatment response (cycle 5 [C5]), and at PD (discontinuation [D]) from pts with response and subsequent PD. ctDNA burden (tumor fraction [TF]) was estimated using low-pass pWGS by quantifying tumor aneuploidy in cfDNA. All samples with TF &#62;1.5% underwent high-depth pWES. ctDNA burden from pWES was estimated as maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF). Associations of TF with MSAF were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient <i>r<\/i>. For each subject, Jaccard index (JI) was calculated to evaluate the overlap of variants between BL and D. Variant allele frequency (VAF) and normalized VAF (nVAF) were used to determine variant clonality. <b>Results: <\/b>108 pts (pembro + chemo, 59; chemo, 49) with initial response and subsequent PD had plasma samples available from BL, C5, and D. Samples from 94 pts had TF &#62;1.5% by pWGS and underwent pWES. MSAF correlated with TF at BL (<i>r<\/i> = 0.84), C5 (0.56), and D (0.86). ctDNA TF was lower at C5 than at BL and D, with a mean of 4.4% (C5) vs 20.9% (BL) and 14.0% (D) with pembro + chemo and 4.0% (C5) vs 15.8% (BL) and 15.5% (D) with chemo. In variant-level analyses of pWES data from samples with high TF (&#8805;2.5%) at BL and D (n = 65), 39.2% and 44.2% of variants were shared between BL and D with pembro + chemo and chemo, respectively. Higher overlap was observed for variants between BL and D for the chemo arm (JI: median, 0.54; range, 0.04-0.91) vs pembro + chemo (0.37; 0.01-0.92). Shared variants between BL and D had higher clonality compared with variants at BL-only or D-only with pembro + chemo (BL and D mean nVAF = 0.50 vs BL-only = 0.39, and D-only = 0.38) and chemo (0.49 vs 0.38 and 0.38).

In addition to genetic alterations, epigenomic reprogramming leads to transcriptional dysregulation and drives cancer phenotypes including molecular subtypes, histologic subtypes, and mechanisms resistance. As current liquid biopsy assays fail to effectively capture transcriptional biology, new approaches are needed to examine the transcriptional status of therapeutic gene targets and pathways including those relevant to rapidly emerging classes such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and radio-conjugates.<br \/><b>METHODS:<\/b> We developed a novel multimodal assay that reveals genome-wide transcriptional activity of promoters, enhancers from chromatin and surveys the DNA methylome using 1ml of patient plasma. We applied this assay to patient plasma samples from across 15 tumor types generating 7000 genome-wide transcriptional profiles.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>We confirmed a significant correlation between epigenomic signals of transcriptional activation and gene expression from RNA-seq (Promoter vs RNA-seq: &#9076; =0.95, p&#60;0.05; DNA methylation vs RNA-seq: &#9076;=-0.16, p&#60;0.05). We identified transcriptional activation in cancer patient plasma of well-established cancer-associated biomarkers (e.g. MET, DLL3, PSMA) in a tumor-specific manner. Epigenomic profiling simultaneously inferred the expression of multiple pertinent ADC targets currently under investigation (MET, HER2, HER3, TROP2, B7H4 in breast cancer), and SLFN11, a known biomarker for sensitivity to these agents. Unlike targeted panels, the platform assesses transcriptional regulation genome-wide, enabling the assessment of transcriptional activity of select genes as well as related pathways. For example, a multimodal classifier robustly predicted HER2 status across metastatic breast cancer plasma samples based on features both within the <i>HER2<\/i> amplicon as well as <i>HER2<\/i>-distal genes that are activated in HER2+ cancers (AUC = 0.93, 0.84-1.0 95% CI).

Therefore, understanding the Osi resistance mechanisms and identifying the poor responders are essential to develop better treatment strategies. Thus, we conducted a prospective observational multicenter study and analyzed serially collected circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Here we report the results from updated analyses focusing on the association between genetic information from ctDNA and clinical outcome.<br \/>Methods: Patient eligibility criteria were as follows: a definitive diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC confirmed through biopsy or cytology, EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del) or L858R mutation, Osi planned as first-line treatment, and pts who could provide blood specimens. Paired plasma DNA samples were collected before starting Osi as baseline (BL) and at PD and analyzed to investigate Osi resistance by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Correlations between genetic information obtained from ctDNA and clinical outcome such as progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The median follow-up time was 33.1 months.<br \/>Results: One hundred eighty-eight pts were enrolled between May 2019 and January 2021, and 125 (66%) were female, 96 (51%) were EGFR 19del mutation, and 109 (58%) were never smoker. Among those, 178 pts were included in the analyses, and 111 experienced PD. In consistent with previous reports, median PFS (mPFS) and median OS (mOS) were 19.1 months and 36.0 months, respectively. The efficacy of Osi differed between 19del and L858R in both PFS and OS, with 19del being longer outcome [mPFS, 23.3 months vs. 17.2 months, HR: 1.56 (95%CI: 1.08-2.26), mOS, 40.3 months vs. 30.4 months, HR: 1.54 (95%CI: 0.98-2.45)]. Univariate analysis revealed that the presence of TP53 mutations and MET amplification (amp) at BL was a predictive factor of shorter PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis also revealed that the TP53 mutations at BL was a predictive factor of shorter PFS and OS. Plasma samples from 85 pts were available for ctDNA analysis. New adaptive mutations or amp at PD were detected in genes such as PIK3CA in 3 cases, MET amp in 4, TP53 in 4, BRIMP3 in 2, APC in 1, and BRAF in 2. Secondary EGFR C797S resistance mutation was detected in 1 case.<br \/>Conclusions: TP53 mutation at BL could be predictive of poor response to Osi. MET amp and PIK3CA mutations were detected as the most common resistance mechanisms, and secondary EGFR resistance mutations were observed less frequently than previous reports.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osimertinib,NSCLC,EGFR TKI resistance,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Bladder-sparing treatments are limited by our current inability to sensitively detect minimal residual disease (MRD). Here, we analyzed urine, a noninvasive and proximal biofluid, from patients with bladder cancer and utilized an approach that incorporates copy number-derived tumor fraction as well as fragmentomics to sensitively detect MRD and predict pathologic complete response (pCR).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We acquired urine preoperatively from 51 BC patients (80% muscle-invasive) on the day of standard-of-care RC, and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 57% of patients. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of urine cfDNA (median depth: 10X) from all 51 BC patients and 13 healthy adults. Tumor fraction level based on genome-wide copy number alterations was estimated using ichorCNA. We inferred fragment size and genomic coverage of urine cfDNA using Picard Tools. Then, we computed the short-to-long (S\/L) fragment ratio for genomic bins in each sample. The S\/L ratio per bin was derived by partitioning the genome into 100 kb bins and evaluating the ratio of GC-corrected short fragments (50-150 bp) to long fragments (151-250 bp) within each bin. A normalized genome-wide S\/L score was calculated by averaging across all bins.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In our cohort of 51 BC patients, 45% of patients achieved pCR (n = 23) while 55% had residual disease detected in their surgical sample (no pCR; n = 28). Patients with no pCR had significantly higher copy number-derived tumor fractions in urine compared to patients with pCR (median 10.6% vs 1.9%, p = 0.0002) and healthy adults (n = 12) (median 10.6% vs 1.8%, p = 0.003). Tumor fraction achieved an AUC of 0.89 for classification of No pCR from pCR with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 92%. Presumed cancer-free patients (healthy and pCR) had significantly longer urine cfDNA median fragment sizes than patients with no pCR (median 177 bp vs 156 bp, p = 0.002). Presumed cancer-free patients (healthy and pCR) also had significantly lower S\/L ratio scores than no pCR patients (mean .98 vs 1.5, p = 0.007). The top 100 bins with maximally differential S\/L ratio between these two patient groups were enriched for genes involved in KEGG pathways implicated in cancer and immune signaling (autophagy, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, Th1 differentiation) indicating biological relevance.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Copy number alteration-derived tumor fraction inference combined with fragmentomic analysis of urine cell-free DNA can enable sensitive detection of MRD to predict pCR and reveal potentially onco-relevant pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Multiomics,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arpit Panda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Irfan Alahi<sup>2<\/sup>, Pradeep  S.

We recently validated a liquid biopsy platform, LBSeq4Kids, for patients with retinoblastoma, brain tumors and solid tumors using low pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) of cfDNA from aqueous humor (AH), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma (PL) to detect Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Herein, we present phase 2, a high-depth comprehensive Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel using cfDNA that allows us to detect SNV&#8217;s, indels and gene fusions in clinically relevant genes for pediatric solid and brain tumors. Seventy-four cfDNA specimens have been analyzed to date, using plasma from 43 patients with solid tumors, CSF from 25 patients with brain tumors and AH from six patients with ocular tumors including retinoblastoma. cfDNA was extracted at diagnosis, during therapy, at remission and\/or relapse. Sequencing libraries were constructed with the xGen Prism DNA Library Prep Kit using 5ng of cfDNA. For the detection of recurrent mutations and fusions we designed a custom panel using a hybridization-based capture method (Twist Bioscience) that included full coverage of the exons of 136 genes harboring recurrent mutations and selected introns for five genes with recurrent rearrangement breakpoints including <i>BRAF, EWSR1, SYT, FOXO1<\/i> and <i>NTRK1<\/i>. Hybridized libraries were paired-end sequenced (Illumina NextSeq 500) at an average 1000x collapsed coverage. Mutations identified in cfDNA were compared with those in the primary or metastatic tumors profiled with our OncoKids&#174; NGS panel. A total of 35\/43 (81%) plasma specimens were positive for either an SNV, deletion or fusion with the most common events being a somatic missense variant in <i>TP53 <\/i>(13\/35, 37%) or translocation involving <i>EWSR1<\/i> (9\/35, 26%). A total of 16\/25 (64%) CSF specimens were positive for SNVs and fusions, most often involving <i>KIAA1549::BRAF<\/i> (7\/25, 28%) in low grade gliomas. A germline variant in <i>RB1<\/i> was detectable in two AH specimens from the left and right eye of a patient with bilateral retinoblastoma while plasma from a patient with metastatic retinoblastoma demonstrated clinically relevant variants in <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>DICER1<\/i>. Serial cfDNA profiling revealed a clinically reported <i>TP53<\/i> c.746G&#62;C missense variant in the plasma of a patient with osteosarcoma at multiple timepoints through the disease course, with evidence for relapse prior to standard imaging.

Baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) burden and changes on therapy are prognostic in mBC. GuardantINFINITY is a tumor-agnostic platform which measures aggregated epigenomic methylation signals that can distinguish ctDNA from non-tumor derived signals and permits the detection of somatic alterations in a 753 NGS panel. Longitudinal measurement of ctDNA quantity and characterization of emerging mutations may permit early identification of resistance and allow for intervention prior to clinical\/radiographic progression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients with HR+\/HER2- mBC receiving CDK4\/6i were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from 2018 onwards. Plasma samples were collected at baseline (prior to initiation of CDK4\/6i) and regularly in clinical follow up. Samples were analyzed using the GuardantINFINITY platform. Clinical information, pathologic characteristics, and dates of clinical progression were collected.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>57 patients with 350 clinical timepoints (median of 5 per patient, range 2-15) were evaluated. Median follow up was 28.6m (range: 0.9-64.3m). Median age at diagnosis of mBC was 59 (range: 38-88). CDK4\/6i received included 42\/57 (73%) palbociclib, 14\/57 (25%) ribociclib and 1\/57 (2%) abemaciclib; 40\/57 (70%) were in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and 17\/57 (30%) with fulvestrant. 5\/350 (1.4%) of samples failed analysis related to low cfDNA input. ctDNA was detected (by methylation) in 49\/57 (86%) at baseline (1 fail, 7 not detected), and 208\/345 (60%) of all samples. Median methylation-based tumour fraction (TF) at baseline was 0.0132 (range: 0.000875-0.433); a higher baseline methylation TF (&#8805;1%) was associated with worse CDK4\/6i-PFS (14.7m vs. 26.7m; HR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.12-4.62, p=0.023). 19\/49 patients had ctDNA clearance, which was associated with improved CDK4\/6i-PFS (34.4m vs. 13.9m; p&#60;0.0001). In longitudinal sampling, methylation TF rose prior to clinical progression and genomic alterations associated with CDK4\/6i-resistance were detected, including copy-number loss in <i>RB1<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Baseline methylation TF and ctDNA clearance as measured by GuardantINFINITY were prognostic in this cohort.

Secondary endpoints are progression-free and overall survival, ctDNA dynamics assessment, and concordance between plasma and tumor NGS. Target enrollment is 150 patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy. Serial LB-derived genotypes are obtained at baseline, early on therapy, and upon progression using a CLIA ultra-sensitive 33-gene panel NGS assay (Elio Plasma Resolve, Personal Genome Diagnostics\/Labcorp). Variant actionability is assessed by an ensemble knowledgebase, registry, and computational characterization approach, and results are reviewed by the JH MTB, followed by treatment recommendations.<br \/>Results: The trial&#8217;s pre-specified interim analysis included 30 enrolled patients with evaluable LBs; 30 baseline, 13 on-therapy, and 6 progression LBs were analyzed. Twenty-five patients had non-small cell lung cancer among which 9 were EGFR-mutated, 1 patient had small cell lung cancer, 3 patients had gastro-esophageal cancer, and 1 patient had a neuroendocrine tumor. In total, 74 variants were identified across all time points; these were cross-referenced in somatic and germline registries, variant knowledgebases, and the biomedical literature, together with computational characterization of functional consequence to assign mutation actionability. Tumor-confirmed variants comprised 36% of baseline and 42% of both on-therapy and progression variants. At baseline, 20% of the variants were putatively clonal hematopoiesis-derived with similar findings at the on-therapy timepoint. Thirty percent of baseline variants and 33% of variants at progression were deemed actionable. Upon JH MTB review, 29% of patients received a genotype-matched therapeutic recommendation based on LB results, with MTB recommendations followed in 38% of the patients. In analyzing ctDNA dynamics, of the 13 patients with on-therapy samples, 23% showed ctDNA clearance, 31% showed persistence, while 46% had undetectable ctDNA at both time points. Among patients with LBs at the time of progression, a third showed ctDNA emergence, a third had ctDNA persistence, and the remainder had undetectable ctDNA throughout the follow-up period.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings highlight the clinical relevance of liquid biopsies in guiding treatment selection and monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Precision medicine,Genotype-targeted therapy,Molecular Tumor Board,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Technical limitations require methods to distinguish tumor signal from clonal hematopoiesis (CH), often including non-tumor sequencing. We developed a tumor-na&#239;ve panel (FoundationOne<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Monitor) to quantify ctDNA tumor fraction (TF). TF analytical validation used peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sequencing. We then leveraged plasma collected serially from patients with aNSCLC in the real-world (rw) Prospective Clinico-Genomic (PCG; NCT04180176) study to investigate the utility of TF for monitoring therapy (tx) response.<br \/>Methods: TF was quantified using a combination of aneuploidy and variant allele frequencies of genomic alterations (GAs), while excluding CH mutations and aneuploidy using fragmentomic signal from cfDNA. In the PCG study, data from consenting patients were collected from electronic health records from 23 participating Flatiron Health Research Network sites. We analyzed plasma collected 6-15 weeks after start of tx in exploratory and validation cohorts per prespecified criteria. We defined molecular response (MR) as undetectable TF on tx regardless of baseline TF. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence Interval (CI) were calculated with univariate Cox proportional hazard regression.<br \/>Results: For TF validation, 1135 samples separate from the PCG study with paired PBMC results were included. Overall, 24\/4274 (0.56%) CH derived non-aneuploidy GAs detected in 1134 samples were falsely classified as somatic. Of these, 4 were detected among 317 samples with no tumor signal, resulting in a false positive TF value (specificity = 98.7%). CH derived aneuploidy was observed in 27 PBMCs and was appropriately filtered during TF estimation in all cases. Assessing the impact of CH aneuploidy filtering on sensitivity, we only identified 1\/320 (0.31%) samples where non-CH derived aneuploidy was omitted. To assess clinical validity, 222 patients were analyzed from the PCG study. MR was assessed after a median of 10.8 weeks of tx (IQR 8.9-12.0). In a subset of 152 patients treated with physicians&#8217; choice, MR was associated with favorable rw progression free survival (rwPFS: 9.4 v 2.8 months [mo]; HR = 0.30; 95% CI: [0.21-0.44]) and rw overall survival (rwOS: 22.0 v 7.5 mo; HR = 0.33 [0.22-0.49]). We validated this finding on 70 patients receiving immunotherapy (50 with chemo). Again, MR was associated with favorable rwPFS (9.0 v 2.8 mo; HR = 0.28 [0.16-0.51]) and rwOS (20.2 v 9.4 mo; HR = 0.42 [0.23-0.78]).<br \/>Conclusions: We describe a highly specific tumor na&#239;ve algorithmic filtration of non-tumor signal to enable high confidence ctDNA quantification and MR assessment. On tx MR is associated with favorable outcomes.

However, due to its propensity to metastasize to the bone, HRD assessment in tissue biopsy poses a challenge in advanced PCa. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a tumor surrogate may be a promising substitute for pinpointing patients who may benefit from PARPi treatment.<br \/>Methods: To test whether causes and consequences of HRD can be detected non-invasively in plasma, we pre-selected 139 plasma samples from PCa patients based on aneuploidy screening (mFAST-SeqS). We then applied targeted sequencing using a QIAseq panel including homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related genes as well as genes involved in cell cycle regulation (<i>TP53, RB1, PTEN<\/i>). Putative, pathogenic germline variants were sequencing in constitutional DNA using Sanger sequencing. Moreover, we performed low pass whole genome sequencing to determine the levels of genomic instability using the shallow HRD (sHRD) algorithm.<br \/>Results: In our cohort, at least one pathogenic mutation was detected in 68\/139 (48.9%) of the patients, of which the majority consisted of alterations in <i>PTEN<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i> or <i>RB1<\/i> (44\/139, 31.7%). Pathogenic <i>BRCA1<\/i>\/2 mutations were detected in 13\/139 patients (9.4%), the majority of which originated from the germline. In 8\/139 patients (5.6%) a pathogenic variant in other HRR genes could be observed and in 3\/139 patients (2.2%) <i>CKD12<\/i> mutations were detected. As expected, samples with pathogenic HRR mutations and elevated tumor fraction, presented high sHRD scores (&#60;20) in plasma DNA. In contrast, the majority of high ctDNA samples with mutations in <i>PTEN<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i> or <i>RB1<\/i> had sHRD score below the cut-off of 20. However, the detection of genomic instability was clearly depending on tumor fractions. Conclusion: <b><\/b>Our study indicates that a non-invasive assessment of root causes and subsequent effects of the HRD phenotype in prostate cancer is feasible, and that mutations in HRR correlate with a high genomic instability. However, to detect and quantify genomic instability in plasma, elevated ctDNA levels are required. Based on in-house data from mFAST-SeqS aneuploidy screening of over 900 plasma samples from advanced prostate cancer, approximately 30% of cfDNA samples would have sufficiently high ctDNA fractions for a combined assessment of causes and consequences of HRD, which might be most informative to direct PARPi treatment in PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Homologous recombination,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Genomic alterations in <i>AR<\/i> associate with resistance to ENZ\/AAP when started for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We aimed to test whether early use of AAP\/ENZ altered the incidence of <i>AR<\/i> alterations at progression. Between July 2014 and March 2016, 1976 patients with metastatic or high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer were randomized to ADT or ADT+ENZ+AAP in the STAMPEDE trial (NCT00268476). Consenting patients were given the option to donate blood for the ancillary biomarker study at trial-defined progression and prior to start of the next line of treatment. We focused on patients who progressed within 4 years from the end of recruitment (early progressors), as these patients represent the greatest unmet need. We obtained plasma DNA at emergence of CRPC from 115 early progressors (ADT n=63, ADT+ENZ+AAP n=52). We performed liquid biopsy-focused, custom, high-coverage targeted enrichment sequencing (PCF-SELECT, Orlando et al, NAR Cancer 2022). We used a bespoke computational pipeline, leveraging allelic imbalance and fragmentome analysis, to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma samples and copy number changes. Of 108 samples that passed quality control, 94 were positive for tumor (ADT n=52, ADT+AAP+ENZ n=42). The detection rate and ctDNA fractions were similar between the two treatment groups [ADT: 86.7% (52\/60), mean ctDNA fraction 0.18; ADT+ENZ+AAP: 87.5% (42\/48), mean ctDNA fraction 0.21; p=0.34]. The proportion of plasma with detectable ctDNA and <i>AR<\/i> gain was significantly higher with ADT+AAP+ENZ vs ADT alone (15\/42, 35.7% vs 8\/52, 15.4%, p=0.03). We then implemented the same approach on plasma collected from patients progressing on ENZ started for metastatic CRPC in a prospective Phase 3b trial (PRESIDE, NCT02288247): we confirmed a high prevalence of <i>AR<\/i> gain in plasma samples with detectable ctDNA (47.7%, 95% CI 38.8-54.9) in the CRPC setting. Significant copy number aberrations in relevant prostate cancer-related genes\/pathways (deletions of <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i> or DNA repair genes, or gain of <i>PI3K<\/i>\/<i>AKT1<\/i>) were identified in 9 out of 42 evaluable samples in the ADT group and 18 out of 38 evaluable samples in the ADT+ENZ+AAP group (21.4% vs 47.4%, p=0.014). Treatment with ADT+ENZ+AAP increases detection of plasma <i>AR<\/i> gain at emergences of CRPC in early progressors compared to ADT alone. Detection of plasma <i>AR<\/i> gain increases at progression on ADT+ENZ regardless of the treatment setting. The impact of early use of ENZ\/AAP on the detection of copy number aberrations, especially homozygous deletions, in other prostate cancer-related genes in plasma requires further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Circulating cell-free DNA,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Nevertheless, the characteristics and sources of cfDNA fragmentation in the blood remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to unravel the impact of DNA methylation and gene expression on the naturally occurring genome-wide fragmentation of cfDNA. We performed a comprehensive analysis of plasma samples from 969 individuals, including 182 individuals diagnosed with cancer (pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian, lung and breast cancer). In healthy individual cfDNA fragmentation patterns like DNA motifs at cfDNA fraqgments ends, recurrent cfDNA fragment start sites, cfDNA coverage and cfDNA fragment size were compared to publicly available data on cfDNA methylation and gene expression from myeloid cells. We discovered that the ends of cfDNA fragments, particularly those containing CGs or CCGs, displayed a distinct pattern of enrichment or depletion, respectively, at methylated CpG positions throughout the genome. This phenomenon is consistent with structural models suggesting an increased interaction of CG fragment ends with nucleosomes. cfDNA fragments were more prevalent (up to 3.7 fold) and of larger sizes (up to 4-5 base larger) when derived from regions of methylated CpGs or transcriptional start sites of genes that were not actively expressed. Differences in cfDNA fragmentation reflected specific biological pathways associated with their tissue of origin (like E2f transcription factors and blood cell metabolism genes in cfDNA from healthy individuals). Through analyses of cfDNA from patients with cancer, we identified a connection between tumor-related hypomethylation, increased gene expression, and a global reduction in cfDNA fragment size. This connection may offer an explanation for the generally smaller cfDNA fragments found in individuals with cancer. We found that cancer-specific methylation at CpG sites from pancreatic cancers were associated with widespread changes in cfDNA fragment ends, particularly for patients with pancreatic (test statistic = Welch two sample t-test; p&#60;2.2e-16) and other cancers. These findings establish a direct link between epigenetic modifications and cfDNA fragmentation that may have implications for non-invasive detection of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Biomarkers,Screening,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The incidence and prevalence of cervical cancer is high in Asia due to limited screening, awareness of HPV infection, and access to vaccines. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comprehensive genomic profiles of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in Asian cervical cancer patients with different histological subtypes and their association with clinicopathological features.<br \/>Methods: This is an Asian multicenter prospective observational study conducted by nine institutions in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam (NCT05099978, ClinicalTrials.gov). Eligible patients had histological diagnosis of cervical cancer with metastatic or recurrent disease. Patients on chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. ctDNA was analyzed in blood samples collected at newly initial diagnosis of metastatic disease and\/or at disease progression. Genomic profiling was conducted by Guardant360 (Guardant Health).<br \/>Results: Ninety-nine samples from 101 cervical cancer patients were analyzed. ctDNA was detected in 70 (70.7%) samples; median time to test results was 11 days. The median number of genomic abnormalities was 1 (range, 0-22). The most frequently altered genes were <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (n=28. 28.3%), <i>TP53<\/i> (n=18, 18.2%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (n=12, 12.1%) and <i>STK11<\/i> (n=6, 6.1%). Clinical trial-related genomic abnormalities were detected in 59 patients (59.6%) with 40 associated with approved drugs in other indication, including those targeting <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation (n=28), homologous recombination deficiency (<i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i> and <i>CDK12<\/i> mutation) (n=5), <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification (n=4) and <i>FGFR3<\/i>alterations (n=3). In squamous cell carcinoma (n=59), commonly altered genes were <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (n=21, 35.6%), <i>TP53<\/i>(n=12, 20.3%), <i>ERBB2<\/i> (n=5, 8.5%), <i>NOTCH1<\/i> (n=5, 8.5%) and <i>ARID1A<\/i> (n=5, 8.5%). In adenocarcinoma (n=36), commonly altered genes were <i>KRAS<\/i> (n=7, 19.4%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (n=6, 16.7%) and <i>TP53<\/i> (n=5, 13.9%). The number of patients with genomic alterations relevant for clinical trials was 39 (66.1%) and 19 (52.8%) for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively. There were no differences in the number of genomic alterations according to prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy can rapidly identify potential candidates for targeted therapy in cervical cancer patients, regardless of histopathology. Clinical studies of precision medicines in Asia are encouraged for such patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Prathepamalar Yehgambaram<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki Kojima<sup>2<\/sup>, Kazuki Sudo<sup>2<\/sup>, Shu Yazaki<sup>2<\/sup>, Momoko Tokura<sup>2<\/sup>, Munehiro Ito<sup>2<\/sup>, Mai Hoshino<sup>2<\/sup>, Wong Yoke Fui<sup>3<\/sup>, Pei Jye Voon<sup>4<\/sup>, David SP Tan<sup>5<\/sup>, Arb-aroon Lertkhachonsuk<sup>6<\/sup>, Anh Tuan Pham<sup>7<\/sup>, Thinh Dang Huy Quoc<sup>8<\/sup>, Wan Zamaniah Wan Ishak<sup>9<\/sup>, Hiroshi Yoshida<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinji Kohsaka<sup>10<\/sup>, Yukari Nagasaka<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryunosuke Machida<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomomi Hata<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenichi Nakamura<sup>2<\/sup>, Kan Yonemori<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,<sup>2<\/sup>National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>National Cancer Institute, Putrajaya, Malaysia,<sup>4<\/sup>Sarawak General Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysia,<sup>5<\/sup>National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>6<\/sup>Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>7<\/sup>National Cancer Hospital, Hanoi, Viet Nam,<sup>8<\/sup>Ho Chi Minh City Oncology Hospital, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam,<sup>9<\/sup>University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,<sup>10<\/sup>National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0fb3199c-b23e-4f48-808b-817441a45a2c","ControlNumber":"4507","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

However, little is known about the applications of ctDNA in the neoantigen-targeted personalized cancer vaccine setting, potentially due to the limited sensitivity of current ctDNA assays. NeXT Personal&#174;, an ultra-sensitive tumor-informed ctDNA assay was used to longitudinally track ctDNA in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with GNOS-PV02 (a personalized therapeutic DNA cancer vaccine) in combination with pembrolizumab.<br \/>Advanced unresectable or metastatic HCC patients that progressed on, or were intolerant to, first-line TKI therapy were enrolled into the Phase 1b\/2a GT-30 study [NCT04251117]. Whole exome\/transcriptome tumor sequencing was used for the design of GNOS-PV02. Patients were treated with GNOS-PV02 (1mg; Q3W x 4, Q9W) and plasmid-encoded IL-12 (0.3mg; Q3W x 4, Q9W) in combination with pembrolizumab (200mg; Q3W). Clinical Response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1 at baseline and Q9W. The ctDNA analysis and tracking for progression was performed as an exploratory objective.<br \/>Over 200 prospective baseline and on-treatment plasma samples from 31 patients were collected and analyzed using NeXT Personal. WGS was performed to identify up to ~1,800 selected tumor variants to create a personalized panel for MRD detection. NeXT Personal has been analytically validated to detection thresholds down to 1-3 parts per million (PPM) of ctDNA with &#62;99.95% specificity.<br \/>ctDNA was detected in 152 of 207 plasma samples with a dynamic range of 1.76 - 166,968 PPM. The limit of ctDNA detection ranged down to 1.05 PPM. 96% (24\/25) of patients were baseline ctDNA+. The percentage change of ctDNA relative to baseline at week 9 (C4D1) significantly correlated with best overall response (CR\/PR\/SD vs. PD: p = 0.0076). The ctDNA change from baseline to week 9 was predictive of OS (P=0.008), with 31.2% 2-yr OS (95% CI: 13.2 - 73.7%) for molecular non-responders vs 100% 2-yr OS (95%CI: 100 - 100%) for molecular responders. In addition, the ctDNA levels at week 9 were predictive of best overall response (P = 0.017). ctDNA burden at week 9 was significantly correlated with overall survival (HR = 5.46, 95%CI: 1.79 - 16.65; P=0.003; C-index = 0.886). ctDNA clearance was observed in all 3 CR patients with a lead time of 483, 126 and 105 days compared with MRI.<br \/>This ultra-sensitive ctDNA assay shows significant association between ctDNA change and clinical response and survival, and can be used to accurately predict clinical outcome. The convenience of non-invasive liquid biopsy and rapid availability of data could enable the use of ctDNA to allow real-time monitoring of personalized cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Liver cancer,Immunotherapy,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

An univocal variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold to distinguish germinal form somatic mutations has not been assessed yet. We aimed to correlate BRCA1\/2 ctdNA detected mutations with germline mutational status to determine potential VAF cutoff.<br \/>Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of both somatic (<i>s<\/i>) and germinal <i>(g)<\/i> <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> alterations in a multiinstitutional retrospective breast cancer (BC) cohort to assess the VAF threshold for the likelihood of germline mutations&#8217; detection by ctDNA next-generation sequencing (Guardant 360) testing. Clinical variables were analyzed using descriptive analyses and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the VAF cutoff.<br \/>Results: Two hundred and fourteen patients (pts) with <i>sBRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations (including variant of uncertain significant and synonymous) detected by ctDNA testing, referred to the enrolling centers between January 2015 to May 2023 were included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 50 years old (Interquartile range (IQR)43,5-61.5), 43% had a family history of cancer. Hormone receptor positive\/HER2 negative was the most represented subtype (68%) followed by the HER2 positive (16%) and triple negative (16%) ones. At ctDNA baseline, 95.8% of pts had a metastatic disease; the main sites of metastases were bone (67.4%) and visceral (59.3%). Ninetyfour (43.9%) and 137 (64%) pts had a <i>sBRCA1<\/i> and <i>sBRCA2<\/i> alterations respectively, while 17 (7.9%) had a co-mutation in <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>. The mean VAF value for <i>sBRCA1<\/i> alterations was 10.1% (standard deviation (SD) 19.5%, range [0.04%-84.3%]) while for <i>sBRCA2<\/i> alterations was 10.8% (SD 18.9%, range [0.21%-80.3%]). The germinal testing, performed per standard of care, was available for 100 pts (46.7%). Among these, 42 (42%) had at least a pathogenic variant detected. A <i>gBRCA1<\/i> mutation was present in 11 (11%) pts while 25 (25%) had a <i>gBRCA2<\/i> mutation. Comparing the somatic and germinal testing, 9\/100 pts had a concordance for <i>BRCA1<\/i> detection, the 2 discordant cases had both a low allele frequency <i>sBRCA2<\/i> alterations; the concordance for <i>BRCA2<\/i> detection was instead 100%. An optimal cutoff of 38.4% (AUC 0.98) for <i>BRCA1<\/i> and 19.5% (AUC 0.96) for <i>BRCA2<\/i> was assessed by ROC analysis as the likelihood of a germline meaning of a somatic mutation detected by ctDNA analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: The identification of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> alterations in ctDNA could guide the use of germline testing. The VAF cutoff identified for the likelihood of a germinal mutation is lower than expected, suggesting that a wider population should be screened for germinal mutation with relevant impact on the therapeutic choices and family screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA,Breast cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

There are several FDA-approved tests using digital PCR (ddPCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) and many more laboratory developed tests in use. The FNIH Biomarkers Consortium identified the absence of validated standards to qualify the performance of ctDNA assays as a critical need and set out to aid in the characterization of QCMs. Here we report on a commutability study comparing the performance of three commercial QCMs to clinical samples at or above LoD (limit of detection) and update on a real-world assessment of these QCMs by 11 clinical laboratories spanning 4 continents and 3 assay modalities.<br \/>Methods: QCMs were provided by Horizon Discovery (H), Thermo Fisher (T) and SeraCare (S). Clinical samples with known <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R and Ex19del mutations were prepared by diluting specimens at known concentrations into cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from healthy donors. The functional characterization compared detection of the mutations in QCM to clinical samples and consisted of 2 parts: (1) Evaluation of <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R\/Ex19del (range 0.1% to 5% allele frequency [AF]) by ddPCR, amplicon and hybrid-capture NGS; (2) Evaluation near the LoD of the amplicon NGS assay at the assay LoD95 of 0.3% AF. For the clinical pilot, participants were sent QCM pools formulated at 0.5% and 1% AF by ddPCR. Some participants also tested clinical specimens with <i>EGFR<\/i> L858R and Ex19del at 0.5% and 1% AF by ddPCR. All participants were blinded to AF and identity of the manufacturer.<br \/>Results: For Part 1, QCM results from hybrid-capture NGS of <i>EGFR <\/i>L858R were similar to ddPCR; for Ex19del, QCM AF trended lower compared to ddPCR. In contrast, L858R clinical samples showed a strong positive bias compared to ddPCR. For amplicon NGS, QCMs performed similarly to clinical samples, with amplicon NGS AF closest to ddPCR AF for T QCM. For Part 2, the observed hit rates mostly approximated expected values. For H QCM, observed LoD95 (10% for EGFR L858R; 50% for Ex19del) and subsequent dilution hit rates were lower than expected. For the clinical pilot, median Ex19del AF of amplicon NGS were higher than for hybrid-capture NGS for both the 1% QCM formulations and 0.5% QCM formulations. Median QCM L858R AF were similar for amplicon and hybrid-capture NGS, with greatest contributor to variance being inter-lab differences.<br \/>Conclusions: This project, unprecedented in the number of participants and analytical rigor, revealed unexpected differences in performance of both assays and QCMs. These findings merit consideration by laboratories that rely on QCMs to develop and perform assays for ctDNA testing as diagnostics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Precision medicine,ctDNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Currently, there is no reliable biomarker that can accurately predict which individuals with PHTS will develop malignancies, let alone SMN. Currently, there is no reliable biomarker that can accurately predict which individuals with PHTS will develop malignancies, let alone SMN. Despite the highly promising value of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for underlying sporadic cancers, the utility of cfDNA in individuals with hereditary forms of cancer remains poorly understood. Thus, we performed a retrospective study in prospectively accrued patients with PHTS investigating whether plasma cfDNA profiles can be leveraged as a predictive marker of cancer risk. We performed ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing of cfDNA of archived plasma samples from patients with PHTS without cancer (N = 50), and those with cancer (N = 49). Those with cancer included patients with only a single primary malignant neoplasm (PMN, N = 23) and patients with second malignant neoplasms (SMN, N = 26). To investigate cfDNA profiles in patients with PHTS and subclinical cancer, we included nine patients with plasma archived before their cancer diagnosis. We observed that patients with PHTS and SMNs have significantly decreased proportion of di- and tri-nucleosome-associated cfDNA fragments compared to patients with PMNs and those without cancer. Furthermore, SMN status was associated with increased genome-wide fragmentation (ratio of short to long fragments) of mono- (OR 2.37, 95% CI [1.09, 7.27]; P = 0.025) and di-nucleosome-associated (OR 3.03, 95% CI [1.07, 15.7]; P = 0.029) cfDNA fragments, even after controlling for age at plasma draw and phenotypic burden. Fragment end profiling was performed by calculating the frequencies of the first 4-nucleotide sequence (4-mer end motif) at each 5&#8217; end of cfDNA fragments. We identified 35 differentially abundant 4-mer end motifs when comparing patients with SMN to those without cancer. Patients with PHTS and SMNs were characterized by a decrease in A-end motifs with concurrent increases in G- and T-end motifs. Increased frequency of C-motifs&#8212;namely CC- and CA-end motifs&#8212;appeared to be unique to patients who had plasma drawn before their SMN diagnosis, a potential marker for active cancer. Our findings provide evidence that cfDNA fragmentomic features can be leveraged as a potential marker of individual SMN risk in PHTS. These results may facilitate earlier cancer detection and intervention as well as prevent unnecessary high-risk cancer surveillance and prophylactic surgeries in this vulnerable population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PTEN,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,Thyroid cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

One of the most challenging issue that hampers the possibility to effectively treat relapsed disease is the lack of biological information about tumor recurrence. To date, the Pt-free interval (PFI), an empirical measure of the time lagging between the end of front-line chemotherapy and relapse, is the only and widely accepted parameter to predict patient outcome and sensitivity to Pt second-line chemotherapy. We have previously demonstrated that analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by low pass whole genome sequencing (sWGS) is a suitable tool to predict patient outcome and to intercept early signs of relapsed disease (Paracchini et al . PMID:33323403). In the present study, we quantified the percentage of tumor fraction (TF) in plasma of patients enrolled within the frame of a phase III clinical trial (MITO-16A\/MaNGO-OV2A-EUDRACT number: NCT01706120) to demonstrate, at baseline, the prognostic value of untargeted ctDNA analysis.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><b>.<\/b> 172 eligible patients enrolled with the frame of the MITO-16A\/MaNGO-OV2A clinical trial, for whom plasma sample was collected at chemotherapy before chemotherapy, were selected for the study.

The proportion of blood cells in circulation containing CH alterations increases with age and environmental exposures such as smoking, leading to a higher prevalence in many high-risk cancer screening populations. CH remains a major confounder for mutation-based liquid biopsy tests evaluating circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), since these assays are unable to discriminate between mutations originating from the tumor as opposed to CH. While the impact of CH mutations on fragmentation-based methods of detecting ctDNA appears to be limited, the effect of mDAs has not yet been explored.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>: To assess the impact of mDAs on screening efforts using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of cfDNA, we performed copy number analyses on cfDNA from plasma collected from 895 individuals consisting of high-risk individuals meeting the USPSTF guidelines for annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography. From a subset of 203 available donors (157 without cancer and 46 with lung cancer), matched genomic DNA from white blood cells (WBCs) were extracted from the isolated buffy coat and WGS was performed to evaluate whether ploidy in cfDNA plasma is derived from WBCs. Genome-wide fragmentation features (short to long ratios and fragment size densities), coverage-based statistics, and copy number (CN) statistics adjusting for mDAs were calculated (CN<sub>adj<\/sub>). Machine learning models to calculate the probability of cancer based on these features were then derived.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>: 3.8% (95% CI 0.9%-6.8%) of individuals without cancer had an mDA in their WBCs that were also observed in the plasma (p &#60; 0.01, permutation test). Fragmentation features were not different in regions with mDAs in individuals without cancer (p = 0.619; permutation test) but were altered in regions of tumor-derived chromosomal changes in patients with cancer (p &#60; 0.01; permutation test). Coverage-based statistics were impacted by mDAs (p &#60; 0.01; Wilcoxon test). Machine learning models fit with CN<sub>adj<\/sub> showed improved performance over CN. However, machine learning models fit with fragmentation features compensated for this difference overall showing robustness to mDAs (p = 0.45; bootstrap) demonstrating the robustness of cfDNA fragmentomes for detecting lung cancer.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b>: While coverage-based statistics of WGS analyses of cfDNA may be affected by mDAs, fragmentation-based approaches relying on cfDNA fragment length are robust to effects of CH.

Variation in cell-free DNA concentrations (cfDNA-conc) has been observed between individuals with and without cancer. We assessed cfDNA-conc in 2287 treatment-naive individuals including those without cancer, with benign or high-risk conditions, or with one of eight cancer types.<br \/>Methods: Plasma (0.3 to 9.8 mL) was separated from whole blood collected in Streck or EDTA tubes from individuals with bile duct, breast, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, liver, lung, pancreatic, or metastatic cancer (n=23, 54, 28, 26, 264, 75, 180, 31, 22, respectively) as well as benign or high-risk conditions (n=550, 133, respectively) such as cirrhosis or hepatitis B or C virus infection (HBV\/HCV), and without cancer (n=901). cfDNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Quality and quantity were assessed using the High Sensitivity DNA assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Total amount (ng) of cfDNA from all nucleosomal peaks was evaluated per volume (mL) of plasma to assess significance across cohorts using unpaired two-sample Wilcoxon tests.<br \/>Results: We observed that in individuals without cancer, cfDNA-conc increased with age (Pearson R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.59; 18-40yrs vs 41-55yrs, vs 56-65yrs, vs 66-85yrs; p=2.31E-09, 1.50E-12, 8.31E-17, respectively). No difference was observed between cfDNA-conc from EDTA and Streck plasma from the same individual (n=9, p=0.359, Wilcoxon signed-rank test two-tailed). Individuals with benign adnexal masses or cirrhosis had similar cfDNA-conc compared to those without cancer while individuals with benign lung lesions or HBV\/HCV had significantly different cfDNA-conc (p=0.70, 0.35, 6.96E-04, 1.88E-09, respectively). These observations were not affected by age. Individuals with cancer had significantly higher cfDNA-conc compared to those without cancer (bile duct p=2.08E-14, breast p=4.44E-16, colorectal p=6.04E-10, gastric p=5.93E-04, ovarian p=9.99E-16, liver p=1.22E-15, lung p=0, pancreatic p=8.57E-03, metastatic p=1.18E-06). Ovarian cancer exhibited higher cfDNA-conc than benign adnexal masses which was more pronounced in later stage disease (I\/II p=3.83E-06, III\/IV p=8.18E-08). Compared to cirrhosis or HBV\/HCV we observed a stepwise increase in cfDNA-conc in liver cancer with progressing stage (0\/A p= 6.50E-04, B p= 5.69E-10, C p= 1.47E-08). Higher cfDNA-conc were also observed with higher stage of lung cancer compared to benign lung lesions (I\/II p=4.99E-03, III\/IV p=3.89E-06). Using cfDNA-conc (ng\/mL) as a single feature, we distinguished individuals with and without cancer with an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI=0.70-0.75).<br \/>Conclusions: In a cohort of 2287 individuals, we observed cfDNA-conc increases with age and cancer stage that varied across cancer types. As a classifier, cfDNA-conc can be predictive of cancer status, yet further work is needed to understand the contribution of other comorbidities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Unfortunately, biomarkers for this deadly disease remain under investigation, and underpinning mechanisms are ill-understood. Here, we applied epigenomic approaches to identify cell-free (cf) DNA features associated with these lethal AR-resistant mCRPC patients.<br \/>Methods: Plasma from 99 mCRPC patients was collected from two independent institutions, either prior to first-line AR-targeted therapy (n = 63) or during treatment (n = 36). We applied EnhanceAR-Seq to detect alterations in the <i>AR<\/i> locus including the upstream enhancer. We then applied genome-wide cfDNA epigenomics to 43 pre-treatment plasma samples and performed both fragmentomics and methylation sequencing to delineate the biology of <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer-altered lethal mCRPC. Finally, we identified stemness genes by applying CytoTRACE to external single-cell RNA-seq data from mCRPC, and applied these to cfDNA via promoter-level methylation analysis. We then assessed these stem-associated genes in tumor bulk RNA-seq data from an independent mCRPC cohort.<br \/>Results: <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer alterations were detected in 44% of pre-treatment cfDNA samples and correlated with significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 2.12, P = 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.48; P = 0.02). <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer alterations were detected in 19% of on-treatment cfDNA samples and were also associated with profoundly worse PFS (HR = 15.38, P = 0.0003) and OS (HR = 15.53, P = 0.002). Further, genome-wide cfDNA fragmentomic analysis revealed that binding sites for developmentally relevant transcription factors such as <i>FOXA1<\/i>, <i>NKX-3<\/i> and <i>HOXB13<\/i> were significantly more accessible in <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer-altered lethal mCRPC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis of the 20 most accessible transcription factors revealed several pathways associated with stem cell development. Interestingly, the 10 most stem-associated genes obtained using CytoTRACE applied to an external cohort of single-cell RNA-seq data from mCRPC (He et al. 2021) were promoter-hypomethylated in the plasma cfDNA of <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer-altered lethal mCRPC patients (P = 0.005). Further, metagene analysis of these stem-associated genes revealed worse PFS by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.04), which was confirmed by multivariate cox proportional hazards modeling. Our stemness metagene further stratified overall survival (P = 0.03) when applied to an external cohort of 80 mCRPC patients from Abida et al. 2019.<br \/>Conclusions: Alterations in <i>AR<\/i> including the upstream enhancer are remarkably prognostic in mCRPC with pre-treatment predictive potential. The mechanism can be inferred via cfDNA epigenomic analysis and appears to involve increased tumor cell stemness in <i>AR<\/i>-altered lethal mCRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Cell-free DNA,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

This underscores the urgent need for biomarker-based strategies for treatment decisions.<br \/>Methods: This prospective biomarker study analyzed plasma cfDNA from 267 advanced HCC patients treated with first-line sorafenib (S) (n=212), lenvatinib (L) (n=32), or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (AteBev) (n=23). Low-depth whole-genome sequencing was performed on cfDNA to identify genome-wide copy number alterations (CNAs). The 'I-score' was established to quantify genomic instability, calculated as the sum of absolute Z-scores of sequenced reads for each chromosome. The treatment outcomes of the three different therapies were compared based on the I-score. The I-score cutoff to differentiate high from low genomic instability was set the level separating progressive disease (PD) from non-PD at the first response evaluation<br \/>.Results: Patient demographics and disease characteristics were predominantly male (90.6%) with a median age of 59 years. The majority had an ECOG performance status of 1 (55.4%), HBV etiology (81.3%), and were classified as Child-Pugh class A (88.8%), with most presenting at BCLC stage C (95.1%). The high I-score group (n=164) exhibited a higher prevalence of macrovascular invasion (56.8% vs. 24.6%; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), lymph node metastasis (39.6% vs. 27.2%; <i>p<\/i>=0.038), and bone metastasis (14.6% vs. 4.9%; <i>p<\/i>=0.012) but lower peritoneal metastasis (5.5% vs. 12.6%; <i>p<\/i>=0.039) compared to the low I-score group (n=103). The high I-score group showed a worse disease control rate (50.6% vs. 74.8%; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), shorter time to progression (TTP) (median, 2.1 vs. 4.3 months; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), and poorer overall survival (OS) (6.0 vs. 18.5 months; <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) compared to the low I-score group. Treatment efficacy varied within the high I-score group, with AteBev showing the most favorable outcomes: the median TTP was 6.0 months for AteBev vs. 4.1 months for L vs. 1.8 months for S (<i>p<\/i>=0.005), and the median OS was not reached for AteBev vs. 7.6 months for L vs. 5.4 months for S (<i>p<\/i>=0.036). However, in the low I-score group, there were no significant differences in TTP and OS among the treatment types: the median TTP was 9.4 months for AteBev vs. 3.9 months for L vs. 4.2 months for S (<i>p<\/i>=0.665), and the median OS was not reached for AteBev vs. 9.9 months for L vs. 18.8 months for S (<i>p<\/i>=0.412).<br \/>Conclusions: The I-score, reflecting genome-wide CNA in cfDNA, has potential as a prognostic biomarker for outcomes in advanced HCC patients receiving first-line treatments.

Timely, effective, and affordable tools with high sensitivity are urgently needed in clinical practice.<br \/>Methods: Tissue and\/or plasma samples from 159 healthy individuals and 89 PLC, LC, or CHVI patients were sequenced by a targeted methylation panel (~70,000 CpGs) to screen candidate methylated DNA markers (MDMs). In phase I, the performance of each selected MDM was validated in 175 plasma samples (PLC, n=101; LC\/CHVI, n=74) by a CO-methylation aMplification rEal-Time PCR (COMET) assay. Logistic models were then trained and validated in phase II with 310 plasma samples (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], n=212; combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma [cHCC-CC], n=12; LC\/CHVI, n=106; training vs. validation, 2:1).<br \/>Results: The methylation levels of eleven selected MDMs with top performance showed a significant increase in PLC compared with LC\/CHVI in both tissue and plasma samples (P&#60;0.05). In phase I, eight of the above eleven MDMs with an area under the curve (AUC) over 0.80 to differentiate PLC and LC\/CHVI were chosen for further investigation. In phase II, the MDM-based logistic model achieved sensitivity of 87.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.8%-92.4%) and 88.0% (78.4%-94.4%), at respective specificity of 97.1% (90.1%-99.7%) and 100% (90.3%-100%) in the training and validation sets. In the validation set, sensitivity in patients with BCLC stage 0, diameter&#60;3 cm, AFP-negative, and PIVKA-II-negative was 90.0% (55.5%-99.7%), 88.9% (65.3%-98.6%), 80.6% (64.0%-91.8%), and 81.3% (54.4%-96.0%), respectively. The classifier achieved similar sensitivity in patients with or without HBV\/HCV infection (88.2% vs 90.0%). Additionally, our model detected 19 of 24 (79.3%, 57.8%-92.9%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Combining AFP and PIVKA-II, the model achieved higher sensitivity of 93.3% (85.1%-97.8%) and specificity of 100.0% (90.3%-100%).<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the feasibility of using an easy-to-implement cfDNA methylation assay (COMET) to discriminate early-stage liver cancer from other liver diseases, with superior accuracy over AFP and PIVKA-II. Notably, the combination of the COMET, AFP, and PIVKA-II increased the overall sensitivity, indicating the potential benefit of integrating these approaches in clinical practices. Moving forward, further investigation is needed to validate these findings in larger prospective clinical studies.<br \/>Keywords: primary liver cancer, early detection, liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis virus infection, methylated plasma DNA marker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Early detection,Methylated plasma DNA marker,Hepatitis virus infection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

It is unclear how improving assay limit of detection (LOD) would translate to improvements in clinical sensitivity. Here, we performed mathematical modeling of ctDNA dynamics after curative-intent treatment in early stage NSCLC to predict the clinical impact of MRD assays with improved analytical sensitivity.<br \/><b><i>Methods<\/i>: <\/b>We analyzed a recently reported dataset of post-surgical ctDNA MRD surveillance in early stage NSCLC (Abbosh et al., Nature 2023) to investigate ctDNA growth dynamics. Of 70 relapsed patients in this cohort, 23 had 3 consecutive ctDNA-positive samples with no intervening therapy. We used these to generate patient-specific mathematical models for ctDNA variant allele fractions (VAF) over time, initially assuming exponential growth. We assessed this assumption by creating log-linear models for ctDNA increase in these cases. Using slopes of the log-linear models, we calculated patient-specific doubling times and assessed their relation to stage, histology, and outcome. We used the log-linear models to simulate a VAF distribution each day after surgery, enabling projection of clinical sensitivities and estimation of lead times for recurrence detection at varying LODs.<br \/><b><i>Results<\/i>: <\/b>For the 23 cases with 3+ consecutive ctDNA positive samples, we developed log-linear models for ctDNA VAF growth, which were strongly correlated (r &#62; 0.5) in 18\/23 (78%) patients (median r = 0.89), supporting that ctDNA can be modeled as exponential growth. We calculated ctDNA doubling times for the 18 patients with exponential ctDNA kinetics and 10 patients with 2 consecutive ctDNA positive samples. Doubling times were remarkably consistent with median 51 days (IQR 40-79). Doubling times were longer for stage I tumors compared to stage II\/III (p = 0.04) but were not different between NSCLC subtypes. Doubling time correlated with time to clinical relapse, with patients having more rapid ctDNA growth relapsing earlier (r = 0.52, p=0.03).<br \/>Finally, we used patient-specific log-linear models to project ctDNA VAFs at a landmark 30 days after surgery. By improving the LOD for ctDNA detection from 10<sup>-4<\/sup> to 10<sup>-6<\/sup>, the projected clinical sensitivity doubled (from 43% to 86%). Simulations predicted that this improvement in sensitivity would increase median lead time from 183 days for LOD=10<sup>-4<\/sup> to 349 days for LOD=10<sup>-6<\/sup> (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><b><i>Conclusion<\/i>: <\/b>For most relapsed NSCLC patients, the natural history of ctDNA MRD growth can be reliably modeled with exponential growth kinetics. ctDNA doubling time is associated with stage and clinical outcome. Ultrasensitive MRD assays with LOD of 10<sup>-6<\/sup> are predicted to meaningfully improve clinical sensitivity at the post-surgical landmark and to increase the lead time for MRD detection before relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Modeling,NSCLC,Tumor growth,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Several drugs are currently in clinical practice for advanced ALK+ NSCLC. However, resistance remains a challenge in these patients. The possibility to analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with non-invasive methods can greatly improve prognostic capabilities, by allowing early detection of relapse and of drug-resistant mutations from peripheral blood. We report a series of 15 consecutive relapsed NSCLC patients (12 ALK+, 3 ROS1+) treated at the Fondazione IRCCS-San Gerardo dei Tintori (Monza, Italy) that were investigated by liquid biopsy at tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) failure, through amplicon deep sequencing of the <i>ALK\/ROS1<\/i> kinase domains. Median DNA yield was 4.8 ng per ml of plasma and mean fragment size was 176 bp. Mutational hotspot coding regions of ALK and ROS1 genes were amplified by high-fidelity PCR and sequenced. Mean coverage of called variants was 24,687x. The threshold for mutation calling was set at 0.6%, after correcting for mapping quality, minimum coverage, and strand bias. Analysis of background signal on healthy control DNA identified 0.0024 mismatches per mapped base. Overall, plasma ctDNA analysis detected an ALK mutation in 7\/18 relapse samples from 7\/15 patients. No ROS1 mutations were found in ROS1 fusion-positive patients. Among 12 patients carrying an EML4::ALK fusion, 10 variants potentially driving resistance were found. Along with mutations that were previously identified (L1196M\/G1202R, E1154K, F1174L), novel ALK variants were detected such as L1198R, T1211I, C1235R, C1237Y, L1196P. Mutations were characterized for sensitivity to ALK inhibitors in a BaF3-EML4::ALK cell model, using cell proliferation assays and western blotting to evaluate the effects on ALK phosphorylation. C1237Y and L1196P mutants appeared to resist all TKIs; hence, we further tested their sensitivity to novel investigational drugs, zotizalkib and repotrectinib. Both mutants demonstrated resistance, suggesting that these two mutations confer broad resistance to TKIs. Molecular modelling of C1237Y and L1196P mutants was run to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance. The ADP-C1237Y complex showed a much smaller root-mean-square deviation than ADP-WT, indicating a higher affinity\/activity of the mutant. L1196 interacts hydrophobically with a methyl group of lorlatinib, P1196 is predicted to lose such interaction, while ATP binding is not affected. The presence of C1237Y and L1196P variants, is a relevant finding due to their resistance, even after the exposure to the fourth-generation inhibitor zotizalkib. The clonal selection of these mutations, made by second\/third generation ALK TKIs may lead to a complete refractory status, which would then render TKIs useless in a sequential therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies:  Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,NSCLC,ctDNA,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Federica Malighetti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matteo Villa<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisa Sala<sup>2<\/sup>, Geeta Sharma<sup>1<\/sup>, Giulia Arosio<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Gemelli<sup>2<\/sup>, Chiara Manfroni<sup>1<\/sup>, Diletta Fontana<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicoletta Cordani<sup>1<\/sup>, Raffaella Meneveri<sup>1<\/sup>, Alfonso Zambon<sup>3<\/sup>, Rocco Piazza<sup>1<\/sup>, Fabio Pagni<sup>1<\/sup>, Diego Cortinovis<sup>1<\/sup>, Luca Mologni<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4da447b5-f582-4547-8222-dc9bea954f61","ControlNumber":"471","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

However, no systematic analysis of the compendium of repeat sequences has ever been performed in human cancer or cell-free DNA (cfDNA), largely due to the inability to identify and quantify repeat sequences genome-wide. We describe here the first comprehensive analysis of genome-wide repeat landscapes in cancer and demonstrate their utility in cfDNA liquid biopsies.<br \/>Methods: We developed ARTEMIS (A<\/u>nalysis of <u>R<\/u>epea<u>T<\/u> <u>E<\/u>le<u>M<\/u>ents in d<u><u>IS<\/u>ease) an alignment-free, genome-wide approach for analyzing repeat landscapes in short read sequencing. This approach uses a <i>de novo<\/i> search of short sequences (kmers) in the telomere to telomere (chm13) reference genome to identify 1.2 billion 24-mers uniquely defining 1280 individual repeat types occurring genome-wide across 57 subfamilies and 6 families. We analyzed ARTEMIS kmers in whole genome sequences of 525 matched tumor\/normal pairs from breast, colorectal, liver, lung, ovarian, cervical, prostate, thyroid, head and neck, gastric, and bladder cancers in the Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG), and in low coverage (1-2x) whole genome sequences of 1450 cfDNA samples from individuals with and without 8 types of cancer.<br \/>Results: Analysis of ARTEMIS kmer repeat landscapes in 525 PCAWG tumors identified changes in all 1280 repeat element types, including 820 novel elements not previously known to be altered in cancer. A median of 807 repeat elements (range 246-1280) were altered in each tumor compared to its matched normal. The majority of changes were in repeat elements not previously described as altered in tumorigenesis and were most frequently found within Satellites, LINEs and SINEs, though changes were also observed in LTRs, Transposable Elements, and RNA Elements. A cross-validated cfDNA model using repeat landscapes (ARTEMIS) and fragmentation features (DELFI) detected individuals in a diagnostic cohort (n=287) across all stages of lung cancer with high performance (AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.95) and was externally validated in a separate population (n=513). The locked model generated scores that correlated with circulating tumor mutant allele fractions for patients (n=19) undergoing targeted lung cancer therapy (r=0.80, p&#60;2.2e-16), and stratified progression-free survival (p&#60;0.001). ARTEMIS repeat landscape analyses of cfDNA also detected liver cancer in a high-risk cohort (n=208) of individuals with cirrhosis or viral hepatitis (AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95), and identified tissue of origin among seven tumor types (n=423).<br \/>Conclusions: ARTEMIS reveals genome-wide repeat landscapes in human cancer, including in 820 novel elements not previously known to be altered in tumorigenesis. These repeat landscapes that can now be described are evaluable in the circulation and provide an avenue for noninvasive detection and characterization of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-14 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cancer genomics,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
