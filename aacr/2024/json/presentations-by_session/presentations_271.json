Consequently, treatment with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors alleviates oncogenic KRAS driven immune suppression, resulting in a profound remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In immunogenic mouse models, these changes can lead to the generation of some complete responses which are dependent on the engagement of the immune system. In this project we aim to investigate whether the induction of immune responses triggered by KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition can effectively target inhibitor-resistant subclones. To achieve this, we mimic the development of drug resistance by combining reporter-traced isogenic KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant lung cancer cells, where the KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant cells are inherently resistant to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors. Growth of resistant cells was monitored via in vivo luciferase imaging and end point flow cytometry. KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition as monotherapy, either with the active-state KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor RMC-4998 or the inactive-state inhibitor adagrasib, led to a proliferative advantage of the drug-resistant subpopulation, suggesting that any immune response to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition in the bulk tumor population was insufficient to target the resistant cell subclones. To investigate if immune mediated elimination of resistant cells could be achieved using combinations, we assessed two strategies commonly evaluated in clinical trials with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors: anti-PD1 blockade and SHP2 inhibition. Of note, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant cells do not respond to these therapies when grown subcutaneously. Treatment of RMC-4998 in combination with either anti-PD1 or the SHP2 inhibitor RMC-4550 was able to induce complete eradication of both KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant lung cancer cells, despite the resistant cells being insensitive to these therapies when treated in the absence of sensitive cells. Furthermore, both combinations induced immune memory towards the resistant cells. These long-term effects were dependent on the immune system as they were not observed in immune deficient mice. Immune profiling of treated tumors revealed that both combinations can result in a more profound remodeling of the TME and potentiate the immune responses. Overall, our preclinical results demonstrate that the anti-tumor responses generated by the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors with SHP2 inhibition and\/or immune checkpoint blockade can result in the bystander immune mediated killing of subclones of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor resistant cells, providing a paradigm for the development of therapeutic combinations that may be more able to counter the development of inhibitor resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Immune response,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

This results in constitutively activated RAS proteins. Despite recent advances in drug design and the emergence of covalent inhibitors, effectively targeting mutant RAS remains challenging. Our group previously identified the tumor suppressor protein DIRAS3, which directly binds Ras and inhibits its function by disrupting KRAS dimers\/nanoclusters and blocking effector activation. DIRAS3 expression reduced cancer cell growth in pancreatic and ovarian cancers. To determine whether DIRAS3 plays a definitive role in inhibiting mutant KRAS, we comprehensively characterized DIRAS3's RAS-inhibitory effects using RASless mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells as a model system lacking endogenous RAS isoforms. We ectopically expressed various KRAS mutations in these cells and then examined DIRAS3's effect on each KRAS mutant clone. We analyzed downstream RAS signaling, colony formation, cell viability, and toxicity. Our results showed that DIRAS3 significantly inhibited RAS-dependent colony formation in KRAS mutant (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13D, G12R, Q61R, Q61L) but not wild-type KRAS clones. However, when we added epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the medium, DIRAS3 expression inhibited wild-type KRAS activity, decreasing colony formation. This suggests that DIRAS3 selectively affects the active, GTP-bound form of KRAS and downstream signaling. Additionally, DIRAS3 expression decreased Erk1\/2 phosphorylation in MEF cells with mutant KRAS, but not in the cells with a BRAFV600E mutation. This indicates that DIRAS3 specifically inhibits the KRAS-mediated MEK\/ERK signaling, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Moreover, to determine the critical region for DIRAS3's RAS-inhibitory function, we compared wild-type DIRAS3 and deletions (&#916;NTE, &#916;CTE, &#916;NCTE). Our results showed both termini are required to effectively suppress clonogenic growth, emphasizing the requirement for DIRAS3 to anchor to the plasma membrane and interact with the RAS dimer interface to inhibit RAS-dependent tumor growth. In conclusion, our findings underscore the potent and specific inhibitory effects of DIRAS3 on RAS-driven oncogenesis, positioning it as a promising pan-RAS inhibitor for RAS-mutant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Cell growth,KRAS,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

In recent years the first mutant-specific inhibitors of KRAS G12C (sotorasib and adagrasib) entered the clinic. While some durable responses were noted in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, the clinical experience of KRAS G12C inhibitors is marked by rapid drug resistance, either intrinsic or acquired, causing re-activation of the MAPK pathway. Common resistance mechanisms include compensatory signaling through the related RAS isoforms NRAS and HRAS, as well as the selection of non-G12C KRAS mutations, among others. The bacterial peptidase RRSP potently cleaves all RAS mutants and isoforms in the conserved Switch I region. We have shown that receptor-mediated intracellular delivery of RRSP using an engineered protein delivery system (RASx) can inactivate all RAS signaling in a cell, causing apoptosis in RAS-addicted tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Since systemic pan-RAS inhibition is not likely to be tolerated therapeutically, precise tumor targeting is a necessary feature of a true pan-RAS inhibitor. Here, we describe the unique ability of the RASx system to specify the cell surface receptor used by RRSP to enter cells, allowing exquisite targeting and killing of KRAS, NRAS and HRAS-driven tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. We screened a panel of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), to demonstrate broad tumor cell killing across pancreatic and colorectal cancer-derived PDOs. 97% of KRAS mutant organoids were sensitive to RASx, independent of the specific mutation. Intriguingly, 46% of wildtype RAS PDOs were sensitive to RASx, including organoids with activating mutations in EGFR. In contrast, PDOs with mutations downstream of RAS such as BRAF V600E were resistant to RASx. Indeed, RASx is effective not only against RAS-addicted tumors, but also wildtype RAS tumors driven by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, potentially expanding the clinical utility of this platform. RASx is a first-in-class, tumor-targeted pan-RAS inhibitor that represents a unique entry into the growing armamentarium against oncogenic RAS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic proteins,Ras oncogene,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

There was also evidence of adaptive receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by 48 hr. In syngeneic mouse models of NRAS-mutant melanoma, RMC-7977 led to a rapid inhibition of tumor growth, increased expression of tumor MHC class I and PD-L1 and an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrate into tumors. Therapeutic escape was associated with decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and increased numbers of immunosuppressive MDSCs.

Metastatic CRC (mCRC) is usually treated with combination chemotherapy and targeted therapy regimens, but eventually becomes chemotherapy refractory. Thus, novel and more effective treatments for mCRC are urgently needed. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key activator of RNA Pol II transcription and promotes the expression of many cancer driver genes, making CDK9 a promising target for cancer therapy.<br \/>Methods: Human CRC cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), cell line xenografts, and patient-derived xenografts were used to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the CDK9 inhibitors AZD4573, enitociclib, and NVP-2, as well as the BRAF inhibitors encorafenib and dabrafenib. <i>In vitro<\/i> viability was measured by chemical cell proliferation assays and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor sizes were measured by calipers. <i>In vitro<\/i> mechanisms of action were assessed by RNA sequencing, real time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. <i>In vivo<\/i> mechanisms of action were assessed by immunohistochemistry.<br \/>Results: CDK9 inhibitors potently inhibited CRC cells and PDOs. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, we did not observe consistent suppression of the oncogenes c-MYC and MCL-1 by CDK9 inhibitor treatment. Instead, CDK9 inhibitors suppressed several other key cancer pathways in CRC, such as MAPK, mTOR, and PI3K signaling pathways. Importantly, multiple targets within the MAPK pathway were strongly suppressed, including EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF. We hypothesized that combination treatment with CKD9 inhibitors and MAPK pathway inhibitors can synergistically treat CRC. As proof-of-concept, we investigated the combination of CDK9 and BRAF inhibitors in models of BRAF-mutant CRC, a particularly aggressive type of CRC. We found this combination to synergistically suppress CRC growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Compared to single agents, combination treatment led to significantly stronger induction of apoptosis and suppression of MAPK pathway signaling. Our results suggest that concurrent treatment with CDK9 inhibitors plus established MAPK pathway inhibitors, such as BRAF inhibitors, can significantly improve upon single agent treatment. Conclusions: We have found CDK9 inhibitors to potently suppress CRC growth and survival through a unique mechanism of action, by vertical suppression of the MAPK signaling pathway. We demonstrate that CDK9 inhibitors can synergize with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of BRAF-mutant CRC models. Thus, CDK9 inhibitors are a promising class of drugs warranting further investigation, including early-phase clinical trials, in mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,CDK inhibitor,BRAF,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

ATAD3A is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that contributes to mitochondrial dynamics, cholesterol metabolism, and signal transduction. Our previous study has demonstrated elevated expression of ATAD3A in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tissues and cultured cell lines. Loss of function suppresses HNSCC cell growth and elicits tumor regression in orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, ATAD3A interacts with ERK1\/2 in the mitochondria of HNSCC cells in the presence of VDAC1, and the ATAD3A-ERK1\/2 signaling axis drives HNSCC development in a RAS-independent fashion. CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering and has been intensively used to modify cancer-associated genes. However, challenges remain as CRISPR editing components must be transported into cells to exert their function. There is a need to explore effective in vivo delivery systems to accelerate the clinical use of CRISPR-Cas9. As no drug is available to target ATAD3A directly, we developed CRISPR-based ATAD3A-targeting nanodrugs by loading Cas9 mRNA and anti-ATAD3A sgRNAs into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that have become clinically acceptable delivery system due to low toxicity and high delivery efficacy and biocompatibility. As expected, treatment tongue tumors established in NSG mice with LNP-sgATAD3A remarkably repressed tumor growth. Most interestingly, the addition of LNP-sgATAD3A to the RAS inhibitor salirasib potentiated anticancer activity for HNSCC compared with the efficacy resulting from single-arm treatment. These novel and significant findings demonstrate a novel approach to inhibiting ATAD3A in tumor cells and provide a possible therapeutic strategy to enhance the success of multimodality therapy in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Mitochondria,Gene therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

The different mutation spectra in these diseases are reflected in divergent responses to EGFR inhibition: significant patient benefit in lung cancer, but limited in glioblastoma. Here, we report a comprehensive mutational analysis of EGFR function. We performed saturation mutagenesis of EGFR and assessed function of ~22,500 variants in a human EGFR-dependent lung cancer cell line. This approach revealed enrichment of erlotinib-insensitive variants of known and unknown significance in the dimerization, transmembrane, and kinase domains. Multiple EGFR extracellular domain variants, lacking approved targeted therapies, were sensitive to dacomitinib. Strikingly, at least two glioblastoma patients with G598V dimerization domain mutations showed responses to dacomitinib treatment together with subsequent off-target resistance in one case. In summary, this comprehensive screen reveals novel functional EGFR variants and suggests broader clinical investigation of EGFR inhibition for cancers harboring extracellular domain mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Signal transduction,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
