More recently, VA established a Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) infrastructure to support clinical trials (CTs) that rely on telehealth, where research staff are at different locations, and\/or where a single IRB provides oversight even when subjects are at different locations.<br \/>Brief Description: Research support and infrastructure is variable across VA facilities resulting in uneven access to cancer CTs in the VA system. Veterans often live in rural areas or have transportation challenges, which are barriers to participate in CTs. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased telehealth use in clinical care and in CTs, providing the rationale for a focused effort in DCTs. DCTs have the potential to reduce barriers to CT involvement at the facility- and patient-level and may be more representative of real-world clinical scenarios.<br \/>Summary of Data: Since its inception, NTO has provided hematology and oncology telehealth care to over 10,000 Veterans, of which 47.5% live in rural or highly rural areas, 76.5% are white and 13.2% are black or African American. Because the NTO program provides clinical care via telehealth modalities, patients who receive care through NTO may be more comfortable with participating in CTs that use telehealth, and thus are part of a pool of potentially eligible subjects.Since creation of the DCT program, three cancer DCTs have been conducted in the VA (1) BNT001 Digital Therapeutic Feasibility Pilot Study, (2) Cemiplimab Survivorship Epidemiology (CASE) Study, and (3) Proof-Of-ConcepT DEcentralized CliNical TrIAL (POTENTIAL) study. The BNT study enrolled 24 Veterans, 19 were male, 22 were white, 13 lived in rural areas, and the median age at enrollment was 68 years, including numerous cancer diagnoses. Veterans enrolled in the BNT study received cancer care at seven VA facilities. The CASE study has enrolled 24 male Veterans, 23 were white, 5 lived in rural areas, and the median age at enrollment was 74 years. The POTENTIAL study enrolled 4 male Veterans, 3 were white, 2 lived in rural areas, and the median age at enrollment was 72 years. Upcoming DCTs will focus on the following disease types: metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.<br \/>Conclusions: The VA provides clinical cancer care to Veterans through the NTO program. The DCT program builds upon the existing clinical infrastructure to conduct CTs on a national scale. The NOP DCT team is a component of the VA&#8217;s Enhance Equity and Access to Clinical Trials (ENACT) initiative, which is part of Cancer Moonshot. The DCT program intends to expand CT opportunities to Veterans with cancer, minimize barriers to CT activation and enrollment, and improve access to cancer CTs for all Veterans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-02 Clinical trial design and accrual,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

To facilitate data sharing, a coordinated, sustainable, and streamlined infrastructure is required to store, preserve, retrieve, and make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Starting January 25, 2023, researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are required to comply with the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (https:\/\/sharing.nih.gov\/data-management-and-sharing-policy\/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies\/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview) and indicate how research data funded by the NIH will be managed and broadly shared. As institutions prepare to meet these requirements, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is looking to understand the existing processes of data storage, preservation, and sharing including what infrastructure and services are available to facilitate data sharing. To carry out this goal, the NCI&#8217;s Office of Data Sharing (ODS), dedicated to promoting responsible and efficient sharing of cancer research data, issued a Request for Information (RFI) to understand the existing data sharing processes for NIH-Funded Research. The RFI was designed to collect information on services (e.g. guidance on data standards and file formats), technologies (e.g. storage, compression, retrieval, archival, analysis tools, workbenches), and processes (e.g. governance, communication, education, outreach) that promote data sharing. ODS utilized the RFI to gather input from stakeholders involved in facilitating data sharing. This included personnel from various fields such as research laboratories, scientific instrumentation core facilities, offices of research and\/or sponsored programs, provost offices or other research administration, libraries, information technology, and institutional review boards. We also engaged with bioinformaticians and data scientists who are actively contributing to data curation, formatting, and analysis. Here, we present analysis of the responses received, including insights relating to gaps and challenges in data sharing, and proposed next steps and recommendations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-04 Data science and informatics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Databases,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program in the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) has supported generation of large genomic data sets and advocated for and\/or required broad sharing of this data. One of DCCPS&#8217;s scientific priorities is focused on data strategies namely, &#8220;the use, enhancement, expansion, and accessibility of new and existing DCCPS-supported data resources to accelerate cancer control research&#8221; (https:\/\/cancercontrol.cancer.gov\/overview-highlights\/2022\/future_directions.html).EGRP funded the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Initiative, a multidisciplinary collaboration of researchers focused on understanding the genetic architecture, biology, and clinical and epidemiologic utility of common cancer risk variants. This program focused on 5 common cancer types - breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate - and required research that incorporated multiple research domains and sharing of any data generated. A major accomplishment of this program was development of the OncoArray genotyping chip, which used information from genetic epidemiology studies, biological\/functional analyses, and clinical and epidemiologic insights to create a comprehensive, high-density genotyping array for pan-cancer studies that has led to the discovery of hundreds of new cancer predisposition variants. This chip was used in a massive, coordinated genotyping effort that culminated in the generation of 7 datasets comprising genotyping data for nearly 500,000 individuals. All the data were deposited in dbGaP between 2014 and 2021 and are available (via controlled access) to any investigators. To understand the secondary use of these data, we determined the number of times the data had been downloaded, who downloaded the data, and types of research for which it was used. We also identified publications using OncoArray data and characterized the publications by research type, cancer type, and other details. Through this analysis, we explore how well the GAME-ON initiative and the OncoArray projects promote the DCCPS scientific priority of optimizing secondary research by making the data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-04 Data science and informatics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Databases,Risk factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

We searched English-language articles published between January 1, 2000, and May 31, 2023, in Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane database, investigating globally approved therapies based on PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitors, or CTA-4. Only prospective trials reporting overall incidence rates or lists of treatment-related adverse events data were included, and studies recruiting fewer than 10 patients were excluded.

We are summarizing the current state and challenges of biomarker use in the context of cancer therapeutic products approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br \/>Methods: We curated a dataset of oncology therapeutic products approved by the FDA through the regular and accelerated pathways from 2011 to 2022, based on publicly available FDA database, approval letters and reviews, prescribing information, publications, and clinicaltrial.gov.<br \/>Results: During the period of 2011 to 2022, the FDA granted 132 accelerated and 331 regular approvals for 80 and 144 oncology therapeutic products with 133 and 340 new indications, respectively. The percentage of approvals for a biomarker-defined population was higher in accelerated approvals in comparison to regular approvals (i.e., 51% vs. 39%). The five disease sites with the highest number of approved indications were leukemia, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, and skin. The vast majority of lung and breast cancer indications were approved in a biomarker-defined population through a range of different biomarkers. Overall, HER2-, EGFR-, BRAF-, HR-, and ALK-defined populations received the highest numbers of approvals. The most common biomarkers linked to the approval of a specific cancer type include Philadelphia chromosome for leukemia, EGFR\/ALK for lung cancer, HER2\/HR for breast cancer, BRAF for skin cancer, and BRCA for ovarian cancer. Multiple myeloma, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma did not have any approval with a biomarker-defined population. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma had a large number of approvals, but the percentage approved for a biomarker-defined population was small. dMMR, MSI-H or dMMR, BRAF mutation, NTRK fusions, TMB H, and RET fusions are biomarkers linked to tissue-agnostic indications approved for solid tumors only through the accelerated pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: To the best our knowledge, the analysis represents the most comprehensive overview of the current landscape on integration of biomarker in oncology therapeutic products approved by the FDA through both the accelerated and regular pathways. Our analysis shows that the FDA has increasingly approved indications based on biomarkers, particularly through the accelerated approval pathway. Biomarkers are reshaping cancer therapy under an evolving regulatory landscape with a growing emphasis on precision medicine that promises continued progress in personalized cancer care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-06 Novel endpoints and biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Oncology,Regular Approval,Accelerated Approval,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Previous studies have shown the benefits of specialty referral in oncology management in specific populations such as lung cancer patients (2). However, there have yet to be larger-scale studies on general trends in specialty referral in oncology. In particular, patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors frequently develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting a variety of organ systems and may benefit from specialty care (3).<br \/>Objectives: To evaluate the patterns of specialty referral in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and identify referral patterns that affect patient outcomes.<br \/>Methods: This was a retrospective study of all specialty referral for patients on an immunotherapy regimen from 6\/1\/2022-6\/1\/2023 at a single-institution cancer center. The specialties consulted included cardiology, dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, neurology, pulmonology, and nephrology.<br \/>Results: In total, there were 5,602 patients on an immunotherapy regimen, of whom 3,519 patients (62.8%) were referred to a specialist. Of these patients, 2,017 (57.3%) attended a specialist appointment. A majority of the patients were male (n=1038, 51.5%), had a mean age of 64.1 years (SD=13.8) at initial consult, and were White\/non-Hispanic (n=1414, 70.1%). The mean and median number of consults per patient were 1.7 (SD=1.3) and 1 (IQR=1), respectively. The maximum number of consultations for a patient was 17. Dermatology was the most commonly consulted service (n=841, 25.9%), followed by neurology (n=781, 24.0%), and endocrinology (n=446, 13.7%). For dermatology, the most common reason for consultation was evaluation of a rash (n=500, 59.5%). Dermatology also had the highest ratio of outpatient to inpatient consultations at 10.4 to 1. The next closest service was endocrinology at 3.0 to 1. The pulmonary service had the shortest time between consult request and patient visit (10 days), followed by dermatology (13 days), and gastroenterology (15 days). Prior to their initial consultation, the vast majority of patients (82.6%) were on a single therapy, and the most common single therapy was pembrolizumab (n=1589, 59.2%).

Some of these patients might undergo secondary resection. However, there is no standardized suggestion on whether colorectal cancer liver metastasis patients should keep target therapy after secondary resection. NCCN guidelines suggest chemotherapy only in patients receiving primary liver resection. Whether we could spare the use of target therapy after secondary resection is the main aim of our study.<br \/>Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we established a cohort of KRAS wild-type mCRC patients treated with first-line anti-EGFR therapy plus doublet chemotherapy between 2013 and 2018. Secondary surgery was defined as either resection of liver metastases or radiofrequency ablation.<br \/>Results: 5694 stage IV mCRC patients received anti-EGFR MAb plus doublet chemotherapy as a first-line treatment between 2013 and 2018. 174 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, with 153 continuing anti-EGFR MAb after secondary resection and 21 patients without anti-EGFR MAb. Compared with those who without anti-EGFR therapy after secondary resection, patients who continued anti-EGFR MAb exhibited significantly longer overall survival (OS; median, 43.8 vs. 31.9 months, p = 0.031) but not in time to treatment failure (TTF; median, 22.2 vs. 26.6 months, p = 0.841). The OS benefits of continuing anti-EGFR MAb remained regardless of left-sided or right-sided primary tumors (40.9 vs. 43.0 months, p = 0.980). The patient cohort from 2016 to 2018 showed more prolonged survival than from 2012 to 2015 (not reached vs. 40.450, p = 0.0305). TTF has no statistical difference when considering patient cohort or primary tumor location. In multivariate analyses, continuing first-line anti-EGFR MAb therapy after secondary resection remained an independent predictor of longer OS.<br \/>Conclusion: For mCRC patients who received secondary resection after first-line anti-EGFR and doublet chemotherapy, continuing anti-EGFR MAb after resection was associated with significantly longer OS regardless of primary tumor sidedness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-07 Real-world evidence and retrospective analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody,colorectal liver metastasis,Resection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.-Y.

Here, we evaluate the efficiency of AUPROS as an innovative model for real-world observational studies in oncology.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate three AUPROS studies at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre either locally or as a part of national and international collaborations: 1) METAL (Molecular Epidemiology of ThorAcic Lesions; n=11,378), 2) THANKS (Translational Head And NecK Study; n=3,506), and 3) CARMA (Canadian Cancers with Rare Molecular Alterations; NCT04151342; n=3,879). Specifically, we reviewed data collected, study elements, protocol language, coordination, institutional review boards (IRBs), and contracts. We also performed stakeholder-directed survey and discussions, analysis of funding, research output, and collaborations, as well as a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis.<br \/>Results: AUPROS is an innovative study design that borrows design elements from master protocol trials, adaptive trials, and master observational trials as well as retrospective and ambispective designs, enabling comprehensive data collection. The universality of AUPROS allowed for multi-purpose analyses of various real-world data (RWD) including epidemiological, clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biospecimens, and imaging data. The adaptive nature created opportunities for multi-source funding (e.g., academic, pharmaceutical, philanthropic, among others), as well as national\/international collaborations and involvement in consortia (e.g., ILCCO, TCGA, BEACON, and INHANCE). Additionally, AUPROS has allowed the development of an expanding national RWE platform that involves collaborations among medical and radiation oncologists and surgeons across different tumor sites. As assessed by research output analyses, AUPROS provided a platform for enhanced research productivity in different areas and utilizing various data sources (METAL=130; THANKS=31; CARMA=5 publications). Our survey and SWOT analysis identified several cost and operational benefits of AUPROS over conventional observational studies, as well as several challenges pertinent to ethics approvals, sustainability, complex coordination, and data quality.<br \/>Conclusions: AUPROS is an innovative model for real-world observational studies with significant logistical and methodological benefits over conventional RWD study designs. Our findings may help broaden the use of AUPROS to address emerging needs in the scope of precision oncology and clinico-epidemiological research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++RSP01-07 Real-world evidence and retrospective analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Epidemiology,Biomarkers,Molecular epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Some follow on drugs offer meaningful benefit via improved efficacy or reduced toxicity, but others offer minimal benefit. We hypothesized there are two cohorts of follow on drugs: those developed concurrently before efficacy &#38; safety of the therapy is established (first generation) &#38; those developed as follow ons after that point (second generation). We analyzed BTK inhibitor (BTKi) development to evaluate patterns of concurrent &#38; follow on development.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> BTKis from 1996-2023 were identified in Pharmaprojects (Citeline, NY). We collected drug development information including indications pursued, development phase reached, &#38; outcome (ongoing development, discontinued development, or completed development with FDA approval). We constructed timelines including the first publicized report of the drug, Phase 2 initiation &#38; date of development discontinuation or FDA approval.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>We identified 19 BTKis targeting CLL, of which 6 (32%) were concurrent and 13 (68%) were follow-ons relative to ibrutinib&#8217;s 2014 approval. A cluster of new agents began development immediately after ibrutinib approval, suggesting two distinct groups in this case. We identified 10 BTKis for MCL, of which only 2 (20%) were concurrently developed drugs, and 8 (80%) were follow on, based on ibrutinib&#8217;s 2013 approval for MCL, with similar clustering to CLL.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>C<\/b><b>onclusions <\/b>Among BTKis, market entry progressed in two phases. In a first phase, a smaller group of sponsors attempted to demonstrate safety &#38; efficacy of the novel class. After proof of safety &#38; efficacy, lowering risks for later competitors, a follow on phase of development began in which multiple sponsors sought to enter the market. Knowledge of which drugs belong to which class can aid with evaluation of trial design as part of regulatory approval decisions &#38; with drug price negotiation.<br \/><table border=\"1\"
