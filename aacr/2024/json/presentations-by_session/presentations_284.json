[{"Abstract":"A goal of immunotherapy is to induce an anti-tumor response that is potent and specific. However, there is increasing understanding that currently approved monospecific checkpoint inhibitors are not effective for all patients and\/or indications. Thus, investigators are increasingly pursuing multispecific antibody treatments in an attempt to enhance clinical outcomes. These treatments may either take the form of mixtures (administered simultaneously or in series) of multiple monospecific antibodies, or as single entity, multispecific antibodies (&#8216;multispecifics&#8217;). In the case of multispecifics, the large number of possible topologies and complexity of manufacture necessitate the development and application of a robust set of complementary technologies. We have developed an exemplary set of such technologies. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to direct desired antibody chain pairing (HC-HC and HC-LC), isolate and engineer single-domain antibodies, as well as generate large (&#62;100) panels of multispecific antibodies with diverse topologies from a limited number of input molecules. These technologies can be leveraged in combination with our affinity and developability-optimized TCE &#945;CD3 and &#945;CD28 antibody panels to achieve desired potency without the need for additional discovery or engineering.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Cory Ahonen<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Sharkey<sup><\/sup>, Melissa Durkin<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Avery<sup><\/sup>, Michael Battles<sup><\/sup>, Beth Sharkey<sup><\/sup>, Kyle Barlow<sup><\/sup>, Arvind Sivasubramanian<sup><\/sup>, Caitlin Stein<sup><\/sup>, Bradley Lunde<sup><\/sup>, <b>Kevin Schutz<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bianka Prinz<sup><\/sup>, Rob Pejchal<sup><\/sup>, Paul Widboom<sup><\/sup>, Eric Krauland<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"18bcc697-e451-4037-bd64-f571e48b252f","ControlNumber":"734","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

These biological effects are exerted by activation of the &#946;-catenin\/TCF transcription complex and consequent regulation of a set of downstream genes. DKK1 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling via competing Wnt binding to LRP5\/6. DKK1 is tumorigenic in multiple cancer types and also immunosuppressive via MDSCs and NK cells. Emerging evidence indicates that DKK1 has been involved in T cell differentiation and induction of cancer evasion of immune surveillance by accumulating MDSCs. Consequently, DKK1 has become a promising target for cancer immunotherapy, and the mechanisms of DKK1 affecting cancers and immune cells have received great attention. With Twist&#8217;s precision DNA writing technologies, we have created phage display libraries with diversity greater than 1 &#215; 10<sup>10<\/sup>, and utilized machine learning model for optimal discovery. In this study, we discovered anti-DKK1 antibodies bind to different cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of hDKK1 by epitope binning and mapping, and block the binding of DKK1 to the receptor. Binding of the antibodies to different CRDs of hDKK1 lead to different activation effect. The <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays showed that the interaction of Wnt to its receptor was restored in the presence of anti-DKK1 antibodies binding to DKK1 CRD2, resulting in TCF\/LEF signaling upregulation. Moreover, anti-DKK1 antibodies binding to DKK1 CRD1 induced immune cell activation and led to tumor cell cytotoxicity. <i>In vivo<\/i> study indicated anti-DKK1 antibody lead is potent in tumor regression.

It plays an important role in tumor development at various stages by activating IL-1 superfamily pathway, thus become an interesting target in cancer treatment.<br \/>Methods: We investigated the correlation between IL1RAP and tumor prognosis through the analysis of the public dataset. An antibody discovery campaign was performed and DX2206 was identified as the top clone against IL1RAP. Epitope of DX2206 was determined by examining the binding of DX2206 with different IL1RAP structural domains and in silico analysis. The activities of DX2206 against IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36 were examined using multiple assays with HEK293-Luc reporter cells, primary HUVEC cells, and A431 human skin squamous carcinoma cells. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a CDX model.<br \/>Results: Based on public data, IL1RAP is overexpressed in various types of cancer patients compared to healthy individuals, and high expression of IL1RAP is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, high expression of the members of the IL-1 superfamily, such as IL1RAP, IL-1, and IL-36, are negatively correlated with pan-Cancer OS. Our epitope analysis indicated that DX2206 binds to a unique epitope within IL1RAP domain 2. In vitro assays demonstrated that DX2206 inhibited the activities of all three pathways, IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36, with sub-nanomolar IC50s. Simultaneously, it induced a potent ADCC effect in the tumor killing assay. Finally, in a CDX model, DX2206 significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo.<br \/>Conclusions: We discovered a potent antagonist antibody, DX2206, that binds to a unique epitope of IL1RAP, inhibits all three pathways of signaling, and demonstrates in vitro and in vivo activities against tumors. Considering these characteristics, DX2206 emerges as an outstanding preclinical candidate for cancer therapy. IND enabling study was ongoing to expedite the candidate into clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Immunotherapy,Cytokines,Interleukin-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Q.

Cancer cells can hijack normal developmental pathways, preventing terminal differentiation or causing de-differentiation or transdifferentiation to a more proliferative, plastic cell state similar to those found in early development. Using our proprietary AI\/ML platform AURIGIN, we created a high-resolution atlas to define the drivers of normal cell states during human development. After mapping primary human tumors to the atlas, we identified the histone acetyltransferase KAT2A as a key driver of tumor cell plasticity in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).<br \/>Targeting KAT2A was genetically validated in MOLM-13 (AML) cells, where knockdown resulted in significant cell growth inhibition and induction of cell state changes consistent with a more mature differentiation phenotype. Similarly, an early tool heterobifunctional degrader of KAT2A and KAT2B (AUR101) resulted in potent growth inhibition and granulocytic differentiation in MOLM-13 cells and in 5\/12 primary AML patient samples grown ex vivo. Treatment of NCI-H1048 SCLC cells with AUR101 potently degraded KAT2A\/B, induced a significant shift from a dedifferentiated cell state to a more differentiated epithelial cell state and potently inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.<br \/>The strong biological validation of KAT2A\/B in SCLC and AML tumors, led us to develop AUR1545, a novel sub-nanomolar degrader of KAT2A and KAT2B. AUR1545, with its improved drug like properties, was tested across representative models of AML, SCLC and NEPC. In vitro, treatment with AUR1545 inhibited proliferation and promoted profound cell state changes in MOLM-13 (AML) cells. In NCI-H1048 (SCLC), LASPC-01 (NEPC) cell lines as well as a primary NEPC organoid model, AUR1545 demonstrated potent antiproliferative effects. In vivo, AUR1545 significantly inhibited tumor growth in an NCI-H1048 xenograft model. Taken together, these data genetically and pharmacologically validate KAT2A and KAT2B as key drivers of cell state plasticity in SCLC, NEPC and AML tumors and point to their utility as novel targets in these aggressive, metastatic and drug resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-04 Differentiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Differentiation,Acute myeloid leukemia,Lung cancer: small cell,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

HER3 mutations, detected in around 3% of cancer cases, may drive oncogenic signaling, leading to rapid tumor growth. Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for HER3 mutations. Through analysis of real-world data and structural modelling of HER3 heterodimers, we identified four common HER3 mutations located within or close to the dimerization interface of HER3, suggesting a potential impact on HER3 heterodimerization. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that all four mutations increased the heterodimerization of HER3 with both HER2 and EGFR. Further, conversion of an endogenous HER3 mutation to wild type via CRISPR editing significantly reduced the growth of KYSE-150, a HER3 mutant cell line. HMBD-001 is a clinical-stage anti-HER3 antibody rationally developed to uniquely block the HER3 dimerization interface to potently inhibit HER3 heterodimerization. Through structural analysis and FACS binding on HER3 mutation cell lines, we confirmed that the binding epitope of HMBD-001 does not overlap with the selected HER3 mutations and therefore may be a good therapeutic option for patients with HER3 mutations. In vitro, HMBD-001 suppressed HER3 mutation-driven PI3K\/AKT signaling, as demonstrated by the reduction of phosphorylated HER3 and AKT levels. In multiple cell- and patient-derived xenograft models with HER3 mutations HMBD-001 response achieved &#62;80% tumor growth inhibition. Based on this encouraging preclinical data, a Phase Ib clinical trial (NCT05919537) has been initiated, evaluating HMBD-001 in patients with aberrant HER3 signaling, including HER3 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB3,Mutations,Antibody,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

However, many patients fail to respond or relapse after treatment with ADC therapies due to tumor heterogeneity and resistance to ADC payloads. We are developing next generation ADCs that deliver targeted combination chemotherapies with a single molecule.<br \/>Method: CatenaBio has developed a novel system capable of attaching distinct payloads at different sites to the same antibody, enabling the production of highly stable single-molecule targeted combination therapies, Multi-Payload-Conjugates (MPCs), with a well-defined drug-antibody ratio (DAR).<br \/>Results: We screened combinations of different payloads targeting several different mechanisms of cell division attached to trastuzumab at different DARs to optimize tumor cell killing. These targeted combination ADCs demonstrated robust killing in both HER2 high and low tumor cell lines. Additionally, these novel MPCs show potent inhibition of tumor growth in a HER2+ xenograft model of cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: Antibody Drug Conjugates have revolutionized the treatment of high HER2 positive breast cancer. More recently advances have been made in the design of ADCs to expand indications to include HER2 low as well as HER2 negative patients. Multi-payload Conjugates&#174; offer the next step in ADC design and allow for the combination of multiple mechanisms of action in a single MPC that are highly effective across multiple breast cancer cell lines and HER2 expression levels.

Long believed to be exquisitely specific, recent preclinical data and our own work indicate that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) frequently (~25%) display cross-reactivity. In many cases, off-target interactions occur with unrelated proteins that cannot be predicted by protein sequence homology. Cross-reactivity can lead to serious or even life-threatening consequences especially when MAbs are configured as bispecifics, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) or CAR-T cell therapies, and IND applications for biotherapeutics require cross-reactivity assessment to prevent adverse events. Tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies have traditionally been used to screen for off-target binding, however, with poor predictive value for in vivo safety and toxicity. We developed the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA) platform to de-risk MAb-based therapeutics by testing for specificity across 6,000 human membrane proteins expressed in unfixed cells. The MPA assesses binding interactions by high-throughput flow cytometry allowing for high sensitivity detection and rapid analysis. All targets identified on the MPA screen are validated by secondary titration analysis. In contrast to TCR studies, proteins in the MPA exist in their native conformations and are not altered by fixation. Recently, we used the MPA to select a lead antibody candidate targeting the oncotherapeutic target Claudin 6 (CLDN6). Through MPA screening, we successfully identified a lead candidate devoid of cross-reactivity against other CLDN family members or any other membrane protein across the human genome. The MPA has also been used to rapidly evaluate the specificity of novel CAR-T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmunity. The MPA has been used for lead selection and data from the MPA has been accepted by the FDA as a part of IND applications for antibody-based therapies. The MPA is currently under consideration for being developed as an FDA-qualified Drug Development Tool.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Antibody engineering,CAR T cells,Specificity Testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

External stimulus such as ultrasound waves can trigger targeted, on-demand drug release from the nanocarriers. We demonstrate a first-of-its-kind use of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to induce Doxorubicin release from the surface of gold nanoparticle drug carriers. Our 1-MHz LIPUS beam is capable of penetrating tissue to sufficient depths with the required power\/intensity for drug release applications with a nominal intensity of around 3 W\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> in the region of interest (ROI). This level of intensity is necessary to elevate the tissue temperature to the mild hyperthermia range of 41 to 45 &#176;C. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments demonstrate a remarkable 22% enhancement in drug release with the addition of LIPUS. Measurements of drug release kinetics, with and without LIPUS, suggest that LIPUS shifts the drug release mechanisms from static (Fickian) to dynamic (non-Fickian) release <i>in vitro<\/i>. Thus, revealing the intricate interactions between ultrasound and drug release from gold nanoparticle drug carriers. To assess the efficacy of the delivery system, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> cell culture model with a customized ultrasound exposure setup. The LIPUS device was situated at the bottom base of a water tank, directing ultrasound beam upward toward a region of interest where the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were located 35 mm away from the LIPUS element. We found that the LIPUS device operating at an acoustic power of around 4 W increased cell killing efficacy by approximately 15% &#177; 2% when compared to conventional nano-drug delivery, highlighting a significant improvement attributed to ultrasound-induced mechanical effects. At the cellular level, these results underscore the potential advantages of ultrasound-mediated nano-drug delivery over conventional chemotherapy and non-targeted nano-drug delivery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ultrasound,Nano-sized drug delivery system,Drug release kinetics and mechanisms,Breast cancer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Farshad Moradi Kashkooli<sup><\/sup>, <b>Anshuman Jakhmola<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tyler K.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) hold significant potential as an effective cancer treatment, by targeting and delivering cytotoxic drugs exclusively to tumor cells that express distinct antigens associated with malignancy. Due to the necessity for specific surface antigens, therapies with ADCs are limited to specific tumor subtypes. In this study, we show the potential of a lupus-derived, cell-penetrating, anti-DNA antibody for delivering of cytotoxic payload to tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>. We utilized a fully humanized variant, named as V66, which was chemically linked to the Topoisomerase I inhibitor, Exatecan. The primary mechanism involved in V66 cellular penetration is mediated by the Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter ENT2. The latter shows elevated expression in a substantial subset of cancer types in comparison to healthy tissues, broadening the range of applications for ADCs in tumor therapy. Using labeled V66, we demonstrated specific tumor delivery <i>in vivo<\/i>, with minimal impact on healthy tissues. <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments validated the nuclear localization of V66-Exatecan, where it triggers the activation of the DNA damage repair pathway (DDR). As a consequence of the profound DNA damage, exposure to V66-Exatecan leads to cell death, exhibiting low nanomolar EC<sub>50<\/sub> values across a diverse range of cell lines. Furthermore, V66-Exatecan treatment presents synthetic lethality with BRCA2 deficiency, evidenced by a substantial increase in sensitivity. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies conducted in BRCA2 deficient tumors revealed a remarkable effectiveness of V66-Exatecan, leading to almost complete tumor regression and substantial improvement in the probability of survival. In addition to the lack of significant weight changes observed throughout the treatment, further toxicological studies conducted in serum and tissues demonstrated the absence of short- and long-term toxicity, with optimal liver and kidney function and the absence of damage to other tissues. Likewise, bone marrow cellularity remained unaffected. Collectively, these studies indicate that V66-Exatecan achieves targeted treatment of tumor cells, where it induces DNA damage leading to cell death. The <i>in vivo<\/i> application of V66-Exatecan leads to tumor regression without triggering general toxicity that is otherwise associated with Topoisomerase I inhibitors. This work provides the basis to advance a novel nuclear-penetrating ADC for delivering cytotoxic payloads.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),DNA damage,Cancer therapy,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Zaira Ianniello<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elias Quijano<sup>2<\/sup>, Denise Hegan<sup>1<\/sup>, Venu Bommireddy<sup>3<\/sup>, Dale Ludwig<sup>3<\/sup>, Peter  M.

Mitotic Kinesin-like Protein 2 (MKLP2) plays a versatile role in both interphase and mitosis and has emerged as a significant prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in cancer. The undruggability of MYC and the scarcity of MKLP2 inhibitors, however, have impeded clinical translation. Our development of JMBI-001, a potent and orally bioavailable small-molecule compound, overcomes these barriers. JMBI-001 elicits loss of function phenotypes in MKLP2 and a synthetic lethal interaction with MYC overexpression. Extensive kinome and safety profiling have revealed no significant off-target effects, and the compound is well-tolerated in long-term animal studies. In preclinical models, JMBI-001 has demonstrated an average tumor growth inhibition rate of 75 % across more than 20 MYC-overexpressing tumor models, including those in the stomach, lung, colon, liver, breast, kidney, skin, and hematopoietic system. Its anti-tumor activity positively correlates with high MYC abundance, aligning with the selective eradication of cells with abundant MYC both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Notably, JMBI-001 also robustly stimulates systemic anti-tumor immunity, enhancing NK and CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration in tumors of syngeneic cancer models. Moreover, additive or synergistic effects have been observed when combined with anti-PD1 therapy even in tumors refractory to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. The dual therapeutic actions of JMBI-001 stem from its disruption of MKLP2 functionalities, leading to anomalies, such as Golgi fragmentation in interphase and multipolarity in pro-metaphase. These disruptions lead to two key outcomes: apoptosis and immunogenic cell death, marked by secreted ATP, released high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), and surface-exposed calreticulin. These abnormalities, primed and amplified by deregulated MYC, are not observed in non-transformed cells, suggesting their potential as pharmacodynamic markers for monitoring JMBI-001's activity <i>in vivo<\/i>. In conclusion, JMBI-001 represents a novel class of anticancer agents that simultaneously triggers MYC synthetic lethality and anticancer immunity by targeting MKLP2-mediated cellular processes. Its unique mechanisms of action, exceptional bioavailability, potency at low nanomolar concentrations, wide-spectrum efficacy, and favorable safety profile establish JMBI-001 as a promising clinical study-ready drug candidate for treating MYC-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Myc,MKLP2,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

TTFields at 200 kHz, together with adjuvant chemotherapy, increased progression-free and overall survival of newly diagnosed Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype and IDH mutant glioblastoma (GBM, WHO CNS 2016) patients in a randomized controlled trial and were therefore approved for the treatment of these patients. We recently demonstrated that TTFields at lower frequencies transiently increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) models of murine and human origin by delocalizing junctional proteins such as claudin-5, ZO-1, and occludin in endothelial cells. The interaction between pericytes and endothelial cells contributes to the rigorous integrity of the BBB and is driven by endothelial cells releasing the platelet-derived growth factor &#946;-subunit (PDGF-&#946;), which binds to the receptor PDGFR-&#946; on the surface of pericytes. Here, we investigated the effects of TTFields on pericytes in a human cell-based <i>in vitro<\/i> BBB model in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of TTFields on BBB integrity.<br \/>Methods: We prepared an in vitro BBB model composed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells and human pericytes. The model was subjected to TTFields at 100-300 kHz for 24 to 72 h. Afterwards, pericytes were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-PDGFR-&#946; antibody in order to visualize PDGFR-&#946; localization and cell morphology under the microscope. To make sure that no cell loss occurred due to TTFields treatment, the nuclei of pericytes were counted.<br \/>Results: TTFields treatment altered the distribution of PDGFR-&#946; staining after treatment, with fewer, less distinct and more punctate PDGFR-&#946; foci. These changes were most prominent after 72 h of TTFields treatment at 300 kHz. We also observed larger nuclei in the pericytes after treatment but no significant loss of cells could be observed as per the nuclei count.<br \/>Conclusion: Together with the previously observed delocalization of tight junctional proteins in endothelial cells, the altered distribution of PDGFR-&#946; pericytes could reveal new mechanistic insights into the effects of TTFields on BBB integrity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Blood-brain barrier,3D models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

LCB84 demonstrates tumor selective killing by multiple mechanisms, increasing both safety and efficacy in parallel. Firstly, the over-expression of TROP2 in many solid tumors allows for targeted delivery of MMAE by LCB84 to Trop2-positive tumor tissues. Secondly, the overexpression of beta-glucuronidase in the lysosome of most tumors facilitates the selective release of active payload within tumor cells compared to normal healthy tissues. Thirdly, the intrinsic selectivity of tubulin inhibitor payloads, such as MMAE, for proliferating cells provides additional protection for non-proliferating normal cells. MMAE is also cell-permeable in its free drug form and can lead to increased efficacy of LCB84 via a bystander effect, enabling activity in heterogenous tumors. LCB84 demonstrates superior efficacy in mouse tumor xenograft studies when compared to benchmark TROP2-targeting ADCs, including sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan. LCB84 also shows an improved safety profile compared to these clinical benchmarks, as well as compared to traditional MMAE-bearing ADCs, in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> toxicity assessments. Additionally, LCB84 shows a stable preclinical pharmacokinetic profile with minimal loss of payload over time.

Over the last 4 years, 8 new ADCs got FDA approval essentially due to the innovation on the linker improving the disposition in patients and the manufacturability together with the technical advantages in the engineering of biologics and the introduction of new cytotoxic payloads such as deruxtecan. In the future, next generation ADCs will be developed exploring payloads beyond the currently used cytotoxins to improve safety, efficacy and durability of responses and therefore the short- and long-term therapeutic benefit to patients. Nerviano Medical Sciences (NMS) generated a portfolio of novel and diversified payload linkers leveraging on its proprietary chemical collection that includes cytotoxic and targeted payloads. A rigorous screening funnel has been applied considering diversification in terms of MoAs, pharmacokinetic properties, mechanism of resistance and combinability with other therapies to identify the optimal match with specific tumor types and targets, generating a new class of ADCs with improved selectivity and efficacy for hard-to-treat cancers even in chemoresistant settings. NMS ADC platform incorporates 1) our patent protected payload linker NMS-P945, a duocarmycin like DNA minor groove binder and alkylating agent inducing DNA damage, acting in chemoresistant cells with bystander effect and immunogenic cell death properties and generating ADCs highly efficacious in mouse xenograft models and safe when administered in NHP, 2) novel anthracyclines (PNU-682 derivatives) with an improved stability and safety profile and 3) targeted molecules with different mechanism of action including payloads active in synthetic lethality contexts. Payload linkers with different functionalization generated from each payload have been evaluated for chemical stability, sensitivity to lysosomal protease cleavage, and conjugability to monoclonal antibodies. The ADCs, generated with proof-of-concept antibodies (e.g. Trastuzumab), were characterized in terms of Drug to Antibody Ratio (DAR), aggregation level, plasma stability, antigen binding and differential antiproliferative activity in target positive vs target negative tumor cells. The best products resulting from the screening funnel have been subjected to a multidimensional analysis taking into consideration payload properties, tumor features and antigen expression in selected populations with the aim of identifying tumor types particularly sensitive to the payload. Our multidimensional approach coupling new payload linker with innovative MoA to careful selection of patients will allow to reach unprecedented efficacy and safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Anthracycline,DNA damage,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"P.

In this study, we report 6K465, a novel pyrimidine-based Aurora A (AURKA) inhibitor that reduces levels of c-MYC and N-MYC oncoproteins more potently than alisertib. In an analysis of the antiproliferative effect of 6K465, the sensitivities of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer (BC) cell lines to 6K465 were strongly associated with the protein levels of c-MYC and\/or N-MYC. We also report DBPR728, an acyl-based prodrug of 6K465 bearing fewer hydrogen-bond donors that exhibited 10-fold improved oral bioavailability. DBPR728 induced durable tumor regression of c-MYC- and\/or N-MYC- overexpressing xenografts including SCLC, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hepatocellular carcinoma and medulloblastoma using a 5-on-2-off or once-a-week dosing regimen on a 21-day cycle. A single oral dose of DBPR728 at 300 mg\/kg induced c-MYC reduction and cell apoptosis in the tumor xenografts for more than 7 days. The inhibitory effect of DBPR728 at a reduced dosing frequency was attributed to its uniquely high tumor\/plasma ratio (3.6-fold within 7 days) and the long tumor half-life of active moiety 6K465. Furthermore, DBPR728 was found to synergize with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to suppress c-MYC- or N-MYC- driven SCLC. Collectively, these results suggest DBPR728 has the potential to treat cancers overexpressing c-MYC- and\/or N-MYC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,MYCN,Aurora kinase,Prodrugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-H.

Based on its proprietary bicycle peptide (<i>Bicycle&#174;<\/i>) phage display platform, Bicycles are a unique class of highly constrained peptides, which have demonstrated utility in the targeted delivery of different classes of payloads (for example cytotoxic agents, radioisotopes, immune modulators) into tumors. Bicycles are currently being explored in the clinic as Bicycle Toxin Conjugates&#174; (BTCs) for targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads into tumors. BTCs consist of a bicyclic peptide that is conjugated to a cytotoxic payload via a cleavable linker, which allows payload release in the tumor microenvironment or within the tumor cell. BTCs were developed to address the shortcomings of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in several ways. First, the small size of BTCs (&#8764;4 kDa) compared to large biologic entities such as monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based conjugates (&#8764;150 kDa) allows rapid distribution to tissues and extensive tumor penetration, which enables rapid delivery of payload into the tumor. Second, the peptidic nature of BTCs results in relatively short, yet tunable, duration of systemic exposure and liver-sparing renal elimination. These properties limit the body&#8217;s exposure to payload and should therefore minimize damage to normal tissue. In this body of work, we used in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake assays and mouse and rat cell line derived xenograft models for 1) cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity evaluation, and 2) Bicycle and toxin uptake and biodistribution evaluation. Here, we show that BTCs targeting a number of different tumor antigens can deliver toxins to tumor tissue producing durable responses in a range of preclinical in vivo models, spanning several solid tumor indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,Drug delivery,Targeted drug delivery,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

TTFields therapy is delivered to patients suffering from GBM continuously by two array pairs placed on their scalp. Since arrays for TTFields application to the mouse head are lacking, and as most GBM animal models are based on mice, in vivo studies of GBM treatment with TTFields are limited. The development of such arrays is challenging due to the small dimensions and specific geometries of the mouse head, but is needed to allow continued preclinical studies to broaden the understanding of the effects of TTFields on GBM.<br \/>Methods: We tested various array layouts to identify one that will be suited to the specific geometries of the mouse head. For animal well-being, the selected array was required to minimally restrict head movement. Additionally, we investigated adhesive tapes to allow on one hand good adherence of the arrays to the skin, and on the other hand easy array removal. To examine the feasibility of treating mice with these arrays, they were applied to mice for 11 days, while recording the electric currents and the actual treatment time (from which the percent usage could be calculated). To validate that the selected array layout delivers meaningful field intensity to the desired region, we performed field measurements using a floating scope.<br \/>Results: To tackle the limitation of the small head size, we developed an array layout in which only two arrays were situated on the head, while the opposing arrays were located on the mouse torso. Additionally, the arrays on the head were divided into two smaller disks. We also identified a thin and transparent adhesive tape (facilitating correct arrays positioning), that offered good tackiness and allowed easy removal without leaving residual adhesive on the skin. The arrays met the minimum treatment requirements: current &#8805;50 mA, usage &#8805;75%, field intensity &#8805;1 V\/cm RMS. At the posterior side of the mouse head, at a location more directly underneath the arrays, field intensity was higher than at the anterior position.<br \/>Conclusion: TTFields could be delivered at sufficient intensities to mice heads by utilizing specifically engineered arrays. Our newly developed arrays are flexible and strongly adhering to enable efficient electric field delivery. By allowing TTFields delivery to mice heads, we will facilitate further advancing this research field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),GBM,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

The properties of an ADC, including its activity and safety profile, can be highly influenced by its characteristics and individual components, commonly viewed as the antibody, payload, linker, and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). However, multiple other characteristics can also significantly influence an ADC&#8217;s overall drug-like properties, including DAR homogeneity, method of bioconjugation, hydrophilicity, and charge balance. Due to the multiparametric nature of ADC platform optimization, there are few examples in preclinical research, and even fewer in the clinical realm, where comparisons across platforms have been investigated for the same target, both preclinically and clinically, to elucidate how deliberate modifications in molecular design can improve drug-like properties and clinical outcomes. To that end, here we describe the improvements observed in preclinical characteristics, as well as their translational relevance to corresponding clinical characteristics. Two anti-NaPi2b ADCs were produced using two different platforms, XMT-1536 (Dolaflexin platform) and XMT-1592 (Dolasynthen platform), conjugated to the same antibody and employing the same payload. The Dolasynthen platform was deliberately designed, taking into account preclinical and clinical learnings from earlier ADC platforms, to improve both safety and efficacy.

Bovine ultralong CDR3 antibodies have a unique &#8220;stalk and knob&#8221; structure in which two antiparallel &#946;-strands support a disulfide bonded knob protruding out of the antibody surface and forms a mini antigen binding domain. By replacing the knob domain with IL-15, we have created a chimeric CDR3-IL-15 IgG which functions as IL-15 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> but can be easily produced in mammalian cells with increased stability. Thus, the CDR3 can stabilize IL-15 in the absence of its high affinity receptor &#945; (R&#945;) chain. Furthermore, as IL-15 utilizes R&#945; for increased <i>trans<\/i> signaling to the receptor &#946; and &#947; subunits, one variant candidate (CDR3-IL-15_R&#945;) was produced by co-expressing R&#945; sushi domain with the chimeric IgG. Both constructs have been demonstrated to be highly active in stimulating proliferation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as in stimulating proliferation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells in rats and non-human primates (NHP). Although the CDR3-IL-15_R&#945; exhibited higher <i>in vitro<\/i> signaling activity than CDR3-IL-15, both were equally potent in stimulating the proliferation of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in NHP without any immunogenicity detected. Moreover, <i>in vivo<\/i> studies in NHP indicated that CDR3-IL-15 acted faster than CDR3-IL-15_R&#945; in stimulating the proliferation of these lymphocytes. CDR3-IL-15 is the first thermodynamically stabilized variant of IL-15 produced in the absence of its R&#945; chain, is highly active <i>in vivo<\/i>, and has multiple potential cancer applications as an T and NK cell stimulating agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Interleukin-15,Ultralong CDR3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Their development is promoted by tumor-secreted exosomes that, thanks to the presence of the integrin &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub> on their membrane, home to the liver where they increase TGF-&#223; production by Kupffer cells, liver-resident macrophages, initiating the formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Considering that anti-TGF-&#946; therapies have not been efficient in clinical trials or cause side-effects, our aim is to develop a liver-targeted anti-TGF-&#223; treatment using functionalized &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> exosomes. We selected 293T cells as a human, non-cancerous cell line to obtain exosomes. 293T have an endogenous expression of &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5,<\/sub> and exosomes were isolated using differential centrifugation of conditioned media. The vesicles obtained had a diameter of 20 to 120nm according to dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy, as expected for exosomes, and Western blot confirmed the presence of the exosome marker CD81. When fluorescently labeled exosomes (SP-DiIC<sub>18<\/sub>) were inoculated in the tail vein of Balb\/C mice, they were detected in the liver 24 hours later. To increase the homing of 293T cell exosomes to the liver, we decided to overexpress &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub>. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids coding the &#945;<sub>V<\/sub> and &#946;<sub>5<\/sub> subunits. After antibiotic and clonal selections, we obtained 293T cells stably overexpressing &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub> (8.9x vs. parental), and isolated exosomes contained the exogenous integrin. <i>In vitro<\/i>, the internalization of &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> exosomes was increased in RAW264.7 macrophages compared to exosomes from parental 293T cells. In mice, we confirmed that the overexpression of &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub> increases the homing of the exosomes to the liver (4.9x vs. parental) and that &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> exosomes preferentially home to the liver when compared to lungs, kidneys, and brain. To functionalize the exosomes, we chose to express, in 293T cells, anti-TGF-&#223; factors that could be directly loaded into their exosomes before their isolation. First, we transduced 293T cells to express the mRNA of a soluble form of betaglycan (sBG) that can neutralize TGF-&#223;. sBG mRNA was detected in 293T cells, their exosomes, and in RAW264.7 cells treated with these exosomes. Low levels of sBG protein could be detected in the conditioned media of treated RAW264.7, but it did not prevent SMAD2\/3 phosphorylation in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, which could be due to the low levels of sBG mRNA in the exosomes. Since larger RNAs have been reported to be less transferred into exosomes, we used 2 shRNA to knock down <i>Tgfb1<\/i>. Although both shTgfb1 could efficiently knock down <i>Tgfb1<\/i> in transduced cells, the exosomes of 293T cells expressing these shTgfb1 did not decrease <i>Tgfb1<\/i> levels in treated RAW264.7 cells. Overall, although the functionalization of exosomes to target TGF-&#223; remains to be achieved, our results show that &#945;<sub>V<\/sub>&#946;<sub>5<\/sub><sup>+<\/sup> exosomes are nanocarriers that could be used for liver-targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,Exosomes,Integrins,Liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Recently, heterobifunctional degraders have gained great interest as payloads, and degrader antibody conjugates (DACs) are seen as a novel therapeutic modality. Heterobifunctional degraders consist of a small molecule ligand that binds a target (protein of interest or POI), a spacer and an E3 ligase ligand, which can catalyze target degradation. Owing to their catalytic activity, degraders can have better potency than the equivalent inhibitors, making them suitable as ADC payload [1]. Degrader payloads can target a wider variety of mechanisms than classic payloads, which use the same antitumor strategies as chemotherapy, such as tubulin binding or topoisomerase inhibition.<br \/>Since many FDA-approved targeted therapies are based on the inhibition of protein kinases, we investigated degraders of these kinases as DAC payloads. Kinase DACs could bring enhanced targeting and therefore better therapeutic window to a field where classic ADC payloads have often shown substantial toxicities. As many heterobifunctional degraders show poor cell membrane penetration, their inhibitory potential could be increased as part of a DAC, where endocytic uptake is followed by intracellular release of the degrader payload.<br \/>To identify kinase degrader payloads, we present a workflow based on a platform called Energetically Privileged Ligands (EPriLs). EPriLs are macrocycle scaffolds that bind non-covalently in the kinase ATP pocket. Their unique binding mode avoids contacts with amino acid positions where resistance to kinase inhibitors frequently occurs. EPriL macrocycles can be decorated appropriately to rationally design specific inhibitors for many therapeutically relevant kinases, and provide synthetic handles to couple them to VHL or CRBN ligands to generate effective kinase degraders.<br \/>Here we describe how EPriL kinase degraders can be developed into effective DACs, using consecutive libraries of EPriL ligands, spacers, E3 ligase ligands and linkers. First, suitable degraders are identified, based on rapid and deep target degradation and potent antiproliferative activity on target cell lines. Degraders are then transformed into maleimide-linked degraders using convenient attachment of enzymatically cleavable linkers. In a medium throughput fashion, these maleimides are coupled to antibodies to generate DACs, which are tested for stability and biological potency. Applying this workflow to various well-validated kinase targets in oncology resulted in a promising kinase targeting DAC with favorable ADME properties, clear potentiation compared to the parent degrader, and increased selectivity for tumor cell lines.<br \/>1] Dragovich <i>et al<\/i>., Chem.

However, translation of these compounds has been held back by their limited bioavailability in target tissues. The aim of this study was to test the use of a novel cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-based delivery platform to enhance uptake of NAT into cancer cells. This platform consists of a highly efficient CPP that combines the advantages of multimerization and cyclization of the archetypal CPP, TAT peptide<sup>1<\/sup>, plus a photochemical (PC) strategy to promote endosomal release of NAT into the cytoplasm<sup>2<\/sup>. Negatively charged NATs form complexes with cationic CPPs through charge:charge interaction. NATs (siRNA or mRNA) were incubated with CPP at different molar ratios and assessed in gel retardation assays. Efficiency of internalization of Cy3-NAT:CPP complexes was evaluated using live cell confocal imaging with quantification of intracellular fluorescence. The mechanism of cellular uptake of NAT:CPP was investigated using inhibitors of endocytosis (chlorpromazine, NaN3, amiloride and methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin). To trigger NAT release from intracellular vesicles, 420 nm\/50 mA LED light irradiation was applied following pre-treatment of cells with a photosensitizer, fimaprofin. CPP-PC mediated internalization and endosomal release was used for delivery of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) siRNA. GAPDH enzymatic activity assays (Sigma, USA) were conducted to confirm inhibition of GAPDH in HeLa, HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells. Transfection efficiency of mRNA encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was evaluated by flow cytometry in HeLa cells. NAT:CPP complexes were found to be maximally efficient at a 10:1 molar ratio. Analysis of live cell confocal images indicated that GAPDH Cy3-siRNA:CPP complexes were more efficiently internalized compared to Cy3-siRNA + monomeric TAT or Cy3-siRNA + lipofectamine (****p&#60;0.0001, one-way ANOVA). The combined CPP-PC platform delivers NAT via a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. CPP-PC delivery of GAPDH siRNA caused marked GAPDH enzyme activity downregulation in HeLa (91%), MDA-MB-231 (51%) and HEK293T (44%) cells. These results were similar to the level of downregulation achieved with lipofectamine + GAPDH siRNA. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 52.4% of HeLa cells expressed eGFP at 1 h following delivery of mRNA-eGFP by CPP-PC. Functional siRNA and mRNA were efficiently delivered into the cytoplasm of cancer cells through combined use of a multimeric\/cyclized CPP plus photochemical-mediated endosomal release. This approach holds promise for clinical application, particularly in the treatment of intraluminal tumors. 1. Tietz, O. <i>et al.<\/i> Nat Chem.<i> 14: <\/i>284-93, 2022. 2. Selbo, P.

However, due to its extremely short half-life in the body caused by enzymatic degradation and poor pharmacokinetics, the I.V. dosage of administration is quite high i.e., &#62;1000 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for metastatic breast cancer treatment. Moreover, gemcitabine in combination with anthracyclines imparts synergy but free anthracyclines are reported to be associated with long term cardiac toxicity. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have provided a befitted solution for improving the poor pharmacokinetic properties and systemic toxicity caused by the chemo drugs because of their ability to improve bioavailability of the drugs at the desired site as well as overcoming multi-drug resistance (MDR).In the present work, PLA-based biodegradable block copolymeric nanoparticles have been employed to co-load Gemcitabine and Pirarubicin for improved anti-cancer activity. Gemcitabine and Pirarubicin have been chemically conjugated to the amphiphilic block copolymer mPEG PLA via a pH responsive Schiff&#8217;s Base linkage using a linker molecule Levulinic acid. The prepared PIRA\/GEM co-loaded nanoparticles exhibited an optimum size, zeta potential and polydispersity index i.e., 187 &#177; 3.5 nm, -10 &#177; 2.0 and &#60; 0.1 PDI respectively. Further, in the drug release experiments, these Nps displayed sustained and higher drug release in lysosomal pH (pH 5.0) than in the physiological buffer environment (pH 7.4) attributed to the pH sensitive bonding. The co-loaded Nps were prepared in multiple ratios (Pira: Gem - 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1) and investigated for <i>in-vitro<\/i> cellular inhibition studies in comparison to singly loaded drug Nps and corresponding free drug formulations in various breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, apoptotic studies revealed significant enhancement in synergistic activity in the case of PIRA\/GEM co-loaded Nps in comparison to conventional free drug formulations. In conclusion, this nano-formulation demonstrated excellent anti-cancer activity against breast cancer cells therefore it may be used as a potential candidate for therapeutic use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Gemcitabine,Pirarubicin,Nanoparticles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Thus, new tumor-targeting treatment strategies are desperately needed. In a previous study, we dissected human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC cell differentiation via cornification and detected an epigenetically determined loss of cell malignancy. Analyzing the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of HNSCC cells may identify targets for anti-tumor therapy. Using patient-derived tumor cells, we created an HNSCC differentiation model in HPV+ tumor cells. Similar to HPV- cells, we observed a loss of malignant characteristics in HPV+ cell cultures in differentiating cell culture conditions including irregular enlarged cell morphology, cell cycle arrest with downregulation of Ki67, and reduced cell viability. Even though cornification was detected in HPV+ tumor cell cultures and HPV+ FFPE tumor tissue sections, cornification was not induced during HPV+ cell differentiation. Instead, RNA-seq and subsequent Gene Ontology analysis showed myocyte-like differentiation with upregulation of markers of myofibril assembly including TPM1, TAGLN, and ACTA1. Immunofluorescence staining of differentiated and undifferentiated primary HPV+ HNSCC cells confirmed an upregulation of these markers and the formation of parallel actin fibers, reminiscent of myoblast-lineage cells. Moreover, multi-marker immunofluorescence analysis of HPV+ tumor tissue sections revealed areas of cells co-expressing the identified markers of myofibril assembly, HPV surrogate marker p16, and stress-associated basal keratinocyte marker KRT17, indicating that the observed myocyte-like differentiation observed in vitro also occurred in human tissue. Normal tissue displayed a co-expression of TPM1, TAGLN, and ACTA1 in differentiating keratinocytes between the basal cell layer and the fully differentiated corneocytes. This shows that the expression of myocyte-lineage markers is reflected in differentiating non-malignant mucosal tissue. Our study suggests that the targeted differentiation of tumor cells might be therapeutically valuable in HPV+ HNSCCs as well.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-04 Differentiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Differentiation,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

We have developed an anti-TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate, DXC1002, that contains a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I payload (CPT113) attached to the antibody mainly in the Fab region via a unique hydrophilic CrossConju&#8482; linker. The anti-tumor activities of DXC1002 were studied in various human cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models and pharmacokinetic profile of DXC1002 were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys and rats. DXC1002 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in TROP2 tumor cells of various expression levels in vitro, and at low dose of 1 mg\/kg for one injection, in both high and moderate Trop2 expression xenograft models. In plasma stability studies, wherein DXC1002 was incubated in the plasma of five different species for 168 hours (7 days) at 37 oC, over 90% ADC was intact, exhibiting good stability of the CrossConju&#8482; linker. Pharmacokinetic studies of DXC1002 in monkeys (TROP2 cross-species) and rats (non-TROP2 cross-species) showed half-lives of about 61.27 and 236.77 hours, respectively. Systemic clearance in monkey and rat was 0.41-0.67 and 0.279-0.309 mL\/h\/kg, respectively. The longer half-lives and slower clearance observed in rats the results offered a more direct assessment of the linker stability as target-mediated clearance played no role in rats. In summary, with the conjugation of a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor payload to Trop2 antibody via the CrossConju&#8482; linker, DXC1002 demonstrates remarkable anti-tumor properties and pharmacokinetic profile, with a potential to be further validated in clinical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Pharmacokinetics,Trop-2,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Huihui Guo<sup><\/sup>, Xiangfei Kong<sup><\/sup>, Yong Du<sup><\/sup>, Zhicang Ye<sup><\/sup>, Yongxiang Chen<sup><\/sup>, Zhixiang Guo<sup><\/sup>, Lingli Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Lu Bai<sup><\/sup>, Junxiang Jia<sup><\/sup>, Yunxia Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wenjun Li<sup><\/sup>, Yuanyuan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Zhongliang Fan<sup><\/sup>, Mengmeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, Binbin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Meng Dai<sup><\/sup>, Juan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Miaomiao Chen<sup><\/sup>, Qingliang Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Robert Y.

However, the selection of combinations of an optimum target, antibody, payload, linker as well conjugation, to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy without excessive toxicity, still presents a significant challenge. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitors such as camptothecin (CPT) analogs represent the much success in ADC payload applications as two CPT analog-ADCs, trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a&#8212;Enhertu&#174;) with Dxd payload and sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy<sup>TM<\/sup>) with SN38 payload have been approved and over 20 CPT analog-ADCs are in the clinical trials now. Topo I inhibitors trigger cell apoptosis through their specific binding at the DNA-topoisomerase interface, leading to the inhibition of DNA supercoiling and entanglement, resulting in DNA damage and cell death. This class of payloads in ADCs has demonstrated more wider therapeutic windows in clinical trials than regular antitubulin payloads, such as maytansine and MMAE, based ADCs. Here, we detail the discovery of CPT analogs, as payloads with a branch hydrophilic linker and site-specific conjugation for ADCs designed to have a widened therapeutic window compared with Dxd-GGFG linked ADCs. The CPT analogs based on the core structure of SN-38, wherein the hydrogen of C-11 was replaced with fluorine, and the hydroxyl group of C-10 was optionally replaced with an amino or a ether group. Many of the novel CPT analogs were at single to tens of pM of IC<sub>50<\/sub> potency in vitro against several tested tumor cell lines, and some were more potent than Exatecan in the comparison tests. The ADCs constructed with branch hydrophilic linkers and the CrossConju<sup>TM<\/sup> technology of chemically site-specific conjugation at Fab region of an antibody through C-10 position of the CPT payloads either with amide bond, either bond or carbamide bonds, or through C-20 position of the CPT payloads with carbamide or carbonate bonds, exhibited much better antitumor efficacy in vivo CDX tumor models, while having higher or similar MTDs in mice toxicity study in comparison with the ADC constructed with GGFG-Dxd, demonstrated wider therapeutic widows than that conjugated with GGFG-Dxd. Moreover, some of the constructed ADCs can overcomes <i>in vitro<\/i>- and <i>in vivo<\/i>-acquired resistance of commercial therapeutic drugs. Herein, we showcase our platform approach in CPT-ADC designs and constructions and can be thereby broadly applicable to construction of various CPT-ADCs for targeted treatment of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Drug design,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yuanyuan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Hangbo Ye<sup><\/sup>, Qingliang Yang<sup><\/sup>, Lingli Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Huihui Guo<sup><\/sup>, Xiaolei Liu<sup><\/sup>, Wenjun Li<sup><\/sup>, Lu Bai<sup><\/sup>, Junxiang Jia<sup><\/sup>, Juan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiangfei Kong<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Yifang Xu<sup><\/sup>, Gengxiang Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Linyao Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Xiang Cai<sup><\/sup>, Ziyu Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Hui Xia<sup><\/sup>, Xia Zhou<sup><\/sup>, You Zhou<sup><\/sup>, <b>Robert Y.

A Steap1 antibody called Vandortuzumab conjugated with MMAE (DSTP3086S) was in the clinical phase I trial for treating STEAP1-expressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and showed acceptable safety at 2.4 mg\/kg once every 3 weeks. However, many patients are nonresponsive to DSTP3086S due to low target expression levels and common treatment-related AEs which were caused by MMAE payloads. DXC008 was generated through screening the therapeutical index in vitro of conjugates of an anti-Steap1 antibody with varieties of payloads of tubulysin B analogs through function peptide spacer linkers. The generated DXC008 exhibited not only good affinity for Steap1 but also moderate affinity for Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) which is as well specifically overexpressed in most prostate cancer with limited expression in normal tissue. DXC008 demonstrated couple tens to a hundred of picomolar concentration (pM) of potency against several prostate tumor cells and over 60% internalization rate within 90 min in vitro. And in vivo it showed very good durable antitumor response as low dose as 1 mg\/kg one injection in both high and moderate of both Steap1 and PSMA expression xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic profiles of DXC008 were favorable and the safety of Maximal Tolerable Dose (MTD) was over 120 mg\/kg in single injection in mice.
