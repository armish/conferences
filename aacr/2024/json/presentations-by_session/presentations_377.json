[{"Abstract":"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer and there is a critical unmet need to develop novel therapies. The transcription factor, PAX8, is upregulated in ~80% of renal, ovarian, endometrial and thyroid tumors and its overexpression correlates with higher risk of death and recurrence. PAX8 represents a promising target because of its high specificity and low expected toxicity, but how it promotes tumorigenesis remains elusive. Using proximity labeling followed by mass spectrometry, we identified a list of PAX8 binding partners and have further confirmed these interactions at the genomic level through ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. Our findings reveal novel PAX8 interactions and a potential therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Ovarian cancer,Protein-protein interactions,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Among regulatory elements, activities of enhancers that are bound by cell-type specific transcription factors (TFs) are tightly linked to cell identity. Enhancers loop to interact with the promoters of target genes at a distance to drive different cell fates. Evidently, transcriptional dysregulation linked to enhancers that are differentially activated in cancer is an underlying factor in tumorigenesis. To identify enhancers linked to prostate tumorigenesis, we analyzed hundreds of in-house and public H3K27ac ChIP-seq data generated from normal prostate and prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. We identified thousands of prostate cancer-specific enhancers (PSEs) that were activated exclusively in cancer conditions. To further identify the target genes of PSEs, we performed 3C-derived assays, such as Hi-C and Micro-C, and mapped genome-wide interactions. However, they were limited by the resolution to detect enhancer-promoter interactions. The recent development of Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC), a hybridization-based capture Micro-C method, allowed us to deeply map the highly nested interactions between regulatory elements. By utilizing RCMC, we generated high-resolution, focal contact maps that revealed comprehensive enhancer-promoter interactions near PSEs in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that PSEs loop to other PSEs clustered in the proximal genomic region, in addition to promoters of significantly upregulated genes in cancer compared to normal cells. We termed these regions as multi-connected \"3D enhancer-promoter hubs&#8221;. To mechanistically dissect these hubs, we deleted 5+ PSEs one by one using the CRISPR\/Cas9 system and performed multi-omics analyses, including RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. We found that single deletions of a subset of PSEs led to the downregulation of multiple genes looped to the deleted PSE as well as to other PSEs. Moreover, we found that deletion reduced the activity of other connected PSEs. When we further evaluated the chromatin contacts of regulatory elements in the PSE-deleted cells, we observed that many chromatin contacts remained unaffected. Finally, we identified TFs that bind to PSEs, and we are currently in the process of investigating enhancer-promoter hub connectivity by performing knockdown experiments on these TFs. Furthermore, we are using molecular assays to identify PSEs that could exert a phenotypic shift in cancer cell identity to drive prostate tumorigenesis. Overall, our study not only provides mechanistic insights into the spatial regulation of 3D enhancer-promoter hubs but also identifies new non-coding drivers in prostate tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Enhancer-promoter hub,Prostate tumorigenesis,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Disrupting this balance can lead to the development of deadly blood cancers, like acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Increasing evidence suggests that acquiring hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene expression programs in AML confers a particularly poor prognosis and increases risk of relapse with conventional therapy. Acquisition of these features in AML is commonly driven by dysregulation of MECOM, a transcription factor and master regulator of HSC self-renewal. To define the role of MECOM in AMLs,&nbsp;we engineered cell-line models of high-risk AML by endogenously tagging MECOM with an FKBP12<sup>F36V<\/sup> degron. These models enable targeted degradation of MECOM which we employed in concert with multi-omic readouts to assess changes in nascent transcription and chromatin accessibility to identify direct transcriptional targets of MECOM. We demonstrate that MECOM degradation results in a rapid increase in chromatin accessibility at MECOM-bound sites and increased expression of cognate genes to establish a pro-differentiation gene program. These findings suggest a previously unappreciated mechanism for MECOM in repressing differentiation-promoting cis-regulatory elements (cisREs) and their cognate target genes in AML. We then employed a pooled CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen to functionally characterize the role that each cisRE plays in promoting high-risk features in AML. Utilizing CRISPRi to repress MECOM-bound cisREs in concert with dTAG-mediated MECOM degradation, we examined if repression of over 500 individual MECOM-bound cisREs is sufficient to maintain AML progenitors in the absence of MECOM. This functional dissection revealed that the individual repression of three cisREs that regulate <i>CEBPA, GFI1B, and RUNX1<\/i> is sufficient to maintain AML progenitor cells in the absence of MECOM. This result implicates MECOM as a direct repressor of known regulators of myeloid differentiation. Given these findings, we hypothesized that small molecule-based recruitment of a transcriptional coactivator to MECOM could rewire its repressive function to activate myeloid differentiation and subsequent leukemia cell death. To test this approach, we treated a MECOM-FKBP12<sup>F36V<\/sup> AML degron model with the bifunctional small molecule NICE-01 (AP1867-PEG2-JQ1) to recruit an epigenetic activator (BRD4) to MECOM to functionally rewire this transcriptional network. NICE-01 treatment induced significant differentiation of AML progenitor cells relative to JQ1 treatment alone. Our work highlights the utility of targeted protein degradation to mechanistically interrogate the function of a key driver of high-risk AMLs and suggests the potential for small molecule-rewiring of stem cell gene regulatory networks to confer therapeutic benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Transcription factor,Stem cells,Gene regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

We previously showed that the nuclear coactivator SRC-1 promoted colorectal cancer (CRC) progression by enhancing CRC cell viability; however, the role of SRC-1 in CRC immune escape is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that SRC-1 was positively correlated with PD-L1 in human CRC specimens. SRC-1 deficiency significantly inhibited PD-L1 expression in both human and murine CRC cells and retarded murine CRC growth in subcutaneous grafts by enhancing CRC immune escape via increasing tumor infiltration and antitumor activity of effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Genetic ablation of SRC-1 in mice also decreased PD-L1 expression in AOM\/DSS-induced murine CRC. These results suggest that tumor-derived SRC-1 promotes CRC immune escape by enhancing PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, SRC-1 activated JAK-STAT signaling by inhibiting SOCS1 expression and coactivated STAT3 and IRF1 to enhance PD-L1 transcription as well as stabilized PD-L1 protein by inhibiting proteasome-dependent degradation mediated by speckle type POZ protein (SPOP). Pharmacological inhibition of SRC-1 improved the antitumor effect of PD-L1 antibody in both subcutaneous graft and AOM\/DSS-induced murine CRC models. Taken together, our findings highlight a crucial role of SRC-1 in facilitating CRC immune escape and targeting SRC-1 in combination with PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy may be an attractive strategy for CRC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Immunotherapy,PD-L1,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

These unique epigenetic features promoted the progression of T<sub>EX<\/sub>, hindered reinvigoration of T<sub>EX<\/sub> state and controlled the abnormal expression of inhibitor receptors (IRs), which could serve as target sites in cancer treatment. Thus, deciphering the regulatory elements in primary human T cells will deeply reveal the mechanism controlling T<sub>EX<\/sub> and provide novel therapeutic strategies to promote clinical response. However, how enhancers can be effectively applied in anti-cancer treatment is still poorly understood because high throughput identifying the functional enhancers of inhibitor receptors at scale is technically limited in human T cells. Here, we first developed a pooled screening platform that employs a compact CRISPRi system and enabled efficient one-step delivery of pooled screening libraries to primary human T cells. Leveraging this platform, we screened large genomic regions (~300kb) at saturation around key T<sub>EX<\/sub> genes, two IRs&#8212;<i>PDCD1<\/i>, <i>HAVCR2<\/i> and one transcription factor (TF)&#8212;<i>TBX21 <\/i>to interrogate functional enhancers in human primary CD8 T cells. We identified two enhancers for <i>PDCD1<\/i>, three enhancers for <i>HAVCR2<\/i> and three enhancers for <i>TBX21<\/i>, all of which are located over 12kb away from each gene&#8217;s transcription start sites. Then, to parse the essential sequences that fulfill enhancer function, we employed Cas9-based in-situ saturation mutagenesis screening to the identified enhancers of <i>PDCD1<\/i> and <i>HAVCR2<\/i>. We found disrupt essential sequences impaired the entire enhancer function, quantitatively phenocopied the effect of targeting the entire enhancer with CRISPRi. Transcription factor motifs analyses of these sequences revealed potential regulation of ZFX for controlling <i>PDCD1<\/i> expression and STAT for <i>HAVCR2<\/i> expression. Finally, we explored the functional consequences of applying enhancers to anti-cancer treatment. Indeed, targeting the identified enhancers of <i>PDCD1<\/i> and <i>HAVCR2<\/i> in CAR T cells lead to enhanced cancer cell killing efficiency in vitro.

Adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine lineage transition is an emergent mechanism of targeted therapy resistance in several cancer types, including lung and prostate cancer. Therefore, understanding the dynamics and mechanisms driving neuroendocrine cell fates in cancer is critical. Mucinous colorectal cancer accounts for upwards of 20% of colorectal cancer cases and is characterized by tumors with mucous accounting for at least 50% of the tumor volume. The normal colon epithelium consists of several specialized cell types, including hormone secreting enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are the neuroendocrine cell of the intestine. We have previously shown that EEC progenitors are enriched in mucinous colorectal cancer and promote cancer cell survival via secreted factors. Additionally, we have shown that lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) promotes EEC differentiation in these tumors; however, the mechanism by which LSD1 promotes EEC differentiation has remained unknown. Typically to carry out its enzymatic function, LSD1 must be a part of a transcriptional regulatory complex. One such complex is the CoREST complex, which contains LSD1, HDAC1, and one of three CoREST protein family members. Here we report that LSD1 and CoREST2 promote EEC differentiation by demethylating the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to promote STAT3 chromatin binding. Additionally, we demonstrate that knocking down CoREST2 decreases tumor growth and lung metastases of mucinous colorectal cancer cells injected orthotopically into the colons of immunocompromised mice. Furthermore, we utilized single cell multi-omics that combines single cell RNA sequencing with single cell ATAC sequencing to show that during EEC differentiation there is an increase in chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions of known EEC-promoting transcription factors. Finally, through our single cell multi-omics analysis we identify a new rare cell type with neuron-like but not secretory characteristics. Mucinous colorectal cancer is an aggressive and chemotherapeutically intractable form of CRC that is enriched for EEC progenitors. Our data demonstrates that LSD1 and STAT3 promote EEC differentiation, suggesting that inhibiting LSD1 and or STAT3 may have benefits for patients with mucinous colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LSD1,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Lineage TFs like IRF4 are difficult to drug but represent high value oncology targets owing to the depth and context selectivity of their genetic dependency. Using a transcription regulatory network (TRN) based approach to integrate a high dimensional multi-platform dataset, we defined the key regulatory activity of IRF4 and its druggable co-factors. This unbiased analysis identified p300 lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) function as the nearest selective neighbor for therapeutic intervention, with more potent and selective effects than historically observed with p300\/CBP bromodomain inhibitors.<br \/>To further probe this biology, we developed a highly selective inhibitor of the KAT domain of p300 and its close homolog CBP. p300 KAT inhibition led to selective downregulation of IRF4 at the mRNA and protein level as well as reduction in acetylation at highly specific sites co-localized with IRF4, in contrast to more general agents like BET inhibitors. Gene expression reduction was most pronounced at IRF4\/p300 co-bound genes, in particular IRF4 itself and MYC. IRF4 and p300 also directly bind to each other and other key MM nodes regulating them at the chromatin, mRNA, and protein levels.<br \/>p300 KAT inhibition exhibits strong antiproliferative activity across <i>in vitro <\/i>MM models regardless of cytogenetics or resistance to other therapies. Moreover, this relationship is mediated by the KAT domain and not its acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain. Comparative pharmacology studies found that a p300 KAT inhibitor downregulated the IRF4 TRN and induced apoptosis in MM cells more effectively than existing standard of care agents, including IMiDs and glucocorticoid receptor agonists, or p300\/CBP bromodomain inhibitors.

Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic disease, making current treatments insufficient. As a result, the 5-year survival rate for PDAC is below 10%.Pancreatic neoplasms are primarily initiated by the KRAS mutation, accounting for 95% of cases. However, the progression of PDAC to a highly aggressive and therapy-resistant cancer is accelerated by chronic inflammation. The role of mutant KRAS signaling and NF-&#954;B inflammatory signaling in promoting PDAC progression has been extensively studied. Yet, the transcriptional mechanism of their cooperation remains unclear. Additionally, the interaction between PDAC tumor cells and signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not yet fully understood. Our study demonstrates that the simultaneous activation of KRAS\/MAPK and NF-&#954;B by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TNF&#945;, respectively, increases cell migration as shown through live-cell imaging analysis. An integrated analysis of epigenetic and transcriptomic data (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq) was performed after dual stimulation of both pathways. This revealed a high occupancy of the active mark, H3K27ac at transcription start sites of a subset of genes involved in cell migration and subtype switch. Through gain and loss-of-function studies, FOSL1 and RELA were identified as the key transcription factors. The epigenome mapping of FOSL1 and RELA after the stimulation of both pathways revealed their occupancy at RELA-dominant and FOSL1\/RELA co-occupied regions. Inhibitor treatments and loss-of-function studies revealed that RELA binding controls RNA polymerase recruitment for transcription initiation and enhances cell migration. Further analysis of RNA-seq data on PDAC cell lines and cells from patient-derived xenografts highlighted that active inflammatory signaling contributes to a subtype switch from the classical to the more migratory basal subtype. Our study, combined with single-cell RNA-seq analysis of published data, shows that macrophages in the tumor microenvironment supply TNF&#945; that activates NF-&#954;B signaling, leading to changes in cell migration. Our study has provided a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which mutant KRAS and inflammatory signaling contribute to the progression of PDAC. These findings could offer a new perspective in the development of mechanism-based therapeutic approaches that can improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and make tumors more amenable to surgical resection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene regulation,Epigenetics,Cell signaling,Cell migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Despite the known progression from NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and eventually HCC, the genetic underpinnings driving this transition remain underexplored. A comprehensive genomics assessment was conducted, encompassing a genome-wide study of variants linked to body fat distribution in 344,369 individuals. Correlating these, significant variants associated with NASH and HCC were discerned in a cohort of 1,009 participants from the NCI-UMD study. Candidate variants underwent further eQTL analysis. Our investigation unveiled the rs3747579-TT variant emerged as significantly associated with NASH-related HCC, serving as an eQTL for mitochondrial DNAJA3. HCC patients harboring this variant presented with diminished DNAJA3 expression, correlating with an unfavorable prognosis. Exploration into the 3D genome architecture has identified potential chromatin topology sites that may influence the regulation of DNAJA3 by rs3747579. Specifically, enhancer loops exhibit allele-specific interactions with rs3747579 in the regulation of DNAJA3. Notably, the rs3747579-CC variant was found to interact with RBFOX2. Beyond its known RNA splicing functions, RBFOX2 might have implications in the chromatin landscape, influencing chromatin dynamics and gene transcription. RBFOX2 knockdown experiments showcased significantly reduced DNAJA3 expression, and luciferase assays highlighted increased activity for the rs3747579-CC allele versus its TT counterpart. In summary, our findings spotlight the rs3747579-TT variant as a potential oncogenic factor in DNAJA3, elucidating its role in the genesis of NASH and progression to HCC. This understanding could pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions in HCC stemming from NAFLD\/NASH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,SNP,Carcinogenesis,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The key element of our cancer-activated construct that drives specificity and sensitivity of expression is a promoter sequence, synthetically engineered to leverage transcription factors (TFs) activated in cancer pathways. Acting as a molecular sensor for dysregulated TF levels, the DNA construct expresses a measurable biomarker in cancer cells, while remaining transcriptionally silent in normal adjacent tissues and benign lesions. Previously, we described a multiomics factor analysis (MOFA) to interrogate 200 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal adjacent tissue samples comprised of RNA-seq based transcriptional profiling, and MS-based proteomics and phospho-proteomics from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) dataset, and generated a list of top TFs dysregulated in NSCLC. In this study, we show the capability to design, engineer, and test cancer specific activity of combinations of response elements using a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) high-throughput pooled screening (HTS) method. More than 2,000 unique sequences of homotypic or heterotypic TF binding sites corresponding to the top 100 TFs were arrayed with diverse spacing and individually barcoded for the high-throughput screens in NSCLC cell lines. To validate our top hits, we individually tested 10 sequences from the top 25% and 8 sequences from the bottom 25%. Nine of the top sequences produced signals 5-10X higher than the background, whereas only one of the eight bottom sequences produced signal higher than the background. We have individually validated 30 different response elements and found that 28 of 30 drove the expected expression, with the majority of response elements (n=20) showing expression 5-10X higher than background. Remarkably, two of the engineered response elements were able to drive expression 20-30X higher in a specific cell line activated by WNT-signaling, suggesting that these response elements can sense specific cancer dysregulated pathways. Our lead response elements are being tested across a broad range of <i>in vitro<\/i> primary tumor lines with diverse genetic backgrounds and transcriptional profiles prior to <i>in vivo<\/i> testing using our imaging platform to distinguish malignant lung nodules. In summary, we have established a robust screening platform to identify response elements that can be activated by cancer dysregulated pathways. We are currently expanding this platform to other cancer models and indications, and leveraging this to explore more complex response elements that use combinations of TFs and natural spacing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Lung cancer,Imaging,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

However, the genomic and epigenomic determinants of phase-separated transcriptional condensate formation remain poorly understood. Questions regarding which TFs tend to associate with transcriptional condensates and what factors influence their association are largely unanswered. Here we systematically analyzed 528 DNA sequence motifs across the human genome and 6,650 TF binding profiles across different cell types to identify the molecular features contributing to the formation of transcriptional condensates. We found that the genomic distributions of sequence motifs for different TFs exhibit distinct clustering tendencies. Notably, TF motifs with a high genomic clustering tendency are significantly associated with super-enhancers. TF binding profiles showing a high genomic clustering tendency are further enriched at cell-type-specific super-enhancers. TFs with a high binding clustering tendency also possess high liquid-liquid phase separation abilities. Compared to non-clustered TF binding, densely clustered TF binding sites are more enriched at cell-type-specific super-enhancers with higher chromatin accessibility, elevated chromatin interaction, and stronger association with cancer outcomes. Our results indicate that the clustered genomic binding patterns and the phase separation properties of TFs collectively contribute to the formation of transcriptional condensates at cancer super-enhancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Transcription factor,Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Z.

Additionally, it is known to be upregulated in various types of cancer and is associated with a decrease in patient survival rates. However, the mechanism of how chromatin remodelers including ACTL6A cause cell death has yet to be defined. Therefore, we would like to investigate how the depletion of ACTL6A promotes cell growth reduction by mediating changes in the epigenetic landscape in colorectal cancer cells. We engineered ACTL6A knockout by CRISPR-Cas9. We performed Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for SMARCB1 and INO80, as representative members of their respective families, and KLF4. Moreover, HCT116 cells stably transduced with doxycycline-inducible shGFP or shACTL6A were implanted into the flank of nude mice. One week after tumor implantation, mice were randomly allocated to 4 groups (n=13-15 per group) and doxycycline treated group was administered with doxycycline (1mg\/ml) and 5% sucrose in the drinking water. Tumor volume was measured with calipers. Upon depletion of ACTL6A, the regions of increased chromatin accessibility were correlated with the upregulated genes. After the loss of ACTL6A, there was a significant increase in KLF4 expression and genomic binding largely increased, coinciding with an increase in newly accessible regions containing KLF4 motifs. Interestingly, there is a strong positive correlation between changes in chromatin accessibility and overall changes in the binding of KLF4, SWI\/SNF, and INO80 complexes. We find that changes in chromatin accessibility are co-regulated by KLF4, the SWI\/SNF and the INO80 complex, while SWI\/SNF and INO80 complex have a low correlation in binding between the SWI\/SNF and INO80 complexes at newly accessible regions, indicating no physical interactions between these two chromatin complexes. Overall, we demonstrated that the redistribution of ACTL6A-deficient two chromatin remodeling complexes and KLF4 is associated with changes in chromatin accessibility, which are also linked to upregulated genes that promote the p53 pathway. These findings revealed the role of KLF4 along with the SWI\/SNF and INO80 complexes, in regulating the chromatin landscape and gene expression in ACTL6A-depleted colorectal cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Cancer epigenetics,Colorectal cancer,ACTL6A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-J.

The enhanced infiltration of stromal tissue of PCa tumor microenvironment limits the identification of key tumor-specific transcription factors and epigenomic abnormalities in malignant epithelial cells. Integrated transcriptome and epigenetic multi-omics analysis of paired PCa organoids indicated that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 40 (BHLHE40) was significantly upregulated in tumor samples. Increased chromatin accessibility at promoter region and enhanced mTOR pathway activity contribute to the elevated expression of BHLHE40. Integrated analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, RNA-seq and high-through chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data together with chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay indicate that BHLHE40 not only regulates the sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription as a classic transcription factor, but also links the enhancer and promoter regions of SREBF1 via forming liquid-liquid phase-separated droplets. Then, we find the BHLHE40-SREBF1-stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) axis protects PCa cells from ferroptosis, leading to the reduced accumulation of lipid peroxidation in cells. Moreover, SREBF1 inhibitor, Fatostatin, significantly suppresses the cell growth of PCa tumors with higher expression of BHLHE40.

These folding mechanisms have been shown to regulate several genomic functions, including gene expression. However, how transcription might regulate the chromatin structure remains a subject of many ongoing investigations. In this study, we use the Integrator protein complex as a tool to understand the impact of aberrant transcription on the 3D structure of the genome. During transcription initiation, RNA Polymerase-II (Pol-II) often pauses proximally to the promoter before further elongating transcripts. The Integrator protein complex regulates this checkpoint by its endonuclease and phosphatase activity. This protein complex is essential in premature transcription termination in hundreds of protein-coding genes. It also facilitates the synthesis of non-coding (ncRNA), such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have been shown to support loop extrusion domains, and their absence may disrupt these domains. Using HiC sequencing, we found that depleting Integrator proteins can interfere with forming and maintaining loop domains. This study aims to be the first to decipher the relationship between chromosome structure and Integrator protein activity and address our very little knowledge of how misregulation of transcription termination may influence the folding of chromosomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Transcription,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Pioneer factors, which can activate silent chromatin by binding to nucleosomes in closed (inactive) chromatin regions, thereby increasing chromatin accessibility, are essential in multiple developmental pathways. Their misregulation has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer. Yet, the involvement of pioneer factor mutations in tumorigenesis and tumor progression remains largely unexplored. GATA3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer. We and other groups found that a subset of GATA3 mutations promote tumor growth by redirecting luminal transcriptional network governed by Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER-alpha), FOXA1, and GATA3. Our genomics data also suggested that GATA3 requires multiple co-factors to maintain and establish active enhancers. Through IP-mass spectrometry, we identified several chromatin remodeling factors as potential GATA3 binding partners, with CHD4 being particularly notable. Our genomic data, including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq, suggest that during GATA3-induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), CHD4 plays a critical role in maintaining closed chromatin structure, particularly at enhancer regions. Depletion of CHD4 results in the activation of chromatin and genes that are not essential for successful MET. Furthermore, we observed functional interactions between GATA3 and PARP1 in both luminal and basal breast cancer cells, with notable changes in GATA3 mutant cells. Through these studies, we aim to uncover epigenetic vulnerabilities in GATA3-altered breast cancer cells, ultimately contributing to the development of new breast cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Breast cancer,Chromatin remodeling,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In contrast to localized disease, metastatic prostate cancer tumor is incurable. Progression to metastatic disease is characterized by tumor heterogeneity and plasticity regulated by epigenetic changes of tumor cells. While tumor heterogeneity is often associated with gene mutations, tumor plasticity is ascribed to transcriptional regulation and chromatin activity. The latter is modulated by treatment of prostate cancer leading to treatment resistance. Here, we identified a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer by an actin regulatory and signaling protein, Abelson Interactor 1 (ABI1).<br \/>Methods: To demonstrate the ABI1-DNA binding, we employed in vitro binding assays, NMR spectroscopy, and ChIP-seq. from cells expressing alternatively spliced isoforms of ABI1 that contain or lack the DNA binding HHR domain. To determine the ABI1 interactions with several transcriptional factors, we used immunoprecipitation and\/or proximity ligation assay (PLA). We used ATAC sequencing to determine the chromatin accessibility in the presence or absence of ABI1 gene. RNA-seq established the activity of transcriptional factors and signaling pathways regulated by ABI1.<br \/>Results: Using NMR spectroscopy, we established that ABI1 demonstrated DNA binding dependent on the presence of alternatively spliced Exon 4. Exon 4 is located within the homeobox homology region (HHR). The DNA binding activity was confirmed using in vitro binding assays; the assay results confirmed the role of ABI1 HHR. Moreover, cells lacking ABI1 or expressing ABI1 lacking Exon 4 show low accessibility and activity of chromatin. In contrast, cells expressing ABI1 containing Exon 4 show active chromatin. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that ABI1 regulated transcription in an Exon 4-dependent manner.<br \/>Conclusions: We uncovered a role of ABI1 in chromatin stability, that is dependent on the presence of the DNA binding region. Notably, ABI1's contribution to transcriptional activity occurs via a transient yet precisely defined interaction between its intrinsically disordered region and DNA. This regulatory control plays a pivotal role in managing tumor plasticity by establishing connections between the actin cytoskeleton, cellular signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Based on these findings, we propose that ABI1 functions as an epigenetic regulator, maintaining transcriptional homeostasis in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Transcriptional regulation,DNA binding,Cell Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

R-loops, described as three-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of a DNA:RNA hybrid and a non-template single-stranded DNA, are assemblies often attributed with pathological consequences like genomic instability and replication stress. However, they have significant physiological roles, inter alia, regulation of transcription initiation, splicing and termination. Loss in R-loop resolution factors (like RNaseH nucleases, senataxin) can result in &#8220;unscheduled&#8221; or &#8220;pathological&#8221; R-loops, which can compromise genome stability. R-loops are commonly associated with an active transcription bubble, with nascent RNA trailing the RNA polymerase re-annealing to the template DNA strand. Increased transcriptional stress can lead to accumulation of R-loops. In a 2016 eLife study by Stork et al., estrogen induction resulted in concomitantly increased transcription and R-loop formation in the same subset of genes. Similar to estrogen induction, activation of the NRF2\/KEAP1 pathway upon oxidative stress causes NRF2 to be released from KEAP1 and enter the nucleus to turn on transcription of its target genes. Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1, encoded by the <i>KEAP1<\/i> gene, is a canonical binding partner of NRF2. Under basal conditions, KEAP1 binds NRF2 and targets it for degradation. Mutations in <i>KEAP1<\/i> and epigenetic modifications have been reported in lung and breast cancer phenotypes. In lieu of chemical manipulation, NRF2 can be activated by knocking down KEAP1 via RNAi. We therefore asked whether transcription activation downstream of the NRF2\/KEAP1 pathway can lead to accumulation of R-loops.We have observed the consequences of depleting KEAP1 (for NRF2 activation) with RNAi on global transcription using ethynyl uridine (EU) incorporation with click-iT chemistry and flow cytometry, on R-loop levels using S9.6 antibody immunocytochemistry and on transcriptional profile changes with RNA-seq. We observe that loss of KEAP1 leads to an increased accumulation of R-loops. Surprisingly, this is not accompanied by an expected increase in transcription as measured quantitatively with EU flow cytometry. This phenomenon was found to consistently occur in various cell lines across cancer types (breast, lung). Interestingly, depleting NRF2 cannot mitigate the effects of KEAP1 loss, suggesting that KEAP1 loss-associated R-loop formation is independent of NRF2 activation. Analysis of RNA-seq data shows that TOP2 is downregulated in KEAP1 deficient cells. As TOP2 has been previously known to regulate R-loop formation, we predict that KEAP1 loss can sensitize cells to topoisomerase inhibitors.In conclusion, interaction of KEAP1 with other players in its interactome outside of NRF2 may regulate R-loop formation and therefore R-loop-induced genome instability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,R-loops,Keap1,Topoisomerase II,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

The mammalian BAF complexes (also known as SWI\/SNF) are important regulators of <i>MYC <\/i>and the cell cycle. There are three BAF complexes (cBAF, ncBAF and pBAF) that share several subunits. SMARCA2 and 4 are mutually exclusive ATPase subunits within the BAF complexes that use ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity to remodel chromatin via nucleosome sliding and removal. PBRM1 is a SMARCA4 associated factor present in pBAF. The association of SMARCA4 with regulatory elements of transcription factors makes it an intriguing target for AML. To evaluate the role of SMARC2\/4 in AML, we analyzed RNA transcripts from highly purified primary AML initiating populations and control samples. Sorted leukemia stem cells (Lin-ve, CD34+, CD38-) overexpressed SMARCA2\/4 when compared to healthy cells. A novel and highly selective SMARCA2\/4 and PBRM1 PROTAC degrading agent AU-15330 was used to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of targeting BAF complexes as well as the role of SMARCA2\/4 in leukemic pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate that AU-15330 effectively degrades SMARCA2\/4 and PBRM1 in human leukemia cell lines with varying mutational profiles; MV4-11 was the most sensitive cell line. When evaluating healthy CD34+ HSPCs as well as patient derived AML cells in colony assays, AU-15330 treatment increased differentiation in patient AML samples with minimal effects on healthy CD34+ cells. A xenograft of patient derived AML cells in irradiated mice was performed to determine the requirement of SMARCA2\/4 in leukemia stem cell maintenance. Mice treated with AU-15330 had greater myeloid differentiation, fewer human cells in their bone marrows and reduced leukemia stem cell activity, seen in secondary transplants. To understand the underlying mechanism of how SMARCA2\/4 and PBRM1 promote leukemic pathogenesis, we used a multi-omic analysis of transcription and chromatin dynamics in MV4-11 cells: ATAC-seq and RNA-seq identified downregulated genes with decreased accessibility, PRO-seq determined early transcriptional changes and HiChIP showed changes in enhancer promoter loops with SMARC2\/4 degradation. Several leukemia related transcription factors as well as inflammatory genes were identified from these analyses as possible targets of the BAF complexes in the context of AML. Finally, to determine the effect of SMARCA2\/4 degradation on pBAF association with chromatin, single cell imaging was performed of U2OS cells with HALO-tagged PBRM1 treated with the degrader or DMSO. pBAF in the degrader treated cells improved engagement with target chromatin however, a decrease in the stability of the complex binding to the nucleosome when compared to DMSO treated cells was shown. Taken together, these studies will determine the role of SMARCA2\/4 in leukemia disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,SWI\/SNF,Chromatin remodeling,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite effective local control, 50% of patients develop metastatic disease responding poorly to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The molecular basis of events leading to initiation of UM is related to mutations in G alpha proteins GNAQ or GNA11, rendering them constitutively active and activating downstream PKC, ERK and AKT pathways sustaining cell proliferation.<br \/>In our previous work, we showed that NCOA3 regulates proliferation of UM cells in vitro and the growth of UM xenografts in vivo downstream of GNAQ or GNA11. The critical role of NCOA3 in UM is manifested by transcriptional regulation of proliferation-related genes that are massively suppressed by NCOA3 knockout or knockdown. Here, we interrogated transcription factors that NCOA3 interacts with in UM to execute oncogenic programs and identified Melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) as its critical partner.<br \/>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an NCOA3 recognizing antibody followed by sequencing was performed to determine NCOA3 binding sites in the human genome. The known transcription binding motifs within NCOA3 peaks were discovered using HOMER algorithm. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to examine direct NCOA3 and MITF interaction. ChIP sequencing for MITF was performed to determine co-localization of NCOA3 and MITF at chromatin. Proliferation of UM cells after inhibition of MITF by either siRNA mediated knockdown or MITF inhibitor ML329 was evaluated using MTT assay. Functional enrichment analysis of transcriptome was used to identify classes of genes regulated by MITF, with specific attention to the subset regulated by MITF partnered with NCOA3.<br \/>NCOA3 chromatin peaks are highly enriched in MITF binding motifs, and 77% of the NCOA3 peaks co-localizes with the MITF peaks. NCOA3 co-immunoprecipitates with MITF. Among transcriptional programs regulated by MITF in UM are those related to melanocyte biology, differentiation, and melanin production, but also those related to melanoma growth, especially cell division, DNA replication, myc response, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and mTOR signaling. Strong suppression of these transcriptional signatures by inhibition of MITF using siRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition correlates with dramatic loss of cell viability. Clinical data indicate that higher expression of MITF-positively regulated genes correlates with lower survival rates of UM patients. Importantly, the transcriptional programs regulated by MITF cooperating with NCOA3 were related to TGF beta signaling, cell adhesion, ECM interaction and actin cytoskeleton.<br \/>Importance of MITF as an oncogene is manifested in uveal melanoma cell lines and clinical data. Oncogenic function of MITF is partially dependent on its interaction with a transcription co-activator NCOA3.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Nuclear receptor coactivator 3,MITF,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that is often inappropriately activated in breast cancer and is frequently associated with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). STAT5 can also be activated and inappropriate activation of STAT5 alone or with STAT3 is generally correlated with a more favorable prognosis, a lower grade tumor, and a better response to therapies compared to inappropriate activation of STAT3 alone. Therefore, knowing the activation status of STAT5 and understanding how STAT5 activation can attenuate STAT3-driven breast cancers could help guide therapeutic choices and patient treatment. STAT3 and STAT5 can regulate a set of overlapping target genes. For example, STAT3 and STAT5 can regulate BCL6 expression, where STAT5 represses expression and STAT3 enhances it. Importantly, STAT5 outcompetes and preferentially binds in the presence of activated STAT3. This suggests that the overlapping target genes could play an important role in understanding how activation of STAT5 can lead to a more favorable breast cancer compared to activation of STAT3 alone. This previous work was conducted in a 2D cell culture model; however, 3D models can better mimic clinical settings and the use of 3D models can help bridge the gap. Therefore, understanding the relationship between STAT3 and STAT5 in 3D is important. SK-BR-3 cells (HER2+ cells with low basal STAT3 activity) and MDA-MB-231 cells (TNBC cells with constitutive STAT3 activity) are being compared between 2D cell culture and 3D media suspension. We have shown using chromatin immunoprecipitation that STAT3 DNA-binding is enhanced in 3D at certain binding sites, whereas STAT5 is not. STAT5 has reduced dominance and preferential binding over STAT3 for BCL6 in 3D compared to 2D. In other cases, STAT3 binding is decreased upon STAT5 activation in 3D but not 2D. To begin to understand these differences, we analyzed phosphorylation of these STATs in 2D and 3D. Phospho-STAT3 levels were similar between 2D and 3D in SK-BR-3 cells when activated with LIF stimulation but were higher in 3D in the MDA-MB-231 cells which contain constitutive STAT3 activity. STAT5 activation by prolactin stimulation did not directly affect STAT3 phosphorylation in 2D or 3D but does affect STAT3 binding in 3D growing cells. However, prolactin induced phospho-STAT5 seems to be reduced in 3D in both cell lines. We are currently analyzing additional binding sites to better define the differences between STAT3 and STAT5 mediated gene regulation in 2D and 3D since STAT phosphorylation does not fully address it. Overall, our data suggests that differences between 2D and 3D breast cancer models will be important for translation to patient tumors and understanding the relationship between STAT3 and STAT5 will help elucidate how STAT5 activation status can be used when treating patients with breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,STAT5,Transcriptional regulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Mutations in genes often result in tumor formation. TP53 encodes p53, a tumor suppressive transcription factor, and is mutated in nearly 50% of all cancer cases. Once mutated, p53 loses its tumor suppressive function while simultaneously gaining oncogenic function. p53 mutations disrupt direct p53 binding to DNA and promotes p53 binding to regulatory regions of oncogenes via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. One of these interacting partners is ETS2, a member of the ETS transcription factor family. ETS binding sites are present in 50% of all mutant p53 occupied regulatory elements. Other ETS family members have also been linked to mutant p53 but these interactions have either been deemed weak (ETS1) or have yet to be identified as direct (ERG). It is my aim to determine the scope of interaction between the ETS family and mutant p53 and to elucidate whether this interaction is required for the observed oncogenic phenotypes of ETS proteins and mutant p53.To determine which ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 purified ETS proteins were used for affinity pull-down of purified mutant p53. The entire ETS family interacted with mutant p53 to some degree, and several ETS proteins had stronger interactions than ETS2. Truncation studies were used to determine interaction domains. One interacting region was the conserved DNA binding domain, which may explain interaction across the entire family. ERG and ETS2, both strong mutant p53 interactors, had two interaction interfaces. I hypothesize that the second interaction interface defines strong interactors. To determine if interacting ETS are responsible for targeting mutant p53 to the genome, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing measured mutant p53 binding in the presence or absence of different ETS factors. These data indicate that each of the conditions resulted in different p53 binding patterns and that there is a requirement for ETS in mutant p53 binding. Lastly, I wanted to determine if there was a correlation between p53 mutation and expression of strong mutant p53 interactors in certain cancer types. Analysis of TCGA samples showed that in ovarian cancers with p53 mutations, ETS factors that are strong mutant p53 interactors were upregulated in a mutually exclusive pattern, while weak interactors tended to be downregulated, or unchanged. Similar trends were observed among some other cancer types. My studies have shown that several ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 in vitro, recruit p53 to the genome, and that this interaction pattern correlates with expression in mutant p53 driven cancers. Additionally, studies are ongoing to determine phenotypes related to this interaction. Ultimately, if ETS\/mutant p53 interactions are deemed important for oncogenesis, these will be attractive targets for drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,Transcription factor - ETS,Prostate cancer,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

We have developed a Dox-inducible spatiotemporally controlled HPV- and YAP-driven model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with a well-defined cancer stem cell population. In order to better understand the epigenetic reprogramming associated with tumorigenesis we have systematically characterized the chromatin accessibility, histone landscape and YAP binding sites in this model.<br \/>Cell lines were generated from tongue epithelia of normal and Dox-induced tumor-containing mice. Gene expression was measured using RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility was measured using ATAC-seq. CUT&#38;Tag for H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and YAP was used to measure epigenetic reprogramming and YAP-DNA interactions.<br \/>Differential gene expression shows that genes involved in hormone signaling, glutathione-related metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and p53 signaling were highly enriched in the normal tongue suggesting a change in metabolism upon tumorigenesis.Differential ATAC-seq peaks with higher binding levels in the normal tongue showed enrichment for p53 motifs as well as homebox motifs including Otx2, GSC and CRX suggesting p53 signaling is lost upon carcinogenesis and lineage determination is altered. Motifs for TEAD, AP-1, and KLF5 were enriched in the tumor-specific ATAC-seq peaks showing that YAP is involved in chromatin accessibility changes. CUT&#38;Tag for YAP shows clear YAP binding near canonical YAP target genes including Axl, Ccn1, Ccn2 and Birc3. YAP peaks with higher binding in the normal tongue cell line were enriched for RUNX2 and p63 motifs and peaks higher in the tumor contained KLF5 motifs showing YAP is directly involved in the reprogramming of lineage determination. Multi-omics integration shows YAP-driven chromatin remodeling is associated with differential expression of genes involved in keratin production, EGFR and ER signaling.<br \/>Direct epigenetic characterization of YAP involvement in tumor initiation is key to understanding the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in head and neck cancer. This work shows that YAP directly binds and affects the expression of genes involved in lineage determination and growth factor signaling to induce cancer progression and generate a cancer stem cell population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cell,Mouse models,Multiomics,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

One of the many consequences of this global epigenetic dysregulation is the reactivation of transposable elements (TEs). TEs compose roughly half of the human genome and are normally repressed through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are a class of TEs that contain long terminal repeats (LTRs) with putative gene regulatory motifs. LTRs can be co-opted to be pro-tumorigenic by becoming non-canonical promotors for oncogenic genes. While several examples of TE-derived promotors have been reported in cancer, the potential significance of TE-derived enhancers remains largely unexplored. Here, we utilized publicly available multi-omics datasets (bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, and chromatin profiling) in the context of ovarian cancer to determine if there are tumor specific, TE-derived-enhancers that have gene regulatory function. We used CRISPRi technology to functionally validate a putative TE-derived enhancer and gene regulatory axis. We discovered that on the bulk tissue level, several TE families are enriched at open chromatin sites and sites marked by H3K27Ac (enhancer mark) of ovarian tumors, suggesting the presence of tumor specific, TE-derived enhancers. On the single-cell level, we discovered that ovarian cells have the highest expression of these TE transcripts compared to stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that the increased TE-derived enhancer activity observed on the bulk level are specific to ovarian cells. Lastly, when we silenced a specific LTR18 locus upstream of a gene, <i>TIPARP<\/i>, TIPARP gene expression was also repressed, suggesting that these putative TE-derived enhancers have gene regulatory function. Determining the regulatory role of these TE-derived enhancers will provide novel insights into cancer-related transcriptomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene regulation,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Multiomics,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

A Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified 13 regions that are related to the risk of developing RCC, and one of this regions is the 14q24 region, a region that has already been shown to have a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) involved in the development of RCC, by which the presence of the risk allele is capable of increase the expression of <i>DPF3 <\/i>and this increase is capable of regulated the RCC cell line proliferation. It is very published the oncogenic effect of <i>DPF3<\/i> in RCC, however, the mechanism by which <i>DPF3<\/i> is acting is not very knew. Our objective is to understand the mechanisms by which <i>DPF3<\/i> regulate renal cancer development. For this, we did a co-immunoprecipitation of DPF3 with nuclear extract of RCC cell line that overexpress DPF3 and analyze the interactions between DPF3 and other proteins of SWI\/SNF Complex. We did a proteomic analyzes in Targeted Mass Spectrometry (MRM) for see the proteins levels. We could see an increase in expression of other SWI\/SNF BAF Complex proteins in RCC cell line that overexpress DPF3, such like SMARCA2, SMARCE1 and ARID1A, suggesting a relation between DPF3 and SWI\/SNF BAF Complex and evidencing that DPF3 is acting through BAF Complex. To extend the evaluation of DPF3 we inhibit the expression of the SNP associated with the 14q24 region, rs4903064, in renal cancer cell lines (UOK121, SN12C and 786-O) using the CRISPRi technic and analyze the role of this SNP in <i>DPF3<\/i>, <i>CEMIP<\/i> and <i>IL23R<\/i> expression. Our initial results demonstrate that in the UOK121 and SN12C lineage, the inhibition of the SNP was able to decrease the expression of <i>DPF3<\/i>, and in the SN12C cell line we also see a decrease in <i>CEMIP<\/i> expression. When we analyze the 786-O cell line, we see that the blockade of SNP does not change the expression of <i>DPF3<\/i>, nor of the other genes, indicating that the action of the SNP on <i>DPF3<\/i> occurs only in the presence of the risk allele for RCC. We also use a murine (Renca) RCC cell line that overexpress <i>DPF3 <\/i>under regulation of TetOn promoter and we did an <i>in vivo<\/i> experiment in mouse (Balb\/c and Balb\/c Nude), for analyze the function of <i>DPF3<\/i> in tumor growth, migration and proliferation. When we inject (s.c) in Balb\/c Nude we could see an increase in tumor growth, in tumor volume and weight in the group treated with doxycycline diet when compare with de control group, suggesting that <i>DPF3<\/i> is capable of increase RCC growth. We also analyze the <i>DPF3<\/i> function in RCC invasion and migration, and when we inject (intrarenal) in Balb\/c we could see a metastatic signal in the lung. The lung of the animals treated with doxycycline diet presents an increase in volume and weight when compare with the control group. In this way, the study of genetic and proteomic behind DPF3 function and RCC development is essential for a biomarker discovery and help in the patient prognosithes and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Protein-protein interactions,Kidney cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Our research reveals a comprehensive metabolic reprogramming, with a particular emphasis on the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and the degradation of arachidonic acid, accompanying this adaptation. Non-mutational epigenetic variations, particularly alterations in active enhancers, coupled with the rearrangement of enhancer-promoter contacts, demonstrate robust correlations with lipid metabolic reprogramming. These findings suggest that non-mutational epigenetic variations play a crucial role in driving the adaptation to trastuzumab.<br \/>Materials and Methods: In a prior investigation, we successfully generated secondary trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3_HR cells. In our current study, total RNA was extracted from both trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3_HR and trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells for transcriptome analysis. Additionally, mass spectrometry was employed to analyze cellular metabolism in both resistant and sensitive cell populations. Simultaneously, we utilized the CUT&#38;Tag kit with an anti-H3K27ac antibody to create a sequencing library for active enhancer measurement. Furthermore, the Micro-C kit was applied to generate a sequencing library for genome contact measurement.<br \/>Results: In our study, secondary trastuzumab-adaptive SKBR3_HR cells demonstrated a reduction in cellular unsaturated fatty acids, with more than 110 UFAs or UFA-containing lipids showing decreases, while only 36 exhibited increases. This phenomenon may be attributed to the downregulation of SCD, FADS2, and HACD2. Simultaneously, the upregulation of PTGS1 and PTGES may contribute to a higher conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), resulting in immune inhibition. In SKBR3 and SKBR3_HR cells, 10,955 and 10,889 non-promoter H3K27me3 peaks, respectively, were identified as active enhancer regions. Among them, 379 enhancers became silent, and 313 transitioned into an active state during the formation of trastuzumab adaptation. Trastuzumab adaptation led to an increase in intra-chromosomal interactions, particularly short-distance contacts (&#60; 1MB). By employing the activity-by-contact (ABC) algorithm, we observed significant variant contacts between PTGES and SCD promoters and enhancers within 1MB genomic regions in SKBR3_HR cells compared to SKBR3 cells.<br \/>Conclusion: The formation of secondary trastuzumab adaptation involves the rearrangement of active enhancers and promoter-enhancer contacts, serving as an effective force to drive lipid<br \/>metabolic reprogramming, especially the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and PGE2 production, reshaping the cellular fatty acid composition and anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Secondary trastuzumab resistance,Promoter and enhancer interaction,Lipid metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

It has been estimated that more than half of protein-coding genes in the human genome possess multiple promoters. Aberrant expression and dysregulated activity of alternative promoters have been correlated with numerous diseases, especially cancer. In this study, we utilized RNA-seq data from 608 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and systematically analyzed promoter activities using the proActiv algorithm. Of the expressed genes in LUAD, approximately 57% have at least two distinct promoters. In addition, we identified 1852 tumor-specific alternative promoters that showed a significant shift (2-fold changes) in promoter activity without any notable changes in the expression of corresponding 1603 genes between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes were associated with key cellular functions such as signaling pathways, cell cycle, and cell junctions. Unsupervised clustering of patients based on altered promoters revealed a significant prognostic value. Among them, we observed a major promoter switch in <i>HDAC9<\/i>, which mainly utilizes three promoters: prmt3280, prmt3283, and prmt3287 in our LUAD dataset. Notably, prmt3287 was exclusively active in tumor samples and functioned as the dominant promoter, while prmt3283 served as the main promoter in adjacent non-tumor samples. Intriguingly, even though the overall expression of HDAC9 mRNA lacked prognostic relevance both in our dataset and in the TCGA dataset, higher expression of the alternative promoter prmt3287 (using &#8805;50% activity level as a cutoff) was associated with adverse outcomes in LUAD patients. We further compared the DNA methylation level around the <i>HDAC9<\/i> domain between paired tumor and non-tumor samples and found that positions with the most significant differences (p&#60;0.001) overlapped with the prmt3287 region. Moreover, DNA methylation levels around prmt3287 significantly decreased in prmt3287 high-activity patient groups. Next, we investigated the ChIP-seq levels over the <i>HDAC9<\/i> region, and ChIPseeker successfully annotated the alternative promoters of <i>HDAC9<\/i>. In addition, the alternative promoter prmt3287 exhibited the highest active enhancer signals. Furthermore, we performed PCR to determine the expression of six distinct transcript isoforms from alternative promoters in four different LUAD cell lines, and we observed high expression of isoform 10, which is possibly generated by prmt3287 in all cell lines. The impact of prmt3287 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell migration will be further addressed. Our results indicate that alternative promoter usage can capture insights that might be missed at the overall gene expression level, and alternative promoter usage in <i>HDAC9<\/i> could be a novel biomarker and a promising therapy target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Promoter,Epigenetics,Histone deacetylase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
