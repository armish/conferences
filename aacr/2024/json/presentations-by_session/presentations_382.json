[{"Abstract":"Background: Lung cancer is the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> most common cancer in the UK and leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Somatic <i>RAS<\/i> mutations are the most common oncogenes in human cancer, and <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations are the largest molecular subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Each cancer genome accumulates a unique combination of somatic mutations, and these mutational signatures provide a genetic imprint of mutational processes that have occurred during tumorigenesis. Mutational signatures provide information on tumor aetiology\/maintenance and could highlight potential therapeutic targets. This is the largest study to date to profile <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant LUAD mutational signatures using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.<br \/>Methods: Paired tumor and germline WGS data were obtained through the 100 000 Genomes Project (Genomics England). <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations were profiled using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) v109.0. Single base substitution (SBS), doublet base substitution (DBS), small insertion and deletions (ID) and copy number (CN) mutational signature extraction was performed using SigProfiler (COSMIC version 3.3). Statistical analysis and plotting were performed in R; a two-tailed p-value &#60;0.05 was considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: 680 LUAD patients were included; 301 <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant (44%), 379 <i>KRAS <\/i>wild type (63%). Common <i>KRAS <\/i>variants were present, including <i>G12C (38.9%), G12V (15.9%) and G12D (14.0%)<\/i>. 17 SBS, 9 DBS, 10 ID and 9 CN signatures were extracted and present in both<i> KRAS <\/i>mutant and wild type cohorts. <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant samples were enriched in smoking related signatures (SBS4, DBS2, ID3; odds (OR) ratio 5.54, 3.80, 4.97 respectively, p &#60;0.001) and diploid CN signature (CN1, OR 1.41, p = 0.03). Conversely, <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant samples were less likely to have clocklike (ID5, OR 0.61, p = 0.012; ID8, OR 0.44, p &#60;0.001), APOBEC (SBS2, OR 0.49, p &#60;0.001; SBS13; 0.50, p &#60;0.001), chromosomal instability (CN9, OR 0.63, p = 0.019), loss of heterozygosity (CN14, OR 0.47, p = 0.015), or homologous recombination deficiency (CN17, OR 0.58, p &#60;0.001) signatures.<br \/>Discussion: These results show distinct mutational signature profiles between <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant and wild type LUAD. As previously described, <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant LUAD is dominated by smoking related signatures; however, the majority of remaining signatures were more common in the <i>KRAS <\/i>wild type cohort where there was a statistically significant difference. This data suggests different mutational processes are observed in <i>KRAS <\/i>mutant compared to wild type LUAD. <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations are commonly clonal and thought to initiate tumorigenesis: timing signatures relative to <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations is necessary to further our understanding of <i>KRAS <\/i>cancer evolution and the subject of future work. Combined with clinical data integration, mutational signatures could provide prognostic information and inform predictive models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Genomics,Somatic mutations,Mutational signatures,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Underlying genomic features of unfavorable clinical courses remain sparsely characterized. Here, we investigated the genomic characteristics of primary-refractory\/relapsed cHL in contrast with long-term-responders (LTR).<br \/>Methods: Therefore, ultra-deep next-generation panel-sequencing was performed on a total of 59 samples (20 LTR, 26 relapsed (rHL: 11 initial-diagnosis, 15 relapse) and 13 primary-refractory (prHL: 8 initial-diagnosis, 5 progression) from 44 cHL-patients applying a hybrid-capture approach. We compared samples associated with distinct disease courses concerning their oncogenic drivers, mutational signatures, and perturbed pathways.<br \/>Results: Compared to LTRs, mutations in genes such as <i>PMS2, PDGFRB, KAT6A, EPHB1, <\/i>and<i> HGF <\/i>were detected more frequently in prHL\/rHL. Additionally, we observed that in rHL or prHL, <i>BARD1-<\/i>mutations occur, whereas <i>ETV1, NF1, <\/i>and<i> MET<\/i>-mutations were eliminated through clonal selection. A significant enrichment of non-synonymous variants was detected in prHL compared to LTRs and a significant selection process in favor of NOTCH-pathway mutations driving rHL or prHL was observed.<br \/>Conclusion: This study delineates distinct mutational signatures between LTR and rHL\/prHL, whilst illustrating longitudinal dynamics in mutational profiles using paired samples. Further, several exploitable therapeutic vulnerabilities for rHL and prHL were identified.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hodgkin's lymphoma,Genomics,Molecular profiling,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

We term these &#8220;non-smoking-related oncogenes&#8221; (NSROs). NSRO-driven tumors account for approximately half of NSCLCs in East Asia, and, alarmingly, their age-adjusted incidence is increasing for unknown reasons. In addition to occurring in non-smokers, NSRO-driven tumors also occur in smokers. However, the clonal architecture and genomic landscape of these tumors remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated genomic and transcriptomic alterations in 173 tumor sectors from 48 patients with NSRO-driven or typical-smoking NSCLCs. Overall, NSRO-driven NSCLCs in smokers and non-smokers had similar genomic landscapes and clonal architectures that were distinct from those in typical-smoking NSCLCs. Surprisingly, even in patients with prominent smoking histories, the mutational signature caused by tobacco smoking was essentially absent in NSRO-driven NSCLCs. We confirmed this unexpected finding in two large NSCLC data sets from other geographic regions. However, we observed differences in the tumor transcriptomes of NSRO-driven NSCLCs in smokers and non-smokers, with tumors in smokers displaying higher transcriptomic activities related to regulation of the cell cycle. This suggested that smoking does have an impact on tumor phenotype in NSCRO-driven NSCLC, likely through non-genetic mechanisms. We concluded that NSRO-driven NSCLCs, whether in non-smokers or smokers, constitute an important disease entity that is very different from typical-smoking NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Mutagenesis,Oncogene,Smoking,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.-Y.

The current standard of care for locally advanced EAC patients is neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) followed by surgery and the pathological response rate is low in clinic. An unresolved question is how the cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) mediate CRT resistance in EAC. To address this question, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 84 longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients (N=47) containing 20 good responders (GR) and 27 non-responders (NR). In total, we obtained 302,918 single cells which enabled us to delineate the phenotypic heterogeneity landscape in EAC at baseline, and identify reprogramming in both the immune and tumor cells during treatment that lead to CRT resistance. We identified 4 major cell type compartments in the EAC TME: lymphoid cells (T cells, NK cells, B cells, and plasma cells), myeloid cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and mast cells), stromal cells (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and epithelial cells. Our data shows that the TME enriched in lymphoid cells, including resident and effector memory CD8 T cells, follicular helper CD4 T cells, and B cells was associated with better CRT responses. Moreover, a significant myeloid cell infiltration was observed across most patients during CRT and the infiltrated macrophages from GR harbored a more pro-inflammation phenotype. In addition, we identified 4 major ecotypes of the TME cells and 4 major expression subtypes of the cancer cells. Notably, the interactions between TME ecotypes and cancer subtypes are significantly associated with CRT responsiveness. In summary, this study has provided valuable insights into the biology of EAC CRT response, and identified novel predictive biomarkers and actionable targets to enhance CRT efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,chemoradiation,Esophageal Adenocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

In this study, we amalgamate single-cell RNA sequencing data from breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX), organoids, cell lines, patient tumors and reduction mammoplasties resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 117 samples with 506,719 total cells. These samples encompass hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 enriched (HER2E), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. We aimed to delineate similarities and distinctions across model systems and patient samples while also exploring stratification of therapeutic drug efficacy based on subtype proportions within tumors. Mammary tumor PDXs, organoids, and established cell lines exhibited higher proliferation and lower heterogeneity observed via UMAP dimensionality reduction compared to most patient tumors or normal breast epithelium. TNBCs had elevated proliferative and pro-metastatic signatures compared to HR+ and HER2E samples. Interestingly, compared to matched PDX tumors, organoids from these same models were found to exhibit stark differences in gene expression, including upregulation of metabolically active aldo-keto reductase family genes, highlighting differences in the model systems with implications for pre-clinical drug testing. Single-cell tumor subtyping analyses with scSubtype and TNBCtype methods found that therapeutically treated samples had shifts in the proportions of cell-wise subtype annotations when compared to matched untreated samples. Similarly, patient lymph node metastasis when compared with matched primary tumors were significantly linked to decreases in Basal-like and HER2-enriched cell-wise annotations in untreated ER+ samples. In vitro assessment of anti-cancer compounds on PDX cells showed significant correlation of subtype proportion with cell viability following treatment with targeted therapeutic agents. This subtyping methodology offers a powerful tool to monitor the evolving gene expression landscape within samples and predict responses to therapeutic agents. We present here a dynamic approach to cell-wise sample annotation and a substantial multi-model dataset for use facilitating informed decision-making in preclinical research and therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The molecular heterogeneity and pathogenesis of uLMS are notwell understood. To unravel the intricate molecular landscape of uLMS, we conducted a multi-omics workflow consisting of 4 high-throughput sequencing technologies; short- and long-readwhole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA-Seq, and Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling enablingmassively parallel proteome proteomic analyses. Our study cohort consisted of 97 fresh frozentissue samples collected from 68 female patients, with 19 uLMS, 37 leiomyoma (LM), and 41normal myometrium (MM). A deep analysis of somatic variants with clinical impact revealed 46variants present in 90% of samples and two actionable therapeutic targets: IDH1_p.Arg132Cysand KRAS_p.Gly12Val. Also, 80% of the samples presented a chromothripsis signature and 60%presented the SBS3 COSMIC signature related to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).Analysis of the proliferation score in RNA-Seq data revealed a notable difference among thetumor groups, signifying a higher proliferation index in the uLMS group, suggesting a moreaggressive growth pattern with implications for clinical behavior and disease progression. Afterapplying a customized workflow to identify balanced chromosomal abnormalities of genefusions with clinical impact, the proto-oncogene eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (EEF1A1)emerged as a prominent fusion partner. Eight fusions in 7 samples were identified withtranscriptional overexpression in positive cases. At the proteomic level the enrichment analysisunveiled activated pathways associated with the innate immune system, while suppressedpathways pertained to extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and smooth muscle contraction.With an integrated bioinformatics pipeline, we identified copy number amplification of theCTHRC1 gene in 80% of the samples, accompanied by increased gene expression and proteinlevels. This gene is related to collagen remodeling and degradation and has been demonstratedto be upregulated in some solid tumors and is closely associated with malignancy. Survivalcurve analysis highlighted a significantly poorer prognosis in uLMS exhibiting CTHRC1 geneamplification with potential clinical relevance of CTHRC1 amplification as a prognostic indicatorin uLMS. Taken together these results show the overall suppression of ECM and collagenremodeling in uLMS associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, these data provide the firstevidence that the EEF1A1 gene has a strong selective pressure in uLMS underscoring theindispensable role of precision genomics in advancing precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Precision medicine,Multiomics,Gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The disease consists of three subtypes, including hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In recent years, the advent of targeted therapies such as PI3K inhibitors has significantly improved the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the detection of relevant molecular markers, such as PIK3CA mutations, relies on tissue samples, which imposes limitations on the clinical application of these therapies. Consequently, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of genomic profiling that compares breast cancer patients across distinct pathological classifications, utilizing a liquid biopsy approach.<br \/>Methods: In this retrospective study, 214 patients with advanced breast cancer were recruited. Plasma samples collected prior to first line treatment were analyzed using PredicineCARE, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) liquid biopsy assay, to detect somatic alterations in ctDNA of blood, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), gene fusions, and copy number variations (CNVs).<br \/>Results: Based on the IHC classifications of tumor tissue, this cohort comprised 119 HR-positive, 61 HER2-positive, and 34 TNBC patients. The assay identified a total of 1456 mutations and 2357 gene copy number variants in plasma samples. Among these, the most frequently mutated genes and those with copy number variations (top 5) in HR-positive patients were TP53 (40%), PIK3CA (39%), ATM (22%), ERBB2 (19%), and FGFR1 (19%). In HER2-positive patients, they were TP53 (39%), PIK3CA (31%), ERBB2 (30%), NTRK1 (20%), and RAD50 (20%). For TNBC patients, the top genes were TP53 (59%), ERBB2 (44%), PIK3CA (35%), NTRK1 (35%), and BRCA2 (26%). Regarding the PIK3CA gene, the most prevalent mutation site was H1047, occurring in 12.61% of HR-positive patients, 14.75% of HER2-positive patients, and 11.76% of TNBC patients. Similarly, both E542 (4.20% in HR-positive, 3.28% in HER2-positive, and 2.94% in TNBC patients) and E545 (3.36% in HR-positive, 3.28% in HER2-positive, and 2.94% in TNBC patients) showed equivalent prevalence across the three classifications. These findings suggest the potential efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in various pathological types of breast cancer.<br \/>Conclusions: This study offers insights into the genomic landscape of advanced breast cancer subtypes through liquid biopsy. The observed prevalence of PIK3CA mutations supports the potential efficacy of PI3K inhibitors across these diverse types of breast cancer, laying the groundwork for personalized therapeutic strategies and biomarker identification for prognosis and targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Mutation detection,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Specifically, melanoma with <i>NRAS<\/i> mutations are of particular clinical concern due to their association with a poor prognosis and lack of specific treatment options. Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel approaches to address the treatment of <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma. A current approach to identify novel drug targets is based on the genetic concept of induced essentiality, where functional interactions that occur in response to oncogene addiction create a dependency on another gene. To identify genetic dependencies in <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma, whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens were conducted in 6 <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant and 7 <i>NRAS<\/i>-wild-type (wt) early-passage New Zealand melanoma (NZM) cell lines that were established and maintained at 5% oxygen to mimic physiological oxygen conditions. The NZM cell lines were stably transduced with the whole-genome Brunello lentiviral single guide (sg) RNA library and screened for up to 35 days. BAGEL (Bayesian Analysis of Gene Essentiality) analyses of the NZM whole-genome knockout screens, alongside CRISPR-Cas9 screening data using the Avana sgRNA library from an additional 28 melanoma cell lines, available on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) database, revealed prospective gene candidates that exhibit greater detrimental effects on the fitness of <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant cell lines compared to the <i>NRAS<\/i>-wt lines. These genes are being further validated as essential genes for <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma cells through custom sgRNA library knockout screens and <i>in vitro<\/i> individual gene knockout studies. In particular, we demonstrate that knockout of <i>SHOC2<\/i>, a gene that encodes a scaffold protein essential for activation of the MAPK signalling pathway, results in the prevention of ERK phosphorylation and a more substantial reduction in cell growth in <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant NZM cell lines when compared to <i>NRAS<\/i>-wt lines. These results support previous studies that have identified SHOC2 as a potential therapeutic target for <i>RAS<\/i>-driven cancers and suggest that targeting of SHOC2 may have utility in <i>NRAS<\/i>-mutant melanoma, where greater treatment options are urgently needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Ras,CRISPR\/Cas9,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues underwent WES, RNA-seq, and copy number analysis (CNA) with concomitant peripheral blood or saliva for germline DNA sequencing. Samples with &#60;20% tumor purity and median coverage of &#60;142x for tumor and\/or &#60;95x for normal samples were labeled as quantity not sufficient (QNS). Genomic and transcriptomic data were profiled to uncover clinically relevant biomarkers and match patients with clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov.<br \/>Results: To date, 63 patients received WES and RNA-seq, with 45 full Tumor Portrait<sup>TM<\/sup> test clinical reports delivered and 3 partial reports for QNS samples. Cell of origin (COO, n = 41), LymphGen (n = 41), and lymphoma microenvironment (LME, n = 42) classifications were applied. The median TAT was 8 days for advanced reports, and 76% of reports had a TAT &#8804;9 days.<br \/>WES identified frequent <i>TP53<\/i> (n = 13) and CDK2NA (n = 5) alterations. COOs were designated as activated (n = 16, 39%) or germinal center (n = 25, 61%) LBCL. The LymphGen classifier showed the EZB MYC- (n = 9, 22%), A53 (n = 6, 15%), and MCD (n = 6, 15%) subtypes as the most prevalent. LME classification revealed most LMEs as mesenchymal (n = 30, 71%). Immune-depleted (n = 7, 17%), immune-inflamed (n = 4, 10%), and germinal center-like (n = 1, 2%) LMEs were less prevalent, but the immune-depleted LME was more common in patients with relapse.

The genomic composition of metastatic, mucinous AC is yet to be resolved at the whole exome level and few groups have assessed the clinical actionability of target genes. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on AC specimens to 1) elucidate the mutational spectrum of AC, 2) identify recurrent mutations at frequencies unique to AC or in common with colorectal cancer (CRC), and 3) uncover recurrent AC mutations that are associated with patient survival outcomes.<br \/>Methodology: Twenty-four FFPE samples, one from each of 24 AC patients treated at our institution with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), were collected from our tumor bank with IRB approval. DNA from tumor and corresponding normal tissue (PBMCs) was extracted, assessed for integrity and quantity, then analyzed by WES using the Illumina NextSeq 6000 platform. The resulting data were processed using both GATK and DRAGEN pipelines. The frequencies of recurrent mutations in AC were compared with those of CRC from cBioPortal and statistically compared by Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test. Logrank test was performed to estimate survival associations based off mutation status. Mutational signatures derived from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium were cross-compared to our cohort to identify previously unknown mutational processes in AC.<br \/>Results: The most frequent mutations were found in MUC6 (63%), KRAS (58%), HLA-B (54%), PABPC1 (50%), and MUC5AC (50%). Distinct from a 534-patient CRC cohort, AC had lower rates of alteration in APC (4% vs 73% CRC, p&#60;0.001) and TP53 (21% vs. 62%, p&#60;0.001), with higher rates of alteration in HLA-B (54% vs 3%, p&#60;0.001), GNAS (38% vs 5%, p&#60;0.001), and ABCA1 (29% vs 7%, p=0.001). Notably, ABCA1 mutation frequency was higher in mucinous CRC (n=56) when compared to non-mucinous CRC (n=478, 20% vs 7%; p&#60;0.001), suggesting that ABCA1 may be uniquely altered in bowel cancers of mucinous phenotype. Alterations in Rho-A were a statistically significant predictor of poor survival in both AC (p&#60;0.001) and CRC (p=0.05). PCAWG analysis showed that the predominant mutational signature in AC most resembles SBS5, suggesting that the mutational etiology of AC may be linked to age and\/or smoking status.<br \/>Discussion: Here we present the largest whole-exome sequencing analysis of AC analyzed to date and identify previously undescribed recurrently mutated genes unique to AC as compared to CRC. We demonstrate novel associations between altered genes and patient survival, which opens discussion regarding the clinical utility of molecular markers in AC for assisting treatment decision making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Metastatic tumors,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, the role of <i>gBRCA1\/2<\/i> in non-BRCA assoc. cancers is poorly understood. HRD tumors present with &#8216;genomic scars&#8217; that can be quantified in tumor profiling (&#8220;HRD-sum&#8221; score). We reasoned that the HRD-sum score together with germline mutation status (including loss of wild-type) is a strong correlate of HRD-positivity. Leveraging 42,448 prospectively sequenced patients across 63 cancer types, we sought to characterize the prevalence of the HRD-positivity in non-BRCA-assoc. cancers.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Allele-specific copy number data was inferred using FACETS. HRD-sum was calculated as a sum of the numbers of telomeric imbalances, large-scale transitions and genome-wide losses of heterozygosity. Calculating each score was iteratively optimized to improve detection of the scars using MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing data using patient-matched WES data from 1841 tumors as reference. Germline mutations were identified by a clinically validated pipeline and annotated for pathogenicity using ClinVar. After excluding low quality tumors, 27,375 patients were retained for analysis. &#8220;HRD-positive&#8221; tumors are those with <i>gBRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations, loss of wild type, and an HRD-sum score &#62;=42.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Expectedly, g<i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations were more frequent in BRCA-assoc. cancers (7.2%, 558 of 7,737 patients) compared to non-BRCA-assoc. cancers (2.6%, 500 of 19,638) (p=5e-60). Among non-BRCA-assoc. cancers, g<i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> were most common in esophagogastric (3.9%), lung (3%), hepatobiliary (2.9%), and bladder (2.8%) cancers. Although biallelic loss in g<i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> patients was sig. higher in BRCA-assoc. cancers (80% vs. 37% in non-BRCA-assoc.), several cancer types showed high rates of loss of wild-type including g<i>BRCA1<\/i> tumors in hepatobiliary (5\/5) and endometrial (10\/11) cancers. HRD-sum scores in all <i>gBRCA1\/2<\/i> biallelic tumors were sig. higher (median 58) compared to monoallelic (26) or wild-type (25) tumors. Notably, the non-BRCA assoc. cancers with biallelic <i>gBRCA1\/2<\/i> harbored higher HRD-sum scores compared to monoallelic (median 51 vs. 22, p&#60;0.0001). These include cancer types such as endometrial (64 vs. 37, p= 0.0014) and esophagogastric (62 vs. 45, p=0.0017).

Notably, a large subset of BAP1 mutant patients present with a unique chromosome 3 copy-number (CN) loss and higher likelihood of metastases. The biology underlying the causes and consequences of Monosomy 3 (M3), and its role in metastases is largely unexplored. This can be partially attributed to the relatively few numbers of preclinical models of UM, and the inability to delineate M3 from BAP1 loss. To address this, we derived a preclinical isogenic model of chromosome 3 CN loss through CRISPR-based centromere targeting in a well characterized UM cell line lacking a BAP1 mutation. Clones with and without chromosome 3 loss were derived from these efforts. Recent studies have evaluated genomic events in primary UM and described five CN aberration-based subtypes expanding beyond M3, with the fifth subtype being called the &#8220;ultra-high-risk UM&#8221; based on poor survival and extremely high metastatic rate. Whole genome sequencing across our clones confirmed chromosome 3 CN loss, and in addition to this, recapitulated all of the core genomic features characteristic of the ultra-high-risk UM group. In comparison, our models without chromosome 3 CN loss maintained a genomic profile more characteristic of lower risk UM subtypes. The genomic landscape of our isogenic low risk (LR) and high risk (HR) clones suggest that chromosome 3 CN loss alone in the absence of BAP1 mutations can be the driver for acquisition of downstream genomic events seen in aggressive UM. Further, using single cell DNA sequencing on the parental model, LR and HR clones, we confirmed that chromosome 3 CN loss in our clones was engineered, and not a pre-existing subclone in the parental cell line. Bulk RNAseq on our LR and HR clones demonstrate concordance with genomic regions of losses and gains, while also highlighting upregulation of pathways such as cell cycle and DNA damage response in the HR clones. Next, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models demonstrating differential behavior in paired <i>in vivo<\/i> settings, where HR clones had higher fitness advantage and metastatic potential, specifically to the mouse liver. This modeling has enabled us to employ spatial transcriptomics in a PDX setting, adapt existing methodology to infer chromosomal copy number events in our system and inform transcriptional and genomic phenotypes akin to the aggressive HR clones. Thus, using our engineered preclinical models, we demonstrate that chromosome 3 loss, in the absence of BAP1 mutations is capable of driving aggressive disease in UM, characterized by genomic evolution, transcriptional reprogramming and <i>in vivo<\/i> invasiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Genomics,Invasiveness,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

We hypothesized that integration of whole-genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), would lead to a more comprehensive understanding of these diseases. Our study is uniquely focused on metastatic and relapsed disease, whereas previous studies focused on primary cases. We also prioritized longitudinal profiling, including with deep sequencing, to capture tumor evolution across primary and metastatic sites and to quantify the utility of resampling.<br \/>We assembled a cohort of 219 high-risk pediatric oncology patients, including solid tumors, CNS tumors, leukemias\/lymphomas, patients with relapsed\/refractory disease (75), metastatic disease at diagnosis (7), rare diagnoses (17), prior cancer history, and estimated overall survival &#60;50%. We characterized 286 samples with WGS (tumor ~60X; germline ~30X) and\/or RNAseq (polyA selected, &#8805;20 million reads), including 95 samples taken from 44 patients at different time points (diagnosis, relapse, etc.). Variants, structural rearrangements, mutational signatures, and copy-number alterations were identified using WGS. RNAseq was used to profile gene expression outliers, gene fusions, and expression of variants. Integrated results were used to prioritize potentially actionable variants. For 20 patients (44 samples), we performed targeted deep sequencing of the DNA (~500X).<br \/>RNAseq identified potentially druggable outlier gene expression and fusions, including 102 novel fusions where the 3&#8217; gene is overexpressed. WGS identified aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity and whole genome duplication across histotypes. Mutational burden and mutational signatures analyses identified profound effects from platinum drugs on tumor evolution, but treatment effects were not universal. Multiple sampling per patient uncovered drastic spatial and temporal differences in the genomes and transcriptomes of these tumors. Custom deep sequencing confirmed these findings, captured evolution missed by WGS, and furthered our understanding of the complex impacts of treatment on clonal evolution. Histotypes differed by whether actionability was higher for WGS or RNAseq alone, but in 66% of samples modality integration increased actionability. Integration also identified a subset of tumors that may be amenable to immunotherapy, but which lack canonical markers of response. Longitudinal analysis highlighted both the opportunities and risks of targeted therapy, with targetable variants gained and lost between timepoints. Our study shows that integrated multi-modality sequencing can elucidate novel insights into the biology of pediatric cancers and identify potential therapeutic targets not detected using gene-panel testing alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Whole genome sequencing,RNA sequencing,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

There are large ongoing multi-institutional studies devoted to advancing medical management for hAML by providing targeted therapeutics to patients based on their molecular characteristics. A preclinical spontaneous large animal model for testing novel therapies could accelerate the development of better treatments in people. Dogs spontaneously develop AML with similar clinical features and outcomes. As such, the dog may be a useful pre-clinical model, but little is known about the molecular landscape and\/or drivers of canine AML (cAML). The goal of this work was to identify somatic mutation candidates in cAML and determine the overlapping features with hAML. We utilized whole exome sequencing at 300x coverage to identify candidate mutations in 51 cAML samples. Somatic variant calling was performed per the GATK best practice recommendations using Mutect2 and a reference panel of normals (n=77) and a variant call file of canine germline variants. We focused our analysis on novel variants predicted to have a moderate to high impact and that occurred in genes implicated in cancer. At least one variant was identified in genes involved in the RTK\/RAS pathway (e.g. <i>NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, FLT3, KIT<\/i>) in over 75% of cAML samples, a trend that is also found in people. Additionally, recurrent point mutations were predicted in <i>NRAS<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i>, and some of which, such as the codon changes G13R and Q61R\/H in <i>NRAS<\/i>, were noted to be shared between hAML and cAML. Mutations in <i>DNMT3A<\/i> were uncommon (n=3\/44) and <i>NPM1<\/i> mutations were not identified in our cohort, both of which are common hAML-associated genes. However, mutations in other epigenetic modifiers, such as <i>KDM5C<\/i> and <i>KDM6A<\/i>, occurred at a high frequency. This data provides insight into the candidate mutations potentially driving cAML pathogenesis and highlights the overlapping molecular features with hAML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Genomics,Translational,Canine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Anatomically, GI cancer includes cancers of the organs in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum. Advances in molecular oncology have started to transform the therapeutic landscape and offer tremendous promise for patients across diverse lineages. However, the equitable benefit of this approach has been hampered due to tumor heterogeneity and the lack of accurate, tumor-agnostic biomarkers with prognosis and predictive utility. Thus, there is a need to identify novel biomarkers that affect gastrointestinal malignancies to improve the management of cancer patients. This study analyzed a single institution's whole genome sequencing dataset to explore the genomic variation in GI cancers. Between 2020 and 2022, 302 AU patients underwent molecular profiling, including whole-exome sequencing (WES) profiling at Caris Life Sciences. WES is an NGS assay that analyzes the DNA sequences of all protein-coding exons in the genome, representing approximately 1-2% of the human genome with coverage of over 22,000 genes. We analyzed the TCGA dataset for comparative analysis, which included cancer data from &#62;1800 GI cancer patients. In addition, survival and network analyses were performed to identify a 6-gene <i>FAT3<\/i>-related signature for GI cancers. In our cohort, we identified <i>FAT3<\/i> (Fat atypical cadherin 3) as the most frequently mutated gene after <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i>, and <i>KRAS<\/i>. <i>FAT3<\/i> encodes a cadherin protein involved in cell-cell interactions and adhesion. In the institutional cohort, <i>FAT3<\/i> was found to be mutated in 16% of all GI cases. Further analysis of TCGA datasets comprising 1808 GI cancer patients revealed <i>FAT3<\/i> mutations in 12% of the cases. To identify additional prognostic biomarkers associated with <i>FAT3<\/i>, we performed network analysis and identified a 6-gene <i>FAT3<\/i>-related signature (<i>FAT3<\/i>, <i>RYK<\/i>, <i>FAT2<\/i>, <i>EGFLAM<\/i>, <i>NTRK3<\/i>, <i>IGSF9<\/i>, and <i>HMGA2<\/i>) that significantly stratified GI cancer patients based on overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. The perturbation profile of the 6-gene signature was associated with 509 patients or 28% of total GI patients. Further, immune deconvolution analysis of stratified patients revealed increased infiltration of immune cells with immunosuppressive phenotypic properties in GI cancer patients with higher expression of the <i>FAT3<\/i>-related gene signature. In summary, this analysis reveals the distribution of <i>FAT3<\/i> mutational profiles in GI patients and identifies a gene signature that stratifies patients based on survival outcomes. This analysis can provide new tools for patient stratification and therapy implementation, leading to better outcomes for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Precision medicine,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Despite its recurrence, the specific characteristics and role of 22qDEL in PTC have not been fully studied. We conducted a pooled analysis of 22qDEL by integrating patient and clinical information and molecular profiles from 1,094 primary PTC tumors across four major published PTC genomic studies: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PTC profile study, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) post-Chornobyl PTC study, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSKCC-IMPACT) PTC cases, and the Seoul National University (SNU) thyroid cancer profile study. The majority of PTC with 22qDEL demonstrated arm-level loss of heterozygosity (86%). Even in PTC cases with partial 22qDEL, we observed a loss across 70% of chromosome 22, encompassing regions 22q12 and 22q13, which harbors known cancer genes (<i>NF2<\/i> and <i>CHEK2<\/i>). More than 90% of 22qDEL co-occurred with established oncogenic drivers of PTC, though a full assessment of PTC drivers was not available for all cases. 22qDEL occurred more frequently with <i>RAS<\/i> point mutations (50.4%) than other drivers (9.3%). A higher fraction of 22qDEL was clonal in <i>RAS<\/i>-driven PTCs (78.3%), suggesting 22qDEL occurs early in <i>RAS<\/i>-driven tumor development. We did not observe any association between 22qDEL and established PTC risk factors such as age, sex, and radiation, nor with clinical features including tumor size, multifocality, and metastasis (p-values&#62;0.22). RNA sequencing gene expression analysis based on 22qDEL status revealed downregulation of most genes residing on chromosome 22q and significant differential expression activity of immune-related genes, further implicating a role of immune dysregulation in PTC. Our study suggests that 22qDEL may not act as a primary driver of PTC but plays an important role as a co-factor of <i>RAS<\/i> point mutations, which could further drive PTC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Genomics,Copy number alterations,Profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Olivia  W.

This requirement for multiple tests results in higher total costs, extended analysis time, and increased usage of sometimes limited tumor material. In our laboratory, we apply long high-fidelity reads to human samples using PacBio circular consensus sequencing (HiFi-GS) of 12-18kb DNA fragments, which offers better structural variant detection relative to short-read sequencing. Here, we assess the ability of HiFi-GS to detect clinically relevant genomic rearrangements (CRGRs) in pediatric leukemia.<br \/>We selected 11 pediatric leukemia cases with corresponding normal (remission) samples, including 7 cases of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 4 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); 5 of these 11 leukemia cases had known CRGRs as below. The remaining 6 leukemia cases had also undergone clinical genetic profiling via karyotyping, FISH, microarray, and sequencing yet a clinical grade genomic driver was not identified. DNA from each sample was sequenced on a Revio instrument (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA) to a target depth of 30x. The PacBio Human Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) workflow was used to process HiFi reads for haplotagged alignment and phasing, followed by somatic structural variant calling using Severus. Subsequent analysis focused on the presence of break ends in known cancer-relevant genes.<br \/>We found that HiFi-GS detected the known CRGRs in all 5 cases with prior findings, providing precise break ends and clarifying sometimes unclear cytogenetic observations (such as exact partner genes), in these cases. These included detection of an <i>ETV6<\/i>-<i>RUNX1<\/i> fusion, <i>NUP98<\/i>-<i>NSD1<\/i> fusion, <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>AFF1<\/i> fusion, <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>AFDN<\/i> fusion, and <i>RUNX1<\/i>-<i>RUNX1T1<\/i> fusion. HiFi sequencing also detected CRGRs in 2 of the 6 &#8220;undiagnosed cases&#8221;; namely, one case of <i>ZNF384<\/i>-<i>TCF3<\/i> fusion and one case of <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>MLLT10<\/i> fusion. The former can be cytogenetically cryptic, while the latter can often be missed due to its potentially complex nature.<br \/>Our results demonstrate that HiFi-GS can reliably detect CRGRs, bringing us closer to the promise of a single comprehensive genetic test for cancer characterization. Additional work examining other somatic structural and copy number variants (i.e., inversions, deletions, and duplications) in these cases, as well as oncogenic sequence variants, is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene fusion,Leukemias,Sequencing,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Previous work in MDS and AML showed that CKAML form clusters distinguishing del(5q) cases with commonly retained regions (CRRs) in the telomeric (&#8805;5q34) and centromeric (&#8804;5q14.2) ends from cases with loss of the telomeric and\/or centromeric regions. Interestingly, del(5q) patients with CRRs were shown to have less genomic lesions and were associated with a better prognosis than other 5q-deleted CKAML cases.<br \/><b>Aim<\/b>: Combining the advantages of two different long read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), we aimed to more comprehensively characterize the molecular landscape of CKAML with del(5q). Our integrative workflow enabled an in-depth characterization of copy number variations (CNV), genomic rearrangements, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Low coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) using ONT was performed on 209 patients with CKAML to identify del(5q) cases for further in-depth analysis. For 10 selected cases with known CRR status, genomic deep sequencing using PacBio Revio and ONT PromethION was performed, as well as PacBio Revio MAS-seq for fusion transcript detection.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: A mean sequencing depth of 3-fold (range 0.4-17.3-fold) was obtained by low coverage WGS of the 209 CKAML cases. With a resolution of 0.1 Mbp n=134 del(5q) cases were identified in our CKAML cohort (64%) and commonly deleted regions on 5q could be resolved at 5q21.2 to 5q23.3 and 5q33.3 to 5q35 (Fisher test, FDR Benjamini-Hochberg, p&#60;10<sup>-30<\/sup>). These regions separated del(5q) in n=52 cases showing CRR retention and n=82 showing partially no CRR, (either the centromeric or telomeric regions, n=74, or of both regions, n=8 involved). Subsequent co-occurrence analysis provided evidence of an association between the loss of telomeric 5q region with a 3p12-25 deletion. In-depth analysis (30-50 fold) of ten distinct del(5q) cases by PacBio and ONT revealed additional insights into the complex clonal composition of del(5q) cases. For example, one case showed two distinct subclones with 5q14.2-5q35.1 deletion and with translocation t(3;5)(p14;q14) respectively. Moreover, we could demonstrate that 5q-aberrations are far more complex than initially thought showing, e.g. inverted terminal duplications that resulted in fusion transcripts involving <i>PDE4D<\/i> and leading to its deregulated expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Using our long read deep sequencing approach we could further delineate the structural complexity of del(5q) CKAML. While gene expression profiling, methylation analysis and correlation of findings with clinical outcome are ongoing and will be presented at the meeting, our results help to further pinpoint the biology underlying del(5q) and to further refine this heterogeneous CKAML subgroup.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Cancer genomics,Chromosomal instability,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Currently, genomic data are obtained through invasive tissue biopsy. Brush biopsy has been utilized for diagnosing dysplasia but its effectiveness in reflecting the complete genomic landscape of OPLs remains uncertain. This study investigates the potential of brush biopsy samples in accurately reconstructing the genomic profile of OPLs. The evolution and heterogeneity were assessed by assessing SNVs, copy number analysis, and subclonal architecture reconstruction of paired tissue-brush biopsy samples of oral epithelium, dysplastic lesion, and OSCC lesion. We found that brush biopsy accurately reflects the genomic landscape of oral lesions, mirroring about 90% of SNVs and comparable CNA profiles found in tissue biopsies. Genomic profiling with brush biopsy was tissue-specific, as SNVs identified in OPL or OSCC lesions were not found in adjacent normal mucosa. Shared SNVs and CNAs were observed between OPL and OSCC samples. This suggested a common ancestor giving rise to these lesions. Subclonal architecture reconstruction confirmed that both lesion types shared a common ancestor clone and then diverged evolutionarily. These findings underscore the potential of brush biopsies in accurately reconstructing the genomic profile of OPL and OSCC, highlighting their usefulness in understanding the biological processes involved in tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Cancer genomics,Head and neck cancers,Copy number variation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Representing 1-3% of uterine cancer cases, these tumors exhibit rapid growth, high recurrence rates, and resistance to the standard treatments. The present study aimed to validate several Loss-of-function mutations (LOF), obtained by NGS analysis in the <i>CREBBP<\/i>, <i>NOTCH2<\/i>, and <i>GNAS<\/i> sequences, in US through Sanger sequencing. <b>Methods:<\/b> Twenty-five samples of US were collected between 2000 and 2015 for genomic DNA extraction. An initial genetic screening of the samples by NGS method was followed by Sanger sequencing validation. Bioinformatics analysis through SnapGene confirmed the results. <b>Results:<\/b> A c.4063G&#62;A mutation was confirmed in uterine leiomyosarcomas (ULMS), in the both strands. Notable variations in the forward strand, such as a C&#62;G substitution at position 38 of the alignment and a degenerate base S at position 113, differentiated ULMS from uterine sarcomas (US). Two ULMSs exhibited the highest substitution rates: one with 18 and another with 6 substitutions. Despite the absence of the c.5527T&#62;C <i>CREBBP<\/i> mutation, ULMS displayed increased insertions and deletions. Assessing the <i>NOTCH2<\/i> gene in US revealed a complex genetic landscape, with a unique SU-specific duplication in the forward strand. The reverse strand maintained high genetic stability. Mutation c.6094C&#62;A was exclusive to one US sample. Notably, the c.7223T&#62;A mutation in <i>NOTCH2<\/i> was not identified. Shared mutations between ULMS and US suggest genomic similarities in these regions. In the <i>GNAS<\/i> analysis, the c.2381A&#62;C mutation was not found. However, in the forward sequence of one US sample, a deletion at the expected substitution site was detected, suggesting a specific genetic alteration. The c.706G&#62;A mutation was consistently present in sample ULMS, indicating genetic stability in this sample. US exhibited a G&#62;C substitution in the reverse sequence, hinting at a unique pattern of genetic variation. These findings underscore the complexity of genetic alterations in these critical gene regions. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our analysis identified specific alterations in ULMS and US. ULMS showed the c.4063G&#62;A <i>CREBBP<\/i> mutation and unique variations, while US had a specific c.6094C&#62;A <i>NOTCH2 <\/i>mutation. The absence of the c.2381A&#62;C <i>GNAS<\/i> mutation in both ULMS and US, along with distinct genetic patterns (c.706G&#62;A in ULMS and G&#62;C substitution in US), underscores significant mutational differences in these critical gene regions.

Brain metastasis, though uncommon is an aggressive tumor type, remains poorly understood in EAC. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 9 brain metastasis samples, profiling their whole-genome with matched normal and comparing them to the primary EAC tumors, other EAC metastasis types and other brain metastasis types, including the Hartwig Institute and PCAWG. Overall, our sample size comprised over 4,500 tumor whole-genome data and we utilized a uniform data analysis pipeline for robust comparisons between cohorts. Our analysis revealed that brain metastasis samples have significantly higher single-nucleotide variants, however, the structural variant burden in brain metastases closely resembled those observed in the primary tumor. Notably, the incidence of whole genome doubling is significantly higher in brain metastasis compared to other primary cancer types and metastases. This significant difference stems from the higher WGD incidence in primary EACs compared to other tumor types. Mutational signature analysis revealed no significant changes compared to the primary tumor, and we observed an enrichment of SBS 17a\/b, previously associated with tumor progression in primary esophageal adenocarcinoma, along with a prevalent presence of the APOBEC mutagenesis signature in most samples. Notably, ERBB2 and TP53 emerged as prominent driver genes present in most brain metastasis samples. We also observed an upregulation of ERBB2 expression in brain metastasis samples. Interestingly, ERBB2 appeared to play a more significant role in brain metastasis progression compared to the primary tumor and other metastasis types, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings advance our comprehension of brain metastasis in EAC, providing crucial insights into genomic alterations and mutational processes that could inform future therapeutic strategies and clinical management for this previously understudied metastatic type.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Oncogene,ErbB2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

While recent integrative genomic studies have described molecular features of individual cancer types, few studies have compared genomic changes between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cancers across anatomic sites. Here, we conducted the first pan-cancer genomic analysis of HPV-associated tumors across multiple anatomic tumor types using whole exome and transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts of cervical (n=254) and HNSCCs (n=514), and targeted exome sequencing of 800 cancer genes plus full length HPV16\/18 genomes in a clinical cohort of squamous tumors from the head and neck (n=458), cervix (n=78), vulva (n=23), anal canal (n=5), and vagina (n=2). Somatic variant calling and filtering, followed by an integrative pathway analysis of commonly altered targets, defined the catalog of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) that drive HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumorigenesis. Sequencing reads from viral RNA or DNA determined HPV status, and HPV type, genome structure, integration events, and viral load were characterized in a subset of samples via de novo assembly of viral aligned reads followed by copy number analysis, breakpoint identification, and the calling of structural variants. Overall HPV positivity was 50% (668 out of 1334 total), with HPV16 accounting for 96%, 89%, and 60% of all HPV(+) anogenital, head and neck, and cervical tumors respectively. Significant differences in somatic mutation frequency between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors were observed in the full cohort, as well as in analyses stratified by anatomic site. Interestingly, we noticed recurrently mutated &#8220;hotspots&#8221; attributable to increased APOBEC-mutagenesis in HPV(+) samples across anatomic sites (PIK3CA:E545K, FGFR3:S249C, EP300:D1399N), while hotspot mutations likely caused by tobacco smoking predominate HPV(-) HNSCC (PIK3CA:H1047R\/L, CDKN2A:R80*, TP53:R282W). Focal and arm level CNAs were distinctive, including gains of 11q22 in HPV(+) cervical and HPV(-) HNSCC, and losses of 11q22 in HPV(+) HNSCC. Biological pathways commonly altered include epithelial differentiation, cell death, innate immunity, growth factor\/kinase signaling, and cell cycle control. In summary, pan-cancer genomic analysis revealed distinct patterns of somatic alteration of conserved biological pathways that associate with HPV status and anatomic site. These findings improve our understanding of tumor biology unique to HPV-associated cancers and may lead to novel treatment and classification strategies to improve patient outcomes in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cervical cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Somatic mutations in the E3-ubiquitin ligase, CBL, are known to activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in cancer and have been exclusively characterized in hematological malignancies. This includes acute myeloid leukemia, where CBL mutations lead to FLT3 activation. Using molecular data from ZERO we have identified known and novel <i>CBL<\/i> variants in novel tumor contexts. Our findings raise the possibility that CBL mutation may be a marker of RTK activation in a range of paediatric cancer types and may represent a group of patients who could benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.<br \/>We analyzed whole genome and RNA sequencing data from the ZERO cohort and identified 26 somatic <i>CBL<\/i> variants in 22 individual patients, the majority of which were in CNS tumors (14 patients). In 8 patients with CNS tumors, we identified missense and splicing variants, which were either novel or not previously seen in this tumor type, that are predicted to have a functional impact on CBL E3 ligase activity due to their location in the linker region or RING finger domain of CBL. Interestingly, most of these patients did not fall into a pre-defined DNA methylation-based subtype classification of CNS tumors and had no significant upregulation of RTK genes.<br \/>In addition to the novel variants, we identified an established oncogenic CBL deletion variant, CBL exon 8\/9 deletion (CBL ex8\/9&#916;), in novel tumor types - neuroblastoma and a germ cell tumor. Functionally, we show that overexpression of CBL ex8\/9&#916; enhances cell proliferation and maintains EGFR signaling by blocking CBL mediated degradation of phosphorylated EGFR in neuroblastoma cells.<br \/>In this study, we demonstrate that CBL is mutated in a range of pediatric cancer types beyond hematological malignancies and may represent a marker of RTK activation and a new target for high-risk patients with limited therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Pediatric cancers,Tyrosine kinase receptors,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Its use ranges from sequencing entire tumor genomes and transcriptomes to targeted clinical diagnostic gene panels. The NYU Langone Genome PACT assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test that uses targeted next generation sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue matched with normal specimens from patients to detect gene alterations in a 607-gene panel. Indications for testing are cancer (solid tumors or hematological malignancies) where a mutational profile from multiple genes would be informative for disease stratification, prognosis, or treatment options including targeted therapies and eligibility for clinical trials. The test is intended to provide information on somatic mutations including point mutations, copy number aberrations, and small insertions\/deletions (indels) for diagnostic and treatment decisions. LG-PACT is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved diagnostic test. The clinical interpretation of sequencing data of molecular tumor markers from NGS encompasses automated variant calling tools with human interpretation. The final mostly manual review of data is intensive, involving highly trained scientists, encompassing literature review, interpretation and tier classification by pathologists, who then provide a complete molecular diagnostic report to the treating oncologists. Since January 2022 to present (October 2023) we have provided clinical genomic reports for 1029 oncological cases from 124 different cancers and their subtypes, including Brain (489 cases incl. meningioma, glioma and glioblastoma), Gastrointestinal (123), Lung (114), among others. We first present the technical challenges of validating an NGS oncological diagnostic targeted assay for appropriate clinical grade accuracy and sensitivity acceptable for patient care. We show how copy number alterations provide a more comprehensive description of the tumors genomic profile. We then outline the actionability of targeted panel sequencing for our current patient cohort. Where analysis of variant detection has led to 47% (490) of our clinical tumor samples containing known tier 1 therapeutic variants. We conclude with presenting case studies that identify both the clinical utility and informatic challenges of variant calling specific to gene panel sequencing e.g., i) the capture of potential targetable rare and novel indels and multivariant mutations in exons 19 and 20 of EGFR, and ii) a unique KIT tandem duplication event in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). We demonstrate the value in precision oncology for multiple cancer types and how the capture of unique variants can provide better targeted treatment options to cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Cancer genomics,Molecular diagnosis,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Canine PTCL clinically and immunophenotypically resembles human PTCL-NOS, and PTCL is more common in dogs than humans, leading to their interest as a naturally occurring preclinical model. Canine models of cancer offer several unique advantages: in contrast to traditional rodent models, these are spontaneous tumors in genetically diverse and immunocompetent animals living in a shared environment with humans, but relative to their human counterparts, they offer accelerated lifespans with shorter clinical courses of disease. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile of 96 canine CD4+ PTCLs to determine similarities to human PTCL-NOS and investigate a possible cell of origin. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on lymph node aspirates of 96 cases of canine CD4+ PTCL diagnosed by flow cytometry and sorted CD4+ nodal lymphocytes and CD4+ thymocytes from healthy control dogs. Raw reads were aligned to the Ensembl canine reference genome (ROS_Cfam_1.0) and tabulated. Data normalization and differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2, and differentially expressed genes were compared to human PTCL-NOS and various stages of T-cell development via gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). Global gene expression in canine CD4+ PTCL was analogous to that of human PTCL-NOS (NES = 2.3, p &#60; 0.001). Additionally, canine CD4+ PTCL had increased expression of <i>GATA3<\/i> (log2fc = 1.9, padj = 6.5e-07) and was enriched for gene signatures associated with downregulation of PTEN (NES = 1.7, p = 0.0001) and upregulation of PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling (NES = 1.5, padj = 0.0007), resembling the more aggressive human GATA3-PTCL subtype. Canine CD4+ PTCL was also enriched for human and murine gene signatures associated with early thymocyte progenitor cells and had increased expression of genes of immaturity, including <i>CD34 <\/i>(log2fc = 7.8, padj = 2.6e-14)<i>, KIT <\/i>(log2fc = 3.3, padj = 7.7e-05)<i>, <\/i>and <i>CCR9 <\/i>(log2fc = 4.8, padj = 3.9e-11), although surface CD34 expression is not detected by flow cytometry. These findings were confirmed when we compared the canine PTCL gene expression programs to a canine single cell transcriptomic atlas of hematopoietic precursors and T cells across canine bone marrow, thymic, and lymph node tissues. Canine CD4+ PTCL cells were significantly (padj &#60; 0.05) enriched for gene signatures associated with early thymic and bone marrow precursors (NES 1.3-2.1), and negatively enriched for gene signatures associated with na&#239;ve nodal CD4+ T cells (NES = -3.2, padj = 0.006). In conclusion, the gene expression profile of canine CD4+ PTCL resembles human PTCL-NOS, supporting its potential as a naturally occurring preclinical model, and a subset of these neoplasms may arise from a thymic precursor cell of origin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Gene expression analysis,Lymphoma,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Single-cell sequencing techniques and high-resolution cellular imaging now afford researchers the ability to investigate the effects of germline variants (especially when compared to somatic mutations) on molecular characteristics of cancer cells and non-cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we investigated a breast cancer (BRCA) cohort of over 100 individuals, for which we have generated sc\/sn RNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and CODEX imaging data as well as bulk whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq data. We identified 21 BRCA cases carrying pathogenic and likely pathogenic rare germline variants in known cancer predisposition genes, such as BRCA2, BRIP1, ATM, and TP53. These predisposition genes showed diverse expression patterns across stromal and immune cell types, indicating roles in cell types beyond breast epithelia. For cases carrying pathogenic germline variants in such genes, we use snRNA-seq\/snATAC-seq to assess gene expression changes and pathway alterations (e.g.,HRD and apoptosis) across all cell types and investigate phenotypic changes associated with pathogenic germline variants in cancer cells compared to stroma and immune cells in the TME. By evaluating chromatin accessibility changes and allele-specific expression, we reveal the connection between epigenetic regulators and differential roles of germline variants across cell types. Finally, the integrated analysis of germline variants and somatic mutations from predisposition genes at single cell resolution broadened our understanding of the role of germline variants in TME during tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Single cell,Genetic susceptibility,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

While the actionable results are included in reports, the non-actionable are less often investigated. This study explored the results of both actionable and non-actionable mutations as well as the co-occurrence of mutations in a pan-tumor model.In this study, we explored data generated from 41 oncology practices where patients (+ 18yo) were tracked within the iKnowMed EHR and had received CGP as part of their care. CGP is defined as a large-scale (300+ genes) NGS-based assay. As part of this study, results between 2017 - present were collected across tumor types and stages.Assessment of the data pool demonstrated that a majority of the 44,769 profiles were generated from Stage IV patients (n=24,545) and NSCLC, colorectal, and breast cancers were the highest representing disease populations in the cohort. The tested gene targets aligned with the diseases that were most represented, with EGFR, PIKC3A, ERBB2, and KRAS genes as the most common genes to have documented results . Exploration of the actionable biomarkers showed the expected pathogenic mutations in the relevant disease context. When exploring the remaining reported variants, it was found that CGP results yield a significant (p&#60;0.05) number of VUSs as well (n=23106). The complexity of mutations was also examined on an intra- and intergenic basis. Intragenic assessment for variants focused on complex mutations, qualified by 2+ mutations including multiple SNV, multiple indels, or SNVs and deletions in the same gene. Trends of co-occurring alterations were not obvious, with TP53 having the most reported occurrences of complex mutations (n=7491). Exploration moved to intergenic assessment and, while disease-bounded exploration did not reveal trends, a disease-agnostic approach revealed co-occurrences of mutations. The top 5 genes with co-existing mutations are TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, and ATM. Co-occurrence of alterations in any gene with tumor agnostic markers was also explored, notably TMB. The presence of mutation with TMB-high was similar to that of intergenic complex mutations and the same genes had high co-incidence levels. This study has demonstrated that CGP data provide insights beyond actionable biomarkers, and that a pan-tumor approach allows new trends to be observed. Real-world data bias for reported biomarkers skewed the results observed. Taking the results out of disease context allows us to visualize new possibilities for identifying variants implicated in disease processes. Future studies could allow the exploration of unreported data from raw files, overlaid with cellular pathways on complex patient profiles to identify exploitable targets. Inclusion of treatment and outcome data can demonstrate the influence of genetics on a patient journey.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Tumor mutational burden,Mutation detection,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The testing was carried out by a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory, Shanghai, China. The hybrid capture panel covered 450 genes, heterozygous snps were used for MTAPhd identification, the detection rate of MTAPhd was measured and fisher&#8217;s exact test was used for analyzing the correlation with age, stage, subtype and gender.<br \/>Results: In total, 6.8% (626\/9202) cases had MTAPhd. In 626 dataset, 220 was female and 406 was male. Age was from 3 to 91 with median 63. 25, 43, 74 and 119 was in clinical stage I, II, III, IV, respectively. Patients with age &#60; 60 had lower odds (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.51-0.71; p &#60; 0.001) of occurring MTAPhd compared to age &#62;= 60. Clinical stage I and II had lower odds (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.44-0.79; p &#60; 0.001) compared to stage III and IV. Adenocarcinoma had lower odds (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.14-0.21; p &#60; 0.001) compared to squamous carcinoma. Female had lower odds (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59-0.83; p &#60; 0.001). MTAPhd occurred in multiple cancers, among which it was more likely to occur in esophageal carcinoma (72\/298; 24.2%), brain tumor (14\/66; 21.2%) and bladder urothelial carcinoma (67\/348, 19.3%). The detection rates of the top three cancer types in the sample size were lung cancer (208\/2743, 7.6%), pancreatic cancer (48\/794, 6.0%) and colorectal carcinoma (7\/756, 0.9%), respectively. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (13.5% vs 19.3%, p = 0.008) and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) (19.3% vs 25.5%, p = 0.045) of Chinese cohort had lower rate of MTAPhd compared to TCGA cohort. 53 out of 626 had no driver mutations associated with recommended drug use currently. One lung adenocarcinoma patient received crizotinib (<i>MET<\/i> amplification) in 2021, then changed to osimertinib (<i>EGFR<\/i> exon19del), underwent chemotherapy in 2023, developed hip metastases, and was currently undergoing radiotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: This study, for the first time, revealed that MTAPhd were found in approximately 6.8% of Chinese patients across different tumors. Patients with age &#62;= 60, stage III and IV, squamous carcinoma and male, were more likely to occur MTAPhd. Esophageal carcinoma and brain tumor had a higher detection rate. Chinese cohort had lower detection rate of MTAPhd for LUSC and BLCA compared to TCGA cohort. Our results indicated that PRMT5 inhibitors would be a potential therapeutic strategy to be considered for Chinese patients with MTAPhd in the near future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Synthetic lethality,Inhibitors,Esophageal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.
