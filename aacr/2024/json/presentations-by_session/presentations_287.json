[{"Abstract":"PRMT5 is an essential arginine methyltransferase that regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes through the methylation of histone and non-histone substrates. In PRMT5 catalysis, SAM serves as the cofactor and methyl group donor, generating a methylated guanidinium moiety on the target substrate. In normal cells, the SAM pools are maintained through the methionine salvage pathway. In 15% of cancers, a key enzyme in this pathway (MTAP) is deleted, leading to an accumulation of the intermediate MTA, which inhibits PRMT5 activity. This genetic loss of function has therefore been pursued as a collateral vulnerability in MTAP deleted cancers. To exploit this synthetic lethality, a number of novel inhibitors have been developed that bind cooperatively at the PRMT5\/MTA complex, offering a compelling pathway to precision medicine. Here we describe a novel, live cell NanoBRET Target Engagement assay that enables mechanistic studies on a variety of PRMT5 inhibitors. Using a cell-permeable NanoBRET probe directed to the substrate pocket of PRMT5, both substrate- and cofactor-competitive engagement can be quantified in cells. Moreover, this method can be used to quantify MTA-uncompetitive target engagement in cells, providing a platform to measure the potency of PRMT5-MTA-drug ternary complex formation. This method serves as a first-in-class method to quantify uncompetitive target engagement in live cells, which can be applied to other model systems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,Drug discovery,Synthetic lethality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Although immunotherapy has shown efficacy in several tumor types, no immunotherapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of gliomas. One of the biggest challenges in using immunotherapies in the CNS is the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits drug delivery and the subsequent therapeutic drug efficacy. In addition to biodistribution, assessment of PK in preclinical models do not reflect the clinical findings. Conjugation of therapeutic agents with molecules binding to TRFC expressed along the BBB are being used as one of the alternative approaches to deliver drugs into the CNS. Herein, we describe a novel TFRC humanized mouse model (hTFRC), developed to enable assessment of compounds targeting human TFRC and aiming to deliver drug through the BBB. hTFRC model was developed by knock-in at the mouse endogenous locus to enable a physiological expression of TFRC. Splenocytes from hTFRC mice stimulated with labelled pHrodo Red human transferrin show internalization of human transferrin, suggesting that humanization of the transferrin receptor does not change the endocytosis process. <i>In vivo<\/i>, treatment of hTFRC mice with anti-BACE1\/anti-TFRC antibodies enables the transfer of anti-BACE1 to the brain, while anti-BACE1 antibody is not. As a consequence of the drug delivery, mice treated with anti-BACE1\/anti-TFRC show a marked reduction in Amyloid-&#946; 1-40 levels in the brain. Altogether, the data suggest that hTFRC is expressed in the BBB and enables the efficient shuttling of therapeutic antibodies to the brain. While assessment of TFRC-targeting antibodies in a glioma model remains to be performed, the hTFRC model is a promising tool to assess delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies in gliomas. Moreover, the hTFRC model is also being intercrossed with the well-established hSA\/FcRn humanized mouse model (Viuff <i>et al<\/i>., 2016), to enable a more translatable PK and biodistribution of compounds targeting TFRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Transferrin receptor,Glioma,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

The majority of GBM cases are linked to genetic mutations (ie. TP53, EGFR, and PTEN), which disrupt the normal regulation of cell growth and division, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. The utilization of nanoparticles presents a promising approach for addressing the complexities associated with selective drug delivery to GMB and treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of including U87-MG membrane lipid extracts in nanoliposomes using target, non-target, and normal healthy cellular populations in vitro.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The nanoliposomes employed for the experiments included various ratios of U87-MG lipid extracts (lipids derived from U87-MG cells), DOPC, Cholesterol, and DPPE-Rhodamine for fluorescence studies. The particle size and zeta potential values were measured and monitored throughout for consistency. Fluorescence intensity values (arbitrary units) were used to assess extent of cell binding, and uptake at the various time points. In vitro studies were employed to evaluate the cellular uptake activity of U87-MG-modified nanoliposome preparations using mixed ratios and compositions of lipid materials. Cell lines employed were, LN-18 (human glioma), T98G (human glioma), U87-MG (human glioma), 4TI (murine breast), and HBEC-5i (normal healthy) cells.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The average size for the nanoliposomes (with and without lipid extract) fell within the range of 110 to 220 nm, while the zeta potential for the CLENs was negatively-charged. In vitro studies revealed that the inclusion of U87MG lipid extract in nanoliposomes increased cellular uptake in glioma cells when compared to control. Current investigations focus on different microenvironments, including non-target and off target cell populations. The findings from the cellular uptake analyses to date suggest that the <i>in vitro<\/i> cellular uptake of the CLENs varied in accordance with the total lipid extract content for all cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Nanoparticle,Liposomes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, differences in handling 3D cell cultures compared to traditional 2D cell lines have limited adoption of 3D techniques in compound and cell therapy screening experiments. To facilitate use of patient-derived 3D tumoroid models, we developed protocols for both scale up and scale down of these models in Gibco&#8482; OncoPro&#8482; Tumoroid Culture Medium. OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium is a serum-free, conditioned medium-free culture medium designed to promote the growth of patient-derived 3D cancer models (tumoroids, cancer organoids). OncoPro medium is compatible with a suspension culture approach for easier handling compared to traditional embedded culture formats. We studied the growth of tumoroids in different flask sizes during suspension culture to optimize scale up for downstream assays. Tumoroid growth rates and morphologies were consistent across non-tissue culture treated flask sizes, and viable cell yield increased with surface area during scale up. In some cases, as many as 100x10<sup>6<\/sup> dissociated tumoroid cells can be recovered from a single Nunc&#8482; TripleFlask&#8482; after a week of growth. After scaling up, tumoroids were dissociated and seeded in multiwell plates to test multiple screening conditions (compound identity, compound concentration) in parallel. Dissociated cells were seeded in 96-well plates using both manual and automated liquid handling (Tecan Fluent 780). Due to the tendency of 3D cell models to aggregate and fall out of solution, initial seeding in a 96-well flat bottom plate resulted in high well-to-well variability. Optimization of cell seeding protocols led to standard deviations in tumoroid metabolic activity, number, and size that were comparable to manual seeding, with a coefficient of variation of less than 3% between wells for multiple tumoroid lines when automation was implemented. Generally, variability in cell seeding was lower when using the optimized, automated cell seeding protocol compared to manual methods. After seeding, cells were grown for three days to form tumoroids prior to the addition of compounds. At this time point, there was low well-to-well variability in tumoroid metabolic activity (CV&#60;2%). Compounds and reagents to analyze cell health could also be added using automated liquid handling prior to analysis on plate readers or high-content imaging platforms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Assay development,3D models,Organoids,3D cell culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Unlike conventional inhibitors that disable target proteins by direct binding, PROTACs are event-driven, meaning that a single PROTAC molecule can induce the degradation of multiple target protein molecules. This catalytic mechanism allows PROTACs to achieve complete inhibition of target proteins at lower concentrations compared to conventional inhibitors, making them a promising therapeutic approach for previously considered \"undruggable\" targets.Despite their promise, the development of PROTACs faces several challenges. The large molecular weight of PROTACs can lead to poor cell permeability and bioavailability. Additionally, the lack of high-throughput, quantitative assays for evaluating PROTAC efficacy hinders structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. The formation of the Protein-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex is crucial for PROTAC function, and reliable methods for assessing this interaction are essential for PROTAC development.In this poster, ChemPartner showcases a comprehensive suite of preclinical models for PROTAC evaluation, encompassing both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Using low-cost, high-throughput biochemical assays, we can provide valuable insights into PROTAC efficacy, facilitating SAR studies and elucidating the relationship between molecular structure and activity. Followed by in cell and in vivo function assays, we can test PROTAC PK\/PD, toxicity, and efficacy. This suite of assays provides a powerful tool to speed up PROTAC development and reduce the fail rate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,In vitro,Assay development,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>y. xu<\/b>, J.

Recent studies with a vedotin-based SLITRK6-directed ADC, AGS15E, have offered clinical proof-of-concept of harnessing this target with the ADC modality for addressing high unmet need at least in bladder cancer. PRO1106 is comprised of a proprietary humanized SLITRK6-targeting IgG1 (dubbed as &#8220;mAb&#8221;) and the proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-based linker-drug, sesutecan. Sesutecan previously demonstrated promising characteristics in preclinical studies with multiple targets and conferred an encouraging benefit:risk profile in the clinic with a FR&#945;-directed ADC (rinatabart sesutecan). PRO1106 and the parent mAb exhibited strong binding (with low nanomolar affinity) to recombinant human or cynomolgus monkey SLITRK6 on bio-layer interferometry. No binding was observed with human SLITRK1 or SLITRK4 or in additional negative-binding assays. Potent cellular binding (with sub-nanomolar EC<sub>50<\/sub>) was also observed for the parent mAb and ADC with bladder, head and neck, and brain cancer cell lines as well as SLITRK6-overexpressing 293F cells. Target-binding was superior to sirtratumab (the parent antibody in AGS15E) and the binding epitope appeared to be distinct from that of sirtratumab in cross-block studies. PRO1106 displayed rapid internalization and elicited robust cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar range) in SLITRK6-expressing tumor cells but not target-negative cells. PRO1106 produced strong tumor growth inhibition in multiple cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models in mice representing bladder cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. PRO1106 showed a stable PK with much higher exposure compared to an in-house synthesized analog of AGS15E in rats. In an exploratory PK study in cynomolgus monkeys, PRO1106 at 5 mg\/kg exhibited extended PK with minimal release of exatecan in circulation and with no apparent toxicity observed. In summary, PRO1106 is an ADC built on a clinically validated linker-drug directed at a clinically validated target, with promising data in preclinical pharmacology studies. As SLITRK6 expression in skin is negligible, PRO1106 may offer an exciting new option for patients with bladder cancer where the current standard-of-care ADC therapy (enfortumab vedotin) confers significant skin-related toxicity burden as well as for patients with additional cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bladder cancer,Solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"W.

To address key issues of current ADCs such as aggregate formation and payload-related toxicities, we have developed a platform technology with tailored solutions for ADCs and small molecule-drug conjugates (SMDCs). Key features of the ADC technology comprise of kinesin spindle protein inhibitors (KSPi) as a novel payload class, a unique linker selectively cleaved by the tumor-associated protease legumain, and a CellTrapper<sup>&#174; <\/sup>modification of the KSPi payload to reduce membrane permeability and provide accumulation in tumor cells beneficial for efficacy and safety<sup>1,2<\/sup>. Our advanced ADC VIP943 is targeting CD123 for the treatment of AML and MDS and is currently in Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06034275). Here we show the extension and applicability of the platform in combination with various antibodies. Two case studies demonstrate how the payload-linker optimization increases the selectivity for tumor over healthy cells and potentially overcomes transporter-mediated drug resistance. Tuning the cleavable linker of cetuximab-ADCs for a higher challenge of legumain-mediated payload release resulted in a 52-fold improved selectivity of cytotoxicity against tumor cells versus HaCaT skin cells. A trastuzumab-ADC using a KSPi payload modified with the CellTrapper, shows low nanomolar potency against JIMT-1 cells resistant to trastuzumab-deruxtecan and thus may overcome resistance. An increased potency was not observed with an ADC releasing a permeable KSPi without CellTrapper. To address heterogenous target expression in solid tumors, novel antibody-2-drug conjugates (A2DCs) were synthesized to combine the advantages of intracellular accumulation of non-permeable payloads with the release of a second, membrane permeable KSPi payload. In vitro studies comparing the A2DCs with their respective mono-drug ADCs on 4 different targets shows the highest cytotoxicity achieved with A2DCs independent of the efficacy driver in mono ADCs. Lastly, synthesis of homogenous KSPi ADCs with a drug to antibody ratio of ~8 is compatible with different antibodies without significant aggregate formation. Furthermore, an easy and efficient process for ring-opening of the thiosuccinimide ring after conjugation was developed and shown to successfully avoid ADC de-conjugation via retro-Michael reaction. Selected examples of each of these subclasses were coupled to trastuzumab; all conjugates were highly efficacious and resulted in tumor regressions in the SKOV-3 model similar to trastuzumab-deruxtecan.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our<sup> <\/sup>technology platform offers options for efficient and safe cancer treatments and allows for versatile adaptations to the various aspects of cancer biology. 1.

The most common approach to mitigate intra-tumoral ADC target heterogeneity is to employ a bystander active payload. Once the ADC is internalized and metabolized, the payload can diffuse into tumor cells, independent of target expression. This strategy has proven effective, as evidenced by all but one of the eleven FDA-approved ADCs incorporating a bystander active payload. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in most cases there is clear evidence of an expression-response relationship, and the bystander approach does not specifically address inter-patient heterogeneity in target expression. Bispecific ADCs that can target two different tumor associated antigens (TAAs) are a promising approach to overcoming challenges associated with spatial and temporal target heterogeneity. A traditional bispecific ADC design employs a bivalent IgG where one paratope interacts with target A, and the other paratope interacts with target B. This design ensures that the molecule is maximally active when both targets A and B are present. However, this enhanced specificity approach has limitations, as it requires cellular co-expression of both targets to be effective. In contrast, a novel-format bispecific ADC targeting two different TAAs independently could increase the addressable patient population relative to a monospecific ADC. For example, a bispecific ADC with the potential for both independent and dual targeting of folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;) and NaPi2b, established targets in ovarian cancers, could significantly expand the number of patients who could benefit relative to an ADC against either target alone. Here we describe a novel approach to the design and screening of a FR&#945; x NaPi2b bispecific ADC library with the aim of targeting tumors that express either FR&#945;, NaPi2b, or both targets. A library of 48 bispecific molecules was designed, employing multiple paratopes and variable antibody formats. The library comprised three valency bins, 1+1, 2+1, and 2+2, corresponding to the number of binding arms to each target. Bispecific antibodies were generated from 31 half antibodies containing Azymetric&#8482; Het_Fc mutations. Complementary half-antibodies were combined and oxidized to generate interchain disulfide bonds, with bispecific antibody purity in the range of 90%. Antibodies and their corresponding ADCs, prepared through direct conjugation to a cytotoxic payload, were evaluated on a panel of FR&#945;-expressing and Napi2b-expressing cancer cell lines. Key ADC parameters, including binding, internalization, and in vitro cytotoxicity, highlighted paratope combinations, valencies, and geometric formats that offer the unique potential to overcome target heterogeneity in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Heterogeneity,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

This often involves large and time-consuming mouse studies to test a small number of compounds in an attempt to show statistically significant benefit. Likewise, testing multiple compounds and combination partners in these systems is limited by time, cost, and a desire to reduce the number of animals used in biological research. To overcome these limitations, we utilized an implantable microdevice (IMD) developed by KiburMed to measure intra-tumoral drug responses and to differentiate the mechanism of action of multiple cytokine agents in parallel in the MC38 mouse model. After sizable tumor growth in mice and implantation of the IMD device with 9 different therapeutic candidates, MC38 mice were taken down at different time points (24 hour, 4 days,7 days) to assess response. Local tumor response in the study was measured by cyclical immunofluorescence for deep cellular response phenotyping with a panel of 32 markers for comprehensive immune cell phenotyping. Among the candidate murine surrogate compounds in the device, SAR445877 (anti-PD-1-IL-15 mutein) was tested as a monotherapy, as a combination partner with anti-PDL1 and compared against anti-PD1 monotherapy. With further validation of this novel platform, results from this work are aligned with previous studies (1) showing a murine surrogate for SAR445877 in combination with anti-PDL1 increases immune cell populations more than either single agent alone. These analyses show CD3, CD4, and CD8 were significantly increased in SAR&#8217;877 murine surrogate + anti-PDL1 compared to SAR&#8217;877 alone or anti-PD1 alone. In addition, T cells could infiltrate at a distance away from treatment release region, well into tumor core. Other significant changes in immune cell markers include increases in CD45+, CD11b, CD11c, CD20 and CD27. In conclusion, we have shown that multiple oncology therapeutics can be screened simultaneously in a small number of mice using an implantable microdevice and data obtained with this technology is consistent with that obtained from traditional mouse tumor experiments.<br \/>(1) Preclinical characterization of SAR445877, an anti-PD-1 antibody-IL-15 mutein fusion protein with robust anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with PD-L1 blockade.

Drugs that cause GI toxicities often affect the proliferative stem and progenitor cell populations responsible for maintaining the cellular composition, self-renewing capacity, and barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. This disruption leads to impaired GI barrier integrity, culminating in a broad range of clinical symptoms, including diarrhea, inflammation, and increased risk of infection. The impact of GI toxicity is substantial and can cause dose-limiting clinical side-effects that may affect patient compliance and dosing adherence. Common nonclinical animal models, including rats, mice and dogs are often poor predictors of human GI toxicity and safety outcomes. Furthermore, in vivo animal testing poses limited screening throughput, which is particularly important in fields such as oncology, where matrices of double or triple drug combinations represent the standard of care. Additionally, existing cell-based model systems, such as Caco-2 cells, are of limited predictive value as they are tumor-derived and do not reprise native epithelium. Thus, there is a need for the development of assay systems that more accurately recapitulate human biology, have higher throughput testing capabilities, and ultimately improve clinical predictability. To this end, we have developed an assay to assess GI toxicity potential using the RepliGut Planar platform, which consists of a primary human stem cell-derived epithelium in a 96-well Transwell format. Quantitative dose-response curves were generated on proliferative and\/or differentiated GI cultures for various test articles utilizing endpoints that assess GI proliferative capacity, cell viability, and epithelial barrier formation and maintenance. An initial set of marketed drugs (including diverse anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, or anti-inflammatory mechanisms) with known clinical incidence of diarrhea were over a 5-log dose range to enable modeling of the Toxic Concentration 50% (TC50). When benchmarked against the known human plasma concentrations (Cmax), this model was able to accurately predict clinical outcomes for diarrheagenic-drugs, as well as non-toxic negative controls, within 30-fold of the clinical Cmax. Overall, this model system provides straightforward and informative screening for GI toxicity that integrates sensitive and robust endpoints, enables screening to support early nonclinical development, and uniquely allows for mechanistic insights.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Toxicity,Screening,Preclinical testing,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

RNA-based therapies, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), RNAi, aptamers, and mRNA, are designed to modulate protein synthesis in patients and have applications in oncology, gene therapy, and infectious disease prevention. Strategies for ONT drug delivery have advanced over recent years with the goal of overcoming limitations when targeting extrahepatic tissues. Improving the &#8220;drug-likeness&#8221; of ONTs is facilitated by chemical modifications to the sugar-phosphate backbone and\/or nitrogenous bases. Modifications are designed to increase ONT drug stability, uptake, and efficacy, but may increase the likelihood of toxicity. First generation chemical modifications include phosphorothioate (PS) modification of the phosphate portion of the backbone, whereas second generation modifications include adding substituent groups to the 2&#8217; position of the ribose portion of the backbone, specifically 2&#8217;-O-methyl (OME), 2&#8217;-O-methoxy-ethyl (MOE), and 2&#8217;-fluoro modifications of RNA. Third generation modifications include peptide nucleic acids (PNA), locked nucleic acids (LNA), morpholino phosphoroamidate (PMO) modifications, and others. We have developed, optimized, and validated a library of monoclonal antibody reagents that detect these chemical modifications independent of nucleic acid composition, structure, strandedness, configuration, or platform. These &#8220;universal detection reagents&#8221; can be used in (1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine biodistribution, (2) immunofluorescence (IF) to determine intracellular localization, (3) ELISA to determine anti-drug antibody binding, immunogenicity, and drug ranking, (4) immunoprecipitation to determine protein binding in serum and\/or tissue lysates, (5) <i>in vivo<\/i> cell culture studies to determine potency, and (6) other immunoassays. While <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization (ISH) is an established method for the detection and localization of ONTs in cells and tissues, this method has limitations that include lack of utility (as unique probes must be designed individually for each ONT), high costs in time and materials to produce probes, the inability of ISH to bind and detect short ONT drug sequences, and difficulties encountered when repeated sequences are present within the ONT sequence. Here we report differential sensitivity and specificity of panels of antibodies specific for PS and MOE modifications.

The platform is modular and comprises 1) an activator that target specific antigens, and 2) inert cancer drugs, protodrugs, which are selectively activated at tumors via click chemistry. The CAPAC technology separates the tumor targeting function from the payload and reunite them at the tumor creating the flexibility to optimize activity while limiting toxicity during preclinical and clinical development. The modularity of the platform enables the rapid development of new therapies as well as unlocking unique treatment benefits such as tunable combinations and payload cycling. We envision that CAPAC will expand the scope of potential targets, widen the therapeutic index of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Here we present a TROP2-targeting activator with a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload.<br \/>TROP2 expression has been observed in many cancers that express low-HER2. The clinical efficacy of anti-TROP2 ADCs is hindered by undesirable side effects, limiting their potential therapeutic window. We have developed the targeting activator SQT02, a TROP2 Fab binder conjugated with ~2.2 tetrazines per protein, and SQP22, an attenuated protodrug of MMAE coupled with<i> trans<\/i>-cyclooctene (TCO). The reaction between tetrazine and TCO moieties releases MMAE at the tumor site. Previously we have demonstrated that SQP22 is attenuated compared to free MMAE and in combination with a HER2 targeting activator led to significant tumor inhibition with no observable toxicity. The CAPAC platform&#8217;s modular nature allows seamless exchange of targeting agents or payloads, thus enabling different therapeutic combinations to be generated quickly and efficiently, like SQT02 in combination with SQP22. Dosing of SQT02 occurs prior to dosing with SQP22 to reduce non-specific activation while enabling higher payload activation at the tumor site to induce tumor cell death. <i>In vitro<\/i>, SQT02 bound NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells with similar EC<sub>50<\/sub> (~0.07 &#956;g\/mL) to an antibody that binds to TROP2. <i>In vivo<\/i>, treatment of SQT02 followed by SQP22 led to 60% tumor growth inhibition compared to Sacituzumab govitecan's 35% inhibition in the NCI-N87 xenograft model. No body weight loss was observed in the animals treated with SQT02 in combination with SQP22.<br \/>We have demonstrated the use of click chemistry to deliver a highly potent cytotoxic agent to tumors, causing significant growth inhibition. The flexibility and adaptability of the CAPAC platform allowed us to quickly develop therapeutic combinations that can be deployed to accelerate the path to the clinic. Our findings provide evidence for developing SQT02 in combination with SQP22 for the treatment of TROP2 expressing cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Biochemical modulators of the therapeutic index,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted drug delivery,Trop-2,Anticancer therapy,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Upon its generation via cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) by a wide array of pathogens that provide extracellular microbial DNA and by intracellular (nuclear and mitochondrial) DNA, it binds directly to the STING protein resulting in the activation of the STING pathway. This activation by cytosolic DNA initiates a cascade of events, cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling, that induces type 1 IFN response, and eventually the signaling is terminated by degradation of pathway components and clearance of stimulatory DNA. Given its significant role as an adaptor for DNA sensors to pathogens and its involvement in immune sensing, tumor growth control, and control of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, the STING pathway has become a very important drug target. Credible evidence suggests that the cGAS&#8211;cGAMP&#8211;STING pathway makes fundamental contributions to at least three major cancer therapies: radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, and it thus represents a promising drug target. Therefore, there is a need to identify lead compounds that effectively modulate human STING for further drug development. Towards this goal, we have developed a bioluminescent assay to monitor the concentration of cGAMP in intracellular as well as extracellular compartments. The assay relies on the new concept of Protein Complementation Assay (PCA) using nanoluciferase (nanoluc) complementation technology where a small peptide (SmBiT) derived from nanoluc linked to cGAMP through a linker (cGAMP tracer) can be recognized by an anti cGAMP antibody that is linked to a nanoluc complementary fragment (LgBiT) resulting in bioluminescence upon the addition of nanoluc substrate. The presence of free cGAMP that is generated in the reaction competes with cGAMP tracer and decreases bioluminescence. We have optimized the assay for higher sensitivity down to less than 10 nM cGAMP and less than one ng of cGAS and thus, and it is suitable for testing compounds that modulate cGAS activity. We also improved cell lysis condition to increase recovery of cGAMP that is generated intracellularly using several cGAS activators and correlating its concentration with cytokine release. We envision using this assay to monitor cGAMP presence in sera and spinal fluids of patients who have ALS and Alzheimer diseases. The assay is homogenous, with minimal or no false hits using LOPAC screening and HTS formatted and can be completed in less than one hour. Thus, this assay provides valuable contribution for investigating modulators of the STING pathway and facilitates the search for novel therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Drug-discovery screen,Innate immunity,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

It is a complex and highly controlled process used to regulate normal gene expression but is often dysregulated in cancer. Compounds that can modulate alternative splicing are currently being explored as a potential new class of therapeutic agent in cancer. This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the splicing process, its regulation, and its impact. The discovery of novel and specific tool compounds that modulate splicing would therefore not only be beneficial in investigating the regulation and dysregulation of splicing in cancer but could also be exploited therapeutically.<br \/>To identify novel regulators of splicing, we generated a cell-based split luciferase screening assay based on alternative splicing of MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein) pre-mRNA. The <i>MCL1<\/i> gene usually produces an mRNA encoding a &#8216;long&#8217; variant (MCL1L) that is an anti-apoptotic protein often highly expressed in cancers. However, in some circumstances, for example following genetic knockdown of splicing factors, a pro-apoptotic &#8216;short&#8217; variant (MCL1S) is expressed as a result of exon-skipping.<br \/>Here we engineered the human NSCLC cell line NCI-H1299 to express a luminescent-tagged version of the MCL1S splice variant to monitor its induction upon spliceosome modulation. Using this engineered cell line, we screened an unannotated library of 12,000 compounds selected to have low molecular weights and favorable properties for cellular uptake. The screen had an average Z&#8217; value of 0.89 over 45 microplates, indicating high assay robustness. Hits were identified as any compound with a luminescence of greater than the average + two standard deviations of the screening dataset. The compounds were validated by repetition in the screening assay, giving 34 candidate hits that were then triaged by qPCR assay to confirm splicing modulation of <i>MCL1<\/i>. One interesting hit was found to increase mRNA and cellular protein levels of MCL1S and induced altered splicing across the transcriptome that was distinct from the splicing profiles of a diverse panel of splicing modulators, including compounds targeting SF3B1, CLK, and RBM39. In addition, treatment with this hit compound resulted in accumulation of the splicing factor SC35 in cytoplasmic granules, an unusual phenotype not seen with known splicing modulators, that could explain the distinct splicing modulation we have observed.<br \/>Deconvolution and further characterization of screening hits and potentially unique new mechanisms of action could improve current understanding of alternative splicing and its regulation in NSCLC. The discovery of novel compounds to expand our current toolset of splicing modulators will be key in building the foundation for future splicing targeted drug discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spliceosome,Screening,Mcl-1,Splice variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Accordingly, there is a critical need to develop methods for efficient testing drug efficacy to discover new therapeutic targets. 3D cancer models are highly valuable tools for cancer research and drug development. However, the complexity of performing 3D assays remains a hurdle for adopting these methods for compound screening. To alleviate the bottlenecks that come with labor-intensive manual protocols we developed cell culture automation methods using CellXpress.ai instrument. The instrument enables automation of 2D or 3D culture for prolonged complex workflows. The CellXpress.ai provides automated plating, passaging, media exchanges, monitoring organoids, alone with compound treatment and the end point assays with high content image analysis. In the present study we describe full automation of imaging, analysis, and cell culture process which enables scaling up complex 3D cell-based assays and compound screening. As an example of 3D protocol, we automated culture and imaging of colorectal cancer 3D spheroids formed from HCT116 cell line in U-shape low attachment plates. HCT116 cells were expanded in 2D, then spheroids were formed after automated dispensing of cell suspension into U-shape 96 or 384 plates. After 48h spheroids were treated with 12 anti-cancer compounds, at multiple concentrations for 3-5 days, then stained and imaged. Cell plating, compound additions, media exchange, and staining were performed automatically by CellXpressAI instrument. During the culture spheroids were monitored using transmitted light, with immediate analysis of phenotypic changes, including inhibition of growth or spheroid disintegration. For endpoint assay spheroids were stained with combination of Hoechst nuclear stain and viability dyes Calcein AM and EtHD, then imaged, and analyzed for multiple read-outs including spheroid size, marker intensities, and live-dead cell scoring. We observed concentration-dependent inhibition of spheroid growth and cell death in response to anti-cancer compounds and evaluated effective compound concentrations for cytotoxic or cytostatic effects. Cell culture process automation for 3D assays, powered by imaging and image analysis has a potential to bring 3D biology into another level, allowing to increase throughput and reproducibility, and enabling variety of high throughput drug discovery and precision medicine applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,Assay development,High-throughput assay,High-content screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Such inhibitors are characterized by non-linear progress curves: after an initial inhibited velocity, a rate constant governs the transition to a final steady-state reaction rate of the inhibited enzyme. A final rate of zero indicates irreversible inhibition, whereas a non-zero final rate indicates slow-binding inhibition. Characterizing these inhibitory modes of action is enabled with a continuous assay format that avoids the common pitfalls and misleading results seen with end-point assays. A continuous assay format enables efficient and robust determination of the kinetic parameters required to drive structure-activity relationship optimization to streamline the development of more effective drugs. It is important to note that simple IC<sub>50<\/sub>s for TDIs will not suffice, and can, indeed, also be misleading. We have developed a robust three-step workflow based on kinetic catalytic activity measurements to quickly identify and characterize TDIs. First, dose-response experiments are conducted with and without an enzyme-inhibitor preincubation step. The curvature of the reaction progress curve in the non-preincubated experiment and a shift in IC<sub>50<\/sub> from the preincubated experiment are indicative of TDI. In the absence of TDI, simple IC<sub>50<\/sub>s are reported with, if possible, K<sub>i<\/sub> values. If TDI is present, a second experiment is conducted to assess compound reversibility using either a jump-dilution protocol or a novel free-compound clearance method that uses gel filtration spin columns or spin plates. In either protocol, forward progress curve analysis is used to monitor the recovery of enzymatic activity after dilution of inhibitor in solution. Lastly, the potency of the inhibitor is evaluated using kinetic experiments tailored to the nature of the inhibition &#8211; either reversible or irreversible. If reversible, then the rate constant from the reversibility experiment is used to determine the residence time of the molecule. If irreversible, then a 24-point dose-response experiment with serial 1.5-fold dilutions is performed, and all the progress curves are globally fit to determine k<sub>inact<\/sub>\/K<sub>I<\/sub>, and, if possible, k<sub>inact<\/sub> and K<sub>I<\/sub> separately.

The most common remedy for edge effect is to avoid using edge wells altogether, which eliminates 37% of the plate from the assay. If all of those wells could be used, an estimated USD $119M could be saved in research costs annually across the globe. We have shown previously that maintaining constant thermal control of plating conditions reduces variability in stem cell toxicity assays. Here, we ask the question: can we use the edge wells in cancer screening assays if we control thermal changes that happen in the traditional lab as cells are plated at room temperature and incubated at 37 degrees C? We had the null hypothesis that including the edge wells would add variability to an A549 cytotoxicity assay, even if the cell handling and incubation temperatures were matched and held constant. We plated A549 cells at either room temperature (like a BSC) or at 37 degrees C using the Xvivo System, which maintains constant temperature, oxygen, CO2, and relative humidity levels around cell handling operations. The cells were treated with serial dilutions of peracetic acid\/hydrogen peroxide solution. After incubation for 3 days, the plates were stained with Crystal Violet and assessed for cell density (n=3 separate experiments). The null hypothesis was disproven. We found that if the plates were maintained at 37 degrees C during cell handling as well as incubation, that cell distribution was random and even across all wells, even edge wells. We found that there was no statistical difference between edge well and center well results in cytotoxicity assays. Edge wells were usable without increasing variability in the assays. This is consistent with earlier findings showing that when temperature changes between cell plating and incubation were averted, stem cell distribution across the plate was random and the edge effect was eliminated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxicity,A549 cells,Assay development,In vitro,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This clonal hematopoietic disorder of progenitor and stem cells exhibits aggressive behavior, and despite initial remission, recurrence is common<sup>1<\/sup>. The conventional shift from chemotherapy to monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been hindered by the absence of AML-specific antigens. Notably, CD33, expressed strongly in 80-90% of AML cells, has become a target for gemtuzumab-ozogamicin (Mylotarg), the sole FDA approved ADC for AML treatment<sup>2<\/sup>. While advancements in understanding AML molecular mechanisms have influenced clinical approaches, the lack of clinically representative models hinders therapeutic progress. Existing models, both in vivo and ex vivo, struggle to capture the heterogeneity and complexity of AML<sup>3<\/sup>. Addressing this, we present our proprietary assay, Champions AML VitroScreen&#174;<sup>4<\/sup>, designed for testing therapeutic candidates in primary AML samples. Our diverse bank of deeply characterized AML samples encompasses multiple subtypes, allowing evaluation of therapeutic responses through cell viability, proliferation, and clonal composition analyses. To validate our novel assay, we employed the VitroScreen platform to test Mylotarg across various AML subtypes, considering CD33 expression levels. By assessing more than 20 AML models, we determined the IC50 for Mylotarg and observed dose-dependent responses, where sensitivity to the drugh correlated with CD33 expression. Through multiple endpoints, including viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and phenotyping, we categorized primary AML models as responders, low responders, or resistant, establishing a strong positive correlation between Mylotarg sensitivity and CD33 expression. Our innovative approach, utilizing deeply characterized AML patient samples in the AML VitroScreen&#174; platform, facilitates high-throughput drug testing. This system, serving as an ideal clinical translational setting in preclinical research, holds promise for developing tailored therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, this approach could significantly impact patient outcomes by offering improved strategies for both primary and recurrent AML cases.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The ADAR1 gene encodes both a universally expressed isoform (p110) and an interferon-inducible isoform (p150), which plays a role in innate immunity by mediating interferon signaling. In the context of healthy, uninfected cells, ADAR1 performs A-to-I editing on endogenous double-stranded RNA to prevent it from activating downstream dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, which in-turn activate a pro-inflammatory response. Loss of function mutations in ADAR1 result in aberrant activation of the dsRNA sensors and are involved in autoimmune disorders. ADAR1 dysfunction also impacts cancer cell growth, proliferation, and response to immunotherapy. ADAR1 expression is increased in several types of cancer and ADAR1 knock-out has been demonstrated to improve the response to certain immunotherapies such PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade and to circumvent tumor immunotherapy resistance mechanisms, making ADAR1 an attractive target for therapeutic development. We have developed and validated a high-throughput, cell-based assay for measuring ADAR1 editing activity. Several ADAR editing reporter constructs were designed and evaluated for their relative response to ADAR1 over-expression. They all feature an ADAR1 hairpin target with a stop codon (UAG) which is susceptible to ADAR1-mediated editing to a tryptophan (UUG), located upstream of a firefly luciferase gene. We show that increasing transient expression of ADAR1 led to proportional increased activity of the downstream firefly luciferase, indicating dose-dependent transcript editing by ADAR1. Selected reporters were used in conjunction with ADAR2 overexpression to identify an ADAR1-biased reporter. Thus, a reporter with low luciferase activity in response to ADAR2 expression was chosen to establish stable HEK293 cell lines (which express low levels of ADAR1) with and without constitutively expressed ADAR1 protein. ADAR1-overexpressing HEK293 cells displayed high luciferase activity, in accordance with high ADAR1-mediated editing of the reporter transcript, which was decreased in response to siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAR1 expression or pharmacological inhibition of ADAR1 activity. Sequencing of the reporter RNA confirmed that changes in reporter activity were correlated with editing of the RNA transcript. Finally, these validated ADAR1 editing reporter cell lines were further engineered to constitutively express Renilla luciferase under the control of a CMV promoter, serving as an internal control for the toxicity of ADAR1 inhibitors. In conclusion, our robust cell-based assay provides a well-validated resource to identify modulators of ADAR1 editing activity in a cellular context.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,RNA,Assay development,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

These mutagenic U\/G mispairs are, however, corrected by error-free base repair (BER) initiated by uracil-DNA glycosylases. SMUG1 (single-strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase), as one of the major glycosylases, removes uracil and oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. In spite of the name, SMUG1 removes uracil also from double-stranded DNA. Unrepaired by SMUG1 U\/G mispairs are mutagenic, and alterations in SMUG1 expression levels have been linked to cancer development. Low SMUG1 transcripts are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and SMUG1 loss has been shown to cause PARPi resistance in HR-deficient background. Hence, tools describing SMUG1 activities in DNA damage response may provide new approaches for cancer cell treatment. We report here the development, optimization and validation of an assay measuring the activity of SMUG1. The new assay is based on the STRIDE platform technology, which enables direct and sensitive detection of single- or double-strand DNA breaks in situ, in fixed cells. sSTRIDE-SMUG1 assay detects DNA nicks localized in close proximity to the SMUG1 protein and can thus be utilized as a direct reporter of its activity. The experiments were performed in HAP1 cells. First, in untreated cells we have shown that the sSTRIDE-SMUG1 signals constitute ca. 1-2% of total single-strand DNA breaks foci detected by the classic sSTRIDE assay variant, while the negative controls have shown that the number of false-positive foci does not exceed 15% of the total number of signals. As expected, treatment of cells with a cytotoxic nucleotide hydroxymethyl-deoxyuridine (hmdU) resulted in an increase in the number of detected sSTRIDE-SMUG1 signals. To verify the specificity of the assay, SMUG1 was knocked-down in HAP1 wild-type cells using siRNA and then the level of sSTRIDE-SMUG1 signals was measured in both untreated and hmdU-treated cells. In all tested conditions, SMUG1 expression silencing has resulted in a decrease in sSTRIDE-SMUG1 foci. We believe that the sSTRIDE-SMUG1 assay can prove to be a very useful solution to study DNA repair mechanisms involving aberrant base excision. Additionally, sSTRIDE-SMUG1 measurements may be of the utmost importance in characterization of agents inducing synthetic lethality or trapping BER intermediates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Base excision repair,PARP inhibitors,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

New chemical entities (NCEs) that specifically interfere with a transcription factor (TF) at any level should induce and be detectable based on selective effects on their primary biochemical activity - i.e., the transcriptional activation of specific target genes. However, the definition of direct targets of a TF and, more generally, the unbiased detection of direct transcriptional effects has remained challenging due to the limited time resolution of conventional techniques for gene perturbation and transcriptional profiling. To overcome this limitation, QUANTRO Therapeutics relies on SLAMseq technology that, by metabolic labeling de novo-synthesized RNA immediately after intervention and conserving the information for later readout, provides unprecedent time-resolution in transcriptomic analysis.<br \/>Aiming to target previously undruggable targets, we set out to first build definitive knowledge around their direct effect on transcription, inducing their quick protein degradation through the auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology followed by immediate transcriptional readout though SLAMseq -before any secondary, confounding effect could appear in the cell.<br \/>The targets&#180; mRNA fingerprints produced are then used as a reference and cross-compared with existing and new chemical entities to:<br \/>(i) benchmark the real mode of action of existing drugs; (ii) identify new drug candidates that specifically interfere with disease-causing transcriptional programs in cancer; (iii) interrogate the efficiency, selectivity, and potency of drug candidates during Hit-validation and Hit-to-Lead activities.<br \/>Proof of concept data demonstrated that time-resolved transcriptional profiling can reveal drugs&#180; mode of action with unprecedent precision and sensitivity, when drugs act on Targets that have a direct effect on transcriptional regulation - such as TFs and signaling pathways. Building on this knowledge, QUANTRO Therapeutics unleashed the unique potential of mRNA fingerprinting technology for HTS-compatible drug discovery by (1) establishing scalable and automated workflows for metabolic RNA labeling, treatment of cells, and RNA extraction; (2) developing algorithms for combinatorial mRNA fingerprint-readout that allow for the simultaneous assessment of TF signatures by multiplexed targeted RNA sequencing (QUANTROseq), thus transforming the precision and scope of cell-based compound screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Targeted therapy,Drug-discovery screen,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arianna Sabò<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nina Fasching Griesmayr<sup>1<\/sup>, Tobias Neumann<sup>1<\/sup>, Raphael Manzenreither<sup>1<\/sup>, Maja Ivankovic<sup>1<\/sup>, Rodrigo Pacheco Valamatos Costa<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Rieser<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Scinicariello<sup>1<\/sup>, Petr Triska<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Stingeder<sup>1<\/sup>, Astrid Gruss<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Cubero<sup>1<\/sup>, Olga Frank<sup>1<\/sup>, Ivica Sowemimo<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Kirchgatterer<sup>2<\/sup>, Adriana Cantoran<sup>3<\/sup>, Stefan Ameres<sup>4<\/sup>, Johannes Zuber<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Bauer<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>QUANTRO Therapeutics GmbH, Vienna, Austria,<sup>2<\/sup>Research Institue of Molecular Biology, Vienna, Austria,<sup>3<\/sup>St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria,<sup>4<\/sup>Max Perutz Labs, Vienna, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fe7eb05b-5ff2-4d26-b0ef-23b8344e7547","ControlNumber":"3391","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Collecting data on &#62;10 markers at a time is ideal due to deeper cell characterization and assay sensitivity, however, high-marker panels are subject to significant spillover spread from spectrally overlapping fluorophores that compromise data quality, standardization, and interpretation. Clinical flow cytometry still relies on the use of multi-tube low-marker (&#60;10) panels that minimize spillover spread and ease analysis and interpretation of results. To improve and expand the clinical utility of flow cytometry, there is a need for higher marker measurements without use of highly overlapping fluorophores, which would also serve to streamline the use of samples and reagents.<br \/>Here, we present the development of a novel barcoding method using micron-sized laser particles (LPs) that confer an optical signature to individual cells at high-throughput, enabling tracking of cells through multiple passes in a flow cytometer. This process is possible using a custom cytometer equipped to detect LPs and capture samples. Sequential staining of samples with releasing or photobleaching antibodies\/fluors between cycles enables merging of multiple smaller panels that each have minimal spillover, resulting in a high-marker dataset with drastic reduction in spillover compared to conventional single-acquisition flow cytometry.<br \/>We demonstrate the utility of this technology through three different assays. Human PBMCs were barcoded with LPs and stained with 1) a panel of releasable antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec, 10 markers, 2 passes), 2) a laboratory-designed panel that utilized photobleaching (32 markers, 3 passes), and 3) a panel of dried and validated DuraClone antibodies that utilized photobleaching (Beckman Coulter, 18 markers, 2 passes). For each assay, cells were stained, acquired, photobleached\/released, captured, re-stained, re-acquired and steps were repeated either once (for 2 passes) or twice (for 3 passes). In all cases, we found drastically reduced spillover, better data quality, and identified the same cell subtypes detected by conventional flow cytometry. Reproducibility was high across multiple (3+) replicates with CVs &#60;30% among all populations with &#62;1% frequency of total. New cell populations were identified that would not be possible with separate acquisitions of each pass.<br \/>Recent advances in flow cytometry now allow more markers to be analyzed together, but at the cost of increasing spectral overlap and spillover spread. Multi-pass flow cytometry confines spillover to individual panels, reducing overall interference and simplifying analysis. This enhances data quality and usability while streamlining resources, facilitating the clinical uptake of complex flow cytometry in cancer research, diagnosis, and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Flow cytometry,Immunoassay,Cancer diagnostics,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

This has limited high content screening&#8217;s utility as a high throughput tool, as speed is essential to cancer research at scale. Using a new approach, Araceli Endeavor&#174; offers a solution to this compromise. This system images 96, 384 or 1536 -well high content microplates in under 10 minutes with full well coverage and sub-micron resolution, enabling high content screening at high throughput speeds without compromising resolution or coverage. Paired with the Clairvoyance&#8482; analysis software, plates are analyzed at similar speeds, going from images to object-level data in 5-25 minutes. As with any new technology, validation is needed. Here we validate Endeavor and Clairvoyance at the level of the bioassay, using a range of common high content assays across different modalities. Assays are chosen to quantifiably demonstrate sensitivity, breadth, and broad applicability. Performance was benchmarked by using well-characterized compounds, matching published EC50\/IC50 values when possible. We examined submicron-level nuclear spot counting, measuring histone yH2Ax and micronuclei formation after genotoxic insult. Intensity-based assays include cellular positivity, here live\/dead, and subcellular translocation with transcription factor NF&#922;B after induction with cytokines Il1b and TNF&#945;. Looking at cytosolic vesicle aggregation, we measured autophagic flux with two distinct modalities, comparative imaging and analysis of live cell dye and immunohistochemistry-based detection yielded consistent EC50 values between methods. Overall, these assays yield consistent, robust results corresponding to literature values, showing the importance of full well coverage and resolution. We demonstrate how assays that formerly took hours can be effectively imaged and analyzed without sacrificing quality in 10-30 minutes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-06 Novel assay technology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-content screening,High-throughput assay,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

More effective therapies are therefore required to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with CRC. Here, we developed a selective and better anticancer drug delivery of CPT through conjugation to a peptide (TH19P01) that targets Sortilin (SORT1), a scavenging receptor expressed in various tumor tissues including CRC. In the current study, significant SORT1 expression was detected in various CRC cell lines as well as that of irinotecan analogs efflux pump (ABCG2) in LoVo and HT-29 cells. Considering this result, we used our proprietary peptide conjugation SORT1 technology to increase cell targeting selectivity and cell delivery efficacy of CPT analogs. Different peptide drug conjugates (PDCs) were generated linking the TH19P01 peptide to SN-38 (an irinotecan metabolite) or exatecan, which are two main CPT derivatives used in recent antibody drug conjugates (ADC) as payloads. <i>In vitro<\/i>, immunonofluorescent microscopy revealed that TH19P01 was rapidly internalized (&#60;15 min) in a SORT1-positive human HT-29 CRC cell model. These PDCs also inhibited CRC cell proliferation at low nM concentrations (3-90 nM). <i>In vivo<\/i>, weekly administration of TH2101 (SN-38) and of TH2303 (exatecan) conjugates were well tolerated as they had little impact on mouse body weight but caused a more potent growth inhibition of the HT-29 CRC tumor xenograft model than did either unconjugated irinotecan or exatecan molecules. In fact, at their maximum tolerable dose, irinotecan and exatecan caused a tumor growth inhibition of only 48% and 45% whereas TH2101 and TH2303 inhibited the growth of HT-29 tumors by 83% and 91%, respectively.

Liver diseases, including viral infections, cancer and metabolic disorders account for about 2 million deaths annually, worldwide (1). Current models for studying liver biology and drug metabolism include 2D cultured primary cells\/ cell lines, which do not represent the metabolic and structural complexity of human tissue. <i>In vivo<\/i> models for liver diseases are time consuming, cost prohibitive and often ineffective. Therefore, better tissue mimetic liver models are needed. Organoids are self-assembled 3D cultured cellular units that may mimic the corresponding human tissue structurally and functionally (2). Patient derived organoids (PDO) are developed from tissue of specific patients and may resemble the source tissue in molecular features, including recapitulation of patient specific responses to therapies. Here, we report development and characterization of novel liver PDO lines from vendor-sourced cryopreserved tissue. We have developed biobanks of undifferentiated as well as differentiated liver PDO models.Human cadaver-sourced liver tissue were obtained with explicit donor consent. Liver PDO were generated following modification of a previously established protocol (3). Briefly, samples were minced, digested to single cells, and filtered. Specific number of cells were mixed with diluted Matrigel (Corning) and added as small drops on cell culture plates and grown in liver PDO specific growth media. Whenever appropriate, PDO were differentiated by culturing in differentiation-specific media in multi-well plates. In all cases, PDO were monitored using brightfield microscopy (Olympus CK40) and live cell imaging (Muvicyte, Perkin Elmer); and passaged every 6-8 days. Undifferentiated PDO were cryopreserved\/ thawed following in-house SOP to confirm viability. Liver-specific biomarker expression in the PDO lines were confirmed by confocal microscopy (ImageExpress, Molecular Devices). PDO lines were also assayed for ALT activity, albumin production and urea. PDO were cleared for microbial\/ viral contamination and confirmed as unique lines using single tandem repeat analyses. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed using vendor services. So far, we have successfully generated 3 liver PDO lines, both undifferentiated as well as differentiated. Our liver PDO lines would be highly useful in understanding liver biology and disease models; and will have significant usage in drug testing, including DMPK and ADME\/Tox studies. Future efforts would include scaling up, development of liver specific assays and developing PDO from specific liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, MASLD and NASH.

In the US, 1 out of 8 women may expect to be diagnosed with BC In their lifetime. Current models for studying BC tumor biology and BC drug discovery include 2D cultured cell lines and patient derived xenografts (PDX). As 2D cultured cells do not represent the 3D complexity of human tissue, and PDX models are time consuming and cost prohibitive, better tissue mimetic models are needed. Organoids are self-assembled 3D cultured cellular units that may mimic the corresponding human tissue structurally and functionally (1). Patient derived organoids (PDO) are developed from tissue of specific patients and may resemble the source tissue in molecular features, including recapitulation of patient specific responses to therapies (2). Here, we report development and characterization of novel breast PDO lines from fresh (&#8804;24h post-surgery) and cryopreserved (&#8804;7 days post-surgery) tissue. Breast tumor and normal, tumor adjacent (NTA) tissue were sourced from consented patients. Breast PDO were generated following modifications to a published protocol (3). Briefly, tissue samples were minced, digested with collagenase, and filtered. The filtrate was resuspended in Matrigel (Corning) and small drops were added on cell culture plates. Both tumor and NTA PDO were cultured using the same media and organoids were monitored using brightfield microscopy (Olympus CK40) and live cell imaging (Muvicyte, Perkin Elmer). PDO lines were analyzed for expression and distribution of important breast-specific biomarkers using confocal microscopy (ImagExpress, Molecular Devices). PDO lines displayed hormone receptors (ER, PR), cell surface (EpCAM, CD49f), cytoskeletal (cytokeratin 14, 19, E-cadherin, vimentin) and cell proliferation (Ki67) markers. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed using vendor services (Azenta). PDO were also tested for their susceptibility to breast cancer drugs, e.g., Tamoxifen, chlorambucil and Docetaxel. We have successfully generated one NTA ER<sup>+<\/sup>\/ PR<sup>+<\/sup>\/ HER2<sup>-<\/sup> PDO line and one tumor ER<sup>+<\/sup>\/ PR<sup>+<\/sup>\/ HER2<sup>-<\/sup> PDO line from different donors. Our breast PDO lines would be highly useful in understanding tumor biology, BC progression, signal transduction, and drug discovery\/ testing. Future efforts would include process scaling up and development of BC specific assays. References:1.Zhao et al., 2022. STAR Protocols 2.Bleijs, M. et al., 2019. EMBO J3.Dekkers et al., 2021.
