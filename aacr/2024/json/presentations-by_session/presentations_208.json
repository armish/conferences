[{"Abstract":"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors are a class of cytotoxic small molecules that have demonstrated effectiveness as therapeutic agents in cancer. However, the broad clinical application has been hindered by poor pharmacokinetic profiles and off-target toxicities. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) enable the targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads by specifically targeting cell-surface antigens expressed on cancers reducing systemic exposure and toxicity. TOP1-ADCs have received FDA approval for HER2- (trastuzumab-deruxtecan) and Trop2- (sacituzumab-govitecan) expressing solid tumors, demonstrating the promise for this drug class to improve the lives of patients. We have developed a novel drug-linker using a potent TOP1 inhibitor with desirable ADME properties, and a hydrophilic glycoside linker as a platform technology enabling ADCs with favorable physicochemical and biological properties. The TOP1 inhibitor payload was optimized for potency, with reduced P-glycoprotein efflux and enhanced permeability. The hydrophilicity of the linker facilitates the development of highly loaded ADCs (8 drugs\/mAb) with high plasma stability, low aggregation, and pharmacokinetics similar to parental antibody. The resultant ADCs are potent and immunologically specific with activity in multidrug-resistant tumor models and bystander activity in heterogenous antigen models. Human cancer cell derived xenograft models demonstrated potent and specific ADC anti-tumor activity with several targets and indications. Improved activity was observed compared to corresponding govitecan- and deruxtecan-based ADCs. ADCs prepared from this drug-linker technology were well tolerated in rats after repeat administration of 60 mg\/kg every 4 days for 4 doses. The excellent anti-tumor activity in several models and favorable safety profile demonstrates this platform TOP1 drug-linker technology has the potential for development as ADCs against many cancer targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Targeting sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways can overcome drug resistance in HCC. In this study, we co-loaded SHH inhibitor, cyclopamine (CPA) and paclitaxel (PTX) in a novel polymeric nanomicellar drug delivery system (M-CPA\/PTX), to overcome the drug resistance in HCC tumor models.<br \/>Method: The combinational effect <i>in vitro<\/i> was studied by treating HCC with CPA and PTX. The combinational index was calculated using CalcuSyn Biosoft software to determine the additive or synergistic effect of the combination. Three formulations (F0, F5, and F16) were selected for further testing based on formulation optimization using central composition design (CCD). The storage stability of M-CPA\/PTXs at room temperature and 4 &#176;C was evaluated by measuring the changes in micelle size, PDI, and encapsulation efficiency (EE) over pre-determined periods. In the pharmacokinetics (PK) study, nude mice were IP-injected with 5 mg\/kg of PTX equivalent F0 and F16. Additionally, the toxicity of F0 was investigated using healthy Sprague Dawley rats, in which rats were intravenously injected with a single F0 dose of 1, 2, and 4 mg\/kg\/drug of M-CPA\/PTX.<br \/>Results: Combinational effect study suggested that CPA and PTX, demonstrated synergistic effect in Hep3B and HepG2 cells compared to the mono-treatment, thus overcoming resistance. F0, F5, and F16 exhibited particle sizes of 75.27 &#177; 1.06, 54.63 &#177; 0.85, and 70.63 &#177; 3.39 nm, respectively. The release kinetics of both drugs from these micelles displayed significantly slow-release profiles from the micelles, with less than 10% cumulative release within 24 hours in plasma. The stability study indicated that both drugs' micelle size and EE were not appreciably changed over 6 weeks at room temperature and 4 &#176;C. Notably, the biodistribution studies showed that F16 achieved significantly greater accumulations of CPA in the liver, kidney, and spleen compared to F0 (P &#60; 0.05). Additionally, the maximal tolerable dose of F0 in rats was 4 mg\/kg\/drug for the M-CPA\/PTX combination, which did not result in treatment-related mortality.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of CPA and PTX offered promising synergistic effects on HCC treatment. F0, F5, and F16 were developed and characterized with the desired physicochemical properties and demonstrated controlled release characteristics for both payloads, suggesting their potential for sustained drug delivery in HCC therapy. Enhanced liver accumulation of F16 suggested favorable biodistribution for the site of action. Lastly, the safe toxicity profile supports the first choice of F0 among other lead candidates for further pre-clinical efficacy studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Drug delivery,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Doxorubicin formulations have marginally improved its therapeutic efficacy while suffering from difficult and costly manufacturing, poor characterization and quality control, limited scalability in production, and disappointingly low drug loading. This study employs DNA fragments extracted from the salmon sperm cells, which is known for high biocompatibility in various biomedical application, to self-assemble via intercalation by doxorubicin. DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes are easy in manufacturing, high scalability, straightforward characterization and quantification, and efficiency in drug loading. Doxorubicin and DNA fragments were dissolved in water and mixed at the optimized 1:6 weight ratio, followed by stirring and incubation for 30 min. DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes were characterized for doxorubicin loading and release, size, surface charge, and morphology by UV\/fluorescence spectroscopy, stable isotope tracer ultrafiltration assay (SITUA), dynamic light scattering particle analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The anticancer efficacy of the DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes were tested in vitro and in vivo using syngeneic and PDX tumor models. Along with PD\/PK studies, DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes were also evaluated for their systemic and cardiac toxicity. Characterization and quantification studies revealed DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes to be relatively monodisperse with a size of 40 nm in diameter, efficient for drug encapsulation (~100%) and drug loading (14.3%, w\/w), and stable for storage while readily releasing doxorubicin in a cell. The self-assembled nanocomplexes were formed when doxorubicin inter- and intra-molecularly chelated DNA fragments. DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes were more efficient in killing cancer cells in vitro than both doxorubicin and the liposomal doxorubicin Doxil. PD\/PK studies demonstrated that DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes circulated longer with less accumulation in the heart than doxorubicin, which altogether lower toxicity. A repeated administration of the DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes to Sprague-Dawley rats exhibited a substantially lower cardiotoxicity score than that of doxorubicin. The improved anti-tumor efficacy of the DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes were finally confirmed using a syngeneic lymphoma mouse model and PDX mouse models of triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers. Complexing doxorubicin with DNA fragments addresses the current technological challenges in achieving an efficient and safe therapy for a broad range of cancers. DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes are amenable to rigorous chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) evaluation with proven anti-cancer efficacy and improved safety profiles. Clinical trials on DNA\/DOX nanocomplexes for cancer chemotherapy are warranted to fully validate their clinical utilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Drug delivery,Nanoparticle,Safety,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Therefore, we aimed to develop a biocompatible delivery of taxol (TAX) delivery vector system for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A basic backbone, TAX loaded poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) PHBV nanoparticle (PHBV-TAX-NPs), were designed and prepared via sonochemical method. The pH-responsive shell of PHBV-TAX-NPs was formed by oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine (PDA) in an alkaline environment. The HCC-targeted peptide SP94 binds to PDA-coated nanoparticles (NPs) through the Michael reaction. Moreover, the nanoparticle surface-grafted SP94 peptide serve as a specific ligand for targeting HCC. The chemical structures and properties of these nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering-autosizer, differential scanning calorimetry, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. As expected, excellent targeting of these SP94-PDA-PHBV-TAX-NPs was demonstrated by cellular uptake and cytotoxicity experiments in HCC cells. Compared with that of free TAX, the SP94-PDA-PHBV-TAX-NPs showed more superior antitumor efficacy in the xenograft mouse model. Notably, the SP94-PDA-PHBV-TAX-NPs were except for their potent anticancer activity, it was less toxic <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> compared to TAX in mice.

These hurdles are particularly evident in the context of the immunosuppressive milieu characterizing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Chemo-immuno-therapeutic synergies, notably those provoking immunogenic cell death (ICD), have demonstrated superior efficacy. This investigation delves into Pt-NHC as a type II ICD inducer to surmount immunosuppression and amplify antitumor immunity within a highly tumor-accumulated liposomal drug delivery system. Additionally, the co-administration of the angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, mitigates desmoplasia in PDAC, further augmenting the efficacy of immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: To address the constraints of IL-2, a lipid-coated nanogel, IL2-Pt@Nanogel, was innovated, amalgamating silk fibroin-loaded IL-2 with Pt-NHC. The nanogel aimed to enhance IL-2 pharmacokinetics and optimize tumor targeting. Concurrently, losartan was employed to alleviate desmoplasia within the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Result: The chemoimmunotherapy nanogel, when coupled with losartan, showcased therapeutic potential in murine models of desmoplastic PDAC. Pt-NHC induced ER-localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DAMP release, reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment by repolarizing M2-type macrophages to M1 and diminishing the regulatory T-cell population. Co-delivery of IL-2 and Pt-NHC in the nanogel enhanced T-cell infiltration and activation, curbing tumor progression in primary and liver metastasized PDAC models. Importantly, the addition of losartan reduced collagen accumulation within tumors, resulting in heightened infiltration of effector T cells and more pronounced suppression of tumor growth in PDAC and metastasized liver.<br \/>Conclusion: This study introduces an innovative nanogel delivery system (IL2-Pt@Nanogel) for chemoimmunotherapy, effectively addressing the challenges associated with IL-2 therapy. Leveraging the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the nanogel improves IL-2 stability and tumor delivery. Pt-NHC incorporation induces ICD, reshaping the tumor microenvironment, and in synergy with losartan, elicits robust anticancer immunity. This strategy holds promise for clinical translation as a secure and efficient treatment for immunosuppressive and desmoplastic cancers, such as PDAC, presenting a distinctive therapeutic avenue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Liposomes,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

A study was also initiated for cancer cases and controls in British Columbia (BC Cancer) with at least one prescription of disulfiram from 1996-2022 (PharmaNET), patients treated with immune-modulating therapies (BC Cancer), and outcome of death (Vital Statistics).<br \/>Results: Liposomes encapsulating Cu(DDC)<sub>2 <\/sub>had a size of 100 nm and polydispersity of 0.1, and caused a 40% reduction in tumor burden in a MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. In a syngeneic tumor model of breast cancer the response with immune-competent mice was greater than mice lacking immune function, and a cancer vaccination model and the presence of ATP, HMBG1 and surface-exposed calreticulin indicated the presence of ICD.<br \/>Conclusions: Cu(DDC)<sub>2<\/sub> was formulated in liposomes facilitating its parenteral administration, and its anti-cancer activity was found to be due in part to activation of the adaptive immune system through ICD. A case-control study is currently being employed to examine the clinical potential of disulfiram, as a protectant and as an adjuvant with immune-activating therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and anthracyclines to potentially improve efficacy through induction of ICD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Immunogenic cell death,Case-control study,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Various therapeutic approaches to stimulate the immune system have thus been investigated, demonstrating strong anti-tumor immune responses capable of controlling metastasis and preventing recurrence. Nevertheless, existing cancer immunotherapies suffer from several limitations, including inconsistent benefits across cancer types and patients. In recent years, the utilization of peptides for immunotherapy has attracted a great deal of interest due to their ability to mimic protein functionalities while maintaining a high degree of modularity and synthetic reproducibility in their molecular design. However, the clinical translation of otherwise promising peptide-based immunotherapeutics has been hindered due to their significantly weaker binding to target proteins and short half-life in plasma circulation in comparison to their monoclonal antibody counterparts. Nevertheless, these issues can potentially be addressed by conjugation to nanoparticles, which enhances cell binding\/uptake and prolongs circulation. To this end, our group has extensively investigated the use of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers to improve the therapeutic utility of peptides. These dendrimers can facilitate the simultaneous binding of conjugated peptides to multiple cell receptors, resulting in a significantly enhanced binding interaction through the multivalent binding effect. Here, we report an efficient de novo nanoparticle design strategy that combines organic synthesis, phage display, and molecular dynamics to identify a novel immuno-oncology therapeutic modality. We first employed phage display to identify several highly selective sequences that bind to the mouse ortholog of TIGIT&#8212;an inhibitory receptor expressed on lymphocytes that has been identified as a potential therapeutic target to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Subsequent computational modeling (NAMD with CHARMM force field) revealed several conserved regions of interaction that we hypothesize drive favorable binding interactions and enhance the binding affinity of the peptide inhibitors. We next incorporated experimental kinetic measurements of the identified sequences with adaptive evolution computational modeling to identify optimized mutant analogs for dendrimer conjugation. It was found that the TIGIT targeting DPCs (dendrimer-peptide conjugates) demonstrated increased binding avidity <i>in vitro<\/i> and anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo,<\/i> most notably when administered in combination with PD-L1 targeting DPCs to a syngeneic mouse model bearing mouse oral carcinoma (MOC1) tumors. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of rational peptide design and our multi-functional DPC platform for the development of both effective and novel immuno-oncology therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,Drug delivery,Polymer drug conjugate,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

However, there can be confounding batch variability in pharmacological outcome from ADCs of the same drug, antibody, and DAR. Previously, DAR was obtained by quantifying the extent of modification of the intact antibody or its protein subunits. The coupling chemistry is used to infer which type of amino acids were modified but generally no specific sites of modification are identified and if identification is obtained, it is not quantitative. Borrowing the rigorously reproducible proteolytic digestion methods from multi-atribute mapping (MAM) used in monoclonal antibody manufacture, and compiling a comprehensive quantitative assignment of every abundant peptide in the ADC digest we can both calculate a DAR from the ion volume ratios and a quantitative map of the specific modified sites. This method, termed &#8220;siteDAR&#8221;, is applied here to both commercial Kadcyla&#174; (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) and in-house preparations of ado-trastuzumab emtansine. We show that preparations of Kadcyla&#174; with the same DAR can have significantly different quantitative maps of modification sites.

Considering the lack of effective therapies, there is an urgent need to develop new and effective therapeutics to improve the prognosis of patients. CA102N is a carrier-mediated novel anticancer product where hyaluronic acid is conjugated to Nimesulide-NH2. CA102N is currently under development for the treatment of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. CA102N was safe and well tolerated in the first-in-human trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the present study, the <i>in vitro<\/i> anticancer activity of CA102N was investigated in K-ras mutant PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. The antitumor efficacy was also tested <i>in vivo<\/i> in the PANC-1 mice model. Results demonstrated that CA102N inhibits cell growth, cell migration, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation in both K-ras mutant PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells or tumors. Administration of CA102N in PANC-1 xenografts resulted in a dose-dependent and statistically significant decrease in tumor growth at 9.8 mg\/kg and 14.7 mg\/kg Nim equivalents, respectively, compared to the vehicle control group. A significant decrease (80%) in liver metastasis was also noted in the PANC-1 orthotopic mice model at 19.6 mg\/kg Nim equivalents dose level. Mechanistically, CA102N was found to suppress the PI3k\/Akt\/mTOR and Raf\/MEK\/ERK signaling pathways, in addition to reducing the expressions of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader and writer proteins, OCT3\/4 transcription factor and RAS levels <i>in vivo<\/i>. CA102N also modified the tumor stroma and improved drug permeability <i>in vivo.<\/i> Based on this compelling data, CA102N shows promise as a potential treatment for pancreatic cancer. Combination therapies and regimens are currently being explored in <i>in vivo<\/i> models as a strategy for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

Minocycline, a commonly used antibiotic and tetracycline derivative, has proven anti-angiogenic effects and the ability to inhibit tumor growth, making it an effective GBM treatment. Temozolomide is an alkylating antineoplastic agent and the current first-choice chemotherapy agent for GBM. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is widely used as a biomaterial for drug delivery due to its inert properties, great biocompatibility and versatility and has been approved by the FDA. Therefore, the objective of this project is to fabricate electrosprayed minocycline- and temozolomide-loaded PLGA microparticles with optimal morphology, drug loading, loading efficiency, and drug release kinetics for the treatment of GBM. The microparticles were fabricated by electrospraying vertically with a 2ml\/hr flow rate, 14kV voltage, 20 cm distance for minocycline and a 10ml\/hr flow rate, 10kV voltage, 10 cm distance for temozolomide with both collected on a copper\/glass plate. The parameters that were investigated were the chamber humidity, duration of spraying, and the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic polymer. To determine the microparticles&#8217; morphology, bright-field microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. The absorbance measurements at 350 and 327 nm were used to determine drug loading, loading efficiency, and release kinetics for minocycline and temozolomide, respectively. Microparticles with low chamber humidity and duration of spraying were more spherical, less aggregated and easier to collect for both drugs. The addition of PEG to minocycline-loaded microparticles led to higher drug loading and loading efficiency (4.02% &#177; 0.34, 64.30% &#177; 5.47 vs. 3.23% &#177; 0.29, 49.40% &#177; 4.49) as the PEG helps the solubilization of minocycline. Using acetonitrile instead of dichloromethane as the solvent, increased drug loading and loading efficiency (4.72% &#177; 0.76, 70.77 &#177; 11.43 vs. 2.37% &#177; 0.27, 35.62% &#177; 4.09) for temozolomide-loaded microparticles as more temozolomide can be solubilized in acetonitrile. Drug release kinetics demonstrated a burst release of minocycline in the first hour (65.46%). To decrease the burst release, the microparticles can be incorporated into a scaffold or depot. Overall, electrospraying is a promising method to fabricate drug loaded PLGA microparticles with high drug loading, loading efficiency, and right morphology and we determined optimal parameters to successfully fabricate electrosprayed drug loaded PLGA microparticles in the micron size range with high drug loading and loading efficiency compared to the often-used emulsion solvent extraction\/evaporation for microparticle fabrication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Drug delivery,Temozolomide,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The increase in testosterone levels, known as the flare effect, is a major side effect of cancer chemotherapy when TRP is used in a combination regimen. Reports indicate that enhancing the cellular uptake and retention of TRP can improve its biological activity. In this study, TRP conjugates of tris(4-methoxyphenyl) methanol derivatives (TPMs) with optimized hydrophobicity were synthesized by reacting 2-substituted methoxybenzenes with 1,3,5-trioxane, followed by conjugation with TRP and sebacic acid to produce TRP-TPMs derivatives. The hydrophobicity of TRP was optimized by using the appropriate hydrophobic linker attached to the respective TPM to improve cellular uptake. The aim of the current studies was to evaluate the respective antiproliferative effects of the newly synthesized TRP-TPMs, physical mixtures of TPMs and TRP using different cell lines. Our hypothesis was that exposure of cells to TRP-TPMs derivatives can enhance the antiproliferative activities in cells in comparison to respective the physical mixtures and TRP. Antiproliferative studies in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM), human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3), and mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1) were carried out following exposure to the respective compounds. Our findings indicate that TRP-TPMs conjugates, at a concentration of 50 &#181;M, significantly inhibited cell proliferation in CCRF-CEM, SK-OV-3, and 3T3-L1 cells by 21-37%, 24-73%, and 37-56%, respectively, following 72-hour incubation in comparison to the respective physical mixtures and TRP. Conjugation of TRP with the respective derivative of TPMs enhanced antiproliferative activities in all the cells (with no significant differences in cytotoxicity) compared to the physical mixtures of TPMs and TRP.

One promising approach is microwaved-induced hyperthermia, which has shown great antitumor and synergistic effects when combined with other therapies. The application of microwaves produces heat by dielectric hysteresis which depends on the dielectric properties of molecules. Ionic liquids (ILs) are compounds composed of ions with &#60;100 &#176;C melting point and have strong dielectric properties. In short, <i>we propose<\/i> the creation of microwave-sensitive nanoparticles using IL, enabling precise hyperthermia induction with low-powered microwaves in localized areas. To achieve this, we stabilize a core composed of 1-butyl-methylimidazolium bromide or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate using Span 80, Tween 20, and Triton-X as surfactants, along with phosphatidylcholine lipids as &#8220;cosurfactants&#8221;. Employing a double emulsion procedure for fabrication, nanoparticles are characterized using dynamic light scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we assess microwave sensitivity by comparing thermal changes between liposomes loaded with 120 mM and 250 mM NaCl solutions. Subsequently, we evaluate biocompatibility and heat effects by incubating IL nanoparticles with BXPC3 and KPC cells, monitoring cell viability through MTT assays. We aim to confine the ILs within the nanoparticle core rather than incorporating them into the membrane. We anticipate increased microwave sensitivity, translating to reduced off-target effects and enhanced precision in hyperthermia treatment. This research holds promise for improving the therapeutic outcomes of pancreatic cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Liposomes,Hyperthermia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

KRAS is frequently mutated and plays a vital role in many tumors. Receptor expressed in lymphoid tissue (RELT), also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 19-like, is upregulated in certain tumors such as lung and pancreatic tumors and is a potential tumor target. To selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to tumor, we loaded mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes with a siRNA against KRAS and surface-modified them with the RELTpep-KLA peptide comprising a RELT-binding peptide (CRQTKN, named RELTpep) and proapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAKKLAKLAK, named KLA). Exosomes were isolated from cell culture medium using ultracentrifugation and transfected with the KRAS siRNA using a lipid-based reagent and then surfaced-modified with the RELTpep-KLA using a phospholipid-based membrane anchor. Compared with control peptide-KLA, RELTpep-KLA-targeted MSC-exosomes were more efficiently internalized into A549 lung tumor and Panc-1 pancreatic tumor cells expressing RELT on their surface and exhibited cytotoxicity to these tumor cells. RELTpep-KLA-targeted and KRAS siRNA-loaded MSC-exosomes reduced the phosphorylation of Erk and exhibited an enhanced cytotoxicity in A549 and Panc-1 tumor cells. Moreover, when intravenously injected, they inhibited tumor growth in Balb\/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous Panc-1 human tumor xenografts more efficiently than those loaded with control siRNA or modified with control peptide-KLA. These results demonstrate that RELTpep-KLA-targeted MSC-exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA hold a potential for exosome-based targeted therapy against cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Peptides,KRAS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

There is a need for more effective therapy with lower side effects, especially for advanced scenarios. Unlike normal epithelial prostate cells, cancerous ones show reduced zinc (Zn) levels due to ZIP1 zinc transporter downregulation. Zn deficiency allows m-aconitase to remain active, making prostate cancer cells energy efficient and grow. High levels of Zn are needed to inhibit m-aconitase, the enzyme responsible for the first reaction in the Krebs cycle. This study aims to induce energy starvation and cell death of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting m-aconitase using the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting liposomal zinc.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Methods: <\/b>Liposomes were prepared by standard reverse phase evaporation method with DSPC, Cholesterol and DSPE-mPEG(2000) lipids. Zinc chloride was used to load Zn<sup>+2<\/sup> into liposome following passive loading method. PSMA-expressing (PC3-PIP) and PSMA-null (PC3-LUC) human prostate cancer cells were used for in vitro studies. In the cell uptake study, cells were incubated with Dil-dye labeled liposomes for 2 hours before analyzing them by microscopy and flow cytometry. For the uptake inhibition study, cells were pre-incubated with PSMA-specific peptide for 2 hours before incubation with liposomes. Cytotoxicity studies were performed with PSMA-targeting Zn-loaded liposomes in PC3-PIP cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We conjugated the PSMA-specific peptide and control peptide (ASP3) with DSPE-PEG(3400)-NHS, and used them at various amounts (1 to 4 mol% of total lipid) to prepare Zn-loaded PSMA-targeting liposomes (TL) and control liposomes (CL), respectively. The average hydrodynamic diameter of all the liposomes was 120 to 130 nm, and zeta potential ranged from -16 to -12 mV. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of Zn<sup>+2<\/sup> were 0.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Cellular uptake studies showed a higher accumulation of PSMA-targeting liposome (TL) compared to non-targeting liposome (CL) in PSMA-expressing PC3 cells, whereas both liposomes showed low uptake in PSMA non-expressing cell. Furthermore, pre-treatment of PSMA-expressing cells with PSMA-specific peptide reduced the uptake of TL, indicating that the uptake of TL liposome is PSMA dependent. Finally, cytotoxicity studies showed that Zn-loaded TL, induces cell death in the PSMA-expressing cells. Overall, we developed PSMA-targeting Zn-containing liposomes that selectively target and kill PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. Future work includes testing the effect of Zn-loaded TL on m-aconitase activity and testing of in vivo efficacy of the formulation in prostate cancer models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Liposomes,Zinc,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Injectable hydrogels were prepared by using a zwitterionic monomer, sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), without using any crosslinker. Gelation was performed at -20 <sup>o<\/sup>C using APS\/TEMED as initiator, allowing the formation of strong electrostatic interactions between poly(SBMA) chains to physically crosslink the hydrogels. Monomer and initiator concentrations were carefully optimized to achieve injectable hydrogels with mechanical and thermal stability. To render ultrasound responsivity to the hydrogels, we loaded the hydrogels with hydrophobically (dodecyl) modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (hMSNs) with sizes around 50 nm. When insonated with low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIUS), the hMSNs incept acoustic cavitation (i.e., growth and collapse of microsized bubbles), which in turn generates mechanical effects in the hydrogels such as shock waves or water jets. We found that loading the hydrogels with hMSN did not affect their injectability, and they remained mechanically stable at 37 &#176;C for more than a week. hMSN-loaded hydrogels demonstrated strong ultrasound responsivity even at low particle concentrations (0.1 mg\/mL) and ultrasound powers (25 W, 0.02% duty cycle). Finally, we loaded the hydrogels with a chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin (DOX, 0.2 mg\/mL). DOX-loaded hydrogels demonstrated minimal release without LIUS treatment (&#60;20% in a day). Application of LIUS (150 W, 1% duty cycle) for 5 min resulted in almost complete mechanical disintegration of the hydrogels, resulting in a burst DOX release. We also showed that the amount of released DOX could be controlled by tuning the LUIS power and its duration. In summary, we developed injectable hydrogels with strong ultrasound responsivity. These hydrogels hold great promise for local and on-demand drug delivery to solid tumors, which is currently under investigation in our laboratory.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Ultrasound,Hydrogel,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The clinical success of these strategies hinges primarily on the safety and efficacy of the delivery vehicle. Here, we have developed a gelatin-lipidoid hybrid nanoparticle (GLNP) that utilizes gelatin's biocompatibility, biodegradability, and lipidoids' high transfection efficiency. With GLNP, we have demonstrated the efficacy of delivering siRNA and silencing AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase commonly associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. siRNA is attached to the surface of GLNP through covalent conjugation with gelatin, while the lipidoid on the system's interior electrostatically complexes with the siRNA. siRNAs are well protected by the GLNP when exposed to serum for at least 48 hours. The GLNP's bivalency significantly enhanced the downregulation of target genes <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Furthermore, the bivalent GLNP can simultaneously target and downregulate two oncogenes. Apart from siRNA, GLNP was also able to encapsulate and deliver mRNA, thereby suggesting the potential to simultaneously deliver RNA therapeutics to effect knockdown and expression of target proteins and maximize therapeutic effect. The length of the carbon chain of the lipidoid can be manipulated to influence the physico-chemical properties of the GLNP and its efficiency in encapsulating and delivering RNA drugs. Importantly, gelatin was found to effectively shield the cationic lipidoid and negate its toxicity. Toxicity studies indicate that high doses of GLNPs (up to 48 mg\/kg BW) are well-tolerated with no significant changes in body weight, hematology, or serum chemistry. The co-administration of GLNP-siAXL and TKI in PDX models has shown notable control of tumor growth. It is important to note that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown significant survival benefits in NSCLC patients. However, the therapeutic effect is limited to only 20% of patients due to several resistance mechanisms, such as increased expression of oncogenic proteins. Therefore, our future study will explore GLNP's ability to sensitize NSCLC tumors to immune therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Nanoparticle,Drug delivery,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Previous therapeutic shortcomings have encouraged the investigation of new strategies, such as targeted therapeutics. YAP\/TAZ, transcriptional coactivators of the hippo pathway, have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of CCA along with the Src familiar kinase, LCK. Milk-derived nanovesicles (MNVs) have emerged as a promising biologic delivery apparatus for hepatobiliary malignancy due to their predilection for hepatic uptake. We sought to investigate the utility of aptamer guided MNVs loaded with short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting YAP, TAZ, and LCK.<br \/>Methods: MNVs were prepared and loaded with species-specific siRNA prior to decoration with an epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) targeting aptamer. In vitro studies were performed using murine and human CCA cell lines, SB1 and HuCCT-1, respectively. In vivo studies were carried out using C57BL\/6 mice following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.<br \/>Results: We previously validated EpCAM as an effective aptamer demonstrated by increased levels of expression in CCA cell lines using immunoblot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrated excellent biodistribution and affinity for tumor-selective uptake. To evaluate knockdown efficacy, CCA cell lines were incubated with EpCAM aptamer guided MNVs individually targeting YAP, TAZ, and LCK which resulted in downregulation of these targets on immunoblot and RT-PCR. MNVs were then loaded with equal concentrations of siRNA targeting YAP, TAZ, and LCK in combination which resulted in similar degrees of gene downregulation compared with single transcriptome targeting MNVs. Due to the role of YAP\/TAZ activation in CCA systemic therapy resistance, we investigated the effect of MNVs loaded with either single target or combinatory target siRNA alongside and in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GemCis). Incubation with both combinatory siRNA and GemCis significantly intensified cell death on Pi\/Hoechst staining compared with single target knockdown alone. Similar findings were found using separate assays of cell viability, including ATP luminescent quantitation and caspase 3\/7 activity. These data suggest MNV transcriptome targeting may induce a state of cell stress which allows for amplification of chemotherapy treatment effect.<br \/>Conclusion: Aptamer guided, nanovesicle mediated transcriptome targeting is a promising therapeutic strategy in preclinical CCA models that may potentiate chemotherapy response. Our future direction involves further investigating the role of CCA target downregulation and its effect on the tumor immune microenvironment utilizing aptamer guided nanovesicle delivery and inducible knockdown cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Extracellular vesicles,Targeted therapy,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in GBM pathogenesis, with miR-92b identified as overexpressed in various cancers, including GBM. Previous research from our lab implicated miR-92b in targeting proteins (FBXW7 &#38; SKP2) in the ubiquitination pathway. RNA sequencing confirmed the significance of these pathways. RNA sequencing of miR-92b inhibition in the U87 GBM cell line revealed impacts on cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and multiple cancer-related pathways. We successfully modified the gold nanoparticle size from 15 nm to 5 nm, increasing the surface area and improving OMI attachment efficiency from less than 5% to 50%. This alteration significantly enhances drug loading in the nanocarrier, providing a promising platform for clinical applications. Characterization of the optimized peptide-modified liposomes reassured the retention and potential improvement of original features related to nanoparticle size and internalization in cell cultures. Future in vivo experiments, utilizing a GBM mouse model, will assess the therapeutic effect of inhibiting miR-92b using peptide-modified liposomes as a drug delivery system. Our multifaceted approach, involving nanocarrier optimization and miR-92b inhibition, holds promise for developing an effective treatment strategy against GBM. The presented results highlight the potential translational impact of our research in addressing the challenges associated with GBM therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Drug delivery,Blood-brain barrier,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The current formulation of nab-paclitaxel shows an improved safety profile compared to the conventional PTX, but the highly potent nature of paclitaxel still poses a problem as it leads to severe side effects, such as neutropenia and neuropathy, calling for the development of carriers with better targeting ability. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a new noninvasive treatment modality which disrupts the mitosis of a cell with alternating electric fields with low and intermediate frequency (100 - 500 kHz). Highly polar or charged macromolecules are impacted by the presence of TTFields as they lose random motions essential for mitosis. In previous work on the formulation of self-assembling cationic-anionic nanoparticles (S-CAP NPs), gemcitabine was successfully loaded into the nanoparticles with optimal particle size, stability, and release profile responsive to TTFields. In this study, S-CAP NPs were developed with biocompatible polymers, DEAE-dextran (Ddex) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), via a relatively green method to load paclitaxel with minimal use of organic solvents. Based on the previous study and the proof of concept, it can be hypothesized that the S-CAP NPs can successfully carry PTX and release it in the presence of TTFields. Various parameters, such as temperature, rpm, and concentration, were tested to optimize the size, PDI, zeta potential, and stability of the particles. The HPLC method was developed for PTX and used to analyze drug loading. Numerous compositions of BSA and Ddex were tested, and the ratio of 10:1 (BSA:Ddex) developed the best parameters of the S-CAP NPs. At 50 &#176;C, the zeta potential of the particle was -3.55 &#177; 0.23 mV for the NPs, but the particles agglomerated over time as BSA precipitates were formed. At -15&#176;C, the particle size was 302.9 &#177; 2.0 nm (PDI = 0.307 &#177; 0.038). Varying concentrations of BSA and Ddex showed the formation of S-CAP NPs at lower concentration. The optimal particle was formed at room temperature (RT) with BSA 0.1% and Ddex 0.01% with a size of 264.6 &#177; 19.7 nm (PDI = 0.079 &#177; 0.028) and a zeta potential of -14.67 &#177; 0.07 mV. The particles showed desirable stability for 48 hours. The HPLC analysis (Agilent, Phenomenex C18, 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 micron) was tested for validity and robustness (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.9996). Currently, the drug loading was achieved at 1.9% and the optimization studies are ongoing. <i>In vitro<\/i> cell viability assay (MTS) with and without TTFields is under exploration. With the successful formulation of PTX-loaded S-CAP NPs, co-loading PTX and gemcitabine can be explored to reduce the treatment burden of the patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Paclitaxel,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Various cancer treatments, including Rehabilitation therapy, Immunotherapy, Hormone therapy, Stem Cell Therapy, and Chemotherapy, are available. However, chemotherapy has notable limitations due to its tendency to harm healthy cells, resulting in side effects such as nausea, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea, anemia, bleeding, and sterility. In response to these challenges, we developed nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery platforms for cancer treatment. These platforms utilize silver graphene quantum dots nanocomposites (AgGQD), known for their ability to enhance drug therapies. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibit toxicity towards both normal and cancer cells by impacting mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell cycle dysregulation, induction of apoptotic genes like Bax, micronucleus formation, chromosome aberration, and DNA damage. Additionally, AgNPs demonstrate antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties by inhibiting PI3K phosphorylation of Akt, disrupting the signaling pathway, ultimately halting angiogenesis, depriving cells of oxygen, and causing tumor cell death. To mitigate the toxicity of AgNPs in healthy cells and enhance their performance as drug delivery platforms, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were introduced in this study. Moreover, GQDs may contribute to improving the solubility of drugs with low water solubility. The NPs were synthesized using graphene quantum dots as reducing agents. The study involved identifying the IC50 value, conducting validation tests on AgGQD and AgGQD doped, and comparing their toxicity on cells. Confocal microscopy was employed to identify the intracellular location of the drug.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Drug delivery,Graphene Quantum Dots,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Prostate cancer, in particular, emerges as a significant health risk for men. Originating in the prostate gland&#8212;a small organ nestled in the male pelvis&#8212;this type of cancer the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the U.S. Despite numerous medical breakthroughs over the years, finding an effective treatment for prostate cancer remains a challenge. Our research is venturing into a new frontier in the fight against prostate cancer, focusing on an innovative method, it explores the potential of nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. This targeted approach promises to not only intensify the therapeutic effect, but also minimize adverse side effects on healthy cells, ensuring a more balanced and effective treatment regimen. A key in this study is the drug Andrographolide (ADG), which has been previously recognized for its robust anti-cancer properties. However, one of its limitations is its hydrophobicity, which makes it challenging to administer due to solubility concerns. To navigate this challenge, we are pioneering the synthesis of AuAg (gold and silver) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) alloy nanoparticles. AuAg particles, in have been the subject of numerous studies due to their profound impact on cellular processes. By integrating a protective layer of GQDs, we aim to boost the nanoparticles' stability, all while preventing any potential release of harmful metallic ions. The primary objective of this advanced approach is to augment the solubility of andrographolide, paving the way for its targeted and efficient delivery to PC-3 cells. An integral part of our research involves determining the IC50 value, which is pivotal in indicating the concentration at which the drug can inhibit the growth of 50% of prostate cancer cells. Once the IC50 value for the AuAgGQDs is firmly established, our focus will shift to evaluating its effects on the morphology of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). By encapsulating andrographolide within the designed nanoparticles, such as AuAgGQDs and their derivatives, we aim to observe changes in morphology. If there is a change in morphology, it indicates successful drug encapsulation. Through this research, we are not just seeking a viable treatment method, but also aiming to expand the horizons of drug delivery systems. The insights gained from this study could very well revolutionize our understanding of therapeutic potential and underscore the importance of nanoparticles in the realm of biomedical applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Drug delivery,Nanoparticle,Graphene Quantum Dots,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Among the various types of cancer, prostate cancer stands out as one of the most prevalent in men. Prostate cancer is primarily identified by symptoms related to urinary health. Conventional medical approaches often rely on drug-based treatments to address this form of cancer. However, like many treatments, drug therapy comes with its own set of challenges. In our research project, we propose an alternative approach for managing prostate cancer. Our innovative idea centers around utilizing nanoparticles as a means of drug delivery. Specifically, we are investigating the use of Taxol, also known as Paclitaxel, as the drug of interest. Taxol possesses a significant challenge due to its hydrophobic nature, which hinders its circulation within the bloodstream. Its solubility is extremely low, at 0.00025 mg per milliliter. To overcome this limitation, we have undertaken the synthesis and integration of AuNPs (gold nanoparticles) with GQDs (graphene quantum dots). This combination enhances the drug's hydrophilic properties, making it more effective in transportation. Our research has led us to conduct experiments on prostate cancer cells (specifically the PC3 cell line). We aim to compare the IC50 value, which represents the drug concentration required to kill 50% of the cancer cells, when using the drug alone versus when using the drug in conjunction with the nanoparticles. Taxol's IC50 value is determined to be 5.73nM. In addition to assessing the impact on cancer cells, we have also examined how the nanoparticles interact with blood, and how this interaction influences the morphology of red blood cells. Furthermore, we have characterized the system using various analytical techniques, including FTIR, NMR, Fluorescence, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. To pinpoint the accumulation sites of the drug and delivery agents, we have employed confocal microscopy on the cancer cells. Our ultimate objective is to equip the drug with the necessary components to facilitate its entry into prostate cancer cells effectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: prostate,drug delivery,gold nanoparticles,graphene quantum dots,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

To enhance oncological healthcare, various methods and technologies, such as drug delivery systems (DDS), have been extensively studied. Developing an effective DDS offers distinct advantages compared to other approaches to anticancer drug treatment. Some anticancer drug molecules possess unfavorable properties that directly impact metabolism and solubility, issues that DDS aims to address. Recent progress in nanomaterial synthesis has introduced innovative and efficient drug systems, providing a new perspective on cancer treatments. Gold nanoparticles, particularly in conjunction with semiconductor graphene quantum dots (GQDs), play a role in creating a unified carrier system applicable to multiple therapeutic methods. The choice of graphene quantum dots is based on their widespread applications and diverse benefits, ranging from compatible size and core-shell chemistry richness to substantial progress in achieving signal homogeneity by reducing the distance between molecules and substrate. The selected model for the DDS is the hydrophobic alkaloid Tetrandrine. Despite its use in treating conditions such as hypertension, and arthritis, and exhibiting anti-cancer activities, Tetrandrine is highly insoluble as an anti-cancer drug, with a solubility of 24.1 &#956;mol\/L [15 &#956;g\/mL] in water and only 5mM in ethanol and DMSO. This research aims to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic Tetrandrine by incorporating it into gold graphene quantum dot nanocomposites, serving as a potential drug delivery system for combating prostate cancer. The synthesis of nanocomposites (Au-GQD, Au-NGQD, Au-SGQD) and Tetrandrine-loaded products (AuGQD-T, AuNGQD-T, AuSGQD-T) will be examined. Additionally, the properties of Tetrandrine loaded onto the nanoparticles will be scrutinized and characterized using NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis, and fluorescence spectrum analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Drug delivery, Graphene Quantum Dot ,Prostate Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

While ADCs are one of game changer and are the fastest growing classes with novel clinical benefits recently, interstitial pneumonia (ILD) is a clinical problem as a fatal adverse event. However, the mechanism of ADC-induced ILD is under investigation. Purpose: We clarify ADC-ILD mechanism by analyzing released payload distribution in the lung using a novel Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting ADC.<br \/>Material and Methods: TROP2-eribulin is a novel TROP2-targeting ADC composed of the TROP2 antibody and cytotoxic payload eribulin conjugated by a cleavable linker. Four human cancer cell lines (A549, HeLa, NCI-H2110 and SKOV3) and one human- leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) were used in this study. Cell surface TROP2 antigen expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. We investigated the concentration and distribution of the TROP2-eribulin and the payload released from the TROP2-eribulin in tumor and lung tissue, using TROP2 low and high expression human cancer xenograft model that were treated with various doses of TROP2-eribulin. The concentration of erbulin was analyzed by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry, and tissue distribution of ADCs was assessed by immunofluorescence (IF) assay.<br \/>Results: In vitro analysis showed that the concentration of intracellularly released eribulin was significantly higher in NCI-H2110 with high TROP2 expression compared to A549 with low TROP2 expression (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05). In vivo analysis, the concentration of released eribulin in tumor tissue was approximately 10-fold higher in the NIC-H2110 xenograft model than the A549 xenograft model, while analysis of lung tissue showed that TROP2-eribulin was distributed in lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner of TROP2-eribulin regardless of TROP2 expression, with significantly more eribulin released in the high-dose group of TROP2-eribulin than in the other dose groups<i> <\/i>(<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05). IF assay showed that TROP2-eribuilin localized to alveolar macrophages. In the analysis using THP-1 cell, which mimic macrophage function, the concentration of eribulin released from TROP2-eribuilin was significantly reduced by the use of an Fc receptor inhibitor<i> <\/i>(<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: Nonspecific uptake of ADC by alveolar macrophages via Fc&#947; receptors releases cytotoxic payload into lung tissue, regardless of tumor antigen expression levels. This understanding can help elucidate the pathogenesis of ADC-induced ILD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Targeted drug delivery,Toxicity,Trop-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Therapeutic tumor vaccines are considered highly effective in eliminating tumors and preventing their recurrence and metastasis due to their ability to induce or enhance T cell-mediated immune responses. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these vaccines is impeded by the heterogeneity present both between and within tumors. In contrast, in situ tumor vaccines, prepared from autologous antigens in tumor patients, present another promising strategy for generating comprehensive immune responses.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we designed a multifunctional nanopolymer, the transformable nanoassembly PEG-Ce6@PAEMA\/R848. This assembly includes the photosensitizer polyethylene glycol-chlorin-e6 (PEG-Ce6), the tumor pH-sensitive polymer poly(2-azepane ethyl methacrylate) (PAEMA), and the immune adjuvant Resiquimod (R-848). The objective is to confirm the activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) at the cellular level. Subsequently, we investigated the maturation of DCs in lymph nodes and tumor sites in vivo.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In the particle characterization process, successful synthesis of nanoparticles was achieved, along with the verification of their acid-responsive function and toxic effects. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated the activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) (Figure 1).To further investigate the in vivo vaccine effects, C57BL\/6 mice were euthanized, and lymph nodes were extracted to examine the accumulation of FITC-PAEMA. It can be observed that, due to the reduction in size of the particles in the tumor acidic environment, the immune adjuvant can easily enter the lymph nodes. Activation of the STING pathway in dendritic cells within the lymph nodes was detected through qPCR. The maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph nodes was determined using flow cytometry (Figure 2).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In this study, we developed a straightforward yet potent strategy focused on in situ tumor targeting. This approach effectively inhibits tumor growth while inducing immunogenic cell death and eliciting a systemic anti-tumor immune response against cancer cells. Additionally, we intend to validate the therapeutic efficacy of this strategy on metastatic and distal tumors in subsequent investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Immunotherapy,Tumor vaccines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.

Nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery systems offer advantages such as targeted drug-loading capacity, and hypotoxicity, showing great potential in improving therapeutic efficacy. This study introduces a targeted drug delivery strategy based on immune-activating nanoparticles that achieves precise drugs delivery in tumor areas. Consequently, this approach remodels the microenvironment and induces tumor cytotoxicity.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>In this study, we first constructed a targeted nanoparticle delivery system FP@CC. The vehicle utilized lung adenocarcinoma cell membranes as the outer shell and encapsulated iron-platinum nanoparticles and STING agonist Vadimezan. Then, TREM2 antibodies were conjugated on the outer layer. The structure of FP@CC-aT2 was characterized by HADDF-STEM and its safety was evaluated by hemolysis test. In vitro, its ability to induce death was verified by AM\/PI staining, and to induce ferroptosis was detected by C11 assay. Furthermore, we evaluated its antitumor effects in subcutaneous tumor models. The composition of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment was analyzed using flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We initially performed HADDF-STEM analysis on the nanoparticle precursor FP\/Vad@CC, revealing its uniform sphericity. For security, no significant hemolysis was observed at different concentrations of FP\/Vad@CC. Then, the structures of FP\/Vad@CC-aT2 and FP\/Vad@CC are relatively stable (Fig 1).The number of dead cells significantly increased after deal with FP@CC, and the effect was significantly enhanced when combined with X-ray. Moreover, C11, utilizing to assess the changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), found that FP@CC led to a significant increase in ROS, comparable to induction by H2O2. Both could be effectively prevented by ferroptosis inhibitor(Fig 2).In vivo, FP\/Vad@CC-aT2 was applied to a subcutaneous tumor model in C57. It exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy and biocompatibility. Flow cytometry revealed that FP\/Vad@CC-aT2 had the anticipated impact on macrophages within the tumor: a significant reduction in CD11high\/CD206high cells and opposite in the ratio of M1\/M2-like macrophages (Fig 3).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study developed a targeted drug delivery strategy, FP\/Vad@CC-aT2, to improve the tumor microenvironment (TME). We conducted preliminary experiments in vitro and in vivo to validate its physicochemical properties and tumor inhibitory effects, including the induction of ferroptosis. We assessed its safety in mouse and obtained initial evidence of FP\/Vad@CC-aT2's ability to remodel the subtypes of macrophage.Moving forward, we will validate its therapeutic and impact on the TME after surgical procedures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-03 Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Engineering nanoparticles,Ferroptosis,Macrophage polarization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.
