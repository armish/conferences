Approved therapeutic drugs, including chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis agents and immunotherapy-based combination regimen (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab), have shown suboptimal clinical benefits for patients with HCC. There are critical unmet medical needs for additional therapeutic options to address this challenge. Deregulation of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling accounts for roughly 30% of HCC and plays a pivotal role in driving HCC tumorigenesis. To date, several FGFR4 inhibitors have advanced to the clinical stage for the treatment of HCC patients. Among them, a recently discovered novel and highly selective inhibitor, Irpagratinib (ABSK011), has demonstrated the potential to become a first-in-class or best-in-class FGFR4 inhibitor. It showed promising anti-tumor activity in an ongoing phase Ib clinical study, with an ORR of 40.7% observed in FGF19 overexpressed late line HCC patients in cohorts treated with BID regimens. To further expand the therapeutic potential of irpagratinib, we carried out an array of combination treatments and revealed its broad synergistic effects with various immune and targeted agents in treating HCC.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated the combination effects of Irpagratinib with a variety of therapeutic agents, covering both targeted and immune-oncology agents, in preclinical HCC <i>in vivo<\/i> models. The tested agents, including lenvatinib, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, anti-PD-(L)1, SHP2 inhibitors and EGFR antagonists, were assessed across a range of preclinical models, such as cell-derived or patient-derived xenografts, engineered syngeneic models and humanized models.<br \/>Results: Synergistic anti-tumor effects of irpagratinib were observed in combination with the indicated agents, demonstrating more profound effects than either single agent alone in the selected preclinical <i>in vivo<\/i> models. This resulted in significant effects on inducing tumor regression or inhibiting tumor progression.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, these findings collectively illustrate very broad synergistic anti-tumor effects of irpagratinib when combined with various other therapeutic agents. These results may pave the road for potential novel combinatory therapeutic strategies that could expand the utility of irpagratinib and provide innovative and more effective therapies to HCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4  (FGFR-4),Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

With the replacement of first-generation reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by the third generation covalent TKI osimertinib as front-line therapy for patients with NSCLC expressing classical EGFR mutations, acquired resistance mutations have shifted with the near disappearance of EGFR-T790M and the emergence and growing incidence of EGFR-C797S. Our understanding of the EGFR mutation landscape has also continued to mature with comprehensive sequencing across all EGFR exons and with the vast majority of patients now undergoing sequencing. We now see how classical oncogenic drivers represent only a subset of oncogenic EGFR driver mutations and where other non-classical driver mutations are numerous and represent a major unmet medical need. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the differences between the classical EGFR-L858R and EGFR-Ex19 deletion (Ex19del) mutations. For patients expressing L858R, many co-express non-classical drivers and this may explain the weaker relative activity for osimertinib in patients expressing L858R versus Ex19del. For patients expressing Ex19del, the co-expression of non-classical mutations is less common. In contrast, patients with Ex19del more often gain C797S as an acquired resistance mutation. Using the Foundation Medicine&#8217;s FoundationInsights&#8482; web-based platform, we present real world evidence (RWE) to define the molecular landscape of classical, non-classical, and acquired resistance mutations from a survey of &#62;80,000 sequenced cases of NSCLC, including &#62;12000 EGFR altered cases. We further present the profile for BDTX-1535 as a MasterKey EGFR inhibitor designed to address this evolved EGFR mutational landscape and tested against over &#62;50 EGFR mutations. We also show how BDTX-1535 can address classical EGFR mutations in addition to on target mechanisms of resistance post osimertinib with potency against C797S as well as non-classical mutations affecting both the intracellular and extracellular domains, including L718X, E709X, S784F, V834L and A289V.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,NSCLC,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

MTX-531 was computationally designed to selectively target both PI3K and wild type EGFR. MTX-531 exhibits low nanomolar potency against the PI3K isoform family and EGFR with a high degree of specificity predicted by co-crystal structural analyses. Full kinome screening confirmed that MTX-531 is exquisitely selective for its intended targets. We evaluated the pharmacological profile of MTX-531, whereupon single agent treatment with this lead molecule elicited a high incidence of durable tumor regressions in a broad panel of PIK3CA mutant CDX and PDX squamous head and neck (HNSCC) models. The combination of MTX-531 with RAS pathway inhibitors, including agents directed against KRAS G12C, led to durable regressions of KRAS mutant colorectal and pancreatic xenografts, resulting in striking increases in median survival. MTX-531 is exceptionally well tolerated in mice and uniquely does not lead to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia commonly seen with predecessor pan PI3K inhibitors. MTX-531 acts as an agonist of PPAR&#947;, a structural feature of the molecule that is thought to mitigate hyperglycemia induced by PI3K inhibition. This unique attribute of MTX-531 confers a favorable therapeutic index not typically seen with PI3K inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, MTX-531 is the first reported pan-PI3K inhibitor that does not lead to hyperglycemia. The pharmaceutical profile of MTX-531 includes favorable cross-species oral bioavailability, microsomal stability, and a facile 3 step chemical synthesis. MTX-531, which has the unique capability of concurrently and selectively inhibiting PI3K and EGFR, illustrates the power of rational computational drug design to target multiple adaptive resistance mechanisms in a single molecule. The versatility of MTX-531 in both the single agent and combination settings offers a breadth of development strategies that continue to evolve as new combination candidates become available. MTX-531 is currently undergoing advanced preclinical development for anticipated first in human clinical trials in late 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,EGFR,Colorectal cancer,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Treatment resistance occurs partly due to the expression of AR splice variants that lack the ligand binding domain (LBD) and are constitutively active in the nucleus. AR-V7 is the most prevalent variant conferring clinical resistance to both ARSi and taxanes. Currently, there is no selective AR-V7 inhibitor leaving patients with limited therapeutic options. Thus, the development of selective AR-V7 inhibitors is a high priority, clinically unmet need. To identify AR-V7 pharmacologic inhibitors, we performed a high throughput small molecule phenotypic screen using enzymatic complementation and nuclear AR-V7 as the assay endpoint. Our primary screen of ~170K compounds (z score = 0.8), followed by a cell-toxicity counter screen and a secondary GFP screen identified hit <b>compound 7907<\/b>, <b>as a dual AR-V7\/AR-fl protein degrader<\/b>, with unique chemotype compared to all known AR modulators. Hit to lead optimization by medicinal chemistry\/SAR studies identified <b>lead compound<\/b> <b>15, <\/b>with increased potency compared to 7907. Mechanistically, we showed that compound <b>15<\/b> shortened AR-V7 protein half-life by activating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inducing proteasomal degradation of both AR-V7\/AR-fl, without affecting their transcription. Importantly, compound <b>15<\/b> induced degradation occurred within 3hr of treatment and was blocked by the clinically approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. TurboID proximity ligation assay identified distinct E3 ligases, uniquely interacting with AR-V7 or AR-fl. Using AR-V7\/AR-fl deletion mutants we further showed that compound <b>15<\/b> activity is mediated by the N-terminal domain of AR, present in both proteins. Remarkably, compound <b>15<\/b> sensitized LNCaP95 cells (endogenous AR-V7\/AR-fl expression) to enzalutamide suggesting potential therapeutic synergism and ability to reverse enzalutamide resistance. Ongoing studies aim to narrow down the binding site of compound <b>15<\/b> as well as identify the E3 ligases mediating its activity. Together, these data support a molecular glue degrader mechanism of action, consistent with published studies showing that molecular glue degraders are ideal for targeting classically &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins lacking an LBD or containing intrinsically disordered domains, as is the case for AR-V7. Currently, all AR-directed therapies target the LBD of AR-fl, inhibiting AR signaling. AR-V7 expression is a direct outcome of this inhibition, leading to AR-fl and AR-V7 co-expression in patient tumors. We posit that our drug candidate, by offering <b>dual AR-V7\/AR-fl inhibition in a single treatment<\/b>, has the potential to not only benefit patients with mCRPC but also patients with hormone-sensitive disease, and delay AR-V7 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-10 Targeted protein degraders,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Androgen receptor,Splice variants,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, many patients eventually experience relapse. Therefore, new approaches for managing patients with resistance to PI should be explored. The integrated stress response (ISR) is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling network that is activated in response to both intrinsic and extrinsic stresses. Stresses are sensed by four specialized kinases: HRI, PERK, PKR, and GCN2, which converge on the phosphorylation of eIF2&#945;. This phosphorylation triggers the translation of ATF4, thus promoting cell survival and homeostasis. Recent studies investigating the contribution of the four ISR kinases in overcoming resistance to PI treatment, have revealed the potential of a selective GCN2 inhibitor to overcome this resistance. Here, we observed that PI simultaneously induced mitochondrial stress, ER stress, and amino acid starvation, leading to the activation of HRI, PERK, and GCN2, respectively. However, the contribution of crosstalk among ISR kinases has not been considered thus far. To gain a comprehensive understanding of ISR kinases in BTZ resistance, we generated single or combination patterns of double and triple KO of the four ISR kinases and reevaluated their contribution to BTZ treatment. Sensitivity screening using the HAP1 single, double, and triple KO cell library showed that HRI primarily, and to a lesser extent, PERK and GCN2, contribute to BTZ resistance. Consistent with the HAP1 KO screening, MM cell line-derived KO cells revealed a similar dependency on these three kinases. Building upon our observation of the significance of the HRI\/PERK\/GCN2 triple kinase, we developed a novel and orally available small molecule, CRD-1367799, which inhibits these triple kinases in cells. CRD-1367799 effectively dampened the activity of these ISR kinases, leading to a complete inhibition of eIF2&#945; phosphorylation and ATF4 activation. Additionally, we observed a distinct anti-growth effect when combined with BTZ in vitro and in vivo, which was not replicated by the GCN2 or PERK-selective inhibitor. Furthermore, we uncovered the mechanism of cell death induction in combination with proteasome inhibitors. Notably, the apoptosis inducers NOXA and CHOP were upregulated, but the mechanism did not seem to rely on previously known processes such as ATF4-mediated transcriptional induction. In summary, our novel findings on the contribution of the triple ISR kinase provides us with new insights for overcoming resistance to proteasome inhibitors with HRI\/PERK\/GCN2 inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, the use of a triple kinase inhibitor in this context has not been reported thus far, making CRD-1367799 a new therapeutic strategy for MM with PI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,ISR kinase, HRI, PERK, PKR, GCN2,Proteasome inhibitors,ATF4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.
