The mechanisms by which CIN driver metastasis are only recently being uncovered. In this talk, I will cover the important aspect linking CIN to cancer-derived chronic inflammation and discuss how cancer cells co-opt inflammatory signaling to spread. A key area of interest is to understand the mechanisms by which tumor cells avoid the deleterious effects of inflammatory signaling. Uncovering these adaptive mechanisms opens the door to novel therapeutic strategies that are selective to cancer cells with CIN. It can also establish novel therapeutic approaches that are selectively lethal to metastatic cancer cells that are often enriched for high levels of CIN. Finally, I will discuss how CIN can be used as a biomarker to stratify patients at a high risk for metastasis and resistance to immune activating therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Chromosomal instability,Inflammation,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samuel F.
