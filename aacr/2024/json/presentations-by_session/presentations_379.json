[{"Abstract":"Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein 3 (TPPP3) is a protein coding gene primarily associated with microtubule bundling. However more recent research is beginning to reveal more diverse roles it may play in the cell, including B-catenin signaling and endothelial injury. TPPP3 has also been associated with increased cancer growth and proliferation as well epithelial to mesenchymal transition. However, it is unknown how TPPP3 is regulated. We used high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) as a model to uncover the regulation of TPPP3 as it is highly expressed in many HGSOC cases. To start, we downloaded ~500 HGSOC RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and, using python, created a co-expression network to identify a subset of genes exhibiting expression patterns correlated with TPPP3 across all datasets, resulting in the identification of 222 genes. Dynein arm assembly, cilia movement and assembly, and microtubule movement and structure were among the top GO-terms after gene ontology analysis. The genes associated with these processes are typically upregulated in the fallopian tube tissue which aligns with the fact that a majority of HGSOCs originate in the fallopian tube. Fork-head box J1 (FOXJ1) is a transcription factor associated with ciliogenesis and was among the top 222 genes from the co-expression network. It has not been confirmed to transcriptionally regulate TPPP3, but their expression patterns line up across many tissue types. In addition, the TPPP3 promoter contains an RFX2 binding site. RFX2 is DNA binding protein that FOXJ1 uses as a scaffold to bind to proximal promoters due to it binding at to DNA at a distal location. As a result of this evidence, we hypothesize that FOXJ1 transcriptionally regulates TPPP3 via RFX2. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited FOXJ1 and identified TPPP3 downregulation. We are further investigating the regulatory function of how TPPP3 is regulated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Ovarian cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

These recurrences are from disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and can sometimes occur years after surgery indicating that DTCs undergo a period of dormancy. The mechanisms that drive cancer dormancy and its awakening are poorly understood in part due to a lack of animal models that recapitulate dormant tumor cell biology. We created a novel model of PDAC dormancy where mice undergo surgery to remove the primary tumor and are followed for evidence of metastatic recurrence. Dormant DTCs can be isolated from mice without clinical evidence of recurrence for molecular studies. Single cell RNAseq of dormant DTCs detected that the circadian rhythm gene, Dec2 is upregulated. We knocked out (KO) Dec2 from murine pancreatic cancer cells and when implanted into the model we found almost no mice developed metastatic recurrence. When immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells were used as hosts, we observed no difference in survival in mice engrafted with Dec WT vs. KO cells indicating the survival benefit in the Dec KO group was due to an immune mediated mechanism. We performed a differential expression analysis on bulk RNAseq data comparing the Dec2 WT vs. KO cells and found antigen presentation a top upregulated pathway. We then observed that surface MHC-I was significantly upregulated in Dec2 KO cells as compared to wild type cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that proteosome activity was significantly higher in Dec2 KO cells and treatment with proteosome inhibitors decreased surface MHCI levels in Dec2 KO cells. Cut and tag experiments revealed that Dec2 binds the promoter of a number of genes that regulate the proteosome. In conclusion, Dec2 promotes cancer dormancy by down regulating cell surface MHCI which facilitates immune evasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circadian genes,Cancer dormancy,MHC I,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

However, fs-indels often generate premature termination codons (PTCs), leading to mRNA degradation by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Importantly, some PTC-containing transcripts naturally escape NMD degradation and produce highly immunogenic neoantigens. Therefore, we hypothesize that NMD inhibition could be used to increase the cellular pool of fs-indels derived neoantigens in cancer cells, and enhance anti-tumor immunogenicity. NMD also regulates other cellular processes by degrading a subset of non-PTC-containing self-transcripts. Therefore, by focusing NMD inhibition towards the degradation of PTC-transcripts only, toxicity may be limited in a clinical setting. We investigate how targeting different NMD proteins affects the degradation of fs-transcripts across several cancers types. To assess the clinical relevance of NMD inhibition, we study how it specifically affects p53 fs-transcripts, since p53 is the most mutated gene in cancer and fs-mutant p53 has been shown to be highly immunogenic.<br \/>Methods: Core NMD proteins were depleted across a panel of cell lines from different cancer types and transcriptomics, flow cytometry, qPCR and western blot were used to evaluate changes in the expression of NMD-targeted transcripts and NMD members. Proteomics and immunopeptidomics were used to study protein expression and HLA-peptide presentation arising from fs-transcripts. A Translating RNA Imaging by Coat protein Knock-off (TRICK) assay was developed to study the translation of NMD-targeted p53 mutants upon NMD inhibition. This assay can precisely quantify the translation of p53 mutant RNA upon different treatments and cellular stresses at single-molecule resolution.<br \/>Results: We found an increase in expression of PTC-transcripts upon silencing of multiple NMD members. Our data suggests that some NMD members are better targets for inhibition of NMD PTC-surveillance, whilst others are more appropriate for inhibition of NMD-mediated gene expression regulation. These data support the recently proposed hypothesis that NMD is a branched pathway, where each branch targets specific subsets of transcripts depending on the cell type. These results are clinically relevant as the method by which NMD is inhibited could help optimize the generation of immunogenic neoantigens whilst minimizing toxicity. The TRICK assay has shown that inhibiting NMD surveillance reduces the degradation of p53 fs-transcripts and increases their protein expression.<br \/>Conclusion: We have identified NMD pathway members that can be targeted to efficiently inhibit the surveillance role of NMD and prevent the degradation of fs-transcripts that could generate highly immunogenic neoantigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay Pathway,Frameshift mutations,TRICK assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

During treatment, DTPs enter a reversible senescent state to survive therapy while cell death is induced in non-DTPs. Here, using RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses, we identified drug-induced TGF&#946;2 secretion in DTPs derived from different oncogene-driven lung cancer cell lines. As expected, TGF&#946;2 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that over time promotes the ability of cells to survive targeted therapy. Using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function and reconstitution experiments we show that downstream of TGF&#946;2, expression of the transcription factor <i>SNAI2<\/i> (SLUG) is essential for the outgrowth of DTPs during targeted treatment. Unsupervised RNA-Seq data analyses in combination with Cut&#38;Tag profiling revealed that EMT signaling is in part a SLUG regulated process but that is also independent of direct SLUG binding at the transcription start sites (TSS) of EMT signature genes. In contrast, we observed high occupancy of SLUG at TSS of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, being repressed in DTPs and at TSS of genes that regulate sphingolipid metabolism and MAPK signaling, being induced in DTPs. In line with our previous findings, a motif-based analysis of the Cut&#38;Tag data (TOBIAS) furthermore uncovered a tight connection between DTP outgrowth and inflammatory signaling induced through IRF7, IRF4 or STAT1 activation.<i> In vivo<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant SLUG deficient cells showed a significantly prolonged tumor onset and a higher response rate to osimertinib treatment. Overall, we uncover a major role of TGF&#946;2\/SLUG-mediated EMT signaling that may be induced indirectly through SLUG-dependent reprogramming of cell cycle directed and metabolic processes in drug tolerant cells. These insights may offer unique therapeutic opportunities to limit the outgrowth of drug resistant tumors in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),Drug-tolerant persister cells,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

PPARG has been implicated in immune mediated resistance but to date, a comprehensive analysis of PPARG expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in urothelial cancer (UC) patients is lacking. In this study, we identified the immunophenotypes associated with PPARG expression in UC patients treated with anti-PD1 therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><br \/>We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs from 5 UC patients and 3 normal healthy volunteers (NHV). Real-world samples (Discovery Life Sciences) were collected from patients who received prior Pembrolizumab. Time post-treatment to collection ranged from 46 to 307 days. An average of 9,500 cells were recovered per donor reflecting an ~80% QC pass rate. Count matrices were generated using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (v7.0.0; GRCh38 reference). Downstream data processing, analysis and visualization were done on Cellenics software.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><br \/>We evaluated 75,725 cells and identified 9 distinct cell populations. The proportion of T-cells was significantly decreased in UC samples compared to NHVs (40% vs 60%, p=0.03). Highest PPARG expression was observed on Classical Monocytes (CMs) cell population. PPARG expression was higher on CMs in UC compared to NHV samples (1.74 vs 0.11 logcounts; padj&#60;0.001). Unsupervised clustering of all monocytes revealed two distinct CM clusters. In cluster A, 95% of the cells originated from UC samples, while most cells in cluster B (81%) originated from NHV samples. PPARG was the top differentially expressed gene upregulated in cluster A (PPARG-high) vs cluster B (PPARG-low) (1.89 vs 0.23 logcounts; padj&#60;0.001). PPARG-high CMs are characterized by a gene signature inclusive of GPRIN3, RGCC, MAFB and IRF2BP, which have been shown to be upregulated in M2 polarized macrophages [1]. Moreover, pathway analysis using GSEA highlighted that PPARG-high CMs are enriched for TREM1 signaling genes (padj&#60;0.001), whose high expression has been associated with immunosuppressive phenotypes in myeloid cells [2] and shorter survival of patients across other cancers [3].<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><br \/>PPARG-high circulating CMs in UC patients exhibit a transcriptomic profile associated with immunosuppression and M2 macrophage polarization. FX-909, a first-in-class PPARG inverse agonist, is being evaluated in the clinic and the study includes an exploratory biomarker approach to assess the potential effect of PPARG inhibition on the CM immune-profile of advanced UC patients enrolled in the Ph1 study [4].<br \/><b>References:<\/b><br \/>1.

The transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), is important in the regulation of differentiation and adaptive responses in many cancers, such that we tested its role in HCC.<br \/>Methods: We knocked down MEF2D in HCC cell lines and analyzed HCC tissues and cell lines by RNA sequencing, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. MEF2D protein acetylation and proteins that interact with MEF2D were identified by coimmunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the regulation of CD70 transcription by MEF2D. H22 cells, with MEF2D knockout or without (controls), were injected into the livers of syngeneic BALB\/c mice. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the function of T cells in tumors, spleens, and lymph nodes.<br \/>Results: Through database searches, we noted that MEF2D and CD70 were upregulated in HCC and associated with shorter patient survival times. Compared to WT tumors, injection of MEF2D-knockdown HCC cells into immunocompetent mice led to smaller tumors with increased T cell infiltration, activation, and impaired T-regulatory (Treg) cell suppressive function. Mechanistically, we found that MEF2D binds to the promoter region of CD70 gene and activates its transcription. Moreover, acetylation of MEF2D enhances the binding of MEF2D to the CD70 promoter and further promotes its transcription. CD70 blocking antibody inhibited activation of the CD70-CD27 signaling axis in murine HCC tumors, leading to impaired immunosuppressive function of Tregs and enhanced T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, regulation of the CD70-CD27 signaling axis by MEF2D affects the numbers and functions of Treg cells and thereby controls T cell infiltration.<br \/>Conclusions: MEF2D in HCC cells increases the expression of CD70 and blocks T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity via the CD70-CD27 signaling axis. Strategies to manipulate this pathway might increase the efficacy of immune therapies for HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Transcription factor,Regulatory T cells,CD70,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1), an epigenetic regulator, exhibits elevated expression in AML. Consequently, inhibiting LSD1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for addressing blood and bone marrow cancers. While initial emphasis centered on LSD1's enzymatic inhibition, compelling evidence highlights its pivotal role as a scaffolding protein, orchestrating transcriptional and chromatin remodeling complexes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. However, our understanding of the precise mechanisms governing these complexes remains limited, necessitating further investigation. The K562 erythroleukemia cell line has served as a prominent model for investigating the molecular factors influencing cell fate determination. In response to specific cues, these cells exhibit a bi-potential capacity, mirroring the behavior of normal hematopoietic megakaryocyte\/erythrocyte progenitors (MEP). Notably, when LSD1 is either depleted or inhibited, the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells is hindered, even when exposed to various pro-differentiating triggers, including the BCR-ABL inhibitor Imatinib. In order to gain deeper insights and identify potential new protein partners involved in the K562 differentiation process that interact with LSD1, we employed the erythroleukemic K562 cell model. Using unbiased, proteome-wide proximity labeling we discovered that LSD1 serves as a scaffold for recruitment of the ChAHP complex, comprised of ADNP, CBX3, and CHD4. The ChAHP complex serves fundamental roles in chromatin remodeling, RNA splicing, and transcriptional control. We confirmed these proximity relationships by immunoblotting biotinylated proteins generated in situ by the promiscuous biotin ligase, (BirA*) when anchored to LSD1. We show that depleting ADNP induces spontaneous erythroid differentiation in K562 erythroleukemia cells, which is augmented by BCR-ABL inhibitor Imatinib treatment. ADNP-deficient K562 cells exhibited accelerated erythroid differentiation, as evidenced by a four-fold increase in the surface expression of erythroid markers (CD71, CD235a) and a significant upregulation of beta-globin gene cluster markers. These findings collectively suggest an antagonistic functional relationship between ADNP and LSD1, potentially counterbalancing LSD1's role in lineage allocation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the loss of the key ChAHP component, ADNP, substantially hampers proliferation and increases apoptosis in K562 cells. These results underscore the potential of ADNP\/ChAHP as an appealing target to modulate the choice between erythroid and megakaryocytic fates and offer promise as a target for pro-differentiation therapies in AML","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,LSD1,Differentiation,ADNP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Acting as an aberrant transcription factor, FUS::DDIT3 disturbs gene regulatory networks interfering with adipogenic differentiation, while driving oncogenic gene expression and proliferation. Functionally, FUS::DDIT3 has been shown to cooperate with the transcriptional coregulator YAP1 and to interact with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. However, mechanistic details on FUS::DDIT3&#8217;s function in transcriptional dysregulation leading to proliferative effects and the required interactome are incompletely understood. This study was performed to investigate transcriptional and epigenetic players recruited by FUS::DDIT3 to drive MLS proliferation and tumorigenesis.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: To study protein-protein interactions between FUS::DDIT3 and its interacting partners, co-immunoprecipitation experiments of nuclear extracts and proximity ligation assays were performed using human MLS cell lines. To further investigate dependencies of nuclear complex assembly, combined RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted. MLS cell viability and proliferation were assessed using MTT assays and xCELLigence real-time analysis, respectively. RT-qPCRs were performed to analyze the expression of FUS::DDIT3 target genes. The expression of FUS::DDIT3&#8217;s interacting proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in primary human MLS specimens.<br \/>Results: Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays demonstrated nuclear interactions between FUS::DDIT3, YAP1, and the canonical BAF (cBAF) complex in MLS cell lines. In addition, a novel interaction of FUS::DDIT3 with the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun was identified. Knockdown of the cBAF-specific subunits ARID1A and ARID1B resulted in reduced MLS cell viability and proliferation. Similarly, RNAi-mediated silencing of c-Jun impaired MLS cell viability and led to decreased expression of FUS::DDIT3 target genes. Strikingly, RNAi-mediated silencing of YAP1 resulted in decreased interaction of FUS::DDIT3 with cBAF components and c-Jun in MLS cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results identify YAP1 as a key factor mediating the nuclear interaction of FUS::DDIT3 with the cBAF complex and the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun, both shown to be essential for MLS cell proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion proteins,BAF complex,c-Jun,YAP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, RNA extracted from FFPE samples tends to be severely degraded, making it suboptimal for constructing high-quality RNA-Seq libraries. The RNA-Seq workflow can further impair data quality, as traditional library preparation and pre-library ribodepletion workflows may result in the loss of valuable information due to rare transcripts being not captured or washed away. Moreover, small, degraded fragments are a challenging template for ligases, and the resulting adapter addition may be inadequate. Here we assessed a novel workflow employing a proprietary enzyme to overcome the limitations and biases of cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase (RT) and ligases. This innovative RNA-Seq library preparation approach, coupled with a post-library ribodepletion strategy, aims to capture a more complete transcriptome profile from RNA extracted from FFPE breast cancer samples, and can also be used for evaluation of gene regulation through intronic and intergenic bases. The study also compared two commercially available kits, RecoverAll and PureLink, for FFPE RNA extraction, evaluating quality metrics such as RNA integrity number (RIN), DV200, recovery of small RNAs during NGS library construction, and transcriptome coverage. A parallel fresh frozen RNA sample, extracted using a phenol-based reagent, served as a benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that the novel workflow yields a richer dataset, encompassing a wider range of transcriptomic elements, including both small and long RNAs from FFPE samples. Performing ribodepletion after the library preparation procedure led to increased detection of small RNAs compared to pre-library ribodepletion. The robust analytical performance of this streamlined library preparation protocol enables its suitability for RNA-Seq analysis of archived FFPE specimens, offering substantial utility for oncology research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),MicroRNA,Transcription,FFPE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

This distinctive transformation underscores the complexity of lung cancer heterogeneity and highlights the critical role of lineage-specifying transcription factors in dictating tumor behavior. Notably, both human and murine models of IMA overexpress HNF4&#945;, a known lineage specifier for gastric differentiation in the adult mouse mucosa. Also, concomitant deletion of <i>Hnf4a<\/i> and <i>Nkx2-1<\/i> at tumor initiation impairs tumor growth and the extent of HNF4&#945; in regulating IMA tumor growth, cellular identity and drug response remains unknown at large. Here, we utilized genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that relies on a sequential recombination strategy to delete <i>Hnf4a<\/i> in established tumors. We induce tumor formation through intratracheal delivery of Flp-O virus, activating the expression of mutant KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> and Cre in lung epithelial cells. Tamoxifen administration recombines either <i>Nkx2-1<\/i> alone (KN) or in combination with <i>Hnf4a<\/i> (KNH). We have extensively studied the phenotypic role of HNF4&#945; in GEMM and organoids and identified gene sets regulated by HNF4&#945; in IMA at the bulk level. To complement our findings, we profiled both the tumor and stromal compartments via scRNAseq analysis on our GEMM to gain insights into the cellular diversity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the role HNF4&#945; plays. Additionally, we performed ChIPSeq in organoids to elucidate the genome occupancy of HNF4&#945; and determine the mechanisms of gene regulation in IMA. We find that deletion of <i>Hnf4a<\/i> impairs tumor growth in GEMM and this is phenocopied in organoids. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in KNH compared to KN and validated several DEGs in vivo. GSEA analysis reveals a significant involvement in regulating cellular identity and suggests a potential impact on anti-tumor immune responses. To this, our scRNAseq data revealed an enrichment of N2-TAN (tumor associated neutrophils) associated genes in KNH compared to KN, suggesting a nuanced interplay between HNF4&#945; and the TME. Additionally, HNF4&#945; exhibited dual functionality, acting as an activator and indirectly as a repressor by modulating the activity of other transcription factors like FOXA1. FOXA1 was found to bind de novo target genes following the loss of HNF4&#945;. These findings so far collectively illuminate the multifaceted role of HNF4&#945; in IMA, primarily driving tumorigenesis in a cell autonomous manner and secondarily skewing the TME towards a protumor via N2-TAN following loss of HNF4&#945; in tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Transcription factor,Single cell RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

This low survival rate is partly due to the lack of targeted treatments for metastatic TNBC, resulting from the heterogeneity of the disease. As such, further research is needed to identify novel molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to suppress TNBC malignancy. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein that binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3&#8217; UTRs of select mRNAs, including many that encode proteins involved in cancer-related processes, and targets these mRNAs for degradation. Loss of TTP in tumors correlates with increased disease severity and decreased survival, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers, including breast cancer. While previous research has shown that TTP can suppress proliferation in breast cancer, the mechanism remains weakly defined. To elucidate how TTP impacts tumorigenic phenotypes in advanced breast cancer, we stably transfected a FLAG-TTP-expressing construct into three aggressive and metastatic TNBC cell lines. We analyzed TTP-induced changes in gene expression patterns among these cell lines using RNA-sequencing and observed that TTP alters the expression levels of many genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of our datasets revealed that TTP affects multiple pathways, including significant suppression of pathways that promote cell growth, various metabolic processes contributing to tumor growth, and the response to hypoxia. As these pathways highly associated with tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that TTP would attenuate multiple tumor phenotypes. Our subsequent functional analyses revealed that TTP potently suppressed four tumor phenotypes in these cell models: cell proliferation, stem cell frequency, migration, and invasiveness. We hypothesized that inhibition of proliferation was mediated by cell cycle alterations, however, flow cytometry analysis revealed no substantial cell cycle perturbations between TTP-expressing cells and controls. Further analysis of cell cycle regulators revealed minimal changes in expression of proteins encoded by known or suspected TTP target mRNAs. Actinomycin D assays surprisingly revealed that TTP had no effect on the decay kinetics of several known TTP targets, suggesting that TTP&#8217;s antitumorigenic properties observed in TNBC cells are independent of its RNA-destabilizing function. To confirm this finding, we constructed cell models expressing an RNA-binding defective mutant of TTP, C147R, which recapitulated suppression of the four tumorigenic phenotypes seen with the wild-type protein. Collectively, these findings reveal that expression of TTP can potently suppress several oncogenic phenotypes in TNBC cells via a mechanism independent of its canonical RNA-binding\/destabilizing functions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Zinc finger proteins,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We hypothesize that aberrant expression of genes involved in crypt-luminal colon epithelial cell migration, needed for proliferative, undifferentiated stem cells at the crypt bottom to mature into growth arrested, mature effector cells near the lumen, may disrupt normal differentiation and initiate events that can trigger the transition from a normal to premalignant state in colon epithelial cells. Forced upregulation of tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), an actin-binding protein that exerts many effects on contractility and migration, prevents certain aspects of Caco2 maturation induced by contact inhibition of growth, including increased expression of the digestive enzyme sucrose isomaltase and glutathione S-transferase alpha 1. Furthermore, TPM4.2-overexpressing cells exhibit numerous morphological abnormalities. Compared to untransfected Caco2 cells and empty-vector stable transfectant controls, TPM4.2-overexpressing Caco2 cell clones elaborate aberrant thin membrane protrusions and expanded membrane ruffles. Particularly striking are defective maintenance of dome structures at middle (day 14) and late (day 21) time points of induced differentiation in TPM4.2-overeexpressing clones. We further hypothesize that TPM4 is overexpressed in human colon tumors, particularly at early stages of tumorigenesis. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined TPM4 RNA expression in datasets obtained from human colon tissue at premalignant as well as tumorigenic stages. TPM4 trends toward overexpression in premalignant, relative to normal, human colon tissue (uninvolved mucosa from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP) and is significantly overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue relative to normal controls. Interestingly, TPM4 overexpression may be more pronounced at earlier, rather than later, stages of adenocarcinoma. Our results suggest that aberrant TPM4 overexpression in colon epithelial cells can promote adoption of a tumorigenic state. Certain aspects of Caco2 cell maturation are disrupted by forced TPM4 overexpression during induced differentiation, and TPM4 overexpression correlates with early stages of colon tumorigenesis. Misregulation of TPM4 gene expression may therefore represent a critical molecular event that can block normal differentiation and induce early events in colon epithelial cell tumorigenesis. TPM4 expression level may therefore prove to be a useful biomarker that can, along with other diagnostics, help to determine tumorigenic progression in human colon tissue and to develop novel strategies to prevent colon cancer and treat it at early stages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Tumor progression,Cytoskeleton,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"G.

Disruption in intestinal epithelium homeostasis has been linked to pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. However, the processes regulating differentiation in healthy and disease setting are incompletely understood. CUX1 is a highly conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is expressed in small intestinal crypts and has been previously shown to be essential in mice and <i>Drosophila<\/i>. CUX1 is upregulated upon inflammatory stress conditions, including intestinal damage and in IBD. In addition, CUX1 is predicted to be protective against IBD from genome-wide association studies. The aim of the current work is to determine the mechanistic role of CUX1 in secretory intestinal cells differentiation and epithelial homeostasis. To this end, we have generated transgenic mouse models that modulate CUX1 levels in an inducible manner. Mice with near-null CUX1 levels exhibit rapid weight loss requiring euthanasia while mice with ~50% residual CUX1 halt normal weight gain. Histologic examination of tissues from mice with CUX1 knock-down reveals a lack of mature secretory cells, including goblet and Paneth cells, the latter playing a supportive role to intestinal stem cells. Moreover, mouse intestinal tissues from our knock-down models demonstrated decreased proliferation with increased apoptosis. In transcriptome profiling, we observed downregulation of proliferation, intestinal stem cell, and digestive system developmental gene signatures and decreased levels of key secretory cell regulators, pointing towards a role for CUX1 in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Indeed, reducing CUX1 levels decreased &#946;-catenin protein levels, while Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling is required for the organization of the crypt-villus axis. Finally, CUX1 knock-down compromises the ability to form budding organoids, demonstrating the cell intrinsic role for CUX1 in stem cell differentiation. In ongoing studies, we are identifying CUX1 genome-wide binding targets and the epigenetic impact of CUX1 in intestinal epithelium cells. Our findings indicate that CUX1 is a critical regulator of intestinal epithelium homeostasis that has a role in differentiation and potential role in injury-induced de-differentiation in healthy as well as IBD patients. We propose that CUX1 regulates stem cell maintenance and crypt composition by regulating Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling and inducing fetal-like transcriptomic repair program shown to be coopted by colon cancers. Resolving an intricate network of transcriptional regulation of differentiation in the intestinal crypt holds the potential to successfully target inflammation-related damage in human intestines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Differentiation,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The role of BAF complexes in cancer steadily increases with &#8764;20% of all malignancies having alterations in BAF complex subunits.

Acetylated lysine residues are recognized by bromodomains, which serve as acetyl-lysine binding modules and participate in transcriptional regulation. Bromodomain-containing protein 8 (BRD8) is a subunit of the NuA4\/TIP60-histone acetyltransferase complex. Although BRD8 has been considered to act as a co-activator of the complex, its biological role remains to be unclear. In this study, we revealed that BRD8 accumulates in colorectal cancer cells through the inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by the interaction with MRG domain binding protein (MRGBP). RNA-seq analysis coupled with genome-wide mapping of BRD8-binding sites disclosed that BRD8 transactivates a set of genes independently of TIP60, a catalytic subunit of NuA4 complex, and that BRD8 regulates the expression of multiple subunits of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) in concert with the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. Depletion of BRD8 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase and suppressed proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. We have also shown that the bromodomain of BRD8 is indispensable for not only the interaction with histone H4 or transcriptional regulation but also its own protein stability. These findings provide a new insight into the roles played by BRD8 in human colorectal carcinogenesis and will contribute to the development of new chemotherapeutic agents targeting the bromodomain of BRD8.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bromodomain,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the SF3B1 inhibitor, pladienolide B, in bladder cancer using <i>in vitro <\/i>models. We used a recombinant plasmid containing the SF3B1<sup>E902K<\/sup> mutation and established an UMUC3<sup>E902K<\/sup> mutant urothelial cell line. Both UMUC3<sup>WT<\/sup> and UMUC3<sup>E902K<\/sup> cells were treated with pladienolide B alone or in combination with cisplatin to evaluate differences in cell viability.

RNAseq was performed after RNA extraction from UMUC3<sup>WT<\/sup>, UMUC3<sup>E902K<\/sup>, RT4, and HT1376 bladder cancer cell lines were treated with pladienolide alone or combined with cisplatin. We determined that the IC50 for pladienolide B is 5nM for UMUC3 cells observed 72 hours post-treatment. Treatment with pladienolide B halted the cell cycle and caused cell death by apoptosis for both UMUC3<sup>WT<\/sup> and UMUC3<sup>E902K<\/sup> cell lines. We also observed that UMUC3<sup>E902K<\/sup> cells were significantly more sensitive to pladienolide B compared to UMUC3<sup>WT<\/sup> cells (p&#8804;0.05).

Thus, we hypothesize that mechanical force plays an important role in coordinating and thresholding transcriptional responses. Here, we challenge this hypothesis by quantifying the effect of nuclear deformation on transcription in real time at single cell resolution quasi genome wide. Further, recent work elucidated that the MYC oncogene exerts global effects on transcriptional output by altering the binding dynamics of transcription factors involved in the activation and productive elongation of RNA Polymerase II. This contrasts with mechanical stress which reduces global levels of RNA Polymerase II.

We compared the gene expression profile in traditionally collected blood samples with that of blood absorbed onto a Mitra&#174; microsampling device containing an RNA-stabilization reagent. Following endotoxin incubation, RNA was extracted from stimulated and unstimulated blood samples. Targeted PCR amplification of 274 immune\/inflammatory genes using the DriverMap targeted RNA-Seq protocol demonstrated robust detection and high correlation (r = 0.94) between the two methods in both unstimulated and endotoxin-stimulated blood. Moreover, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in standard and microsampling methods exhibited substantial overlap with publicly available datasets from similar experiments. Furthermore, we compared whole blood extracted from Tempus&#8482; blood RNA tubes to Mitra microsamples pre- and post-immunization with the Pneumovax&#174; vaccine using the DriverMap EXP genome-wide 19K panel for targeted RNA-sequencing. We observed approximately 90% overlap in the top 10K genes between Tempus and Mitra microsamples.

Presently, the mortality rate associated with cancer in humans ranges from approximately 11% to 25%. Numerous nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins have demonstrated interactions with p53, influencing both its activity and abundance. In our prior, unpublished findings, we established that JDP2 interacts with p53, modulating its activity. Consequently, in the present investigation, we broaden our exploration to identify novel proteins capable of regulating p53 transactivation. First, we found a synergistic effect of ATF3 and JDP2 on p53 transactivation. Moreover, deSUMOylation of ATF3 and dephosphorylation of JDP2 further enhance p53 transactivation. Secondly, FOXR2 (an epigenetically regulated pan-cancer oncogene) and NAA10 (an acetyltransferase) also remarkably increase p53 transactivation in H1299 (p53 null) cells. Thirdly, in addition to MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX) as p53 negative regulators, we further found that FOXL2 (a transcription factor in steroidogenesis regulation), DDX20 (a transcription factor for embryonic development and ovarian function), and p14ARF (for cell cycle regulation) significantly down-regulate p53 transactivation. Taken together, our preliminary results demonstrate that several transcription factors regulate p53 transactivation and possible p53 stability and\/or degradation. This data is presented to substantiate the idea that numerous newly discovered proteins may engage with p53 and control its transactivation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Transcriptional regulation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Elevated cytoplasmic expression of HuR has been associated with various malignancies, influencing key cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The involvement of HuR influences prognostic outcomes and hence is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer research. The present study investigates the oncogenic role of HuR in TNBCs, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed on TNBC patient tumor tissue (n=40) to asses the expressions of HuR and MMP9. Human TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were used for <i>in vitro<\/i> studies after confirming cytoplasmic HuR accumulation in these cells via Immunofluorescence. The RNA binding activity of HuR was disrupted using CMLD2, a specific inhibitor of HuR, and subsequent physiological changes were assessed through functional assays. An exploratory investigation of HuR-moderated metabolic changes was performed employing NANOSTRING nCounter XT gene expression assay using metabolic pathways panel. Investigation and\/or validation of molecular changes were done via immunoblotting.<br \/>Results: Meta-analysis using Liu-2014 TNBC dataset correlated high HuR protein expression with reduced patient survival (p=0.028). HuR (77%) and MMP9(55%) were found to be overexpressed in TNBC tissues. Inhibiting HuR with CMLD2 resulted in the downregulation of the protein and its downstream targets CDK2, MMP9, and &#946; catenin. HuR inhibition compromised proliferation, migration, Matrigel invasion and EMT (downregulated E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, and Vimentin) in TNBC cell lines. Further, HuR inhibition resulted in decreased clonogenicity in 2D and 3D TNBC cultures. Transcriptomics studies showed that HuR inhibition in MDA-MB-231 altered the profile of glycolytic genes in addition to other pathways such as cell cycle and DNA damage repair. In accordance, the expression of glycolytic proteins was reduced upon CMLD2 treatment. Similar results were obtained on HuR knockdown by siRNA suggesting that HuR-mediated effects on TNBC progression might be in part through its modulation of aerobic glycolysis.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, our results demonstrate HuR as a positive regulator of aerobic glycolysis in TNBCs and the ability of CMLD2 to inhibit HuR provides a rationale to consider it as a potential anticancer agent for TNBCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,Glycolysis,Metabolism,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Aberrant intronic polyadenylation (IPA) causes a stop of normal transcription resulting in the production of truncated mRNA isoform or lncRNA. We sought to examine the role of mutant p53 in pre-mRNA processing, especially in IPA regulation in lung cancer.<br \/>Methods: We established stable cell lines transfected with mutant p53 (R273H, R175H, H179Q, C238Y, and C242F) or vector control using the NSCLC cell line H1299 with a homozygous deletion of the endogenous p53. Total RNA was used to build libraries enriched in sequences near polyadenylation sites (PASs) using the 3&#8217;mRNA-Seq REV library kit (Lexogen; Greenland, NH). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37), and PASs with &#8805;2 supporting reads and &#8805;0.05 usage in any experiment were identified. Counts for each Intronic Polyadenylation (IPA) and total reads in the terminal exon were compiled into matrices for each condition. DEXseq was applied to detect changes in the relative abundance of each exon part normalized to all exons within the gene. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was implemented using the enrichR package.<br \/>Results: We identified 32,752 IPA sites in 5,718 genes, and 26,416 distal PASs (dPASs) in the 3&#8217;UTRs of 10,298 genes. Across all five cell lines, when compared individually to the vector control, a comprehensive shift in IPA events was observed, with a concurrent decrease in dPASs. Many of IPA isoforms exhibited consistent patterns of increased or decreased abundance changes. Upon closer examination of each individual cell line, such as the p53-R273H cell line (vs. vector), significant usage changes were identified for 2,389 IPA sites, of which 1,210 were increased and 1,128 terminal exons were altered, with 650 being suppressed. At the gene level, a total of 1,183 genes had at least one significantly increased IPA isoform, a significantly decreased distal isoform, or both. GO analysis showed that these genes were highly enriched in DNA repair-related functional terms such as DNA repair, double-strand break repair, and nucleotide excision repair. The observed IPA changes in DNA-repair genes were consistently observed across the other 4 mutant lines (vs. vector). This observation was further supported by analyzing data from patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in the TCGA cohort, where we selected samples carrying nonsense\/ frameshift mutations, and\/or a deep deletion as the p53-null control group, and those carrying missense mutations as the p53-mutant group.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study illustrated a novel role of p53 mutants in the regulation of intronic polyadenylation processing that contributes to deficient DNA repair. These observations offer a fresh perspective on the multifaceted roles of p53 in cellular homeostasis.<br \/>Acknowledgment: This work was supported by NCI Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA012197 and NIH\/NCI grant R03CA256100.<br \/><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,p53 mutations,DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest and their development appears to rely on AP-2&#945; and its paralogues, along with master regulator MITF. Prior studies have indicated that AP-2&#945; is a crucial regulator of melanoma metastasis. However, it is unclear if AP-2&#945; plays a role in melanomagenesis. We sought to understand the role of AP-2&#945; in melanomagenesis, hypothesizing that knock out (KO) of <i>TFAP2A<\/i> would suppress malignant potential <i>in vitro <\/i>and downregulate genetic pathways linked to malignant transformation.<br \/>Methods: <i>TFAP2A <\/i>KO was generated with a single-guide RNA CRISPR\/Cas9 system targeting exon 3 of the gene in the human melanoma cell line A375. Tumorigenesis phenotype was assessed by evaluating contact-independent colony formation with the <i>in vitro<\/i> soft agar assay. To identify downstream regulatory programs controlled by <i>TFAP2A<\/i>, we then utilized RNA-seq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, San Diego).

Although HO-1 is crucial for free heme degradation, its nuclear expression unveils non-canonical functions beyond its enzymatic function. Understanding the specifics of its non-canonical role remains a critical unmet need. In this study, we identified nuclear interactors of HO-1 and assessed their association with PCa.PCa cells were treated with hemin (80 &#181;M, 24 h), a specific pharmacological inducer of HO-1. Nuclear HO-1 immunoprecipitation and LC-ESI MS\/MS analysis identified 11 differential nuclear associated-HO-1 proteins between control and hemin-treated PCa cells (ILF3, ILF2, BCLAF1, SAFB, DDX17, SLC25A5, CASP14, PRDX1, BRIX1, CCDC175, and GPATCH1). Next, we performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) showing that ILF3 appears as a master regulator of this signature. To assess the clinical relevance of these factors in PCa, we analyzed overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse free survival (RFS) in multiple PCa datasets (GSE34312, GSE35988, GSE3933, GSE46602, GSE6956, GSE70768, TCGA-PRAD, GSE70770, GSE16560, GSE24136; n=1064). We performed univariable and multivariable analyses for these factors and identified the ones that significantly and independently affected the OS, RFS, PFS. Next, a risk score model was built based on the expression of 9 genes (&#8721;n<sub>i<\/sub>=1(Coef<sub>i<\/sub>&#215;Expr<sub>i<\/sub>)) for the GSE70770 dataset using these factors identifying a subpopulation of PCa patients with high-risk of RFS (HR: 7.39 High vs Low score, p&#60;0.0001); ascertaining the critical role of this signature in PCa. To elucidate the association of these factors with the aggressive phenotype of PCa, we analyzed RNA-seq expression data from the MDA-PCa-PDXs series (PCa Patient Derived Xenografts Program; MD Anderson Cancer Center), capturing PCa heterogeneity. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed that samples with high expression of HO-1 nuclear interactors corresponded to neuroendocrine tumors, negative for androgen receptor staining. Principal Component Analysis identified ILF3 as the most relevant HO-1 interactor driving PDXs&#8217; samples variance, correlating with a significant decrease in relapse-free survival of PCa patients. Further, we used ChIP-Atlas to assess the epigenomic landscapes for these nuclear HO-1 interactors. Results indicated that 40% of HO-1 nuclear interactors were potential transcription regulators. Strikingly, KEGG pathways analyses revealed that their regulomes were significantly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting their relevance in neural processes. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HO-1 and its nuclear interactors may play a pivotal role in neuroendocrine PCa, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for this aggressive form of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heme oxygenase-1,Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

There is growing evidence that PRRX1 is highly expressed in certain cancers and is critically involved in human survival prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism of PRRX1 in cancer malignancy remains to be elucidated.<br \/>Methods: PRRX1 expression in human Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) samples was detected immunohistochemically to evaluate survival prognosis. MPNST models with PRRX1 gene knockdown or overexpression were constructed in vitro, and the phenotype of MPNST cells was evaluated. Bioinformatics analysis combined with co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, RNA seq, and structural prediction were used to identify proteins interacting with PRRX1.<br \/>Results: High expression of PRRX1 was associated with a poor prognosis for MPNST. PRRX1 knockdown suppressed the tumorigenic potential. PRRX1 overexpressed in MPNSTs directly interacts with topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) to cooperatively promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increase expression of tumor malignancy-related gene sets including mTORC1, KRAS, and SRC signaling pathways. Etoposide, a TOP2A inhibitor used in the treatment of MPNST, may exhibit one of its anticancer effects by inhibiting the PRRX1-TOP2A interaction.<br \/>Conclusion: Targeting the PRRX1-TOP2A interaction in malignant tumors with high PRRX1 expression might provide a novel tumor-selective therapeutic strategy.<br \/>Significance: MPNST is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis and still lacks definitive treatment. Our results could hold promise as an alternative therapeutic strategy to inhibit the interaction between PRRX1 and TOP2A, and may improve the prognosis for malignant tumor patients with high expression of PRRX1 and TOP2A such as MPNSTs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Topoisomerase II,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

As the site where genetic information is translated to protein, they have a key role in cell survival, growth and proliferation. Ribosome biogenesis (RiBi), the process of creating ribosomes, is a complex function governed by precise checkpoints and surveillance mechanisms which may become dysregulated in cancer leading to tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Ribosome-targeted therapy could provide a promising treatment for cancer. NUC-7738 (3'-deoxyadenosine [3&#8217;-dA] which is phosphorylated and protected with a phosphoramidate moiety attached at the 5&#8217;-position) generates sustained intracellular levels of 3&#8217;-dATP, a molecule that profoundly influences RNA regulatory processes, including poly(A) tail length, leading to alternative polyadenylation (APA) and splicing, resulting in impaired cellular responses. NUC-7738 is currently being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma in the Phase 2 part of the clinical study (NCT03829254). Here, we investigate the impact of 3&#8217;-dATP on RNA regulation and RiBi utilizing a novel bioinformatic pipeline.<br \/><b>Material and Methods:<\/b> RNA was extracted from melanoma and renal carcinoma cell lines treated with NUC-7738 for 24h and paired biopsies (pre and post treatment) from patients treated with NUC-7738 + pembrolizumab. Sequencing libraries used for long-read PCR-cDNA sequencing were generated. Gene-level expression was quantified using Salmon DeSeq2. In addition to gene expression, poly(A) tail length, APA and isoform switch were analyzed. Protein expression was determined using JESS Western analysis. Multiplexed analysis of protein localization and expression in tissue was carried out using an in-house immunofluorescence protocol.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> NUC-7738 caused a global reduction in poly(A) tail length in cell lines and patient biopsies that was most pronounced in the poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts, including SNHG19, 5&#8217;TOP and YAE1, all of which play a role in RiBi. PAXT lncRNAs such as SNHG3 and SNHG19 increased in abundance. Ribosomal subunit proteins such as RPS3, RPS6, RPL17 decreased in expression. Expression of YAE1, a regulator of RiBi, also decreased. Distinct APA usage of various transcripts was observed in cell lines and patient biopsies.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Through the development of a novel bioinformatic pipeline we have been able to demonstrate that NUC-7738 disrupts RNA regulation, leading to perturbed RiBi.

These drugs operate through two distinct molecular mechanisms: inhibition of androgen biosynthesis and blockade of the androgen receptor. However, due to concerns of side effects, concurrent usage of multiple drugs is not recommended. A notable challenge is the eventual development of drug resistance, rendering all second-generation hormonal therapies ineffective. Currently, there is a lack of guidelines for helping patients choose the most suitable drug. In the context of pharmacogenomics, genetic differences can influence drug susceptibility and efficacy, with variations in genomic sequences and regulatory mechanisms impacting drug response at the transcriptional and translational levels. Considered the rapid processing capabilities of Affymetrix transcriptomic microarrays, we hypothesized that distinct gene signatures in patients who respond well or poorly to second-generation hormonal drugs could be identified and could act as a companion diagnostic tool.<br \/>Methods: We enrolled 180 advanced prostate cancer patients, who fulfilled Taiwan national health insurance criteria of using second-generation hormonal drugs, from seven medical centers or regional hospitals in Taiwan at 3 time points: prior to drug administration, 3 months after treatment started and drug resistance developed. The RNA expression data and clinical parameters were analyzed, and classification models were built using IPA and R. Good or poor responders were defined by 3-month prostate-specific antigen (PSA) lowered by 90 percent.<br \/>Results:: Differential expression and enrichment analyses post-treatment highlighted the activation of NF-kappa B signaling and various immune cell pathways. Notably, pathways related to primary immunodeficiency and IL-17 became prominent following the development of drug resistance. At the initial stages, distinct alterations in cell cycle pathways, particularly G1\/S and G2\/M, were observed between good and poor responders. This was elucidated through principal component analysis and subsequent dbscan clustering. To further distinguish between these responder groups, we utilized an integrative approach for feature selection, combining support vector machine, random forest classifier, and lasso regression. Despite the innovative approach, the model's error rate stood at approximately 15%, attributed mainly to the limited number of cases.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of using transcriptomic analysis to predict responses to second-generation hormonal drugs in advanced prostate cancer, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies. However, the need for larger cohort studies is evident to refine these predictive models and enhance their accuracy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,Prostate cancer,Microarray,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.-H.
