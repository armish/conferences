[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a membrane-anchored oncofetal protein with minimal expression in normal tissues. Significant upregulation of GPC3 protein has been observed in the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), and is associated with poor prognosis.

The affinity of peptide binders to GPC3 was determined by surface plasma resonance (SPR) and radioligand binding assays. Cellular internalization was radiometrically measured at multiple time points. Non-human primate (NHP) PET imaging was performed with <sup>64<\/sup>Cu. In vivo biodistribution, monotherapy and combination treatments with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu or <sup>225<\/sup>Ac were performed in HCC xenografts.

In vivo biodistribution study of [<sup>177<\/sup>Lu]Lu-RYZ-GPC3 in HCC xenografts showed sustained tumor uptake of 16.6, 16.4, and 8.8 %ID\/g at 24, 48, and 96 hours with fast renal clearance, resulting in favorable tumor\/kidney ratios of 3.6, 10.2, and 13.0, respectively. Minimal or no uptake was observed in other normal tissues. PET imaging in NHP confirmed absence of on-target uptake by liver or other organs, and fast renal clearance.

However, although highly efficacious in eliminating tumors, incidental damage to underlying tissue remains a major limitation of RT. In the case of head and neck cancer, damage to the otherwise healthy salivary glands is often unavoidable even at low dosages, leaving patients with lifelong xerostomia and other comorbidities. FLASH Proton RT (F-PRT) is a form of ultra-high dose RT and has been reported to spare healthy tissues while retaining its tumor-controlling efficacy. The first system to deliver dosimetrically identical FLASH Proton RT (F-PRT; 60- 110 Gy\/sec) or Standard Proton RT (S-PRT; 0.5-1 Gy\/sec) using double-scattered protons was designed by our group.<br \/>Aim: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of F-PRT on radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction and the potential mechanism of this sparing effect by analyzing the effects of FLASH on two distinct salivary gland cell types: acinar and ductal cells.<br \/>Methods: The head and neck area of C57BL\/6 mice were irradiated with a single dose of 16 Gy of F-PRT (128Gy\/s) or S-PRT (0.95 Gy\/s). Radiation-induced xerostomia was studied by measuring the saliva flow rate of mice at 5, 10, 14, and 28 days post-PRT. Expression of AQP5, SOX9, and Keratin- 18, 19 was studied at 2, 5, 10, 14, and 28 days post irradiation by both immunofluorescence and protein immunoblotting.<br \/>Results: Following irradiation with a single dose of 16 Gy, saliva flow was reduced by both treatments. However, the F-PRT-treated mice showed a significant improvement in salivary flow at 14 and 28 days post-irradiation, compared to those treated with S-PRT. Expression of AQP5 was significantly downregulated at 2, 5, 10 and 14 days post irradiation with S-PRT while F-PRT-treated mice showed a significant restoration of the AQP5 expression during the same time points. Expression of SOX9 showed no significant differences between S-PRT and F-PRT treated mice at earlier time points (2, 14 days), however, there was a significant difference in expression of SOX9 between the irradiated and unirradiated group. The difference in expression of SOX9 was visible from day 28 post-irradiation, where the F-PRT treated group showed increased expression compared to S-PRT.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that F-PRT reduces radiation-induced hyposalivation and reinstates the expression of AQP5 in the acinar cells of the submandibular gland of mice. Furthermore, it demonstrates that on day 28 post-irradiation, F-PRT-treated mice displayed more SOX9-expressing progenitor cells in the submandibular salivary glands compared to S-PRT.<br \/>Acknowledgements: This work was supported by a Sponsored Research Agreement from IBA to Drs.

Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a prostate cancer-specific membrane marker which directly correlates with androgen independence, metastasis, and disease progression, has been well-established as a radioligand target for the diagnosis and treatment of mCRPC. Lutetium-177 (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu)-PSMA-617 (PLUVICTO<sup>TM<\/sup>) was approved in 2022 for the treatment of progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC. However, only 30% of patients showed a radiological response in the registrational trial. Meanwhile, recent clinical experience has shown very limited efficacy in low PSMA expressing patients. These data collectively request for further improvement in the clinical benefit of PSMA-targeted radiotherapy. Actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac), an alpha emitter, is significantly more potent on cancer cell killing and has a shorter range in tissue penetration when compared to the beta emitter <sup>177<\/sup>Lu. Such a profile supports the development of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac based radiotherapies. Using our proprietary Clear-X<sup>TM<\/sup> technology platform, we developed <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-FL-020, a novel <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-based PSMA radioligand therapy candidate which has demonstrated prominent pre-clinical properties. We have assessed the binding affinity against PSMA of the non-labeled vector FL-020 <i>in vitro<\/i>. The <i>in vivo<\/i> biodistribution profile of FL-020 was characterized by SPECT\/CT imaging and biodistribution using Indium-111 (<sup>111<\/sup>In)-FL-020 in PSMA high LNCaP tumor-bearing nude mice. In addition, anti-tumor activities of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-FL-020 were evaluated in the LNCaP xenograft model and directly compared to <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-617. FL-020 was found bound to LNCaP cells with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 51.55 nM. Meanwhile, the off-target screening showed that less than 50% inhibition of binding or activity was observed by FL-020 at 10 &#181;M against 85 targets including receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and transporters, indicating the high selectivity of FL-020. Moreover, <sup>111<\/sup>In-FL-020 displayed a very promising<i> in vivo<\/i> distribution profile with high and sustained tumor uptake and fast systemic clearance. Furthermore, <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-FL-020 exhibited superior anti-tumor activity compared to <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at the same dose level (10 KBq\/mouse) in the LNCaP xenograft model with a favorable safety profile as indicated by body weight and hematological parameters. A mechanistic study was also conducted in <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-FL-020-treated LNCaP tumor samples where DNA double-strand breaks and tumor cell apoptosis were observed, confirming the MOA of alpha emitters. Taken together, these results collectively demonstrate that <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-FL-020 is a potent and selective PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy candidate with superior anti-tumor activity and a favorable safety profile warranting further clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-08 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PSMA,Prostate cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

CA9 is considered an attractive target and is upregulated in a variety of cancers, especially, in 95% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) where there remains a large clinical unmet need despite the availability of several newly approved medicines. PeptiDream has identified PD-32766, a novel macrocyclic peptide, targeting CA9 and can be labeled with radionuclides such as copper (<sup>64<\/sup>Cu) and lutetium (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu), which enables tumor-specific PET bioimaging and radiotherapy. Here we report the theranostic translational feasibility of PD-32766 for ccRCC.<br \/>Materials and Methods: PD-32766 was discovered using Peptide Discovery Platform System (PDPS), a proprietary screening system of PeptiDream. Binding affinity of PD-32766, <sup>63<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>175<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 to CA9 was measured by SPR. For <i>in vivo<\/i> evaluation, we used a xenograft model in which VMRC-RCW (ccRCC cell line with similar CA9 expression level to clinical samples) was subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice. To assess biodistribution, <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 or <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 was dosed to VMRC-RCW xenograft mice, and the percentage of injected dose in tumors and major organs was quantified by cut and count method. To evaluate whether PET imaging can detect tumors, <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 was dosed to VMRC-RCW xenograft mice and after dosing, PET scanning was performed. For therapeutic experiments, <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 was dosed to VMRC-RCW xenograft mice and tumor volume was measured for 45 days after dosing.<br \/>Results: SPR analysis revealed that PD-32766, <sup>63<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>175<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 exhibits an affinity of less than 0.2 nM for CA9. In <i>in vivo<\/i> biodistribution experiment, <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 showed specific and strong accumulation in tumors 4 hours after dosing (88 and 107% ID\/g, for <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766, respectively) and were highly retained in the tumors at 48 hours after dosing (37 and 51% ID\/g, for <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766, respectively). Maximal intensity in other normal tissues were 23 and 9 %ID\/g (tumor\/kidney=3.8 and 11.9 for <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766, respectively at 4 hrs.). PET bioimaging of <sup>64<\/sup>Cu-PD-32766 clearly detected only tumors, consistent with the biodistribution data. In therapeutic experiments, <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 (30 MBq\/mouse single or QW x3) was well tolerated and strikingly improved mouse survival compared with control animals for 45 days after transplantation, which suggests a robust tumor growth inhibition of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PD-32766 dosing. Taken together, PD-32766 showed specific tumor accumulation and strong therapeutic effect in a clinically relevant xenograft model of ccRCC.<br \/>Conclusion: PD-32766 has preferable properties for imaging and therapy with radionuclides and a great potential for theranostic use in ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-07 Theranostics\/radiotheranostics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Theranostics,Carbonic anhydrase IX,Kidney cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoshihide Mizukoshi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shota Tsuchida<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroko Inaba<sup>1<\/sup>, Tatsuro Kotake<sup>1<\/sup>, Takanori Aoki<sup>1<\/sup>, Kai Orihara<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuichi Funase<sup>2<\/sup>, Naoki Kanazawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Hikaru Shimizu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaita Sawano<sup>2<\/sup>, Kentaro Suzuki<sup>2<\/sup>, Hayato Yanagida<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeru Ehara<sup>1<\/sup>, Hidetomo Kitamura<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Matsushima<sup>2<\/sup>, Masato Murakami<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PeptiDream Inc., Kawasaki, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>PDRadiopharma Inc., Sammu, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6b8a974c-3e5d-4c27-99af-7259ae8ee441","ControlNumber":"3052","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

They are composed of a tumor-targeting ligand and a radioactive payload. The therapeutic potential of RLT strongly depends on their biostability and residence time in tumor and healthy tissue after injection. Macrocyclic peptides are effective tumor-targeting ligands because their size and molecular characteristics confer optimal pharmacologic properties that can be fine-tuned during the development process. mRNA display is a powerful platform for macrocyclic peptide drug discovery that identifies high affinity peptide ligands through <i>in vitro<\/i> selection. Here, we describe the selection and initial characterization of macrocyclic peptides discovered by mRNA display that bind to the extracellular domain of a tumor target. Enrichment of the library for peptides that bound to the recombinant target protein was observed after four rounds of selection with no further enrichment in round five. The library of round 5 was sequenced by Illumina sequencing and the top 1,000 sequences (highest counts) were used to perform cluster analysis. We tested the top sequences of 43 different clusters in <i>in vitro<\/i> translation binding assays to validate the selection output and identify sequences for hit confirmation. Most of the sequences tested showed clear binding to the target protein and only a few peptides showed binding to a closely related protein from the same protein family. No non-specific binding of the discovered peptides to an irrelevant protein was observed showing the high specificity of the generated library. From this confirmatory selection data, we chose a subset of peptides for chemical synthesis. Binding affinity measurements were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular binding of selected candidates to target-positive and -negative tumor cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. From this hit confirmation data, <i>in vitro <\/i>internalization and <i>in vitro <\/i>anti-tumor efficacy of radiolabeled peptide candidates for RLT are assessed. Our data highlights the potential of mRNA display platforms for fast and efficient discovery of highly specific macrocyclic peptides with optimal binding properties suitable for RLT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-07 Theranostics\/radiotheranostics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ROR1,Peptides,Radiotherapy,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

ABD147 is a Delta Ligand 3 (DLL3)-targeted antibody conjugate designed to carry and deliver cytotoxic radioactive isotopes to DLL3-expressing tumor cells. DLL3 is commonly expressed on the cell surface of neuroendocrine cancer cells, including SCLC, but has limited and predominantly intracellular expression in non-malignant tissues. The ABD147 antibody specifically binds human DLL3 with high affinity and is internalized by DLL3-expressing cancer cells. To minimize radiation exposure to normal tissue, ABD147 has been engineered to clear quickly from the blood compartment. Using indium-111 to determine ABD147 pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice, we demonstrate rapid blood and normal tissue clearance of <sup>111<\/sup>In-ABD147, as designed, following a single intravenous dose administration. However, <sup>111<\/sup>In-ABD147 retains high tumor accumulation (activity concentration of up to 30% ID\/g) in xenograft mouse models of SCLC despite low DLL3 surface antigen expression on tumor cells (&#8804; 3000 copies). <sup>111<\/sup>In-ABD147 shows a favorable tumor-to-normal tissue distribution with predominant liver clearance.

In summary, ABD147 can preferentially deliver radionuclides to DLL3-expressing tumor tissue while substantially reducing the systemic radioactive exposure typical of conventional IgG radioconjugates.

We identified a novel host-protective effect conferred by short-term fasting when treating mice with high dose radiation. We showed that fasting mice for 24h induces epigenetic and transcriptional changes in small intestinal epithelial cells (siECs) and confers protection to small intestinal stem cells from high dose radiation. Here we report that fasting induces changes in the gut microbiome favoring bacteria producing metabolites, specifically short-chain fatty acids, that induce epigenetic changes in siECs. 16S rRNA sequencing of feces isolated from the small intestines of fed and fasted mice revealed a marked enrichment of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila<\/i> (<i>AKK<\/i>) in fasted relative to fed mice. Specific depletion of <i>AKK<\/i> through antibiotic treatment impaired the ability of fasting to provide organismal radioprotection whereas both organismal and OLFM4+ stem cell protection was restored in fasted animals upon reintroduction of <i>AKK<\/i>. <i>AKK<\/i> produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including propionate which is able to induce histone modifications and our metabolomic analysis of feces isolated from the ileums of mice demonstrated a significant increase in propionic acid levels in fasted mice compared to fed mice. Importantly, we showed that <i>AKK<\/i> conditioned medium as well as its metabolite (propionate) are able to induce histone acetylation in Lgr5+ stem cell enriched epithelial spheroids cultured in vitro.

Nanobodies, the smallest natural antigen-binding fragments, have been developed as targeting vehicles for RDCs owing to their outstanding tumor penetration, high affinity, high stability and low immunogenicity. However, the limitation of radiolabeling methods, the short blood circulation half-life and tumor retention time of nanobody hamper their application in targeted radionuclide therapy. To address those problems, this study explores a <sup>177<\/sup>Lu labeled anti-PSMA nanobody site-specifically conjugated with an albumin binding moiety, which improves PK profiles and radiotherapeutic efficacy by increasing circulation half-life and tumor uptake.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A molecule with an albumin-binding moiety and a DOTA chelator fused in one molecular entity, utilizing a highly hydrophilic and stable branch linker, was efficiently and site-specifically conjugated to an anti-PSMA nanobody in a one-step manner based on GQ&#8217;s iLDC technology, which allows for more flexibilities in <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-labeling. The albumin-binding RDC maintained comparable antigen binding affinity and internalization compared to the parental nanobody, exhibiting medium affinity to albumin. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging studies performed in PSMA positive tumor-bearing mice showed enhanced blood circulation half-life of the albumin-binding RDC and, thereby, prolonged the time window for binding to PSMA, which resulted in a significantly higher accumulation and retention over time in PSMA positive tumor with higher tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver ratios compared to <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-PSMA-617. Remarkably, the albumin-binding RDC demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy with significant regression of tumor growth and no apparent toxicity or body weight loss was observed in all treated mice.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The introduction of an albumin-binding moiety enhanced blood circulation of the novel RDC developed by GQ&#8217;s iLDC, resulting in unprecedentedly high tumor uptake and retention over time, which conferred superior anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy.

Since the linear energy transfer and degree of induced DNA damage of alpha particles far exceeds that of beta particles, several investigational PSMA-targeted small molecules labeled with the alpha-emitter actinium-225 (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac) have shown encouraging clinical signs of efficacy. However, xerostomia is often found as a dose-limiting side effect, presumably due to low levels of PSMA expression and efficient uptake of small molecules in salivary glands. To reduce these unwanted side effects a PSMA-targeted radioligand comprising a triad of important features was investigated. It consists of a high-affinity PSMA binder for specific tumor-targeting; a customized albumin-binding moiety designed to prolong plasma residence time and increase the therapeutic index by improving tumor uptake while reducing salivary gland uptake; and a chelator for efficient complexation of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac. From a series of compounds containing the same high-affinity PSMA-targeting moiety, but different chain lengths and albumin-binding domains, compound RPS-072 containing a PEG-3 and PEG-8 chain and an iodobenzyl moiety as albumin-binder was selected for further evaluation (J Nucl Med 2019; 60:656-663). This compound was the basis for the PSMA-Trillium with a DOTA chelator for imaging applications in humans (NCT05773703) or a macropa chelator for <sup>225<\/sup>Ac labeling resulting in <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium. <i>In vitro<\/i> preclinical characterization of <sup>225<\/sup>Ac-PSMA-Trillium was performed to test affinities for PSMA and albumin.

However, despite encouraging results, such patients tend to develop progressive disease, and thus, enhanced efficacy is warranted. To this end, the use of radiopharmaceuticals harnessing alpha-emitters is a promising venue due to the potent energy deposition and short range of alpha particles in tissue. Here, we employ the PSMA targeting vector, [<sup>211<\/sup>At]PSAt-3, for targeted alpha radionuclide therapy in a preclinical prostate cancer model.<br \/><b>M<\/b><b>ethods<\/b>: [<sup>211<\/sup>At]PSAt-3, a structural derivative of PSMA-617, in which the L-2-naphtylalanine was replaced by L-3-[<sup>211<\/sup>At]astato-phenylalanine, was obtained by electrophilic [<sup>211<\/sup>At]astatodesilylation. Evaluation of [<sup>211<\/sup>At]PSAt-3 was conducted in male inbred nude mice of Balb\/c background xenografted subcutaneously with human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP).

Fluoride treatments, including silver diamine fluoride (SDF), have been used as a tool to combat these harms, but its influences on the thermal properties of dentin and enamel prior to and after radiation therapy are not well understood. Thus, this study analyzed how SDF influences the thermal stability of dentin and enamel that has been exposed to radiation therapy intended for head and neck cancer patients.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Forty human posterior teeth were collected, cleaned of debris and soft tissue, and then mounted into acrylic resin molds. The teeth were divided into two equal groups, with one group being the control (no treatment) and the other group receiving SDF treatment. Using an X-Rad 320ix biological irradiator, all teeth were subjected to two grays of radiation therapy every day for six weeks. Afterwards, the dentin and enamel were pulverized a SPEX freezer mill. Samples were heated in a NETZSCH Thermal Analysis instrument, and the amount of carbon dioxide and water released was determined. All teeth were heated to 1429 &#176;C from room temperature.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The SDF-treated dentin released the most carbon dioxide (49,611.82 ppm\/mg), followed by irradiated dentin (47,672.76 ppm\/mg) and untreated dentin (45,249.66 ppm\/mg). In contrast, the SDF-treated enamel released less carbon dioxide (7,367.62 ppm\/mg) than the control enamel (8,172.01 ppm\/mg). The pattern of release of water was different from that of carbon dioxide. The control dentin group released the most water (45.56 ppt\/mg), followed by the SDF-treated (39.72 ppt\/mg) and irradiated dentin (23.51 ppt\/mg). Similarly, the control enamel also released the highest amount of water (0.83 ppt\/mg), as well as the highest amount of carbon dioxide. The SDF-treated enamel released around 65% of the water compared to the control enamel group (0.54 ppt\/mg). Furthermore, the irradiated dentin had the largest heat reversal temperatures for carbon dioxide (85.19 &#176;C) and water (86.57 &#176;C).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The impacts of SDF treatment and radiation vary between dentin and enamel. Comparatively, dentin has a higher content of combustible material than enamel. Radiation treatment reduces the water content of both enamel and dentin, which may make teeth more susceptible to fracture. Therefore, regular dental check-ups and frequent fluoride treatment to increase the strength of the teeth are recommended for patients undergoing radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Normal tissue\/cellular stress responses to radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Radiation therapy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Oral mucositis was analyzed by histopathological examination. Radiation-induced xerostomia was studied by measuring the saliva flow rate of mice.

However, the F-PRT-treated mice showed a significant improvement in salivary flow at 14 days (p&#60;0.05) and 28 days (p&#60;0.005) post irradiation. Expression of AQP5 was found to be significantly down-regulated at 2, 5, 10, and 14 days post irradiation with S-PRT. However, mice irradiated with F-PRT showed a significant restoration of the AQP5 expression post-RT. Oral mucositis started to appear on day 14, which showed more severity on day 28 post-irradiation with S-PRT. Histopathological analysis showed the presence of lingual gland atrophy only in the tongue of mice treated with S-PRT 28 and 60 days post-irradiation. F-PRT ameliorates radiation-induced jawbone loss compared to S-PRT as observed in mice irradiated either with a single dose or in a fractionated regime.

Strategies to enhance immune responses include combining ICT with other existing cancer therapies. Targeted radiotherapy (TRT) uses a radiolabeled cancer-targeting vector, allowing for systematic delivery of specific radiation to all tumor sites while minimizing radiation exposure to healthy tissues. We propose Targeted Copper Theranostics (TCTs) as a TRT, utilizing copper-67 to irradiate and prime immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and evaluate the efficacy of copper-67-based TRT-ICT combination therapy.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated two tumor-targeting vectors conjugated to a sarcophagine macrobicyclic chelator (SAR), an antibody&#8212;5B1, targeting the PDAC-specific biomarker carbohydrate antigen-19-9 (CA19-9), and a peptide RGD, targeting the &#945;v&#946;3 integrin receptor, which is highly expressed in some PDAC tumors. We administrated ~1.1 MBq of [64Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD (~0.1 &#956;g) or [64Cu]Cu-SAR-5B1 (~10 &#956;g) to FC1245 Ft2Ab PDAC (a murine PDAC cell line expressing CA19-9) tumor-bearing C57BL\/6 mice and performed biodistribution studies at 1 and 4 h for [64Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD-injected mice and at 24 and 48 h for [64Cu]Cu-5B1-injected mice. [67Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD- and [67Cu]Cu-SAR-5B1-based dose escalation studies and the combination of a copper-67-based TRT and ICT were performed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of copper-67-based TRT and potential synergistic effects of combination therapy.<br \/>Results: Tumor uptake of [64Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD is ~5 %ID\/g at 4h-post injection, and tumor uptake of [64Cu]Cu-SAR-5B1 is ~55 %ID\/g 24h-post injection. In dose escalation studies, administration of ~11, 22, and 37 MBq of [67Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD (~1 &#956;g) or administration of ~4, 11, 18 MBq of [67Cu]Cu-5B1(~150 &#956;g) improved overall survival to 25 or 32 days respectively, compared to the control cohort (14 days). Based on weekly whole-blood analyses, no significant radiotoxicity was observed in mice receiving various doses of TRTs. The combination of 11 MBq of either [67Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD or [67Cu]Cu-SAR-5B1 in combination with either antiPD-L1\/PD1 or antiCTLA4, improved overall survival by ~7 days compared to ICT-treated control groups.<br \/>Conclusion: Biodistribution studies demonstrated relatively high tumor specific uptake for [64Cu]Cu-SAR-bisRGD and [64Cu]Cu-SAR-5B1. Dose escalation study results suggest copper-67-based TRT could effectively inhibit tumor growth with minimal radiotoxicity. The combination of TRT with ICTs improved overall survival compared to single-ICT-treated control groups.
