[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>. Dual positive cells (DPCs) that express both epithelial markers and leukocytic markers have been observed in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients. DPCs acquire functional behaviors from both cell types which may drive tumor progression. However, the lack of reliable methods to isolate and identify DPCs has hindered the investigation of their origin and clinical implications in breast cancer patients. While microfluidic devices have been widely used for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by liquid biopsy, DPC detection is underexplored in these devices. Herein, we demonstrate rapid onchip isolation and detection of DPCs in whole blood samples from metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients using an integrated microfluidic device.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. Our microfluidic device consists of a unique preconditioning component that concentrates targets in whole blood and a downstream cell immobilization component that captures target cells. We included 7 female patients with MBC, of which 29% are white (2), 57% are African American (4), and 14% are Latina (1). The median age is 50y (34y -75y). All patients were undergoing systemic breast cancer therapy at the time of blood collection. A total of 9 samples (4 mL each) were collected from either an antecubital vein (peripheral vein) or the subcutaneous port catheter (central vein) of these patients. All samples were processed within 5 hours of blood drawn in our novel microfluidic biochip. CTCs (EpCAM+\/CK+, CD45-, DAPI+) and DPCs (EpCAM+\/CK+, CD45+\/CD66b+, DAPI+) were identified by immunofluorescence after cells were fixed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. Processing of each sample was completed within 40 minutes using our microfluidic device. Both DPCs and CTCs were detected in all the samples (9\/9). The average DPC count was 3 DPCs per 4 mL whole blood with a standard deviation of 1.9 cells. The average CTC count was 9 with a standard deviation of 5 per 4 mL whole blood. 89% of the samples (8\/9) had &#62; 5 CTCs after the sample volume is scaled to the standard 7.5 mL. No correlation was found between DPC count and CTC count (Pearson correlation coefficient <i>r<\/i>=0.08). While the blood collection location (central vs peripheral veins) had a significant impact on the CTC count (12.6 vs 4 on average with <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01), there was no statistical difference in DPC counts in the samples collected from central and peripheral veins.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. Both DPCs and CTCs can be rapidly isolated and detected from MBC patient whole blood in our microfluidic device. Our preliminary results indicate no correlation between DPCs and CTCs, suggesting that DPCs might not originate in blood circulation of MBC patients. More work with a larger patient cohort will be needed to further investigate the clinical implications of DPCs on MBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Breast cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

PSMA is an important drug target in prostate cancer, and ARv7 is a splice variant that confers resistance to second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors. In this study, we describe the development and analytic validation of a novel assay to quantify ARv7 and PSMA protein expression on CTCs.

The characteristics of cancer cells change with progression and treatment. Therefore, timely evaluation on their characteristics and decision on the treatment strategy are required. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are released into blood vessels in solid tumors and promote metastasis by circulating in the blood. CTCs are thus attractive targets for liquid biopsy and can provide useful information for selection of appropriate treatment. To obtain reliable results from CTC testing, it is important to prove that the detected cells are derived from cancerous tissue. In molecular tests targeting CTCs, it is still unclear whether the detected cells are derived from cancer tissue displaying genetic mutations. Aiming to establish reliable CTC testing, we have developed a simple method using molecular imaging flow cytometry to detect APC gene mutation together with Cytokeratin and Vimentin, which are epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. Since, abnormalities in the APC gene are detected in 60-70% of colorectal cancer patients, detecting such mutations provides strong evidence that the detected cells are derived from cancerous tissue. Here, we show that upon evaluation of analytical performance of our method using cells isolated from cancerous tissue, our method showed high concordance rate against APC gene mutation. A clinical proof-of-concept using 5 mL of whole blood from colorectal cancer patients revealed that counts of cells with APC mutation in blood and cells with Cytokeratin and\/or Vimentin expression in blood are highly correlated. Our results demonstrated a pathological stage-dependent increase in the count and frequency of Cytokeratin and\/or Vimentin positive CTCs. We believe that our study not only establishes a practical approach for identifying CTCs in cancer patients but also provides potential implications in clinical practice, prognostic evaluation, and selection of treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Colorectal cancer,Flow cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Unfortunately, most patients have advanced stages (stage III or IV) at the time of diagnosis and the only U.S. Preventive Services Task Force-recommended screening test, Low Dose CT scan (LDCT), has a high false-positive rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the early detection of lung cancer with better discrimination between individuals with lung cancer and those without. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of a non-enrichment-based liquid biopsy workflow, the High Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA) to be used as a complementary tool to the current screening methodology. The HDSCA workflow can detect circulating cells of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and hematological origin, as well as acellular events such as oncosomes. This allows the investigation of the broad spectrum of circulating rare events for the potential identification of biomarkers associated with lung cancer. We investigated 52 peripheral blood samples collected from the second annual screening round of Manchester&#8217;s 'Lung Health Check' pilot of a community-based lung cancer screening cohort. Of these, 7 were subsequently diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, 2 with small cell lung cancer, and 43 were deemed at high risk of developing lung cancer. We additionally investigated 60 peripheral blood samples from individuals with no known pathology to use as controls. Within the screening cohort, a number of single rare analytes were found to have statistically significant differences between the lung cancer, high-risk cohort, and normal blood donor samples, which can potentially be biomarkers used to differentiate the cohorts. We also built a multi-analyte patient-level classification model utilizing the rare cellular and acellular events that stratified lung cancer patients from the normal donor individuals and high-risk cohort with high accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of liquid biopsy as a complementary screening approach for lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Early detection,Liquid biopsies,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Pts had a median age of 63 years, 40% (25\/52) were females, and 84% (43\/51) had a smoking history with a median pack-years of 37.5 [4-100]. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (48% 25\/52), followed by squamous carcinoma (23% 12\/52), undifferentiated (20% 10\/52) and other hystologies (9% 5\/52). Patients had stage I disease in 10% (5\/52), stage II in 11% (6\/52) and stage III in 79% (41\/52). LB was performed before curative treatment in 35\/52 (67%), after curative treatment in 6\/52 (11.5%) and during curative treatment in 12\/52 (23%). Overall, LB was positive in 57% (30\/52) of cases: 63% (26\/41) in stage III and 36% (4\/11) in stage I\/II. Major driver mutations identified in tissue were then found in 61.5% (8\/13) of LBs. The concordance between LB and tissue findings was 100% in pts with ctDNA+ (7 KRAS, 4 EGFR, 1 ALK, 1 HER2 ampl). CH was present in 66.7% (20\/30) of ctDNA+ LB and 47.8% (11\/23) of ctDNA- LB. Median tumor mutational burden (TMB) in ctDNA+ LB was 5.5 mut\/Mb, with 4 cases of TMB &#62;16. Median follow-up was 12.6 months (mo). In pts with ctDNA+ versus ctDNA- LB, mDFS was 12.9 mo (95% 6.3-18.6) versus 27.7 mo (95%CI 12.7- NR), p=0.07, in the overall population and 12.9 mo (95%CI 7.8-19.2) versus 27.2 mo (12.7-NR) respectively, p=0.19, in pts with stage III disease.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b><br \/>LB has informal results for molecular diagnosis in nearly half of pts with an early-stage lung cancer. The high frequency of CH may lead to LB misinterpretation as false positive and requires caution. The potential association of positive LB with earlier relapse requires further investigation in larger cohorts with a longer follow-up. Results will be updated by the time of meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Precision medicine,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Currently, CTC identification is performed by visual assessment, which is time-consuming and potentially affected by subjective interpretations. Recently, we developed a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm for automated CTC identification in CELLSEARCH images (CellFind&#174;, Menarini Silicon Biosystems, research use only). This study aims to assess the CTC identification performance of CellFind on 2 different datasets: the first for comparison with human reviewers, and the second for validation with much higher number of images.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> CellFind is composed of an image segmentation followed by a classification network, which was trained using 13067 CTC and 52890 non-CTC images from 215 breast, 123 prostate and 180 colorectal cancer samples. The performance of CellFind was tested on 2 separate datasets. 1) The first dataset was made of CELLSEARCH gallery images from 26 breast cancer, 68 prostate cancer, and 40 benign samples. 8 human reviewers, qualified for CTC image analysis, performed blind labeling. The Ground Truth (GT) was generated by the classification of the 3 most experienced reviewers by majority voting (1621 CTCs out of 17080 images). Accuracy and F1 metrics were used to rank the performance of DL and 5 reviewers against the GT. 2) The second dataset was made of CELLSEARCH gallery images from 63 breast, 66 prostate and 32 colorectal cancer samples. 3 experienced reviewers created the GT classification by majority voting, identifying 20052 CTCs out of 117447 images.Finally, each patient was assigned to the favorable or unfavorable group by applying the validated cutoff on CTC enumeration per sample (CTC&#8805;5 for breast and prostate cancer, CTC&#8805;3 for colorectal cancer).<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> 1) On 17080 gallery images from 134 samples, CellFind reached top human-level performance, as ranked both by accuracy (97.8% for DL vs. 96.8-98.0%) and F1 (88.6% for DL vs. 83.3-89.9% for reviewers). On the 94 cancer samples, DL accuracy on favorable\/unfavorable prognosis was 98.9% vs. 95.8-97.9% for reviewers. 2) On the bigger dataset with 117447 gallery images from 161 cancer samples, CellFind obtained accuracy = 96.0% and F1 = 87.8% for CTC identification (TP = 17039, FP = 1735, FN = 3013, TN = 95660). For favorable\/unfavorable prognosis the DL accuracy was 95.4%.<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> Automated identification and enumeration of CTCs in CELLSEARCH images with CellFind can remove human subjectivity from the review process and maximize standardization among different research centers. CellFind performed better than most operators and reduced the data processing time required for each blood sample by the operator.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Using a cohort of patients with advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, we herein show the feasibility of using circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration, biomarker analysis, and kinetics as complementary to or as an alternative to ctDNA testing.<br \/><i>Methods:<\/i> Using the RareCyte platform, nucleated cells from blood were collected, spread on slides, stained, and imaged with CyteFinder&#174; for CTC identification (CK\/EpCAM+, CD45-) and quantification of biomarkers (PD-L1\/HER2 or Ki67\/EGFR). CTC enumeration (CLIA-accredited CTC test) and biomarker status for each patient were tracked over time and compared with ctDNA mutational analysis and tumor burden.<br \/><i>Results:<\/i> CTCs were detected in 60\/70 samples (86%) and in 36\/38 unique patients (95%). On average, more CTCs were detected in baseline samples from colorectal cancer patients compared to other subtypes (Table 1). Moreover, multiple patients showed pronounced changes in CTC number that correlated with treatment response, as well as strong correlation between CTC and tissue biomarker expression e.g. HER2. Rapid decline and\/or CTC clearance was seen as early as a few days into starting effective systemic therapy. The average turnaround time for CTC testing was 5-7 days.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> Our study emphasizes that real-time monitoring of CTCs is complementary to traditional tumor burden monitoring via imaging and ctDNA analysis. CTCs offer multiple unique advantages vs ctDNA including early response assessment within days of initiating therapy, a substantial decrease in cost of serial testing, and the ability to assess clinically relevant cell surface protein biomarkers e.g. HER2 and PD-L1.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{42E6518C-F325-411C-A529-5CD20063956E}\"><caption>Table 1.

Phenotyping living cell properties, such as drug sensitivity, complements deep sequencing to improve the prediction of cancer treatment response and holds promises for functional precision medicine. Modern cancer therapeutics target genetic alterations in modular networks, also known as cancer hallmarks, which drive biological essentialities for cancer progression. However, it remains elusive the relative robustness of each module among the naturally occurring solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: In order to explore this issue, we analyzed a drug sensitivity database of a collection of circulating tumor cells-derived organoids (CDO) from 532 patients with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors to 15 chemicals. In this collection, each CDO was derived from 20 ml peripheral blood on a binary colloid crystal cell culture system over 4 weeks. CDO were tested for survival fraction at the Cmax of the designated chemicals. Cell viability was measured with ATP abundance normalized to vehicle controls. For each chemical tested, the probability density function (PDF) of drug sensitivity was fitted to log normal distribution and goodness of fit was analyzed with Kolmogorov Smirnov test with the significance cut-off set to 0.05. The targeted biological pathway of each chemical was mapped to canonical human pathways in the Gene Ontology and KEGG databases. Strength of the specific evolution conserved module (ECM) was evaluated with the published analysis using clustering by inferred models of evolution (CLIME) algorithm.<br \/>Results: There were 25 types of tumors in the database. The top 3 tumor types were soft-tissue sarcoma, breast cancers, central nervous system tumor. The average number in each tumor type was 21. The PDF of commonly known chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, doxorubicin, docetaxel followed log normal distribution. In contrast, the PDF of commonly known biological targeted agents such as everolimus, cabozantinib or enzalutamide do not. For chemicals whose PDF followed a log normal distribution, the biological pathways that were affected tend to have a higher strength of ECM value.<br \/>Conclusions: Our early analysis revealed the feasibility to quantitatively estimate the robustness of biological pathways in the cancer hallmark modules with a CDO bank. The biological implication of deviation from classical log normal distribution for biologically targeted agents warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Cancer hallmarks,Evolution conserved modules,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

PDAC is diagnosed in the late stages, which limits treatment options and yields poor clinical outcomes. Recurrence is a significant issue for patients undergoing surgery for PDAC. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are thought to be a potential mediator of recurrence, facilitating the formation of secondary tumor sites after surgery. Thus, there is a need to isolate CTCs to improve understanding of disease recurrence, to ultimately improve outcomes. Herein, we aim to validate our inertial microfluidic (iMF) system for isolating pancreatic CTCs from blood. We also benchmark our iMF system to a commercially available immunomagnetic negative selection system, EasySep&#8482;, and quantify target cell recovery and cell enrichment.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>Our iMF system employs the differential cell sizes of CTCs from blood cells and inertial migration of such cells in a straight microchannel (150 &#181;m &#215; 50 &#181;m &#215; 24 mm) to enrich CTCs from blood. The iMF system sample flow rate used is 100 &#181;L\/min, with a 200 &#181;L\/min PBS buffer flow rate. The EasySep&#8482; Direct Human CTC Enrichment kit targets CD2, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD45, CD61, CD66b, and Glycophorin to remove blood cells from the sample using magnetic particles, thereby separating them from CTCs. We spiked low cell concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 Hoechst-stained pancreatic carcinoma cells, PANC1, in 1 mL of healthy blood then captured using either EasySep&#8482; or iMF. Cell enumeration was performed after centrifugation or Cytospin.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> PANC1 cells and WBCs have average sizes of 18 &#181;m and 8.4 &#181;m, respectively. We characterized our iMF device to capture cells <i>&#8805;<\/i> 12 &#181;m, which yields capture of most PANC1 cells. Indeed, our iMF system achieved 82.8&#177;19.2%, 72.5&#177;16.3%, and 59.3&#177;3.8% recovery for 50, 100, and 500 cell-spikes in lysed blood, respectively. For the same 50, 100, and 500 cell-spikes, the total iMF CTC yields after Cytospin were 46.3&#177;11.8, 44.3&#177;9.1, and 32.7&#177;2.1%, while the total CTC yields from EasySep&#8482; were 4.6&#177;3, 5.3&#177;2.1, 8.3&#177;1%, respectively. When we processed whole blood directly, EasySep&#8482; had lower cell recovery, 3.8&#177;0.2, 4.6&#177;1, and 3.3&#177;0.4%, respectively. Our system also demonstrated 8&#215; higher target cell enrichment compared to EasySep&#8482;. Blood lysis before iMF separation did not drastically affect the recovery of target cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions. <\/b>We determined that our system has improved performance over the commercial isolation system, EasySep&#8482;, thereby validating the effectiveness of microfluidic isolation for PDAC. In future studies, we can then use our iMF system in CTC isolation from routine blood draws from PDAC patients undergoing surgical resection. We may then isolate real patient samples and study relevant phenotypes of PDAC CTCs which may therefore be used for identifying certain mechanisms of PDAC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Pancreatic cancer,Liquid biopsies,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Post-surgical management of CRC patients often involves the administration of opioid analgesics. These analgesics operate through opioid and cannabinoid receptors, pathways implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, potentially impacting patient survival adversely. This investigation delves into the influence of piritramide and morphine on cancer dissemination, encompassing in vitro and in vivo assessments, cytotoxicity analyses, and elucidation of their mode of action.<br \/>Methods: The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of 131 CRC patients was quantitatively assessed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. Cytotoxic effects of morphine and piritramide were evaluated via colony-forming assays (CFA) utilizing HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. The impact of piritramide and morphine on opioid receptor activity was gauged through transfected reporter cell lines and fluorescence imaging plater reader (FLIPR) calcium assays. <i>In vivo<\/i> models involving subcutaneous and intrasplenic administration in SCID and BALB mice, respectively, utilizing HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, were conducted. Morphological profiling, employing the cell painting assay, facilitated high-content image-based analysis on both cell lines.<br \/>Results: Perioperative analgesia with piritramide exhibited a tendency towards longer time to recurrence (TTR) survival in CRC patients (HR=1.8, p=0.104). Conversely, morphine-treated patients demonstrated a twofold increase in TTR events (HR=4.7, p=0.011). Piritramide, but not morphine, significantly inhibited colony growth in HCT116 and HT-29 cell lines in the CFA, consistent with cytotoxicity test results. Functional assays revealed agonistic effects of both piritramide and morphine on opioid receptor kappa 1 (OPRK1) and mu 1 (OPRM1), with piritramide exhibiting greater potency as an OPRK1 agonist. In the SCID mice model, subcutaneous application of HT29 cell lines resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth in piritramide-treated mice. In the intrasplenic model utilizing BALB mice, mice treated with piritramide exhibited diminished tumor growth and a reduction in both the number and size of metastases. Comparative analysis with reference compounds revealed a distinct phenotypic profile of piritramide affecting the endoplasmic reticulum.<br \/>Conclusion: Piritramide, as opposed to morphine, demonstrated cytotoxic effects on both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> CRC cell lines, resulting in reduced tumor growth and dissemination. Perioperative analgesia with piritramide exhibited potential in improving time to recurrence survival in CRC patients.<br \/>Acknowledgement: This study received support from the European Union - Next Generation EU (LX22NPO5102) and Palacky University Olomouc (LF 2023_006).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Colorectal cancer,Opioid receptors,Piritramide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The parallel development of a drug and its associated predictive biomarker is considered an ideal strategy for achieving rapid and successful drug development in precision medicine. In this context, we employ an automated circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation platform, known as GenoCTC, to facilitate the development of biomarker-driven CTC assays, with the ultimate goal of developing companion diagnostic (CDx) tests. Method: This study employed the 5<sup>th<\/sup> generation GenoCTC device, a fully automated system designed for marker-based CTC enrichment using immune magnetophoresis. We confirmed the isolation of CTCs through spiking tests, utilizing cancer biomarkers such as cMET, Mesothelin (MSLN), and Claudin 3 (CLDN3). cMET is a biomarker extensively studied in various cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer. We previously showed the prognostic significance of cMET expressing CTCs in HR+ and HER2- metastatic breast cancer patients. MSLN and CLDN3 are tumor-associated proteins showing overexpression across diverse cancer types, with a potential for the development of antibody-based cytotoxic drugs. The GenoCTC device allows efficient separation of CTCs expressing these biomarkers, ensuring high accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. Simultaneously, therapeutic drugs directed at these markers are progressing through phase trials or preclinical studies. Conclusion: Our results show that cMET, MSLN, and CLDN3 are potential markers for the development of biomarker tests, that can improve the patient selection process for personalized therapy targeting these biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Precision medicine,Cancer markers,Companion diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, due to the scarcity of CTCs among the millions of nucleated blood cells, there is an unmet need to improve CTC isolation assays. Our technique <i><u>Acoustophoresis<\/u><\/i> uses standing ultrasound waves in a flow-through microfluidic chamber to discriminate cells based on their size, density, and compressibility.<br \/><b><i>Method:<\/i><\/b> We analyzed the effectiveness of acoustophoretic circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation from 6 mL PFA fixed red blood cell lysed blood from 12 metastatic prostate cancer patients and 20 healthy control subjects and compared it to the golden standard CellSearch. For acoustic cell separation, cells were diluted in 12 mL PBS based buffer and separated by acoustophoresis and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry using a standardized antibody panel (EpCAM, cytokeratin, CD45, CD66b, DAPI). Generally, CTCs, and clusters migrate faster than white blood cells (WBCs) when exposed to ultrasound in the microchannel during acoustophoresis and can therefore be separated from nucleated blood cells.<br \/><b><i>Major findings:<\/i><\/b> Our pilot study shows that acoustophoresis finds both singlets and clusters of CTCs in patients as well as aggregates of CTCs and WBCs. In total, 67 cancer cell containing cell clusters were identified. Most identified cell clusters were small, containing less than 4 cells. In addition, acoustophoresis is a label-free separation technique, and could therefore identify additional subclasses of CTCs among the detected CTCs with e.g., EpCAM low\/- expression. Further, we provide extensive data for the effect of storage time on acoustophoretic separation performance for fixed prostate cancer cell line cells and WBCs. Demonstrating that sample processing can be done up to 72 hours after blood sampling. We believe this is to date the most comprehensive study of acoustic separation of CTCs in patients and control subjects.<br \/><b><i>Conclusion:<\/i><\/b> Label-free acoustophoresis is a potential method for future non-invasive molecular interrogation of metastatic cancers. We believe Acoustophoresis is a promising technology for CTC enrichment with the possibility to detect new subclasses of CTCs as well as cell clusters not detectable with CellSearch.

These treatments are increasingly supplemented with monoclonal antibodies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint-blocking antibodies. The use of these therapies is typically dependent on solid tissue biopsy to confirm elevated expression of these markers in the solid tumor, which carries complications and may only be sampled at diagnosis. In contrast, a liquid biopsy may detect these markers with minimal invasiveness and at multiple points throughout treatment and recovery. Here, we describe the development of an automated and integrated workflow for circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis. We previously demonstrated that the CapioCyte method is a highly sensitive approach for enrichment of CTCs using a combination of biomimetic rolling on recombinant E-selectin and antibody-mediated capture on a nanostructured polymer surface within a flow chamber for capture. Here we report a fully automated CapioCyte instrument for CTC purification and immunofluorescence staining using epithelial, white blood cell and nuclear makers to identify and distinguish CTCs from WBCs while also quantifying EGFR or PD-L1 presence on respective CTCs. The immunostaining conditions were developed and validated for high analytical sensitivity and specificity using cell lines and health donor white blood cells with known biomarker status. The final assay conditions were transferred to the CapioCyte for automated immunostaining. CapioCyte enriched and stained CTC samples are paired with the BioView Allegro Plus platform, an imaging and analysis solution using machine learning and customized algorithms for automated imaging and CTC candidate identification based on high-resolution Z-stack images. The reported comprehensive and automated workflow was used to enumerate CTCs in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in a feasibility cohort. Median CTC counts from NSCLC patients was 7.5 CTC\/ml (n=26, mean 51.7, range 0.3 - 406.2). Studies are on-going to expand the cohort including testing blood from head and neck cancer patients and respective EGFR and PD-L1 status. The combined and automated CapioCyte-Allegro Plus workflow shows great potential for routine quantification of CTCs and EGFR and PD-L1 status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Immunohistochemistry,Machine learning algorithm,Automated Imaging and enumeration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-h.

CTCs and tdEVs are independent prognostic factors in MBC, however, liquid biopsy studies focusing on ILC are to date scarce. Higher CTC levels have been observed in ILC than IDC. One study including 28 ILC pts suggested the use of higher CTC cutoff for prognosis stratification. The clinical significance of tdEVs in ILC is unexplored. This study aimed to assess differences in the distribution and prognostic value of CTCs and tdEVs between ILC and IDC.<br \/><b>Methods<br \/><\/b>Blood samples were collected from 304 pts with MBC before starting a new line of therapy at Northwestern University (Chicago, IL) between 2016 and 2021 (NU16B06 trial). Blood was processed with the CellSearch&#174; system. The ACCEPT software was applied to CellSearch&#174; images to automatically enumerate CTCs and tdEVs. Association of CTCs and tdEVs with overall survival (OS) was tested in ILC and IDC pts. A count of CTCs &#8805; 5 was considered high. The cutoff levels for tdEVs were &#60; 20 (low), 20-79 (intermediate), and &#8805; 80 (high), as previously reported. Additional exploratory cutoffs for CTCs (&#8805; 20, &#8805; 50, &#8805; 80, and &#8805; 100) and tdEVs (based on quartiles of tdEV distribution in the overall population and ILC) were also evaluated.<br \/><b>Results<br \/><\/b>Of the 304 pts, 47 had ILC while 257 had IDC. 56% of pts received first-line therapy. Median CTC count was 8 [interquartile range (IQR) 2-35] in ILC and 1 (IQR 0-8) in IDC pts (P &#60;.001). A significantly higher median tdEVs count was observed in ILC (36; IQR 18-115) than in IDC (11; IQR 2-86) pts (P =.002). High levels of CTCs (&#8805;5) were not associated with OS in ILC (P =.88), even when higher cutoffs (&#8805; 20, &#8805; 50, and &#8805; 80) were used. Only the detection of &#8805; 100 CTCs was significantly associated with OS in ILC pts (median OS 36 vs 10 months; HR 3.4; P =.028). In contrast, the prognostic effect of CTCs &#8805; 5 was strong in IDC and maintained for all cutoffs. Similarly, while the prognostic value for tdEVs was confirmed for IDC using both 20-80 and exploratory cutoffs (3-105 and 18-155), no association between tdEV levels and OS was observed in ILC regardless of the cutoffs used.<br \/><b>Conclusion<br \/><\/b>ILC is associated with higher CTCs and tdEVs compared to IDC, probably due to the impaired cell-cell adhesion that characterizes ILC. Unlike IDC, the prognostic effect for the established cutoff of &#8805; 5 CTC was not observed in ILC. A higher CTC cutoff could be considered for this subtype of BC. For tdEV no association with OS was observed, regardless of the cutoff used. These findings emphasize that ILC is a distinct entity also in the liquid biopsy features. Because of the low prevalence of ILC, research efforts should be directed at combining data from ILC pts to better characterize this subtype of BC and understand the reason behind the different associations with OS as compared to IDC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Extracellular vesicles,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

The study of CTCs comes with technical challenges due to their heterogeneity and low cell numbers, leading to difficulties in genomic characterization. This study aims to overcome these technical challenges by developing a comprehensive gene expression profiling workflow using qPCR and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on rare cells enriched with Genesis System with Celselect Slides<sup>TM<\/sup>.<br \/>Methods: To mimic CTCs in blood, we created a rare cell model sample by spiking A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells at concentrations of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 cells\/ml in whole blood from healthy donors. The Genesis System, which can capture rare cells of 8&#181;m-30&#181;m, isolated 83.73% of spiked A549 cells in whole blood. Using the same blood samples without A549 spiked in, we enriched cells using the Genesis and it was used as a baseline for gene expression controls. High quality RNA was extracted from each of the enriched samples and used for both qPCR and RNA-Seq to detect the gene expression signature of the non-small cell lung cancer cells.<br \/>Results: Our analyses revealed significant differential expression of cancer-related genes (p &#60; 0.05) in all A549-spiked samples when compared to the blood-only controls. Notably, in the 50 cells\/ml dilution, RNA-Seq analysis identified over 3,000 differentially expressed genes, encompassing protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs, and small non-coding RNAs. Among these, 759 genes were consistently present across all enriched samples, suggesting a common expression pattern. To investigate the potential utility of these genes as non-small cell lung cancer biomarkers, we constructed a custom qPCR array comprising 38 of these genes and pre-amplified their targets using 50pg of RNA from the enriched cell samples. Notably, six genes from this panel (MET, TOP2A, NF1, SPP1, GAPDH, and ANXA5) exhibited significant differential expression (+\/- 4-fold, p&#60;0.05) in the enriched samples. MET and TOP2A, in particular, are well-known biomarkers for non-small cell lung cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: Our liquid biopsy workflow demonstrates the recovery of high-quality RNA from enriched rare cells, including CTCs. It enables comprehensive profiling of the tumor transcriptome, encompassing RNAs of various sizes, including miRNAs. Our approach has the potential to facilitate the identification of patient-specific biomarkers, enabling swift monitoring using preamplification and qPCR in advancement of targeted oncology therapy and research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer and is characterized by poor prognosis and survival rate. This is associated with the fact that most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease and the possibility of recurrence after treatment remains high. Monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT1 and MCT4) play a crucial role in cellular metabolism, as they are responsible for the transport of lactate and other monocarboxylic acids across the plasma membrane. Their function can further regulate cell survival and proliferation, especially under hypoxic conditions. To elucidate the relationship between CTCs and the metabolic aspect of cancer, we aimed to investigate the expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in CTCs derived from NSCLC patients and its potential association with patients&#8217; outcome.<br \/>Methods: Fifty-three NSCLC patients at baseline were enrolled in the current study. CTCs were isolated using the ISET system and triple immunofluorescence experiments were performed, using CK, MCT1, MCT4, and CD45 antibodies. The expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in CTCs was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.<br \/>Results: CTCs were detected in 29 out of 53 (55%) NSCLC patients. CK expression was characterized as high or low, with the predominant phenotypes among CK-positive patients being the CK<sub>high<\/sub>\/MCT1+\/CD45-and CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT4-\/CD45- (63% and 66%, respectively). Whereas the phenotype CK<sub>high<\/sub>\/MCT4+\/CD45- was detected in 52% of the patients. The phenotypes with the lowest frequency were the CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT4+\/CD45- (7%), CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT1+\/CD45- (15%), and the CK<sub>high<\/sub>\/MCT1-\/CD45- (15%). Most of the isolated CTCs had the CK<sub>high<\/sub>\/MCT1+\/CD45- and CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT4-\/CD45- phenotypes with a mean percentage of 48% and 51% respectively, while only a small number of CTCs per patient were CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT1+\/CD45- or CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT4+\/CD45- (8%and 5%, respectively). The phenotype CK<sub>low<\/sub>\/MCT1-\/CD45- was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) [<i>p<\/i> = 0.005, (15 vs 33 months respectively)], HR=0.351), while the presence of more than 3 CK<sub>high<\/sub>\/MCT4+\/CD45- CTCs was related to poorer progression-free survival (PFS) [<i>p<\/i> = 0.042 (4 vs 17 months respectively)].<br \/>Conclusions: MCT1 and MCT4 were expressed in a high proportion of NSCLC patients at baseline and may constitute interesting biomarkers relevant to cancer progression. However, further analysis in a larger cohort of patients is required to clarify their potential significance in clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Lung cancer: non-small cell,MCT1,MCT4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.

NSG mice, which are a strain of immunodeficient mice frequently utilized as a non-clinical model for cancer research, exhibit diminished levels of natural killer (NK) cells and abnormal monocytes in their bloodstream. In a previous study, a positive correlation was observed between the duration of injection and the levels of white blood cells (WBC) in mice that were injected with various cancer cell lines derived from humans. To evaluate the correlation among the primary tumor and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as well as the impact on immune cells, we assessed changes in immune cell composition, primary tumor size, and enumeration of CTCs in xenografted mice over a period of time. This investigation was carried out using CytoGen's Smart Biopsy&#8482; systems. The results, which were obtained using equipment including CytoGen's Smart Biopsy&#8482; Systems, showed that the distribution of white blood cell (WBC) components exhibited variations based on age, primary tumor burden, and circulating tumor cell (CTC) count following injection. A notable association was observed between the augmentation of immune cells and the quantity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) present in the bloodstream. Therefore, alterations in immune cells may potentially impact the potential to affect the ability to influence the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, metabolic therapy, and anti-metastatic therapy. When conducting non-clinical investigations with the objective of developing cancer treatment protocols, it is crucial to meticulously select humanized or immunodeficient mice that are appropriate for the study. Therefore, it is advisable to perform regular monitoring of murine blood samples in order to observe any variations in the counts of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), while considering a standardized blood volume per individual. In the immunodeficient mouse model, the existence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) results in an increase in the quantity of cells present in the bloodstream. The observed rise in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is found to be concurrent with the progression and development of the primary tumor. The consideration of this aspect is of utmost importance in the formulation of non-clinical studies aimed at the development of cancer treatment protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Preclinical testing,Immune cells,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

ALK+ NSCLC will frequently develop mutations during treatment, leading to nonresponse and eventually cancer relapse. Therefore, there is a critical need for sensitive technologies to monitor ALK+ NSCLC disease status in patients over time.<br \/>To facilitate longitudinal monitoring, there has been a rapid evolution in diagnostic technologies leveraging circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a liquid biopsy tool. CTCs can be collected non-invasively at various intervals throughout patient treatment. Moreover, they shed from solid tumors and disseminate into the bloodstream, which makes isolating CTCs a valuable source of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic insights pertaining to the primary tumor. In this study, we present a comprehensive workflow for conducting multi-omic analysis on CTCs derived from ALK+ NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><br \/>Blood samples were collected from a cohort of ALK+ NSCLC patients, and CTCs were isolated using a high throughput, label free microfluidic device, Labyrinth. Enriched CTCs were immunofluorescently stained for cytokeratin, CD45, DAPI, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and vimentin markers. Heterogeneous CTC populations with hybrid epithelial\/mesenchymal (EM) phenotypes are reported. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on enriched CTC samples. DNA was extracted and sequenced using a 523 gene targeted sequencing panel. Single cell RNA-seq technology was performed in parallel on CTC samples to investigate the gene expression throughout treatment.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><br \/>The median concentration of CTCs in the ALK+ NSCLC cohort (n=33) is 137 CTCs per ml of blood, and 64% of CTCs are in an EM hybrid state. In ALK+ NSCLC patients (n=3) with an average of 4.6 visits per sample, we observed a trend of decreasing CTC concentration for patients with partial response to the treatment. The presence of ALK fusion in ALK+ NSCLC patient&#8217;s CTC is confirmed by FISH. Oncogenic mutations (JAK1, SPEN, ERBB4, NTRK3) are observed in bulk CTC samples from two NSCLC patients. Single cell RNA sequencing was performed on three ALK+ NSCLC patients; 58, 199, and 700 potential CTCs were detected with positive cytokeratin expression and no white blood cell marker expression.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><br \/>This study examined the feasibility of using CTCs for studying and monitoring the clinical status of the ALK+ NSCLC patients as well as the genomic and transcriptomic signatures within their tumors. More patients will need to be processed in order to validate our workflow and reinforce our conclusions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Multiomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Confirmation of AR-V7 expression is important step in prostate cancer diagnosis and determining the drug, but the detection of AR-V7 with tissues has limitations such as clinical challenge to poorly accessible tumor tissues before and after treatment. Here, we developed the method of AR-V7 detection in circulating tumor cells (CTC) after isolation with CytoGen&#8217;s Smart Biopsy<sup>TM<\/sup> CTC isolator by in vitro assays of qPCR and immunofluorescence (IF) with high sensitivity and specificity, overcoming the limitations of tissue biopsy.<br \/>Method: qPCR and IF methods were developed for high sensitivity and specificity of AR-V7 detection. Sensitivity and specificity were tested using AR-V7 positive cells (VCaP and 22Rv1) and negative cells (PC-3 and Raji). Limit of detection (LOD) test of AR-V7 expression was performed with AR-V7 positive cells (200 cells to 50 cells, 3 points) mixed with Raji cells (1x10^5cells). Then, AR-V7 positive cells (200 cells to 50 cells, 3 points) were spiked into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of blood sample (5mL, healthy donor) to mimic CTC after isolation by CytoGen&#8217;s Smart Biopsy<sup>TM<\/sup> CTC isolator, subsequently AR-V7 expression was tested with qPCR and IF assay.<br \/>Results: AR-V7 expression was clearly detected by qPCR and IF in the LOD test of AR-V7 positive cells mixed with Raji cells and was not detected at all in the negative controls. The similar clear results were also observed in the spiking test of AR-V7 positive cells into PBMC isolated by CytoGen&#8217;s Smart Biopsy<sup>TM<\/sup> CTC isolator, suggesting that clinical samples of prostate cancer could be applied with excellent sensitivity and specificity for AR-V7.<br \/>Conclusions: AR-V7 expresses only a part of cancer tissue, so it is difficult to accurately diagnose with traditional histological assays. Detection of AR-V7 in intact live CTC isolated by CytoGen&#8217;s Smart Biopsy<sup>TM<\/sup> CTC isolator might overcome limitations of tissue biopsy. In this study, we developed the method to detect AR-V7 in CTC with high sensitivity and specificity with qPCR and IF assay, and presented the results of verifying AR-V7 expression by double check using two kinds of assays.

Comprehending PDAC's mutational landscape through NGS-based assays, acquiring representative tumor tissue biopsies remains arduous. Single circulating tumor cell (sCTC) genomics could provide clinically relevant personalized diagnostics. Here we demonstrate comparative analysis of sCTCs genomics and ctDNA outcomes in paired advanced PDAC patients.<br \/>Methods: Retrospectively, 25 live sCTCs and sCTC clusters were isolated from 10 advanced PDAC patients' blood using OncoRadar platform consisting glass beads conjugated with antiEPCam antibodies, tuned for releasing CTCs, without cell fixing, an assay in 96 well plate. Whole genomes from sCTCs were amplified using random degenerate primer-based PCR. Amplified genomes and paired ctDNA were subjected to CGP using clinical assay OncoIndx&#174; to identify patient-specific genomic alterations in sCTC and paired ctDNA samples. The raw sequence alignment and variant calling was performed using iCare software&#174;.<br \/>Results: Live 25 sCTCs and 8 CTC clusters were isolated (&#8805;2 CTCs). Mutational profiling revealed multiple pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) variants. sCTCs exhibited at least twice as many P variants compared to paired ctDNA samples, with CHD4, FGFR2, and HNF1&#945; being the most common. The mutational profile of sCTCs showed concordance with at least one variant in paired ctDNA, and was enriched in dysregulated cytoskeleton and cell migration machinery. Specifically, COL7A, KIF5B, and RHOA mutations were prevalent in almost all sCTCs, with exclusive mutations (KIF5B and RHOA) in some cases. KRAS P variants were exclusive to 50% of ctDNA samples, paired sCTCs exhibited NRAS P variants. RAS isoforms were observed in 70% of sCTCs. Gene amplification occurred in CCND1\/2, FGFR2, and ERBB2 in 90% of sCTCs, with CCND1 amplification more prevalent in sCTC clusters. Mutations in epigenetic repressors (HDAC1, KDM2B) were ubiquitous in sCTCs, co-occurring with DDR pathway mutations (F test, P 0.003, OR 11). Loss-of-function BRCA mutations were detected in 60% of sCTCs, and were absent in paired ctDNA. Additionally, 70% of sCTCs exhibited therapy-resistant variants (NF1, STK11, ARID1A, and PIK3CA), contrasting with a 10% frequency in paired ctDNA.<br \/>Conclusions: Genomic profile of sCTCs in advanced PDAC patients revealed a complex mutational landscape, providing additional clinically relevant insights that complemented ctDNA findings. sCTCs exhibited greater tumor mutational heterogeneity compared to paired ctDNA samples, and detected additional actionable pathogenic variants. Results suggest that sCTCs may offer therapeutically relevant molecular information for advanced PDAC patients for whom tissue is unavailable and ctDNA fails to provide actionable therapy options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biomarkers,Circulating tumor cells,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We report, an assay to selectively capture live sCTCs at singularity with NGS-based comprehensive mutational profiling in breast cancer (BC) patients. Further, paired ctDNA outcomes using blood with mutational heterogeneity scores of sCTCs adds comprehensive genomics for establishing an accelerated treatment outcomes and resistance signatures.<br \/>Methods: Retrospectively, sCTC were isolated from 70 breast cancer (BC) patients using OncoRadar platform consisting affinity-based glass beads mediated by anti EpCAM antibody. CTCs were selectively captured and released without fixing and contamination of any leukocytes. Platform possess cleavable disulfide spacer at pH 8.0, between glass beads (diam. 2 mm, area 12.57 mm2) and a ligand. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), and accuracy were evaluated using MCF-7 cells and CTCs. Assay to isolate CTC has been developed in 96 well plate, for downstream NGS-based comprehensive gene panel analysis using hybridization-based target enrichment. Interestingly, no mutations detected in blood samples (~20%) for CtDNA versus CTC DNA offered non-chip implicated mutations.<br \/>Results:. Analytical validation using OncoRadar showed higher cell capture efficiency (99%) with spiked MCF-7 cells\/ml of blood. Sensitivity and specificity values were 97% and 98% respect, while PPV was 99% and NPV was 7.5% with the accuracy parameter of 99%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV parameters when assessed for CTC isolation from 70 BC patients. NGS-based mutational analysis, sCTC showed the presence of PIK3CA, ESR1, and NF1 mutations, which were absent from paired ctDNA samples.<br \/>Conclusion: Detection of ctDNA obscure mutations in paired sCTC samples suggests high sensitivity of sCTC-based genomic assays compared to current standard of practice. Heterogeneity scores amongst inter and intra CTCs with MATH scores offer new dimensions in genomics. Combination of ctDNA and sCTC DNA assay offers a comprehensive realistic genomic outcome for more significant therapy decisions, especially when guideline based options may exhausts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Circulating cell-free DNA,Circulating tumor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

The effectiveness of three- or six-months adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer estimation showed association of CTCs with the emergence of resistant cell clones. The presence of CTCs with clusters indicates an aggressiveness of the epithelial cancers. However, the presence of CTC clusters has not been evaluated in large populations. Here, we demonstrate the distribution prophecy of CTCs and CTC clusters in epithelial cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Retrospectively, 3458 patients' blood sample was analyzed for the presence and distribution of CTCs and CTC clusters using DCGI approved OncoDiscover platform having immunomagnetic multicomponent system mediated by anti EpCAM antibody. 1.5 mL of peripheral blood was analyzed to capture cells and clusters from Head &#38; Neck, breast, and lung cancer patients. Earlier the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of OncoDiscover assay was presented. CTCs and clusters were identified with CK 18 +ve, DAPI + ve and CD45 -ve staining using automated motorized fluorescence microscopy. CTCs clusters were defined by the presence of two or more CTCs bound together.<br \/>Results: .Out of 3458 epithelial cancer patients, 65.52 % patients showed the distribution of CTCs ~ 2262 (CTC numbers varied from 1-9\/ 1.5 mL), while 7.54% patients showed CTC clusters (261 clusters). Total number of captured CTCs and clusters were 19345 (mean CTCs and cluster distribution was 5.59), while CTC were predominantly in 19037 numbers (98.41%) and clusters were 308 (1.59 %). Highest number of CTS were observed in HNC (52.98%) and breast cancers (22.75%), followed by lung cancer (5.65%). While, prophecy clusters were observed in breast cancers (26.95%), followed by lung (16.23%).<br \/>Conclusions: The frequency and distribution of CTCs and CTC clusters was evaluated in epithelial cancers. Patients with CTC alone and patients having CTCs as well CTC clusters represent more aggressive disease and the progression of disease.

Cases classified as HER2-positive tend to proliferate, metastasize, and often lead to relapse. HER-2 is the most valid tumor marker, used as a diagnostics and prognostic biomarker in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Thus, analysis of expression of HER-2 on CTCs can offer a real time dynamic biomarker for treatment options between endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Functional assays on CTCs with HER-2 biomarker offer evolving biomarkers especially when the tissue is not accessible and inadequate.<br \/>Methods: Retrospectively, 179 breast cancer patients' blood was analyzed for the presence of CTCs using the OncoDiscover&#174; platform approved by Drug Controller General of India (CDSCO). Consisting of immunomagnetic multi-components mediated by anti EpCAM antibodies. The isolated cells were immunostained consisting of a nuclear dye DAPI, CK-18, CD45 and HER-2 antibodies. CTCs were identified by the presence of HER-2 + ve, CK 18 + ve, DAPI + ve and CD 45 -ve staining. Validation of HER-2 expression on the CTCs was analyzed based on the linear intensity gradients of the fluorescence signals. CTCs were termed as HER-2 -ve based on weak or no detectable fluorescence signal and termed +ve based on high fluorescence signal.<br \/>Results: Among the cohort of 179 patient samples, 63.68 % samples showed the presence of CTC (CTC ranged from 1-7). 47.84% of these CTCs showed the expression of HER-2 signal. The mean value for fluorescence intensity for expression of HER-2 in CTCs was found to be 3.23. The observed mean fluorescence intensity for HER-2 expression further emphasizes the robustness of CTCs as a viable source for molecular characterization.<br \/>Conclusion: Integration of HER-2 analysis on CTCs into the clinical assessment of metastatic breast cancer, may offer a non-invasive, real-time strategy for profiling and possibly paving the way for more precise and tailored therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Hormone receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
