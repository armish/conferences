PI3K also regulates immunity; inhibition of this pathway suppresses Tregs and myeloid derived suppressor cells resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. Murine experiments combining PD-1 and PI3K inhibition showed an increased CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell:Treg ratio and improved survival compared to either alone. We launched a multicenter phase I\/II investigation of copanlisib (PI3K inhibitor) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in 2 cohorts of patients with metastatic MSS CRC, Cohort 1: PIK3CA mutant (PI3KCAm) and Cohort 2: PIK3CA wild type (PIK3CAwt). From 2\/2019 to 4\/2022, 39 patients were enrolled: 6 in the phase 1 portion and 33 in phase 2 (22 PIK3CAm\/17 PIK3CAwt). All patients had received at least 2 lines of prior therapy. Patient demographics and best treatment responses are in Table 1. There were no dose-limiting toxicities; toxicities were as expected and tolerable, most commonly hypertension in 16 (41%) patients and maculopapular rash in 4 (10%) patients.<b> <\/b>3 patients in cohort 1 (14%) had partial responses (PR) and 3 had stable disease (SD): (range 1.7-4.7 mo.). One patient in Cohort 2 (6%) had a PR and 4 had SD: (range 3.8-7.4 mo.). Notably, all 4 responses have lasted more than 2 years. The trial incorporated robust translational correlates for mechanism interrogation with serial biopsies and blood draws. We will report circulating cytokine profiling, mass cytometry on PBMCs, and highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging (CyCIF) on paired pre- and on-treatment tissue specimens to i) dissect immune and PI3K pathway changes with treatment ii) correlate these to clinical responses and iii) determine baseline biomarkers of response and mechanism of effect. Overall copanlisib\/nivolumab was well tolerated. The PIK3CAm CRC cohort met the primary endpoint for objective response rate but later than 6 months as responses were evolving.<br \/><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{E312451C-3536-4BA0-8C7C-F2D5D8E0F336}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\">Table 1: Demographics and Best Treatment Responses of Patients Treated on NCT03711058: Study of Copanlisib and Nivolumab in MSS Colorectal Cancer<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&nbsp;<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sex<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Race<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RAS-RAF status<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Best Response<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TMB<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total (n=39)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58 (40-83)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 53%(21), M: 47%(18)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AA: 15%(6), AS: 8%(3), W: 77%(30)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered: 67%(26), Wild type: 33%(13)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 10%(4), SD: 18%(7), PD: 72%(28)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (1-10)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PIK3CA mutant (n=22)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">57.5 (42-83)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 73%(16), M: 27%(6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AA:23%(5), AS: 9%(2), W: 68%(15)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered: 73%(16), Wild type: 27%(6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 14%(3), SD: 14%(3), PD: 73%(16)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (1-10)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Exon 9 mutation (n=13)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58 (45-83)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 77%(10), M: 23%(3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AA: 15%(2), AS: 8%(1), W: 77%(10)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered 85%(11), Wild type: 15%(2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 8%(1), SD: 8%(1), PD: 85%(11)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.9 (1-18)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Exon 20 mutation (n=5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62 (43-76)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 80%(4), M: 20%(1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AA: 20%(1), W: 80%(4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered: 80%(4), Wild type: 20%(1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 20%(1), SD: 20%(1), PD: 60%(3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (3-8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other (n=4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">46 (42-54)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 50%(2), M: 50%(2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AS: 25%(1), AA: 50%(2), W: 25%(1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered: 75%(3), Wild type: 25%(1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 25%(1), PD: 75%(3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.3 (3-7.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PIK3CA wild type (n=17)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">59 (40-81)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F: 29%(5), M: 71%(12)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AA: 6%(1), AS: 6%(1), W: 82%(15)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Altered: 59%(10), Wild type: 41%(7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR: 6%(1), SD: 24%(4), PD: 71%(12)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.5 (1-9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\">AA: African American, AS: Asian, C: Caucasian, F: Female, M: Male, PD: Progressive disease, PR: Partial Response, SD: Stable disease<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PIK3CA,Molecular targets,Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV), an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a FR&#945;-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid DM4, showed tolerability and single agent activity in a Phase 1 dose expansion study in FR&#945;-positive advanced\/recurrent EC (NCT01609556). In addition to target-mediated cytotoxicity, MIRV activates monocytes and promotes phagocytosis of tumor cells through Fc-Fc&#947;R interactions. We therefore hypothesized that MIRV would improve the low response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in MSS\/pMMR EC and conducted this two-stage, phase 2, single cohort study evaluating the activity of MIRV in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent\/persistent EC (NCT03835819).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients with advanced or recurrent MSS\/pMMR, FR&#945; positive (defined as &#8805;50% of tumor cells with &#8805;2+ staining on IHC by Ventana, Inc.) serous EC received MIRV 6 mg\/kg AIBW and pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients could have received 1-3 prior lines of therapy; prior ICI therapy was allowed. The co-primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST 1.1 and frequency of patients surviving progression-free for 6 months (PFS6). In the first stage of the study, 16 patients were enrolled; if there were &#8805;2 objective responses or &#8805;2 PFS6 responses, an additional 19 patients would be enrolled in Stage 2. If a total of 4 objective responses or 8 PFS6 events were achieved, the combination would be considered worthy of further study.<br \/><b>Data: <\/b>Among 130 patient tumors prescreened for FR&#945; expression, the median FR&#945; (% of tumor cells with &#8805;2+ staining) was 30% (IQR: 5-55) and 43 (33.1%) were FR&#945; positive (PS 2+ &#8805;50%). As of data-cutoff in November 2023, a total of 16 patients had received study treatment with median follow-up of 4.7 months (IQR 2.9, 17.3). Of 16 treated patients, 6 patients (37.5%, 95% CI: 15.2-64.6%) achieved an objective response, including 1 patient achieving a confirmed CR and 5 patients achieving a PR [3 confirmed PR (18.8%) and 2 unconfirmed PR (12.5%)] (Fig. 1). An additional 31.3% (5\/16) had stable disease and two patients were alive and progression free at 6 months. The most common TRAEs included AST elevation (50%), blurred vision (44%), fatigue (44%) and diarrhea (43%); grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 2 patients (12.5%). Ocular toxicities of any grade were reported in 56.3% of patients. Updated efficacy and safety data as well as ongoing correlative studies will be reported at the time of the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In this investigator-initiated study, the combination of MIRV and pembrolizumab met the co-primary endpoint to be considered worthy of further study in FR&#945;-positive recurrent MSS\/pMMR serous EC. Investigations into subpopulations most likely to derive clinical benefit from this combination are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immunotherapy,Folate receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Given poor outcomes, there remains a clear unmet need in this pt population. IMvoke010 (NCT03452137) evaluated the efficacy and safety of atezo in pts with LA SCCHN who are at high-risk for disease progression following multi-modal definitive tx.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Eligible pts with LA SCCHN (Stage IVa or IVb involving the oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx, HPV negative oropharynx or Stage III HPV positive oropharynx [per AJCC 8th edition]) with no disease progression after multi-modal definitive tx were randomized (1:1) to receive atezo 1200 mg or placebo. Tx was given every 3 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint: investigator-assessed event-free survival (INV-EFS). Other key endpoints: overall survival (OS, secondary for efficacy) and safety<b>. <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>A total of 406 pts were randomized to receive either atezo (n=203) or placebo (n=203). 156 (38.4%) pts underwent surgery as part of definitive tx.
