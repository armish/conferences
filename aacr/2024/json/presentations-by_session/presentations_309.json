[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction<\/b>: The most prevalent subtype of breast cancer is HR+\/HER2- (positive for hormone receptor, negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). For metastatic breast cancer (mBC), a frequent occurrence is resistance to the aromatase inhibitors used in endocrine therapy (ET). Resistance is mediated through mutations in the ligand binding domain of estrogen receptor 1 (<i>ESR1<\/i>). Approval of elacestrant, a second-line agent for HR+\/HER2-\/<i>ESR1<\/i> mutated mBC , underscores the need for early detection of ESR1 resistance mutations. We have developed sensitive RT-qPCR reagents for targeted longitudinal studies into the emergence of <i>ESR1 <\/i>resistance mutations in plasma. This all-inclusive kit analyzes circulating exosomal RNA (exoRNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to accurately identify low copy number mutations with a rapid turnaround time.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Challenge panels were constructed using blends of synthetic nucleic acids of known mutational status in a background of partially fragmented wild-type DNA from cell lines. Additionally, plasma samples collected from subjects with stage IV mBC (HR+\/HER2-) on active aromatase inhibitor therapy, +\/- CDK 4\/6 inhibitor for a minimum of one year, were subjected to an in-house method optimized to co-enrich exoRNA and cfDNA. Multiplex RT-qPCR-based target enrichment performed on 11 <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations and an internal control were evaluated on widely used thermal cycler and qPCR instruments.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We developed technology that interrogates 11 key <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations associated with ET resistance in HR+\/HER2- mBC cases. Earlier studies performed in simplex analyzed plasmid-based <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations with detection of 10 or fewer mutant copies, estimating analytical sensitivity of at least 0.1% (5 mutant copies in a background of 5,000 WT copies). Herein, we describe the subsequent work to complete the methodology employed in the kit, including the incorporation of an endogenous control, external batch run control materials (positive, negative), deeply optimized reagents (RT, pre-amplification, qPCR), and automated analysis. We report on the results of studies into the kit&#8217;s performance characteristics against their targets: analytical sensitivity of the equivalent of 5 copies of mutation per mL plasma, high precision across replicates at 0.1% allele fraction, analytical specificity of &#8805;90% negative results in mutation-negative replicates, as well as workflow attributes (reduced pipetting steps and turnaround time).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our solution to detect <i>ESR1 <\/i>resistance mutations facilitates the generation of nucleic acid sample to results within one day using liquid biopsy samples and a multiplexed RT-qPCR. Enhancing mutation detection sensitivity by complementing cfDNA with exoRNA will facilitate future research into breast cancer treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastatic tumors,Estrogen receptor,Molecular diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

Specifics subgroups of CUP that share similarities with cancers of known primary beneficiate from tissue-tailored therapeutic strategies. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical and biological presentation of a cohort of patients with suspected CUP of renal origin (rCUP) and to evaluate their optimal therapeutic management.<br \/>Methods: All Patients with rCUP identified prospectively between 2020 and 2023 within the French National Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for CUP were included. Centralized pathological review and immunohistochemical stainings were performed. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), whole transcriptomic sequencing (RNAseq) and application of the deep-learning based algorithm TransCUPtomics for prediction of tissue of origin, and DNA methylation analysis were performed and compared to public renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.<br \/>Results: 23 patients were included. The median age at diagnosis was 57 yo and 17\/23 were male. The most common metastatic sites were the bones (N=17) and the lymph nodes (N=14). 19\/23 patients presented with at least two distinct distant metastatic sites. Genomic analyses performed in 10 patients led to the identification of recurrent inactivating mutations in genes commonly altered in RCC, including NF2 (N=7), SETD2 (N=3), or VHL (N=1). 10\/11 samples analyzed by RNAseq were predicted as RCC by the TransCUPtomics classifier based on their gene expression profiles. DNA methylation profiling performed in 7 samples showed major similarity with known RCC subtypes.Centralized pathological review and integration of molecular characteristics led to the final diagnoses of papillary RCC (N=2), clear cell RCC (N=7), renal medullary carcinoma (N=1), TFEB-amplified RCC (N=1) and unclassified RCC (N=12). 20\/23 patients received at least one line of systemic treatment based on the renal origin, including anti-angiogenic TKI, anti-PD1\/PDL1 antibody, anti-CTLA4 antibody or mTOR inhibitor. The median PFS under the first renal-oriented systemic treatment was 5 months and 10 patients remained progression-free for more than 6 months under tailored-treatment. The median OS was 31 months, and 11 patients are still alive in October 2023.<br \/>Conclusions: This study shows that rCUP represent a new entity within CUPs that shares major similarities with classical RCC despite the more frequent presentation of unfavorable prognostic factors. Prolonged survival can be observed with renal-tailored systemic treatment, supporting the individualization of these patients within CUP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,Cancers of unknown primary,Renal cell carcinoma,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Here we present the analytical validation results of an expanded targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 141 clinically relevant genes for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Based on review of clinical guidelines, 141 genes including 79 myeloid and 84 lymphoid associated genes were selected. The expanded hematological panel interrogates all coding exons of the 141 genes to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions\/deletions (indels). The panel also identifies copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 16 genes, <i>FLT3<\/i> internal tandem duplicates (ITDs), select non-coding pathogenic variants, and patient sex. The custom hybrid capture-based assay utilizes genomic libraries created from 250 ng gDNA extracted from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cell suspensions, followed by sequencing on Illumina&#174; instruments. Concordance studies were performed on clinical samples previously assessed using an orthogonal NGS-based laboratory developed test for SNVs\/indels\/<i>FLT3<\/i>-ITDs or digital multiplexed ligation-dependent probe amplification for CNAs. In total, 308 patient samples were evaluated and included 72 (23.4%) acute myeloid leukemia and 58 (18.8%) myelodysplastic syndromes samples among other indications, of which 240 (77.9%) were bone marrow specimens. Analysis of concordance demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 99.7% for SNVs (750\/752), 99.5% for indels &#60;25bp (206\/207), and 95.7% for indels &#8805; 25bp (22\/23). Variants were from 45 genes including <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>NPM1<\/i>, and <i>IDH1\/2<\/i>. PPA was 100% for <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITDs (38\/38; size range 18-300 bp) and sex (294\/294). For CNAs, PPA was 96.4% (132\/137) and negative percent agreement (NPA) was 98.3% (931\/947). Assay precision was determined using three replicates of 15 clinical samples for both intra and inter-assay precision using multiple operators, instruments, and reagent lots. 100% concordance was observed for SNVs (36\/36), indels (11\/11), a 24 bp <i>FLT3<\/i>-ITD (1\/1), CNAs (24\/24), and sex (15\/15). Analytical specificity was assessed using 5 replicates of NA12878 showing specificity &#62;99.99% for SNVs\/indels with variant allele frequency &#8805; 3%, and &#62;99.99% for CNAs with copy number &#8804;0.85 or &#8805;1.15. Dilution series to determine analytical sensitivity are in progress. This study highlights the analytical validation of the expanded NGS panel for the detection of clinically informative genomic alterations in hematologic malignancies. Results from this validation study, when complete, will include at least 576 samples plus orthogonal testing. These data describe the performance of the assay to enable a comprehensive evaluation of genomic alterations using a single sample, further facilitating the use of broad NGS assays in patients with hematologic malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Molecular profiling,Precision medicine,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Grant Hogg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tong Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Helen Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Adib Shafi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashraf Shabaneh<sup>1<\/sup>, Jon Williams<sup>1<\/sup>, John Howitt<sup>2<\/sup>, Amanda Williamson<sup>2<\/sup>, Rachel Dango<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaojun Guan<sup>1<\/sup>, Heidi Hoffmann<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Mooney<sup>2<\/sup>, John Pruitt<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Parker<sup>2<\/sup>, Henry Dong<sup>4<\/sup>, Stan Letovsky<sup>3<\/sup>, Li Cai<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric  A.

It is an adult-onset systemic inflammatory disorder genetically characterized by somatic mutation of the UBA1 gene which encodes the ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 1. VEXAS patients have overlapping rheumatologic and hematologic manifestations, including increased risk for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is critically important to diagnose VEXAS syndrome, but UBA1 mutation test is still not commercially available. The three most frequent mutations of UBA1 gene are p.M41T(122T&#62;C), p.M41V (c.121A&#62;G), and p.M41L (c.121A&#62;C) in codon 41 of exon 3. Other mutations including splice site mutations at exon 3 (c.118-2A&#62;C, c.118-1G&#62;C and c.118- 9_118-2del), p.S56F (c.167C&#62;T) in codon 56 of exon 3, and p.S621C (c.1861A&#62;T) in codon 621 of exon 16 have been reported. Based on XNA technology, we developed a QClampTM Plex platform to detect all the eight mutations in a single reaction with Luminex system. XNA technology enriches mutant target sequence in a PCR reaction by using synthetic DNA analog XNA (xenonucleic acid) to block wild type DNA. With spiking synthetic mutant DNA in GM24385 cell line DNA, we determined that this assay can detect mutations with a detection limit of variant allele frequency (VAF) for M41T at 0.1%, M41V at 0.1%, M41L at 0.25%, c.118-2A&#62;C at 1%, c.118-1G&#62;C at 1%, c.118- 9_118-2del at 1%, S56F at 0.25% and S621C at 1%, respectively, and specificity of 100% for all mutations. We tested saved DNA samples extracted from whole blood previously collected from suspected VEXAS patients and tested at the National Cancer Institute by Sanger sequencing, including 13 positive and 20 negative samples. Our assay detected all corresponding UBA1 mutations in the 13 positive patient samples, and did not detect UBA1 mutation in 18 of the 20 negative patient samples. Two of the 20 negative samples were also tested positive for UBA1 M41T and M41L on our assay, respectively, due to its significantly higher sensitivity than the Sanger sequencing platform, which has a detection limit of 15-20% VAF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,UBA1 Somatic mutations,multiple mutation detection,VEXAS syndrome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Therefore, it is imperative to conduct further analysis utilizing extensive clinical samples to unveil the clinical and epidemiological profile of NED.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the histopathological samples of patients diagnosed with malignant tumor using immunohistochemical techniques for NED markers, such as ChrA, Syno and CD56. The morbidity and prognosis of NED patient would be analyzed subsequently. Eligible patients must have pathologically confirmed gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer and prostate cancer with no prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy received before surgery. Patients aged 18-75 years with normal organ functions were enrolled.<br \/>Results: Between January 2017 and June 2018, over 450 cases were enrolled. Preliminary analysis focused on 36 esophageal cancer (EC) and 44 prostatic cancer (PC) samples. NED markers were expressed in 4 (11.1%) of 36 EC patients, including 4 cases positive for Syno, 1 case positive for ChrA, and 2 cases positive for CD56. Meanwhile, NED markers were expressed in 15 (34.1%) of 44 PC patients, including 10 cases positive for Syno, 15 cases positive for ChrA, and 2 cases positive for CD56.<br \/>Conclusion: Neuroendocrine differentiation is obviously observed in EC and PC. The encouraging prevalence rate of NED may have clinical implications for individualized treatment.

To benefit this large and diverse patient population, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, including TNG908 and TNG462, have been developed to leverage the synthetic lethal relationship between MTAP deletion and PRMT5 inhibition. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors selectively bind the PRMT5-MTA complex driving selective inhibition of PRMT5 in MTAP-deleted cancers while sparing normal, MTAP-proficient cells. Our PRMT5 inhibitors are currently in Phase I\/II clinical trials (NCT05275478 and NCT05732831), and eligibility is restricted to patients with tumors with confirmed MTAP loss either detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or immunohistochemistry.<br \/>MTAP gene loss occurs in cancers because of its chromosomal proximity to one of the most common genetically altered tumor suppressor genes, CDKN2A, but the chromosomal 9p breakpoints for the co-deletion are not uniform. Indeed, while clinical NGS testing and preclinical data confirm that homozygous intragenic MTAP breakpoints occur, the functional consequence of any given breakpoint on MTAP enzymatic activity and protein function remains unknown. Given the potential implications for homozygous intragenic MTAP deletions to impact the clinical response to MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, we have started to evaluate the loss-of-function phenotype of various MTAP truncations to determine whether they retain MTAP activity. Here, we present our initial functional genomics analysis of this important diagnostic biomarker using in vitro cDNA reconstitution approaches for MTAP activity combined with analysis of PRMT5 inhibitor sensitivity. Ultimately, these data may help refine patient enrollment on clinical trials to drive the maximum benefit for patients with MTAP-deleted cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Cancer genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Several histologic variants, including plasmacytoid, neuroendocrine, and micropapillary subtypes, are associated with an increased bladder cancer recurrence risk and cancer-specific mortality. The molecular basis and therapeutic implications of this phenotypical plasticity remain poorly understood. Enfortumab vedotin (EV), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, has also emerged as a new standard-of-care for metastatic bladder cancer patients, but the association between lineage plasticity as manifested by morphologic heterogeneity in bladder cancer, Nectin-4 expression and ADC response remains poorly defined. Previous DNA-based molecular profiling studies of histologic variants revealed that <i>CDH1<\/i> mutations were the pathognomonic molecular alteration in plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma, but no recurrent driver mutations have been found to be unique to the aberrant histology regions of other mixed histology subtypes. Thus, to explore the molecular basis for the lineage plasticity of bladder cancers with aberrant histology and to define the association between lineage plasticity manifested as morphologic heterogeneity and the expression of Nectin-4, HER2 and other potential ADC targets, we performed RNA-seq of pure urothelial carcinomas (n=118, not otherwise specified, UC-NOS) and bladder tumors with divergent differentiation or histologic subtypes (n=199). Our cohort included a subset of tumors in which RNA-seq was performed on microdissected UC-NOS and variant histology regions of the same tumor. Tumors with neuroendocrine, sarcomatoid and squamous histology had the lowest Nectin-4 expression, whereas histologic subtypes that retained a luminal transcriptional profile such as micropapillary, plasmacytoid and nested histology had higher levels of Nectin-4 expression. In mixed histology tumors, Nectin-4 and\/or HER2 expression was often restricted to only one of the two histologic components. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis noted enrichment of distinct oncogenic pathway gene sets in different histologic variants. Preliminary investigation into the mechanism(s) of Nectin-4 regulation using bladder cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) has identified targetable pathways which when inhibited revert lineage plasticity and induce Nectin-4 expression. In sum, lineage plasticity manifested as heterogenous histomorphologies was associated with heterogeneous Nectin-4 expression in some but not all histologic variants of bladder cancer. Ongoing studies using PDOs from bladder cancer patients with mixed histology will seek to identify molecular pathways whose inhibition leads to increased expression of Nectin-4 or other ADC targets such as HER2 and thus increased sensitivity of ADCs targeting these cell surface proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Therapeutic target,Molecular subtypes,Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

ATC lacks differentiation and loses its thyroid-like functions making it a difficult cancer to treat due to its lack of targetable genetic lesions and unresponsiveness to conventional treatments. Therefore, we investigated genes that had aberrant expression in ATC in relation to differentiation. Using NCBI Gene expression omnibus (GSE33630, GSE85457), which provides publicly available transcriptomic datasets, and bioinformatics software, GEO2R, we found that Homeobox D4 (HOXD4) has 12.5FC higher expression in ATC vs. normal tissue (p=0.000552) and 4.36FC higher in ATC vs. papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in human patients (p=6.69e-08). HOXD4 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cell differentiation and has been associated with a worse prognosis in cancers such as ovarian serous carcinoma. As loss of differentiation is essential to ATC&#8217;s refractory nature and therapeutic resistance, we are exploring modulation of differentiation by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA was used to induce differentiation in ATC cell line T238 therefore abrogating the aggressive phenotype of this cancer. T238 treated with ATRA had a 26% decrease in proliferation at 24 hours, 46% at 48 hours, and 87% at 72 hours measured using a trypan blue exclusion assay. T238 treated with ATRA also had a 44% decrease in migratory capacity at 24 hours and 24% at 48 hours measured by a cell scratch wound assay. Immortalized normal thyroid cell line NTHY-ori-3-1 did not have a significant decrease in either proliferation or migratory capacity when treated with ATRA. T238 cells treated with ATRA for 24 hours had a 30% decrease in HOXD4 protein levels. Lastly, immunohistochemistry staining of HOXD4 in human patient tissue samples confirmed the over-expression of HOXD4 in ATC (19.5% staining) vs. normal tissue (2.5%) and PTC (7.5%). Overall, we hypothesize that the aberrant expression of HOXD4 in ATC plays a crucial role in the aggressive metastatic phenotype and therefore differentiation agents such as ATRA can target this biomarker to modulate the ATC phenotype. Therefore, HOXD4 can be used as a potential prognostic indicator for early detection of ATC. Future studies will involve CRISPRi based knockdown of HOXD4 in vitro and validation of these results in animal in vivo models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic markers,ATRA,Thyroid cancer,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The canonical NF-&#954;B pathway driven by IKK&#946; has been implicated in CRC development and progression, however less research has focused on non-canonical NF-&#954;B signaling, regulated by inhibitory-&#954;B kinase alpha (IKK&#945;). This project aimed to assess IKK&#945;, phospho-IKK&#945; (pIKK&#945;<sup>s176<\/sup>) and IKK&#946; expression in a retrospective CRC cohort to establish association with survival outcomes. Subsequently, this project aimed to determine the effect of abrogating IKK&#945; activity without perturbing the canonical NF-&#954;B pathway controlled by IKK&#946; using a first-in-class selective IKK&#945; inhibitor in vitro\/ex vivo.<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for IKK&#945;\/pIKK&#945; <sup>s176<\/sup>\/IKK&#946; was performed using tissue microarrays from a CRC patient cohort (n=787). QuPath&#174; software was used to semi-quantitively assess expression levels and scores were analyzed for association with cancer-specific survival (CSS). CRC cell lines (n=3), patient-derived organoids (PDOs; n=5) and patient-derived explants (n=5) were treated with novel IKK&#945; inhibitor SU1644 and assessed for cell viability and proliferation.<br \/>Results:<i> <\/i>Positive staining for IKK&#945;, pIKK&#945;<sup>s176<\/sup> and IKK&#946; was detected in tumor specimens. High cytoplasmic expression of IKK&#945; within tumor cells was associated with reduced CSS in patients with right-sided colon cancer (HR=3.091, 95%CI; 1.128-9.467, log rank p=0.021). Conversely, high IKK&#946; expression was a marker of good prognosis (HR=0.627, 95%CI; 0.457-0.861, log rank p=0.004). A high ratio of IKK&#945; to IKK&#946; was associated with reduced CSS in the full cohort (HR=1.404, 95%CI; 1.050-1.879, log rank p=0.021) and this was potentiated in right-sided colon cases (HR=1.772, 95%CI; 1.107-2.837, log rank p=0.016). Selective inhibition of IKK&#945; using 1&#181;M SU1644 in vitro caused a significant reduction in HT29 colony formation (p=0.012) and cell viability (p=0.039). PDOs showed altered cell morphology, reduced cell viability and proliferation when treated with SU1644. In the patient-derived explant model, Ki67 expression was reduced in tumor explants treated with SU1644.<br \/>Conclusions: These data establish high cytoplasmic IKK&#945; expression within tumor cells as a marker of poor prognosis in CRC and conversely high IKK&#946; expression as a marker of good prognosis. This highlights the importance of development of selective IKK&#945; inhibitor SU1644.

However, its diagnostic and prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its role in regulating malignant behavior in CRC, remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the potential of RNF208 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for CRC and its function in regulating malignant behavior in CRC through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation.<br \/>Methods: In this study, based on the ExoRbase2.0 human plasma exosome database (CRC=35; Healthy=118) and TCGA-COAD dataset (CRC=478; Healthy=41), we conducted bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptomic differences in plasma exosomes between CRC patients and normal individuals using ExoRbase2.0. Survival data from the TCGA-COAD dataset were integrated to select key molecules for CRC diagnosis and prognosis. Plasma samples from 39 CRC patients and 16 normal individuals were collected from hospital, and exosomes were isolated and purified using a reagent kit. qPCR was employed to validate the levels of RNF208 in plasma exosomes, confirming the results of bioinformatics analysis. Biological behavior was assessed through CCK-8 proliferation assays, flow cytometry experiments, and Transwell migration assays to investigate the relationship between RNF208 and malignant behavior in the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line.<br \/>Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant correlation between elevated RNF208 expression in plasma exosomes and the incidence of CRC, as well as poor prognosis. The qPCR results from clinical samples further confirmed this correlation, and ROC curves demonstrated high sensitivity and accuracy, suggesting RNF208's potential as a diagnostic and independent prognostic factor for CRC. CCK-8 experiments showed that RNF208 knockdown suppressed proliferation activity in HCT116 cells, flow cytometry indicated that RNF208 knockdown promoted apoptosis in HCT116 cells, and Transwell migration assays demonstrated that RNF208 knockdown inhibited the migration of HCT116 cells.<br \/>Conclusion: RNF208 serves as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer, promoting the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells and contributing to the further deterioration of the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,RNF208,Diagnosis,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fangyue Guo<sup><\/sup>, Shanfeng Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Pei Li<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Basic Medical Experimental Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b6e5286a-203e-49ac-b992-cb62520a8124","ControlNumber":"1287","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

To identify potential regulators of sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitors, we performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in the presence and absence of an MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor. Knockout of CAAP1 and AKAP17A were among the strongest sensitizing hits across multiple MTAP-deleted cancer cell lines representing different histologies. Strikingly, the CAAP1 gene co-localizes with MTAP and CDKN2A on chromosome 9p21. Co-deletion of CAAP1 is reported in 20 percent of MTAP-deleted cancers in the TCGA PanCancer Atlas. CAAP1 or AKAP17A knockout in MTAP-deleted cancer cell lines sensitized the cells to PRMT5 inhibitors including the clinical stage MTA-cooperative inhibitors, TNG908 and TNG462, and the non-MTA-cooperative inhibitor, GSK3326595. Moreover, we discovered that CAAP1 and AKAP17A protein levels are interdependent, as knockout of either gene caused decreased protein levels for the other. Consistent with this finding, CAAP1 reconstitution in CAAP1-deleted cell lines led to increased AKAP17A levels. Endogenous CAAP1 and AKAP17A protein levels are positively correlated across a panel of cancer cell lines and MTAP-deleted patient-derived xenograft models. Consistent with a previous report (Ni et al., 2023), exogenous CAAP1 and AKAP17A co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the proteins form a protein complex. AKAP17A and CAAP1 are not well-characterized proteins, but PRMT5 inhibitors induce global alternative splicing events (ASEs) in cancer cells, and based on preliminary studies a possible function for the CAAP1\/AKAP17A complex could be to mitigate ASEs induced by PRMT5 inhibition. Collectively, these data indicate that CAAP1 and AKAP17A exist interdependently and mediate sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitors. The colocalization and 20 percent incidence of CAAP1 deletion in the setting of MTAP deletion may suggest that such patients will have improved responses to PRMT5-targeted therapy. S. Yoda and M. R.

A national multidisciplinary tumor board (NatCUPMTB) was created in July 2020 in France to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CUP pts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic impact of this NatCUPMTB after 39 months of activity.<br \/>Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective study with prospective follow-up. All pts discussed at least once in the NatCUPMTB between July 2020 and October 2023 were included. Pts and tumors characteristics, pathological and genomic analyses including WGS, WES and transcriptome analysis performed on the two PFMG2025 (French Genomic Medecine Plan 2025) national sequencing laboratories, multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) conclusions, and follow-up after MTB were collected.<br \/>Results: 244 pts were included. The median age at diagnosis was 60 yo, 53% were female, and the majority of patients had an OMS status &#60;2. The median number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was 2, with a majority located in the lymph nodes (62%). The median time between diagnosis and first MTB presentation was 3 months (1-20). At the time of analysis, NatCUPMTB conclusions were available for 129 pts with a second MTB presentation. MTB investigations enabled to identify a likely primary origin in 89\/129 (69%) pts, the most frequent being breast carcinoma (N=15), renal carcinoma (N=13) and lung carcinoma (N=13). The most frequently molecular alterations found were in <i>TP53 (37%), KRAS (19%), CDKN2A (18%), NF2 (12%), KMT2C (10%), CDKN2B (9%), PBRM1 (9%)<\/i> genes. MTB diagnoses were based on the combination of clinical, pathological and genomic investigations in 51\/89 (59%) of pts. Importantly, a personalized therapeutic strategy was recommended by NatCUPMTB in 91\/129 (71%) of pts. Among these recommendations, 72\/91 (79%) were based on the diagnosis of tissue of origin (TOO), 9\/91 (10%) on an actionable molecular alteration validated in the TOO indication, 8\/91 (9%) on an actionable molecular alteration not validated in the TOO indication and 2\/91 (2%) based on a druggable alteration only independently from the TOO. After a median follow-up of 1.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 17.7 months from the 2nd MTB presentation.<br \/>Conclusion: NatCUPMTB provides significant diagnostic in 69% of pts with CUP and a therapeutic strategy recommendation for 71% of pts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular diagnosis,Cancers of unknown primary,Multidisciplinary tumor board,French Genomic Medecine Plan 2025,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Despite multi-modal therapy including surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy, all patients experience tumor progression and recurrence. Our group proposed and validated the first single cell guided functional classification of primary GBM in four tumor-intrinsic cell states which informed clinical outcome and delivered therapeutic options. However, recurrent GBM remains therapeutically unresolved due in part to the diffusely invasive nature and in part to marked cellular heterogeneity of the tumor.The evolutionary trajectory of glioblastoma after therapy is a multifaceted biological process that extends beyond discrete genetic alterations alone. Here, we profiled by multi-omics platforms the largest dataset of matched primary and recurrent GBM including 123 longitudinal glioblastoma pairs, temporally separated by standard-of-care treatment. Genomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics all independently captured the loss of proliferative-progenitor characteristics and a significant upregulation of specialized neuronal and synaptic signaling programs in recurrent GBM. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that the molecular transition from proliferative to neuronal state at recurrence is marked by coherent post-translational activation of the WNT\/PCP signaling pathway and the BRAF protein kinase. Multi-omic analysis of Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models mimicked the patterns of evolutionary trajectory, consisting of marked activation of neuronal signaling programs in recurrent patients. Inhibition of the BRAF kinase with small molecule inhibitors impaired both neuronal transition and migration capability of recurrent glioblastoma cells, which are the phenotypic hallmarks of glioblastoma progression after therapy. Accordingly, combinatorial treatment of temozolomide with BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, significantly prolonged the survival of mouse PDX models. This work provides comprehensive insights into the biological mechanisms of glioblastoma evolution and treatment resistance and highlights new therapeutic opportunities to effectively counter them in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular profiling,Recurrence,Glioblastoma,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Protein deubiquitination, mediated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) like ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), holds therapeutic promise in cancer treatment. This study delves into the mechanistic understanding of DUBs, particularly in acquired chemoresistance in GC.<br \/><b>Methodology: <\/b>We initially examined TCGA database to assess the impact of Ubiquitin Specific Proteases (USPs), specifically USP37 and USP14, on prognosis in Gynaecological Cancers (GCs). Subsequently, we evaluated their expression in various GC cell lines at both protein and RNA levels. Cell proliferation and metastasis assays were performed to analyze the effect of depleting these USPs on survival and metastasis in GC cells under replication stress. Proteomics analysis was conducted on cells with altered expression of USP37 and USP14 to identify interacting proteins regulating proliferation and metastasis. To investigate DUBs role in chemoresistance, we generated chemoresistant (CR) cell lines with cisplatin exposure, characterized their viability and proliferation, conducted cell cycle and apoptosis analyses, and performed proteomic profiling to explore the USP37 and USP14 specific interactome in chemoresistant cell lines.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Examination of TCGA database revealed an association between elevated USP37 and USP14 expression and poor Overall Survival (OS) and Disease-free Survival (DFS) in Gynaecological Cancers (GC) cohort. Increased expression of USP37 and USP14 at RNA and protein levels was observed in GC cell lines. Inhibiting USP37 and USP14 reduced GC cell proliferation under replication stress and hindered metastasis. Proteomics analysis identified proteins linked to replication (PCNA), DNA damage (Chk-1), cell cycle, and metastasis. Cisplatin-resistant GC cell lines were successfully established, demonstrating prolonged survival and increased proliferative capacity after cisplatin treatment compared to chemosensitive (CS) cell lines. FACS analysis indicated altered cell cycle distribution and increased proliferation in CR cells. Comparative interactome analysis revealed altered protein sets associated with USP37 and USP14 in CR and CS GC cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This study provides evidence that supports the participation of USP37 and USP14 in the onset of gynecological cancers (GC). We present evidence of alterations in the oncogenic network linked to USP37 and USP14 in GC.

Quantitative assessment of HER2 expression at the cellular level may improve therapeutic efficacy prediction. While ERBB2 mutations are known oncogenic drivers, their impact on tumor cell HER2 expression is unclear. In this study, we focused on common ERBB2 mutations, and analyzed HER2 expression via AI-powered image analysis in pan-cancer tumor specimens to identify possible mutation-expression correlations.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed 183,292 pan-cancer samples from AACR GENIE, and 10,967 from TCGA. A set of 156 cases with both ERBB2 mutation status and HER2 4B5 IHC WSIs was obtained (Neogenomics). An AI-powered HER2 analyzer (Lunit SCOPE HER2) was previously developed using 1,133 HER2 IHC-stained WSIs of breast cancer stained with 4B5. Single-cell HER2 intensity was analyzed and aggregated, reported based on breast ASCO\/CAP criteria. ERBB2 RNA levels were analyzed for mutations and amplification.<br \/>Results: We identified 2,735 cases with ERBB2 mutations (2,603\/183,292 [1.4%] in GENIE and 132\/10,967 [1.2%] in TCGA). These mutations were categorized for analysis based on their highest frequency and previous characterization: exon 20 insertions (ex20ins, including Y772dup (YVMA) and G776InsVC), S310x, and other pathogenic mutations. In the dataset, ex20ins cases were predominantly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 381\/482 [79.0%]) and S310x cases were enriched in urothelial, NSCLC, and breast cancers (269\/683 [39.4%], 64\/683 [9.4%], and 47\/683 [6.9%], respectively). Of the 156 ERBB2-mutated cases with HER2 IHC images, 59 had ex20ins, 24 had S310x, and 73 had other mutations. AI analysis in each case type indicates a significantly higher proportion of HER2 3+ tumor cells in S310x and ex20ins cases than other mutations (median, 7.5% vs. 6.1% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.003). As such, high HER2 expression was observed in S310x and ex20ins cases compared to other mutation cases (HER2 3+ 10\/24 [41.7%], 22\/59 [37.3%], and 14\/73 [19.2%]). Additionally, in NSCLC, ex20ins and S310x cases exhibited a modest enrichment for high HER2 expression relative to other mutation cases (21\/56 [37.5%], 3\/9 [33.3%], and 5\/20 [27.6%]). RNA analyses from TCGA showed higher levels for ex20ins (median 13.6; interquartile range 13.1-13.7 in log2 scale), compared to S310x (12.4; 11.9-13.6) and other mutations (12.6; 12.1-13.3), but lower than that of amplified ERBB2 (15.5; 13.8-17.0).<br \/>Conclusion: An AI-powered pan-cancer image analysis of HER2 IHC of tumor cells in conjunction with genomic data reveals a positive correlation between ex20ins and S310x ERBB2 mutation and protein expression. This correlation is also seen at the RNA level, but the lesser levels relative to ERBB2 amplified cases suggests the effect may be mediated at the protein level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Molecular classification of tumors for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic outcomes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ErbB2,HER2,Immunohistochemistry,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Thus, the possibility of targeting oncogenic, mutant p53 proteins has long been a therapeutic goal. However, that aspiration has not been fully realized, leaving patients vulnerable to aggressive disease that is resistant to chemotherapy and to targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy owing to the loss of wild type p53 functionality and the gain of new oncogenic functions when mutant p53 is expressed. An effective therapeutic strategy is urgently needed for p53 mutant cancers, and our team is developing novel analogues of curcumin with the potential to convert mutant p53 to a wild type conformation and restore its tumor suppressive functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of AKT-100, which was developed from the parent molecule and curcumin analogue HO-3867. Effects were compared to another drug believed to reactivate p53 functionality, APR-246, using CyQUANT IC50 cell proliferation assays and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Structural analyses are underway investigating the specific sites of interaction of AKT-100 with various mutant forms of p53. Our findings indicate that, <i>first<\/i>, AKT-100 exhibits impressive cell killing in multiple ovarian and serous endometrial cancer cells at concentrations ranging from 100-300 nM and is synergistic with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. <i>Second<\/i>, RNA sequencing demonstrates the reactivation of wild type p53 genes associated with normal cell cycle regulation (induction of <i>CDKN1A<\/i> encoding p21 and <i>GADD45A<\/i>), apoptosis (induction of <i>PMAIP1<\/i> encoding Noxa and <i>DR5 <\/i>encoding Death Receptor 5), and the inhibition of DNA replication and multiple alternative mechanisms of DNA repair employed by malignant cells. <i>Third<\/i>, RNA sequencing indicates that AKT-100 acts through both p53-dependent and independent pathways to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Gene expression is impacted in ways that portend a therapeutic effect as well as highlight potential resistance pathways (e.g. significant induction of <i>PLK5<\/i> encoding polo like kinase 5) that can be further targeted to create synthetic lethal drug combinations with AKT-100 chosen specifically to target the various mutant forms of p53. Taken together, these results identify novel curcumin analogues in early development with the potential to improve therapy for p53 mutant cancers. Through this strategy it is also possible to identify and block resistance pathways that are activated by different forms of mutant p53 in response to AKT-100 and to create synthetic lethal precision drug combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Endometrial cancer,p53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The availability of new therapies and biomarkers for patients&#8217; selection is still an urgent need. Altered lipid metabolism, which has been reported in several tumors, has not yet been studied in DMPM. By comparatively analyzing gene expression profiles of tumors form relapsed (n=18) and non-relapsed (n=18) DMPM patients, we initially found that fatty acid synthase (FASN) was up-modulated in relapsed tumors, with a significant linear correlation between FASN expression and shorter patient relapse-free survival (RFS), suggesting a potential role of FASN in DMPM progression. The prognostic significance of FASN was further assessed in a cohort of 80 DMPM patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Our results indicated that high FASN staining was significantly associated with reduced RFS (hazard ration (HR): 1.930; p=0.014) and Overall Survival (OS) (HR: 1.854; p=0.032) as assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissues microarray samples. The prognostic value of FASN, along with Ki67 staining and patient age, was also maintained in multivariate analysis in terms of both RFS (HR: 2.240; p=0.007) and OS (HR: 2.246; p=0.014). To validate FASN as a therapeutic target, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of non-selective (orlistat) and selective (cerulenin and C75) FASN inhibitors on patient-derived DMPM cell lines, both as single agents and in combination with selinexor -a selective inhibitor of the exportin chromosome maintenance protein. FASN pharmacological inhibition in DMPM cells resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation, especially upon C75 exposure. In combination experiments, we observed a synergistic activity of FASN inhibitors and selinexor, as determined by Chou and Talalay method. Through western blotting and flow cytometry analysis, we gained further insight into the mechanisms by which FASN inhibitors and selinexor synergize to reduce DMPM cell proliferation. Compared to single agents, the combined treatments resulted in increased apoptosis response and cell cycle impairment, as indicated by caspase-dependent apoptosis activation and cell accumulation in the G2-phase. Overall, our results support the relevance of FASN as a prognostic biomarker for DMPM patients and underscore its potential as a novel therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,Therapeutic target,Fatty acid synthase,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Targeted therapies have failed largely due to challenges associated with biopsy collection, tumor antigen heterogeneity, and accurately distinguishing transcriptionally distinct esophageal, GE junction or gastric tumor types. We developed a novel, multimodal liquid biopsy assay that profiles genome-wide transcriptional activation. Here, we deploy this assay to define clinically relevant insights in a cohort of GEA patients.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>1 ml of plasma from whole blood samples was used to assess genome-wide enhancer, promoter and DNA methylation loci in 11 GEA patients (Stage III: 1, Stage IV: 10) and 7 healthy volunteers. 6 patients were confirmed as HER2+ based on standard tissue IHC\/ISH methods. ctDNA estimation was performed using the ichorCNA algorithm on low pass whole genome sequencing data. A multimodal HER2 classifier developed previously using genome-wide features including HER2 was used to predict HER2 status of the GEA samples.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Epigenomic profiling and comparison of GEA and healthy volunteer plasma samples revealed distinct genome-wide transcriptional activation patterns associated with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, including (i) the characteristic upregulation of HER2, FGFR2 and VEGF (ii) SOX2, KLF4, GATA6 transcription factor circuitry, and (iii) DNA methylation at the CHFR and MGMT promoters. We then explored if epigenomic profiling of liquid biopsies could infer the activation status of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targets currently under investigation in GEA cancers. Simultaneous examination of multiple target genes including HER2, HER3, TROP2, CLDN18, CEACAM5 and MET demonstrated patient-specific differences and dynamic range in transcriptional activation of a subset of these target genes. Finally, we investigated if HER2 status could be assigned accurately and quantitatively from a liquid biopsy using the multimodal HER2 classifier. HER2 positivity by IHC was predicted accurately in 8\/11 samples corresponding to an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.85. Discordance between plasma and tissue HER2 calls could be partially attributed to variability associated with tumor site\/section used for tissue collection, IHC staining, and time between biopsy collection and blood draw.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS:<\/b> We demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive epigenomic profiling from low input volume of 1ml of plasma to provide a snapshot of the tumor&#8217;s transcriptional state to derive clinically actionable insights. The HER2 classifier overcomes several of the challenges with IHC profiling by providing a uniform and quantitative measurement of HER2 activation. This non-invasive assay provides an accurate reflection of tumor transcriptional biology that can inform optimal patient selection strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Epigenomics,Cancer markers,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

Loss of USP1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is also synthetic lethal with BRCA1 deficiency, and USP1 inhibitors are now undergoing clinical development for these cancers. Here, we show that USP1 inhibitors also promote the accumulation of ssDNA gaps during replication in BRCA1-deficient cells. USP1 inhibition increased monoubiquitinated PCNA at replication forks and resulted in accumulation of ssDNA gaps in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells. Knockdown of RAD18, the E3 ubiquitin ligase known to ubiquitinate PCNA, caused USP1 inhibitor resistance and suppression of ssDNA gaps. ssDNA gap accumulation induced by USP1 inhibition correlates with drug sensitivity of <i>BRCA1<\/i>-mutated cancer cells and overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in cell line and xenograft models. Furthermore, USP1 inhibition was synergistic with PARP and POLQ inhibition in <i>BRCA1<\/i>-mutant cells, with enhanced ssDNA gap accumulation. A set of patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids (PDOs) were used to confirm the sensitivity of <i>BRCA1<\/i>-deficient cells to USP1 inhibition. Five PDOs were derived from patients with high grade-serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Among the five PDOs, two of them were from tumors harboring germline <i>BRCA1<\/i> pathogenic mutations. <i>BRCA1<\/i>-mutant PDOs, but not <i>BRCA1<\/i>-WT PDOs, were sensitive to a USP1 inhibitor and to PARP inhibitor monotherapies. The accumulation of ssDNA gaps after treatment with a USP1 inhibitor or a PARP inhibitor correlated with the sensitivity to these drugs in all the models tested. Moreover, the combination of a PARP inhibitor and a USP1 inhibitor showed synergy in a <i>BRCA1<\/i>-WT model, which was resistant to both monotherapies. Interestingly, ssDNA gaps accumulated with the combination treatment and not with monotherapy in this model. Ovarian cancer PDOs therefore provide a powerful tool for rapid <i>in vitro<\/i> sensitivity testing. The detection of ssDNA gap accumulation may be a useful predictive biomarker for response to USP1 inhibition as monotherapy or in combination in ongoing clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Organoids,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
