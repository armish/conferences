[{"Abstract":"Background: There is increasing interest in developing precision medicine strategies for cancers with <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations. Co-alterations in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>and ARID1A (AD) occur in ~1% of all cancers. Previously, patients with co-alterations in <i>PIK3CA <\/i>and AD have shown both an improved objective response rate and improved progression free survival following copanlisib (cop) treatment compared to cancers with <i>PIK3CA <\/i>mutations and wild-type AD. Here we evaluate potential mechanisms for this enhanced clinical benefit.<br \/>Methods: AD was knocked out in SW48 and SW48<i><sup>PIK3CA-H1047R<\/sup><\/i> (SW48PK) human 2D colorectal cancer cell lines using CRISPR (SW48AD; SW48PKAD). Knockouts were confirmed using PCR genotyping, amplicon sequencing, and western blot (WB). A cell proliferation assay (WST-1) was performed at increasing doses of cop for 48hrs to determine cell viability. WBs were performed at 6hrs and 24hrs after cop treatment to determine levels of phosphorylation of AKT, S6, and 4EBP1 and levels of apoptosis-related proteins (MCL-1, BCL-xL, BCL-2, PARP). Athymic nude mice were flank injected with SW48PK and SW48PKAD and treated with cop (10mg\/kg in PEG400\/acidified water (0.1N HCl, pH 3.5; 20\/80, v\/v) or vehicle for 25 days or until moribund.<br \/>Results: WST-1 assay showed highest sensitivity to cop in SW48PKAD cells compared to SW48, SW48PK and SW48AD. At 10nM (p=0.01), there was a significant difference in cell viability between SW48PK and SW48PKAD. No significant difference was seen in the phosphorylation (p) of AKT, S6, or 4EBP1 between SW48PK and SW48PKAD. Expression of MCL-1 protein decreased in SW48PKAD compared to SW48PK. No difference was seen in levels of BCL-xL and BCL-2. On treatment with cop, there was a greater reduction in pS6 in SW48PKAD at 24 hours compared to SW48PK, but no significant difference in pAKT and p4EBP1. There was a gradual increase in MCL-1, BCL-xL, and cleaved PARP in SW48PKAD overtime following cop treatment compared to SW48PK. <i>In vivo, <\/i>untreated<i> <\/i>SW48PKAD tumors grew more quickly than the SW48PK tumors (8-fold increase in tumor size in SW48PKAD compared to 5-fold increase in SW48PK by day 25, p=0.06).

An evolving concept that contributes to our understanding of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AR antagonists in advanced PCa is the ability of cells to turn on compensatory hormone receptor signaling for survival. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that induction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression confers resistance to AR-targeted therapy. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated that the inhibition of AKT signaling blocks pro-oncogenic GR activity and overcomes resistance to AR-targeted therapy. AKT1 is predicted to phosphorylate GR at s134, however, the implications of pGR(s134) in advanced PCa remains unclear. Although ligands (e.g., Dex) activates GR, we have found GR activation modulated by post-translational modification (PTM) and persistent in treatment resistant PCa. Therefore, we hypothesize pro-oncogenic GR activation through AKT1-induced PTM. The rationale is that by inhibiting AKT signaling, we block residual GR signaling that can potentially drive lethal prostate cancers and consequently be re-sensitized to the standard of care. We validated our findings by Western blot analysis, we used an AKT1-specific inhibitor (AKT1i) and observed decreased AKT1 activity and decreased pGR(s134) without affecting total GR protein expression. Functional studies using shRNA against AKT1 showed reduced pGR(s134) expression without affecting the total GR expression Our preliminary data suggests that pro-oncogenic GR activity is modulated through the phosphorylation of GR on s134 by AKT1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Drug resistance,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Akt,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Approved clinical therapies targeting overactive PI3K are scarce and often accompanied by severe adverse effects due to lack of PI3K isoform selectivity. We recently reported a proprietary covalent proximity scanning (CoPS) approach to selectively target distant cysteines outside of the ATP-binding pocket in kinases. Using CoPS, we developed isoform specific, irreversible covalent PI3K&#945; inhibitors (cPI3K&#945;i) with outstanding target engagement profiles. Here, we report structure-guided scaffold and linker-optimizations resulting in cPI3K&#945;i with long-term and rapid inhibition of PI3K&#945;. Cellular activity was improved exploiting additional protein-inhibitor interactions inspired by X-ray crystallographic data, and introduction of structural elements to increase cell permeability. The cPI3K&#945;i series showed enhanced cellular potency and excellent on-target engagement. Kinetic parameters and covalent bond formation were determined using TR-FRET, nanoBRET tracer displacement assays, and LCMS\/MS based proteomics. With our new cPI3K&#945;i, IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of PKB\/Akt phosphorylation, pPKB\/Akt recovery after drug washout, and growth inhibition experiments were performed in cancer cell lines harboring activating PIK3CA or inactivating PTEN mutations. Efficient and long-lasting inhibition of PKB\/Akt phosphorylation was observed in PIK3CA mutant cell lines, while loss of PTEN was associated with partial responses, consistent with contributions of other class I PI3K isoforms to signal reactivation. A dynamic FOXO cytosolic\/nuclear translocation assay was used to monitor distal PI3K signaling: cPI3K&#945;i blunted PI3K signaling rapidly with rates identical to the reversible BYL719\/alpelisib. After drug washout, inhibition by BYL719\/alpelisib was relieved within minutes, while a complete and prolonged shutdown of downstream signaling events was observed in PIK3CA mutant cell lines but not in cell lines where PTEN function was lost. This relapse in downstream signaling explains the lack of efficacy of PI3K&#945; selective inhibitors in models with PTEN loss and demonstrates that persistent inhibition across the PI3K pathway is required for efficacy. In summary, the new cPI3K&#945;i display outstanding specificity and cellular activity in PIK3CA-mutated cancer cells, and support the further development of cPI3K&#945;i as future clinical candidates and an alternative to established reversible inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Kinase inhibitors,Drug discovery,Covalent inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Hotspot mutations in the <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene constitutively activate the catalytic subunit of the PI3K&#945; isoform and are found in 10-30% of solid tumors. The development of PI3K pathway inhibitors has been hampered by poor drug tolerance and release of negative feedback loops, leading to rapid reactivation of signaling in response to reversible inhibitors. To remedy these challenges, we developed highly selective covalent PI3K&#945; inhibitors that irreversibly bind to a non-conserved cysteine (C862) located 11 &#197; outside the ATP-binding site. Here we present the properties of an optimized drug-like covalent lead, dubbed compound 9, and describe the generation of a biotinylated probe developed to be used in conjunction with compound 9 to monitor PI3K&#945; target occupancy in relation to downstream PI3K signaling outputs. Biochemical investigations of compound 9 using TR-FRET assays showed high affinity binding (<i>K<\/i><sub>i<\/sub>), high reaction rates (<i>k<\/i><sub>inact<\/sub>) for covalent bond formation with PI3K&#945;, and negligible off-target reactivity. Cellular NanoBRET assays revealed that compound 9 diffuses three times more rapidly into cells as compared to BYL719 (alpelisib), and leads to rapid and potent on-target engagement. Covalent bond formation to residue C862 of PI3K&#945; was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant cancer cell lines, covalent binding of PI3K&#945; occurred at low nanomolar concentrations and led to persistent inhibition of Akt\/PKB phosphorylation for more than 72 hours after drug removal. Notably, investigation of PI3K&#945; re-synthesis after labeling with compound 9 showed a negligible reappearance in cancer cell lines, which indicates that persistent suppression of PI3K&#945; signaling by compound 9 results in a much longer half-life for PI3K&#945; than previously reported. The irreversible inactivation of PI3K&#945; by compound 9 provides a marked gain in growth inhibition potency (10-600-fold) in <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutant cancer cell lines in comparison to clinical reversible PI3K&#945; inhibitors and allows for intermittent dosing without compromising efficacy. These data collectively demonstrate that compound 9 enables precise and selective targeting of PI3K&#945; with high potency and long-lasting efficacy in cancer models. The new class of irreversible PI3K&#945; inhibitors have a unique pharmacology among PI3K inhibitors characterized by strong decoupling of drug exposure from efficacy which may provide opportunities to lower treatment burden in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,Covalent,Kinase inhibitors,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Prevalence of these mutations is enriched in many human malignancies, particularly in hormone receptor-positive\/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+\/HER2&#8722;) breast cancer. PI3K&#945; inhibition showed clear clinical benefit in treating HR+\/HER2&#8722; breast cancer and has been approved in combination with fulvestrant. First generation PI3K&#945; inhibitors such as alpelisib and inavolisib, however, have limited selectivity against wild-type (WT) PI3K&#945;; therefore, are associated with a variety of on-target adverse effects including grade 3 hyperglycemia, skin rash, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Discovery of a highly-selective inhibitor of mutant PI3K&#945; could enable deeper target coverage while reducing undesired effects of inhibiting WT PI3K&#945;. SNV-002 is a novel, proprietary, and mutant-selective inhibitor of PI3K&#945;. In cellular assays, SNV-002 inhibited Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT) with single digit nanomolar potency in PI3K&#945; H1047R-mutant T47D cells and displayed greater than 50-fold selectivity over SKBR3 WT control. Similar inhibition of pAKT was also observed in other cell lines carrying PI3K&#945; hotspot mutations, such as CAL33, NCI-H1048, EFM19, and HCC1954. SNV-002 maintained selectivity in helical domain E545K-mutant cell lines including MCF7 and MDA-MB-361. This selectivity was further confirmed using MCF10A isogenic cell lines carrying either WT or mutant PI3K&#945; (H1047R and E545K). In cellular assays to assess inhibition of other isoforms of PI3K (PI3K&#946;, PI3K&#947;, and PI3K&#948;), the IC50 of SNV-002 was over 10,000 nM. Similarly, a broad kinome screen showed no inhibition of activity of 371 kinases. Compared with alpelisib, SNV-002 showed improved potency and prolonged residence time in T47D breast cancer cells. Importantly, assays using H1047R-mutant cells in the presence of human whole blood showed SNV-002 potency to be less than 100 nM, which was over 10-fold more potent than that of alpelisib. Treatment of breast cancer cells with SNV-002 suppressed PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, as evidenced by reduced levels of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein and associated with loss of cell viability in mutant lines. The pharmacokinetic profile of SNV-002 was excellent across multiple species. Oral administration of HCC1954 tumor-bearing mice with SNV-002 resulted in dose-proportional exposure and &#62;90% pharmacodynamic inhibition of pAKT in the tumor with doses of 10 mg\/kg, and no sign of glucose dysregulation in contrast to alpelisib. Together, these data show that SNV-002 is a highly-selective and potent inhibitor of mutant PI3K&#945; with good drug-like properties that support further development of SNV-002 for treatment of cancers driven by oncogenic PI3K&#945; mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,PIK3CA,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

They play a crucial role in cancer initiation and progression by orchestrating tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, metastasis, immunosuppression, and resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and chemotherapy (Gao J, 2022). On the other hand, when properly stimulated, macrophages can effectively interact with the innate and adaptive immune systems arms, promoting cancer cell phagocytosis and tumor destruction by T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Mantovani A, 2022). PI3K&#947; has a unique pattern of expression and biological function, and it has been investigated for a long time as a therapeutic target for different disorders, including cancer. Inhibition of PI3K&#947; reprograms M2 macrophages into M1 cells in the tumor microenvironment which translates into the expansion of activated T cells by relieving macrophage suppression. Recent clinical data indicates the compelling role of PI3Ky in combination with PDL1 in anti-tumor activity, irrespective of PDL1 status (Hamilton E, 2021). PI3Ky selectivity has been difficult to achieve due to the high sequence homology across the class 1 PI3K isoforms (Drew SL, 2020). Macrocyclization of small molecules with a linear structure strongly reduces their conformational flexibility and alters a variety of their physicochemical and biological characteristics. The unexpected selectivity these compounds can exhibit, even amongst closely similar target molecules, is explained by the conformationally limited structure (Ma J, 2022). Here, we describe the discovery of a potent and selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of PI3K&#947;. OPM-116, macrocyclic compound display &#62;300-fold selectivity for PI3K&#947; over the other class I isoforms. Its selectivity in biochemical and cellular assays as well as in human PBMC assays is presented. In vitro, OPM-116 can inhibit the IL-4-induced polarization of M2 macrophages. Pharmacodynamic analysis performed in animals that received oral compound administration confirmed the absolute selectivity and good PK profiles of the drug. OPM-116 is a highly selective, PI3K&#947; inhibitor that displays high potency and specificity and represents a promising step toward the identification of a clinical candidate.<br \/>Drew S.L., et al.

Currently, RET-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) selpercatinib and pralsetinib are approved for this patient population, demonstrating favorable antitumor activity and safety profiles in advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC. However, tumors eventually become refractory to selective RET inhibitor monotherapy. We sought to identify signaling pathways which mediate RET-independent acquired resistance to RET inhibitors and effective therapeutic combinations to overcome resistance. Using LC-2\/ad (CCDC6-RET) NSCLC cells, we assessed the expression and activation of critical signaling pathways at a proteomic level following RET knockdown using reverse-phase protein array. RET knockdown resulted in rapidly increased adaptive upregulation of EGFR, HER2, MET, mTOR and MEK pathway signaling; observations were confirmed by Western Blotting. To determine whether EGFR or MET signaling facilitate RET inhibitor resistance, LC-2\/ad and NCCE-TH1101 (KIF5B-RET) NSCLC cells were treated with increasing concentrations of selpercatinib or pralsetinib with or without ligands for these receptors, EGF or HGF respectively, and after five days cell viability was measured by CellTiter Glo. EGFR and MET signaling promoted RET TKI resistance in both cell lines. Next, to evaluate whether blockade of EGFR or MET signaling could enhance the activity of RET inhibitors, we treated LC-2\/ad and NCCE-TH1101 cells with RET TKIs alone or in combination with the EGFR TKI erlotinib or poziotinib, or the MET inhibitor SU11274. We observed an additive effect with EGFR but not MET inhibitors when combined with RET TKIs. Western blot analysis revealed that EGFR signaling could reactivate mTOR and MAPK signaling after RET TKI treatment. Therefore, we next tested whether inhibition of these downstream pathways might enhance RET TKI sensitivity. We observed that treatment of LC-2\/ad and NCCE-TH1101 cells with an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) or a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) in combination with RET TKIs increased the anti-tumor activity or RET inhibitors. Finally, we established cells with acquired resistance to selpercatinib and pralsetinib. RET TKI resistant cells did not harbor secondary RET fusion mutations but underwent epithelial to mesenchymal transition and exhibited pan-RET inhibitor resistance. Moreover, RET TKI resistant cells showed increased cell surface expression of EGFR and MET by flow cytometry. RET TKI resistant cells were sensitive to mTOR or MEK inhibitors in combination with RET TKIs. Collectively,<b> <\/b>our findings indicate that in RET-fusion positive NSCLC tumor cells, activation of bypass pathways including the EGFR, MAPK, mTOR pathways may facilitate RET inhibitor resistance and that blockade of bypass pathways may enhance the efficacy of selective RET inhibitors and overcome acquired RET TKI resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,NSCLC,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Aberrant CDK2 activation occurs in selected cancers (<i>e.g.<\/i>, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer) through <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification, leading to Rb phosphorylation, inactivation, and cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation. <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification and subsequent cyclin E overexpression are associated with chemotherapy resistance and shorter progression-free and overall survival. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to inhibit aberrant CDK2 activation and elicit positive clinical benefit in these patients. BLU-222 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable, investigational CDK2 inhibitor with demonstrated activity in preclinical <i>CCNE1<\/i>-amplified ovarian cancer models.

They are not curative because of the emergence of BTK inhibitor resistance mutations in as much as 67% of relapsed patients (in CLL) [1]. Frequently observed mutations include BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>, which abrogates covalent binding of irreversible drugs such as acalabrutinib, ibrutinib and zanubrutinib, and BTK<sup>T474I<\/sup> and BTK<sup>V416L <\/sup>which both abrogate binding of the non-covalent inhibitor drug pirtobrutinib [1, 2]. To combat resistance, third generation BTK inhibitors are needed, which must 1. bind to unique regions in the tumor driving kinases that are not marred by resistance mutations, 2. have sufficient potency for sustained inhibition of BTK signaling, and 3. be sufficiently selective to afford efficacious doses and suitable for a combination regimen. We have developed a platform called Energetically Privileged Ligands (EPriLs), based on a macrocycle scaffold that binds non-covalently in the kinase ATP pocket. Their unique binding mode involves connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the general kinase fold in a continuous &#946;-sheet, in this way avoiding hotspots for kinase inhibitor resistance mutations. The potent binding of the macrocycle ensures a very long residence time. Using the EPriL platform, we have developed CFON-026, a next generation non-covalent BTK inhibitor with a covalent-like residence time as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular washout experiments. The biochemical binding K<sub>D<\/sub> to BTK<sup>WT<\/sup>, determined by SPR, is 0.14 nM. CFON-026 binds mutants with K<sub>D<\/sub>s of 0.4 nM (BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>) and and 1.8 nM (BTK<sup>T474I<\/sup>). X-ray crystal structures of CFON-026 bound to BTK<sup>WT<\/sup> and BTK<sup>T474I<\/sup> confirm the unique binding mode and water network around the active site. CFON-026 inhibits the growth of the BTK dependent cell lines TMD8 and Rec-1 with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 0.45 nM and 1.7 nM, respectively. CFON-026 is very active on TMD8 variants containing endogenous BTK inhibitor resistance mutations (BTK<sup>C481S<\/sup>, BTK<sup>V416L<\/sup>, BTK<sup>T474I<\/sup> and BTK<sup>L528W<\/sup>, IC<sub>50<\/sub> range 1-100 nM). CFON-026 has favorable metabolic stability, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety characteristics, and induces complete tumor regression in a TMD8 xenograft model. Since BTK resistance mutations can be detected diagnostically 12-18 months before clinical relapse, CFON-026 could be applied as combination partner to prolong progression free survival on first line BTK inhibitor therapy. Experiments with mixed populations of BTK mutant cell lines, to model a heterogenous tumor, show that CFON-026 can deepen the efficacy of ibrutinib, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib. In conclusion, CFON-026 is a novel EPriL-based non-covalent BTK inhibitor that could enhance and prolong responses of existing covalent BTK inhibitor therapy.

However, within 12 to 18 months following treatment, 15-20% of the patients develop C797S mutation, which drives resistance to these drugs; with the progression of disease brain metastasis is observed in 40-70% of the EGFRm+ NSCLC patients. Here, we report a highly potent and brain penetrant fourth generation EGFR-TKI ACE-34237307, designed to overcome C797S mutation (del19\/C797S and L858R\/C797S), and common single point mutations (del19 and L858R). ACE-34237307 is also designed to potently inhibit the more prevalent non-canonical EGFR mutations such as G719S and L861Q. ACE-34237307 showed robust anti-proliferative activity against EGFR double mutations in Ba\/F3 (EGFR-del19\/C797S and EGFR-L858R\/C797S) cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.1 and 0.23 nM, respectively.

However, treatments with 3<sup>rd<\/sup> Gen EGFR inhibitors lead to occurrence of acquired C797S mutation in 10-24% of patients. Though studies showed that double mutations 19Del\/C797S (DC) and L858R\/C797S (LC) could be inhibited by 1<sup>st<\/sup> Gen EGFR TKIs, appearance of triple mutations 19Del\/T790M\/C797S (DTC) and L858R\/T790M\/C797S (LTC) always leads to treatment failure. In recent years, 4<sup>th<\/sup> Gen EGFR inhibitors have been developed such as BLU-945 and PH009-1. PH009-1 had been reported on AACR annual meeting 2023.<br \/>Methods: Cell activity and selectivity were determined in engineered Ba\/F3 cell lines carrying EGFR wild type (WT, stimulated with EGF), 19Del (D), L858R (L), 19Del\/T790M (DT), L858R\/T790M (LT), DC, LC, DTC and LTC. The <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy and PK-PD studies were performed in cell or patient derived xenograft (CDX or PDX) cancer models (HCC827, D; Ba\/F3, LC; PDX, DTC). Brain penetration capability was tested in mice orally treated with PH009-1 for 7 days. Systemic safety of PH009-1 was evaluated in 28-day repeated dosing toxicity studies in rats and dogs following GLP guidelines.<br \/>Results: PH009-1 displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against Ba\/F3 cells harboring EGFR mutations (L, D, LC, DC, LT, DT, LTC, DTC) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.4, 1.3, 5.2, 1.2, 1.1, 1.5, 2.8, 1.9 nM, respectively, but had very weak effect on EGFR WT Ba\/F3 cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 1135 nM), suggesting excellent potency and selectivity. In contrast, though BLU-945 potently inhibited DT, LT, DTC, LTC with IC<sub>50<\/sub> less than 5 nM, but its activities on L, D, LC, DC were not strong with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 31.6, 81.2, 46.2, and 52.0 nM. In <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies, PH009-1 at a dose of 20 mg\/kg BID led to potent inhibition on tumor growth and EGFR phosphorylation, and tumor regression was observed at higher doses in all tested models. In HCC827 model with 19Del (first line therapy setting), mice were treated for more than 200 days, and one tumor relapsed in BLU-945 group but not in PH009-1 or Osi group. Also, deaths were observed in Osi group, but not with PH009-1. After treated mice with PH009-1 at efficacious dose for 7 days, concentrations in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) at 0-8 h post final dose were more than enough (&#8805;1.5 fold) to cover IC80 on all tested mutations. In GLP toxicity studies, no unexpected toxicity was observed. In dogs. the highest tested dose was determined as highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) and based on high plasma exposure, wide safety margin was confirmed with PH009-1.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data suggested that PH009-1 overcome T790M\/C797S resistant mutations, and also have potential to become a potent and safe approach for first line therapy of NSCLC with EGFR mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,EGFR TKI resistance,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Due to unique structural domain, FGFR4 is specifically bound by FGF19 with high affinity in the presence of co-receptor &#946;-Klotho. Hyperactivated FGF19\/FGFR4 signaling, induced by FGF19\/FGFR4 overexpression and FGFR4 mutation, was reported to be associated with the growth, metastasis and invasion of various cancer. Thus, FGFR4 is considered as a novel target to treat cancer with hyperactivated FGF19\/FGFR4 signaling. Here we report BB102 as a highly selective and potent reversible-covalent FGFR4 inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: BB102 was developed through structure-based drug design, and optimized by SAR analysis and medicinal chemistry iteration. Biochemical and cell assays were applied in evaluation of BB102 inhibitory activity. Preclinical studies including pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity were performed in rats and dogs. Xenograft tumor models in mice were conducted to demonstrate the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of BB102.<br \/>Results: As a reversible-covalent FGFR4 inhibitor, about half compound of BB102 dissociated from FGFR4 kinase within 24 h, which was conducive to overcome the fast re-synthesis rate of FGFR4 (&#60; 2 h) in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. BB102 only inhibited kinase activity of FGFR4<sup>WT<\/sup>, FGFR4<sup>N535K<\/sup> and FGFR4<sup>V550L<\/sup> at nanomolar levels in 207 kinase panel screening. BB102 completely blocked the phosphorylation of the downstream protein ERK at 16.7 nM. BB102 exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth in mouse models<i> <\/i>inoculated with the high expression of both FGF19 and FGFR4, or FGFR4 mutated tumor cells. PK profile of BB102 showed good oral bioavailability (F&#62;70%) with a nearly linear dose-dependent exposure. The compound had no effects on the respiratory and central nervous systems in rats, cardiovascular system in Beagle dogs or hERG liability <i>in vitro<\/i>. In comprehensive safety evaluation, the Severely Toxic Dose in 10% (STD<sub>10<\/sub>) in rats was 300 mg\/kg\/day and the Highest Non-Severely Toxic Dose (HNSTD) in dogs were 100 mg\/kg\/day.<br \/>Conclusion: BB102 is a highly selective and potent reversible-covalent FGFR4 inhibitor with promising efficacy in high expression of both FGF19 and FGFR4, and\/or FGFR4 mutated tumor models and good safety in preclinical studies.

Furmo has demonstrated promising interim efficacy and safety in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (pts) with EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mts (Han et al., 2023). Furmo is currently being studied in a global Phase 3 trial for 1st line pts with ex20ins in NSCLC (FURVENT; NCT05607550) and has received FDA Breakthrough Designation in this pt population. P-loop and &#945;C-helix Compressing (PACC) mts represent another subset of uncommon EGFR mts (Robichaux et al., 2021) that are similar to ex20ins in narrowing the drug binding pocket; include e.g. G719X, S768I, E709X, L747X, V774M; and are found as single or compound EGFR mts. Treatment options for pts with PACC mts remain limited. In this study, we further characterized PACC mts as cancer drivers in NSCLC and evaluated the pre-clinical activity and binding mechanisms of furmo in PACC and ex20ins mts.<br \/>Methods: AACR Project GENIE and TEMPUS databases were used for mutation analysis. In vitro potency was determined in Ba\/F3 cell lines for 33 PACC and 16 ex20ins mts. In vivo efficacy was conducted in pt-derived xenografts (PDXs). Molecular modeling was performed using MOE software.<br \/>Results: PACC prevalence was 2.4% vs. 1.6% for ex20ins and 14% for classical EGFR mts in all NSCLC, corresponding to 10.4% PACC and 7% ex20ins of all EGFR mts. Co-mutation analysis revealed that other oncogenes, such as p53, co-occurred alongside PACC to a similar rate as with ex20ins and classical EGFR mts which further supports the role of PACC mts as a similar cancer driver as other EGFR mts in NSCLC. Ba\/F3 cell lines harboring PACC mts were highly sensitive to furmo which showed overall superior potency vs. osimertinib and similar activity to afatinib. When comparing the mutant\/wild-type IC50 ratio, furmo showed promising and high activity against single (e.g. G719X) and compound (e.g. ex19del+L718V) PACC mts. IC50 values were similar for PACC as compared to ex20ins mts. Therefore, furmo is predicted to be broadly active across both PACC and ex20ins mutant pt populations at clinically achievable drug levels. Molecular modelling revealed that furmo&#8217;s interaction with ex20ins and PACC mts is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with specific sites and its proximity to hydrophobic residues including L792 and P794 in the drug binding pocket. To further characterize furmo sensitivity in vivo against PACC mts, studies in PDXs are ongoing to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: PACC mts are important and prevalent cancer drivers in NSCLC and furmo is similarly active preclinically against both PACC and ex20ins mts. The activity of furmo in EGFR PACC mutant NSCLC is currently being evaluated in a global study FURTHER (NCT05364073).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,uncommon mutations,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Structure-activity relationships,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Monique B.

However, resistance mechanisms and side effect profiles may limit their clinical utility. We designed 3HP-2827, a highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of FGFR2, to treat solid tumors harboring FGFR2 alterations, including amplifications, mutations, and fusions to overcome these limitations. 3HP-2827 inhibits FGFR2 enzyme activity with more than 1623-fold selectivity over FGFR1 and FGFR3. 3HP-2827 inhibits cell proliferation with IC50 &#60;10 nM and 30 nM in FGFR2 amplified and FGFR2-mutant cancer cell lines, respectively. 3HP-2827 demonstrates high kinome selectivity for FGFR2 against a panel of 485 human kinases, resulting in 90.1% inhibition of FGFR2, and no other kinases showed greater than 75% inhibition. 3HP-2827 leads only modest activity at 10 &#181;M against PDE4D2 and LCK in 44 distinct common adverse drug reaction targets, supporting its high degree of safety. 3HP-2827 also demonstrates a dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of FGFR2 and FGFR2 signaling pathway nodes, including ERK and AKT, in the FGFR2-dependent cancer cell line. In vivo, 3HP-2827 demonstrates potent antitumor activity in cell- and patient-derived xenograft mouse models, including FGFR2&#8209;amplified gastric cancer, FGFR2&#8209;mutant (N549K) endometrial cancer, FGFR2 fusion ICC and gastric cancers. Strikingly, 3HP-2827 demonstrates superior activity in patient-derived ICC and gastric cancer, cell-derived endometrial cancer (CDX) in tumor and pFGFR2 inhibitions. In the ICC PDX model, 3HP-2827 also induces the regression of pemigatinib-resistant tumors. 3HP-2827 is well tolerated in the toxicology studies, and no hyperphosphatemia or tissue mineralization is observed at 150 mg\/kg\/kg\/day in rats and 120 mg\/kg\/day in dogs. The data support that 3HP-2827, a potential to be a best-in-class selective FGFR2 inhibitor, will be studying clinically at the beginning of 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),Inhibitors,Tumor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

FLT3 is therefore seen as a promising therapeutic avenue for AML and as a result, a more complete understanding of its function and signalling may lead to additional targets and resistance mechanisms being identified. To date, several FLT3 inhibitors including Quizartinib (AC220), a second-generation ITD-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have been developed, but single-agent clinical trials have not been overwhelmingly successful. In most preclinical studies, the inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors are mainly evaluated using mutant-expressing models, however, most AML patients harbour both a wild-type and mutant FLT3 allele as well as presenting with high plasma levels of FLT3 ligand (FLT3L). We hypothesized that FLT3L could act through WT-FLT3 to influence the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in cells with heterozygous mutations. In this study, we have examined the role of FLT3 inhibition and FLT3L activation on the cellular localisation and downstream signalling in several AML cell lines, some of which express ITD mutations. We also looked at mechanisms by which FLT3L could impair the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. Our results revealed that the majority of FLT3 in the MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells was intracellular. Inhibition of ITD-FLT3 with quizartinib led to a dramatic relocalisation of FLT3 to the cell surface. This effect was more pronounced in MV4-11 (FLT3ITD\/ITD) than the heterozygous MOLM-13 (FLT3ITD\/WT) cells that also express WT. This was accompanied by inhibition of ERK, AKT and STAT5 signalling pathways and resulted in cell death. Quizartinib induced cell death only in AML lines expressing FLT3-ITD mutations (MOLM-13 and MV4-11), and this could be antagonised by FLT3 ligand (FLT3L). The largest inhibitory effects were seen in heterozygous cells expressing a mutated and wild-type allele. FLT3 inhibition was associated with downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, Bim. Our experiments indicated that both of these proteins were regulated by both WT and ITD-FLT3 through the MAPK pathway. These results suggest that activation of FLT3 signalling by FLT3L confers resistance to quizartinib through upregulation of Mcl-1 and suppression of Bim expression. Taken together, our data suggest that FLT3 cell surface localisation and expression are controlled by ITD mutations and are key components of drug resistance. The data also suggests a novel therapeutic approach in patients with high plasma FLT3L levels, especially when using type II inhibitors such as quizartinib, is to co-target the MAPK\/ERK pathway to abrogate the FLT3Lmediated resistance in FLT3-ITD AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,FLT3,Apoptosis,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The EGFR L858R mutation constitutes approximately half of the EGFR-mutated patients, and despite receiving first-line or second-line treatment with the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR TKI osimertinib, they continue to exhibit a poor prognosis. According to real-world analysis, the leading resistance mechanism to osimertinib is identified as EGFR C797S mutation. Furthermore, osimertinib is still associated with gastrointestinal and skin toxicity, despite its improved selectivity for EGFR WT compared to 1<sup>st<\/sup>-generation EGFR TKIs. Here, we show that IN-119873 can overcome C797S-mediated acquired resistance based on the results obtained by various in vitro and in vivo NSCLC models. IN-119873 binds to an EGFR allosteric site separate from the ATP-binding site with a remarkable preference for highly mutant-selective inhibition. It effectively targets EGFR L858R activating mutations while sparing the inhibition of EGFR WT, which sets it apart from ATP competitive inhibitors. Moreover, oral administration of IN-119873 showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy in a dose-dependent manner in a diverse of osimertinib-resistant CDX and PDX models. IN-119873 also demonstrated favorable blood-brain-barrier penetration with promising intracranial efficacy in the H1975-luc brain metastasis model both mono or in combination with osimertinib. As a selective, orally available, and CNS-penetrable next-generation allosteric EGFR-TKI, IN-119873 is currently undergoing IND-enabling studies and has the potential to demonstrate activity in both first-line and resistance settings, either as a monotherapy or in combination with 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR TKI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),EGFR TKI resistance,Combination therapy,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The resulting oncogenic driver alterations often drive multiple solid tumors. Therefore, targeting FGFR2 has broad therapeutic potential. Currently, only pan-FGFR inhibitors are approved for FGFR2-driven intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but not for other FGFR2-driven cancers. Due to the severe on-target toxicity associated with inhibition of FGFR1 and FGFR4, the use of the pan-FGFR inhibitors has been very limited. Thus, developing a selective FGFR2 inhibitor addresses the unmet medical need as the treatment options for FGFR2-altered cancers remain limited. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a highly selective FGFR2 inhibitor, ACE-16229210. This molecule potently inhibits FGFR2 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 6.2 nM) and exhibits excellent selectivity (&#62;133-fold) over other FGFR1 and FGFR4 in biochemical assays. It also potently (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;1 nM) and selectively (&#8805;500-fold) inhibits FGFR2-induced ERK phosphorylation in multiple cancer cell lines harboring FGFR2 fusions, amplification, and mutations, but not those harboring FGFR1, FGFR3, or FGFR4 genetic alterations (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 460 nM). Furthermore, this molecule, when evaluated in a panel of 24 cell lines, demonstrates potent anti-proliferative activity against the cell lines harboring FGFR2, but not FGFR3, and especially FGFR1, or FGFR4 genetic alterations. Thus, ACE-16229210 is a potent and selective FGFR2 inhibitor. Interestingly, it exhibits the most potent activity against gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations followed by fusions, amplification, and activation loop mutations. This molecule shows a robust broad spectrum of antitumor activity with significant tumor regression at low doses (1-10 mg\/kg) in several tumor xenograft and PDX models representing the major FGFR2 relevant tumor histologies including gastric, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers harboring clinically important FGFR2 driver alterations with a well-defined pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic relationship. This molecule also demonstrates strong synergistic effects when combined with irinotecan and fulvestrant in a gastric tumor model and a breast cancer PDX model harboring FGFR2 amplification, respectively. Finally, ACE-16229210 did not significantly affect serum phosphorus levels in animals at the exposure levels that are &#62;100-fold higher than the efficacious AUC, further confirming its excellent selectivity over FGFR1. Taken together, these <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies show that ACE-16229210 is a potent and selective FGFR2 inhibitor with the potential to be developed into a more effective treatment option for multiple cancers harboring FGFR2 oncogenic driver alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),FGFR2-altered breast and Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,pan-FGFR inhibitor Resistance,FGFR2 Fusion & amplification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Unfortunately, treatment-provoked adaptive resistance mechanisms inevitably develop, limiting their therapeutic potential. As a central node essential for receptor tyrosine kinase mediated RAS activation, SHP2 has emerged as an attractive cancer target. Consequently, many SHP2 allosteric inhibitors are now in clinical testing. Here we discovered a previously unrecognized off-target effect associated with SHP2 allosteric inhibitors. We found that these inhibitors accumulate in the lysosome and block autophagic flux in a SHP2-independent manner. We showed that off-target autophagy inhibition by SHP2 allosteric inhibitors contributes to their anti-tumor activity. We also demonstrated that SHP2 allosteric inhibitors harboring this off-target activity not only suppress oncogenic RAS signaling but also overcome drug resistance such as MAPK rebound and protective autophagy in response to RAS-MAPK pathway blockage. Finally, we exemplified a new therapeutic framework that harnesses both the on- and off-target activities of SHP2 allosteric inhibitors for improved treatment of mutant RAS driven and drug resistant malignancies such as pancreatic and colorectal cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Phosphatase,Autophagy,Ras,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiming Miao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yunpeng Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinmin Miao<sup>1<\/sup>, Allison  A.

Among NSCLC, approximately 2-4% of patients have mutations in the HER2, a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and key proliferation driver, with exon 20 insertions making up about 90% of these mutations. HER2 exon mutations can have various alterations, and among them, the most common HER2 mutation is in-frame insertions in exon 20, especially the A775_G776insYVMA insertion\/duplication. These mutations can affect the structure and function of the HER2 protein and may contribute to tumor development and growth. HER2 mutations have often shown resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), further highlighting the need for HER2-specific treatments. Also, inhibitors targeting HER2 mutations are selective, meaning they specifically target HER2 alterations without causing toxicities or affecting EGFR<sup>WT<\/sup>. Therefore, there is a need for the development of selective HER2 exon20 insertion mutant inhibitors. Herein, Hanmi has identified selective HER2 exon20 insertion mutant small molecule inhibitors, designed based on affinity and binding mode starting from a known crystal structure using GLIDE (Schr&#246;dinger), and the screening for the viability of cell lines including HER2<sup>A775_G776insYVMA<\/sup>, HER2<sup>G776delinsVC<\/sup><sub>, <\/sub>HER2<sup>WT<\/sup> and EGFR<sup>WT<\/sup> was investigated. Hanmi's HER2 exon20 insertion mutant inhibitors selectively target mutant HER2 receptor tyrosine domains through shared binding, sparing EGFR<sup>WT <\/sup>and minimizing EGFR-related toxicities. With highly selectivity against EGFR<sup>WT<\/sup> and desirable pharmacokinetic properties, the Hanmi compounds inhibit HER2 mutant cells and HER2 mutant enzymes. Additionally, the compounds have an oral administration-compatible DMPK profile and demonstrated anti-tumor activity in HER2 mutant and HER2<sup>WT<\/sup> tumor xenograft mice. In conclusion, based on our study, Hanmi compounds, a novel HER2 exon20 insertion mutant inhibitors could be suggested as an appropriate therapeutic agent for inhibitory activity against HER2 exon20 insertion mutant NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,NSCLC,exon20 insertion,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Here, we assessed antitumor effects of olverembatinib in preclinical models of SDH-deficient cancers and explored potential mechanisms of action (MOA). Antiproliferation assays were conducted using CellTiter-Glo&#174;. MOA analyses were performed using western blotting. <i>In vivo<\/i> activity was evaluated using an SDHB knock-out [KO])-derived mouse xenograft model. Olverembatinib had superior antiproliferative activity (vs other approved TKIs) in SDH-deficient cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 0.129-5.132 &#956;M), including Jurkat clone E6-1 (<i>SDHB<\/i> mutation [mut]), OS-RC-2 (<i>SDHA<\/i> and <i>SDHB<\/i> mut), RKO (<i>SDHA<\/i> mut), and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells with SDHB KO (PC12<sup>#<\/sup>5F7) (Table 1). In PC12<sup>#<\/sup>5F7 cells, olverembatinib decreased HIF-1&#945;, HIF-2&#945;, VEGFA, and FGFR1 protein levels and inhibited phosphorylation of FGFR1, IGF-1R, SRC, AKT, and ERK1\/2. Increased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP-1 was observed, suggesting induction of apoptosis. In PC12<sup>#<\/sup>5F7 (SDHB KO)-derived xenograft models, olverembatinib demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity at 10 and 20 mg\/kg (QOD), with tumor growth inhibition rates of 27.4% and 52.2%, respectively. At 20 mg\/kg, olverembatinib showed superior efficacy vs ponatinib (10 mg\/kg) and rogaratinib (50 mg\/kg). Results from western blot analyses were similar in both tumor tissues and cell lines.

BRAF V600 point mutations and <i>BRAF<\/i> fusions, which are found in both pediatric and adult cancers, are oncogenic drivers that drive constitutive activation of the RAF pathway (Jones 2009, Yaeger 2019). Neurofibromatosis 1 (<i>NF1<\/i>) loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, which occur in many cancer types, result in decreased neurofibromin GAP function, thus activating RAS (Basu 1992). Tovorafenib is an investigational, selective, CNS-penetrant, small molecule type II RAF inhibitor which inhibits both RAF monomers and dimers and has been shown preclinically to impact the <i>KIAA1549<\/i>::<i>BRAF<\/i> fusion (Sun 2017). In this study, the impact of tovorafenib alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor, pimasertib, was explored in adult or pediatric tumor models harboring <i>BRAF<\/i> fusions or <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF mutations. At clinically relevant doses, tovorafenib treatment resulted in tumor regression in an <i>AGK<\/i>::<i>BRAF<\/i> fusion melanoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model <i>in vivo<\/i>. In contrast, little anti-tumor activity was observed in response to tovorafenib <i>in vivo<\/i> in two tumor models harboring <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF mutations. Ongoing PK-PD studies in both the <i>AGK<\/i>::<i>BRAF<\/i> fusion model and the <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF models will assess the extent and duration of target inhibition. <i>In vitro<\/i>, anti-proliferative activity of tovorafenib was also evaluated in <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF mutant tumor cell lines or PDX models of different tumor types, including melanoma, lung and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). While tovorafenib was potent in the BRAF V600E tumor cell line, little activity was observed in the <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF tumor cell lines. Modulation of phosphorylated-ERK (pERK) was also assessed. At very low concentrations, modest induction of pERK was observed in the <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF tumor cell lines, with inhibition at higher concentrations. <i>In vitro <\/i>combination studies were conducted using pimasertib and tovorafenib, or a tool compound. Synergy was observed in a <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma PDX model <i>ex vivo<\/i> and a <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF MPNST cell line <i>in vitro<\/i>, suggesting that vertical pathway inhibition is impactful in the <i>NF1<\/i>-LOF mutant setting. Tovorafenib is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy in relapsed or progressive pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) harboring <i>RAF<\/i><i> <\/i>alterations (NCT04775485) and in combination with pimasertib in patients &#8805;12 years of age with recurrent, progressive, or refractory solid tumors harboring MAPK pathway alterations (NCT04985604).

However, contemporary strategies suffer from limited responses, adverse side effects, and low tissue penetration due to utilization of macromolecules, calling for more efficacious and safer alternative strategies. SHP1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and has been shown to negatively regulate immune responses in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and SHP1 deletion in these cells has shown to promote their anti-tumor functions. Recent studies also demonstrated that inducible SHP1 knockout inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> through immune activation. Although presented as an attractive target, no high-quality small molecule inhibitors have been reported for SHP1 due to its undruggable nature. Through high-throughput screening and extensive medicinal chemistry, we have acquired the first-in-class SHP1 covalent inhibitor M029, which shows &#62;25-fold selectivity against SHP2, its closest analogues and &#62;60-fold selectivity against other PTPs and cysteine-based proteins. Further proteomics studies reveal that M029 is superiorly selective for SHP1 <i>in cellulo<\/i>. Additionally, M029 is stable in 100-fold excessive glutathione with a half-life of &#62;35 hours and non-toxic up to 100 &#181;M to healthy cells, such high stability was also reflected by its oral bioavailability with a F% of 10%. M029 treatment significantly activated T cell receptor signaling in T cells and NK cells killing effects <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, oral dosage of M029 significantly delayed tumor progression in mice bearing MC38 tumors through enhanced T cell and NK cell infiltration and activation and prolonging of T cell exhaustion. To validate that the compound acted through immune activation, we dosed the mice with anti-CD8<sup>+<\/sup> or anti-NK1.1 during M029 treatment, both of which abolished the compound efficacy, corroborating with its mechanism of action. Meanwhile, to assess the compound safety, we dosed the mice up to 100 mg\/kg for 8 days, where no significant body weight change or cytokine storm were observed. Collectively, we have developed the first SHP1 covalent inhibitor with high selectivity and strong anti-tumor efficacy. This study is the first characterization of pharmacological SHP1 inhibition as cancer immunotherapy and solidified its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. The development of M029 will also enlighten drug discovery strategies against SHP1 or other undruggable PTPs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein phosphatase,Immunomodulation,Cancer immunotherapy,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Various types of EGFR-activating mutations are one of the most important oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, 5-10% of patients have EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations that are insensitive to clinically available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Recently, as mobocertinib (EXKIVITY<sup>&#174;<\/sup>) failed to improve progression-free survival in Phase 3 clinical trial, there remains a high unmet medical need to develop new drugs with wider therapeutic window to treat NSCLC harboring EGFR ex20ins mutations. Herein, we report a novel EGFR-TKI, TRX-211-399, specifically designed to target ex20ins mutations. TRX-211-399 potently inhibited the proliferation of not only Ba\/F3 cells overexpressing near-loop (A767dupASV, S768dupSVD) and far-loop (H773insNPH, H773dupH) mutations but also patient-derived NSCLC cell line. In particular, TRX-211-399 demonstrated high selectivity against wild-type EGFR. With favorable DMPK profiles, once-daily oral administration of TRX-211-399 showed significant tumor regression in multiple Ba\/F3 xenograft models carrying different EGFR exon20ins mutations. Furthermore, in a PC-9-luc cell intracranial xenograft model, TRX-211-399 induced substantial anti-tumor effects and prolonged survival without body weight loss. TRX-211-399 is currently undergoing further preclinical evaluation as a potential candidate for clinical development for patients with EGFR exon20ins mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,EGFR exon20 insertion mutations,Blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeable,Potential candidate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

There is no broadly applicable targeted therapy to treat lung cancer and those FDA-approved drugs target patient-specific biomarker mutations such as <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, etc. Targeting multiple oncogenic pathways to induce synthetic lethality is an attractive strategy for anticancer therapeutic development. Here, we describe the effects of novel multitarget small molecule PI3K-CDK4\/6-CDK9 inhibitor LCI139 on a panel of human NSCLC cells of mixed histologic and mutational backgrounds.<br \/>Methods: LCI139 specific target inhibition was assessed by cell-free kinase hotspot\/lipid kinase assay and KINOMEscan. LCI139 (0.001-10&#956;M) was screened against NCI-H1975, NCI-H1703, NCI-H1373, NCI-H1781 and NCI-H226 human cell lines; IC<sub>50<\/sub> values determined by CellTiter-Glo\/WST-8 Assay and apoptotic rate by flow cytometry (Annexin V\/7-AAD). Metabolomic profile of representative LCI139 sensitive (LCI139<sup>S<\/sup>) and resistant (LCI139<sup>R<\/sup>) NSCLC cells was evaluated by western blot.<br \/>Results: LCI139 is a highly potent inhibitor of PI3K-CDK4\/6-CDK9: 0.070&#181;M (PI3K&#945;), 0.461&#181;M (PI3K&#947;), 0.214&#181;M (PI3K&#948;), 0.0015&#181;M (CDK4), 0.0036&#181;M (CDK6), 0.000039&#181;M (CDK9). NCI-H1703, NCI-H226, NCI-H1373 and NCI-H1975 were highly sensitive to LCI139 (0.68, 3.2, 35.27 and 342.4nM IC<sub>50<\/sub>), while NCI-H1781 remained insensitive up to 10&#956;M. Confirming those findings, LCI139 promoted robust apoptotic cell death in NCI-H1703, NCI-H226, NCI-H1373 and NCI-H1975 but not NCI-H1781. LCI139<sup>S<\/sup> H1703 cells displayed increased bioenergetic reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), compared with the LCI139<sup>R<\/sup> H1781 cells. In the LCI139<sup>S<\/sup> H1703 cells, LCI139 treatment decreased expression of all mitochondrial complexes (I-IV) and glycolytic enzymes (HK2, GAPDH, LDHA). Conversely, LCI139 treatment of LCI139<sup>R<\/sup> H1781 cells only inhibited expression of mitochondrial complexes II and III, but increased glucose uptake (Glut1) and retained expression of other glycolytic enzymes.<br \/>Conclusions: Triple PI3K-CDK4\/6-CDK9 inhibitor LCI139 is nanomolar potent against several NSCLC cells lines of mixed histologic and mutational backgrounds. NSCLC cells that are most reliant on OXPHOS to generate ATP, a classic metabolic adaptation to chemotherapy, appear to be most sensitive to LCI139. Taken together, these data support further drug characterization and mechanistic dissection to assess LCI139&#8217;s potential clinical utility in treating advanced stage and recurrent NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Small molecule inhibitor,CDK inhibitor,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Cody  C.

Genetic interaction has been documented between WEE1 and PKMYT1, and clinical trials have reported clinical activity with inhibitors of WEE1 (adavosertib, azenosertib) and PKMYT1 (lunresertib). Here, we report the discovery and characterization of ACR-2316, a dual inhibitor of WEE1 and PKMYT1 specifically designed for optimal selectivity through co-crystallography and superior single agent activity uniquely enabled by Acrivon Predictive Precision Proteomics (AP3). Mass spectrometry-based AP3 profiling was conducted across several novel WEE1 and PKMYT1 inhibitor leads generated through co-crystallography-based rational drug design. Selective leads originating from one series were further optimized using AP3 for biological structure-activity relationship analysis. AP3 profiling revealed WEE1 inhibitor-upregulated phosphorylation sites across a subset of phosphoproteins that were oppositely regulated (quenched) by PKMYT1 inhibitors. Consensus sites for these included CDK1 T14, a direct PKMYT1 phosphorylation site, as well as CHK1 S296. A particular lead compound, ACR-2316, demonstrated a desirable potent, balanced ratio of cellular WEE1 (IC50 = 2 nM, IC90 = 10 nM) and PKMYT1 (IC20 = 44 nM) inhibition resulting in superior activation of the mitotic kinases CDK1, CDK2, and PLK1 compared to adavosertib and lunresertib, based on annotated kinase substrate relationships. ACR-2316 is more selective than adavosertib, azenosertib, and lunresertib based on &#62;200 kinases profiled by AP3 and 468 kinases assessed by KINOMEscan. Cell cycle analyses demonstrated a drastic ACR-2316-induced S-G2\/M accumulation qualitatively distinct from adavosertib or lunresertib. In a 19-cancer cell line proliferation assay (CellTiter-Glo), ACR-2316 demonstrated greater potency in all cell lines tested compared to adavosertib and lunresertib (mean IC50 = 70, 252 and 364 nM, respectively). Superior anti-cancer activity of ACR-2316 was observed in 12 ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft models tested ex vivo (CellTiter-Glo 3D) compared to azenosertib and lunresertib (mean IC50 = 9, 248 and 1620 nM, respectively). Across human tumor xenograft mouse models, oral administration of ACR-2316 demonstrated superior, durable, dose-dependent efficacy compared to azenosertib and lunresertib and was well tolerated at all doses. Complete responses observed with ACR-2316 were associated with strong WEE1 and intermediate PKMYT1 inhibition in tumors. In conclusion, ACR-2316 is a potent, selective dual WEE1\/PKMYT1 inhibitor with superior single-agent activity compared to clinical WEE1 or PKMYT1 inhibitors. ACR-2316 is progressing through IND-enabling studies in preparation for clinical monotherapy development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"WEE1,PKMYT1,ACR-2316,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Sotorasib (S) is a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> specific inhibitor clinically approved for the treatment of advanced KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. One identified resistance mechanism to sotorasib is the increase of multiple phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR and HER2. The objective of this study was to assess the <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy of the single agents N, L, T and S, and the combination of N and S in HER2-amplified, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated cancer cell lines.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The antiproliferative effects of N, L, T and S were assessed in the HER2-amplified and KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated KYSE-410 (esophageal) and NCI-H2030 (lung) cancer cell lines, and KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated MiaPaca-2 (pancreatic) cell line by 5-day acid phosphatase assay. IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were calculated using CalcuSyn software. To assess the synergy between N and S, matrix assays were performed and analyzed using Combenefit software. To further determine the efficacy of the drugs, changes in signaling pathways were assessed by Western blotting.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>N displayed nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values (&#60; 100 nM) in all three cell lines, while nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> values with L and T were only achieved in KYSE-410 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 426.84 nM and IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 363.38 nM respectively). S was most potent in MiaPaca-2 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 6.04 nM), followed by NCI-H2030 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 270.60 nM) and KYSE-410 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 5.46 &#181;M). Matrix assays showed that NS was broadly additive in MiaPaca-2 cells, and synergistic in both NCI-H2030 and KYSE-410 cell lines. N and NS numerically decreased HER2 levels compared to control in NCI-H2030 after 24h of treatment (6.4-fold, p = 0.58 and 2.5-fold, p = 0.79 respectively) but not in KYSE-410. KRAS levels were significantly increased (1.89-fold, p &#8804; 0.05) after treatment with NS in NCI-H2030. No significant effects were observed on the activation of HER2 and EGFR in either cell line at 24h. In NCI-H2030, NS had a significantly stronger inhibitory effect on pERK compared to N (p &#8804; 0.0001) and S (p = 0.012) alone. In KYSE-410, pERK levels were also slightly decreased with NS, but not significantly different from N (p = 0.12). However, pAkt levels in KYSE-410 were significantly reduced by N (1.3-fold, p = 0.009) and NS (1.7-fold, p &#8804; 0.0001) compared to control, with NS showing a significantly greater decrease than N (p = 0.026). It thus appears that the synergy between N and S occurs through a stronger inhibition of ERK activity in NCI-H2030, while it occurs through a stronger inhibition of Akt activity in KYSE-410.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> NS is additive or synergistic in the three KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutated cancer cell lines examined.

Exon 20 insertion mutations (exon20ins) are the predominant HER2 mutations in NSCLC, and ~50% of HER2-mutant metastatic NSCLC patients develop brain metastases. The antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has received FDA accelerated approval for HER2-mutant NSCLC, but currently there are no approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for this indication. NVL-330 is a novel, brain-penetrant, HER2-selective TKI, designed to address the combined medical need of treating HER2-mutant tumors, avoiding treatment related adverse events due to off-target inhibition of wild-type EGFR, and treating brain metastases. Here we characterized the preclinical pharmacological profile of NVL-330 in comparison to other investigational HER2-targeting TKIs and T-DXd.<br \/>Methods: TKIs were profiled in cellular phospho-HER2, phospho-EGFR, and viability assays. <i>In vivo<\/i> antitumor studies were performed in nude mice with HER2-altered subcutaneous or intracranial tumors. T-DXd concentration was measured in an ELISA assay. The unbound brain-to-plasma partitioning ratio (&#922;p,uu) was determined at one hour after oral 10 mg\/kg dosing in Wistar Han rats.<br \/>Results: NVL-330 broadly inhibited HER2 oncogenic alterations, including amplified wild-type HER2, HER2 exon20ins and non-exon20ins mutants, with potency and selectivity over wild-type EGFR comparable to investigational HER2-selective TKI zongertinib. By contrast, NVL-330 had a higher Kp,uu than zongertinib in rats. In a patient-derived xenograft model harboring HER2 exon20ins, treatment with NVL-330 suppressed phospho-HER2 and downstream signaling, increased total HER2 and caused dose-dependent tumor regression at well tolerated doses. In the HER2<sup>amp<\/sup> NCI-N87 subcutaneous xenograft model, oral administration of 30 mg\/kg NVL-330 twice per day induced tumor regression, similar to that achieved by intravenous administration of 10 mg\/kg T-DXd once every three weeks, a human-relevant dose in mice. By comparison, in the intracranial setting with the same tumor model and dosing regimens, NVL-330 induced tumor regression, whereas T-DXd provided tumor stasis. Pharmacokinetic analysis in these intracranial tumor bearing mice indicated that NVL-330 had significantly higher brain penetrance than T-DXd.<br \/>Conclusions: NVL-330 was broadly and selectively active against HER2 oncogenic alterations <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, and demonstrated brain penetrance in rodents exceeding that of HER2 investigational TKI zongertinib and T-DXd. This preclinical profile supports the potential for NVL-330 to address a medical need for patients with HER2-driven cancers, including those with brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,HER2 exon 20,Brain metastasis,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The demonstration of clinical benefit of available pan-ERBB and HER2 inhibitors has been hampered by the dose-limiting side effects from their collateral or residual EGFR inhibition. Here we present IAM1363 (also known as ENT-H1), a highly potent and selective irreversible inhibitor of both HER2 wild-type and HER2 oncogenic mutants. IAM1363 binds to HER2 in a type II DFG-out conformation, the only example reported to date for this target. This binding mechanism underlies its strong interactions with HER2, including N-terminally truncated HER2 (p95HER2) and HER2 kinase domain mutants, with cellular IC50s in the low nanomolar range, while sparing WT EGFR. Oral administration of IAM1363 in mice led to tumor regression (TR) in a diverse set of HER2-driven tumor models at levels well below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Importantly, strong in vivo efficacy was observed in tumor models that exhibited resistance to the existing HER2-targeting agents. For example, in a p95HER2 xenograft model, IAM1363 caused significant TR, including complete responses, at 100 mg\/kg dose, whereas tucatinib achieved at best tumor stasis at MTD and T-DXd showed marginal effect. Besides HER2 truncation, co-occurring EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) amplification or overexpression can also lead to resistance to HER2-directed treatments. IAM1363 was tested in xenograft models using HER2-amplified\/EGFR-high cell lines HCC1954 and SKOV3, and demonstrated robust TRs. Even more strikingly, IAM1363 led to TR in the HCC827 human lung cancer xenograft model with mid-level HER2, and high levels of EGFR and MET expression. The resistance combatting effect of IAM1363 goes beyond co-occurring RTK-mediated mechanism as IAM1363 also showed dose-dependent TR in KYSE410, a human esophageal squamous cancer xenograft model that harbors the KRAS G12C mutation and HER2 amplification. Taken together, IAM1363 represents a promising clinical candidate for the treatment of HER2-driven tumors. Its unique binding mechanism and potent pan-HER2 activity overcome multiple resistance mechanisms, and its strong EGFR avoidance widens the safety margin. Additionally, IAM1363 was found to be consistently enriched in xenograft tumors that had moderate to high HER2 expression levels, and those with HER2 activating mutations. This distinctive pharmacokinetic property facilitates optimal target engagement in tumors, including those occurring in the brain, while minimizing potential systemic side effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Drug resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The primary focus has been on tailoring single-warhead compounds to target specific cysteine residues within the functional domains of target proteins. However, the biochemical properties including dimerization, induced conformational changes, and interactome disruption have been underexplored, presenting an ongoing limitation in current drug discovery approaches. In this study, we generated a library of 32 cysteine-reactive warhead compounds using various combinations of scaffolds and warheads to represent diverse reactivities. A combinatory assay approach, including cysteine druggability mapping (CDM) to discover reactive residues and SDS-PAGE fractionation assays to identify disrupted protein interaction events, was employed. Characterization of the library revealed distinct reactive cysteines and dimerization profiles among the 32 unique compounds. Compound 1C9, identified as a lead compound, demonstrated significant dimerization of EML4, a common fusion gene partner in lung cancer. Using the EML4ALK fusion gene as a proof of concept, we explored potential mechanisms underlying the compound-induced dimerization of EML4. Subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and screening of 70 additional compounds were conducted to optimize ALK dimerization and minimize off-target effects. The enhanced compound disrupted the ALK cellular signaling pathways AKT and ERK upon dimerization of the EML4ALK fusion gene. Additionally, we discovered that covalent dimerization induced EML4ALK degradation without requiring a ubiquitin ligase like a PROTAC. In conclusion, our work has uncovered a novel class of cysteine covalent binders, which we believe are valuable tools to modulate protein-protein interactions in previously undruggable proteins in cancer. This discovery holds significant therapeutic potential for future drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Proteomics,Small molecule inhibitor,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Diane Yang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stefan Harry<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Codd<sup><\/sup>, Stefan  T.
