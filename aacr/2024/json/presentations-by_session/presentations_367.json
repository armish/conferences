[{"Abstract":"Tumors exhibit dynamic gradients of oxygen diffusion and consumption leading to regions of hypoxia. The presence of hypoxia is associated with poor clinical prognosis and elevated genomic instability. Genes can be amplified extrachromosomally as ecDNA, which are acentric circular structures that can rapidly generate large genomic copy number amplifications. The amplification of oncogenes on ecDNA is unstable thus providing cells with an advantage to adjust and survive the changing environment. Here, we have analysed the effect of hypoxia on disease outcome and ecDNA formation in the multiregional longitudinal NSCLC TRACERx (TRAcking Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) cohort. We have analysed next generation sequencing, clinical and histopathological data available from the tumours that were harvested at the time of surgery from patients recruited into the lung TRACERx study. Hypoxia was first quantified using the mRNA-based Buffa hypoxia gene signature. Complexheatmap from R-Bioconductor package was used for clustering based on mRNA expression of gene signature. Moreover, hypoxia scores for each region were established using the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) from R- Bioconductor package. The impact of hypoxia on overall and disease-free survival was performed using the survminer package. Histopathological data was used to study the association between hypoxia and necrosis. The genetic instability was analyzed using whole exome sequencing. The amplicon architect tool was used to study the association of hypoxia with ecDNA detection. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the extent of hypoxia varies widely both within and between primary tumours, suggestive of the presence of inter and intratumour hypoxia heterogeneity. High hypoxia status is associated with worse overall and disease-free survival in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous-cell carcinoma. The presence of necrosis in the primary tumour was associated with higher hypoxia. Moreover, higher hypoxia scores correlate with circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) shedding in pre-surgery plasma samples (p value&#60; 0.05). Higher hypoxia was significantly associated with increased wGII scores, indicative of genomic instability. Also, hypoxia resulted in increased detection of ecDNA in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, there is inter and intratumoral heterogeneity in hypoxia levels in lung TRACERx. Moreover, the presence of hypoxia is associated with the detection of necrosis and ctDNA shedding. The increased genomic instability and detection of ecDNA in this study could be associated with the poor prognosis that is observed with hypoxic tumours and could merit further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Genetic instability,Cancer genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Oxygen-sensitive activation of hypoxia-induced transcription factors is in part regulated by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs). We and others previously showed that the BTB and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) transcription factor promotes metastasis in various cancer types. In accompanying work, we show that BACH1 is prolyl-hydroxylated and degraded in an oxygen-dependent manner in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here we show that BACH1 lacking its hydroxylated proline sites (i.e., mutant BACH1) expressed in TNBC cells exhibits increased DNA binding to a canonical BACH1 binding site as well as greater transcriptional output of metastasis and hypoxia-response-related genes relative to wild-type BACH1. Furthermore, <i>in vivo<\/i> assays showed that mutant BACH1 promotes greater tumor metastasis of TNBC cells than wild-type BACH1. Our findings suggest that the proline hydroxylation of BACH1 directly regulates BACH1&#8217;s transcriptional activity by modulating its DNA-binding activity. Together, these results reveal a mechanism underlying oxygen-sensitive regulation of BACH1 that could potentially contribute to BACH1-mediated pro-metastatic signaling and therapeutic resistance under hypoxia in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Hypoxia,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Long Chi Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Dann<sup>1<\/sup>, Madeline Henn<sup>1<\/sup>, Dongbo Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Shi<sup>1<\/sup>, Lydia Robinson-Mailman<sup>1<\/sup>, Kazuhiko Igarashi<sup>2<\/sup>, Marsha R.

Prostate cancer progression is accompanied by bursts of chromosomal instability (CIN), including chromosomal translocations, oncogene amplifications, and chromothripsis. While high CIN correlates with most metrics of aggressive disease, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how CIN originates in prostate cancer. Recently, we discovered that cells in primary prostate tumors lack centrosomes, cytoplasmic organelles that ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation by organizing the shape of the mitotic spindle. Experimental elimination of centrosomes in immortalized, non-tumorigenic prostate cell lines was sufficient to generate extensive CIN, resulting in oncogenic transformation of these lines when sub-cutaneously injected into NSG mice. Because we identified centrosome loss as a potential driver of CIN, we sought to understand mechanisms that can trigger centrosome loss in the prostate. Although centrosome loss naturally occurs during the development of some tissues, for example centrosome elimination during oogenesis, the mechanisms that trigger loss are not known. Therefore, we first investigated microenvironmental changes in early prostate cancer as a potential cause. Hypoxia, pathologically low oxygen concentration, is common in the aging prostate due to loss of vasculature and is associated with poor prostate cancer prognosis and high CIN. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypoxic exposure induces centrosome loss in prostate cells. Indeed, we found that exposure to 1% oxygen concentrations leads to progressive centrosome loss in non-tumorigenic, immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines. Using immunofluorescence of centrosomes in cultured cells, we found that hypoxia-induced centrosome loss is independent of HIF transcription but requires activation of the confluence-dependent Hippo signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we found that centrosome disassembly begins with the removal of the pericentriolar material (PCM), the outer shell of the centrosome that nucleates microtubules. We were able to block centrosome disassembly by over-expressing a constitutively-active mutant of Polo-like Kinase 1, which normally strengthens the PCM during mitosis to promote centrosome maturation. Furthermore, centrosome loss was prevented by treatment with the Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor Okadaic Acid. Using RNAseq, we have identified potential PP2A regulatory subunits that are up-regulated in cells undergoing hypoxia-induced centrosome loss. Our model is that hypoxia induces dephosphorylation of the PCM, mechanically weakening the centrosome and leaving it vulnerable to disassembly. Together with previous findings, we conclude that hypoxia-induced centrosome disassembly is a plausible driver of CIN in early prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Hypoxia,Prostate cancer,Centrosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>John M.

This is likely because it is detected at a very late stage and the therapeutic approaches that have been used for its treatment have proven to be quite ineffective. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed for a better prognosis in patients suffering of pancreatic cancer. PDAC cells often rewire their metabolism to survive and progress. This metabolic rewiring permits the acquisition of nutrients by the cells when these are exposed to a poor nutrient microenvironment. One of the most used processes in nutrient stress conditions is the &#8220;cell-drinking&#8221; pathway macropinocytosis, an endocytic pathway that cancer cells exploit to support cancer metabolism in such unfavorable conditions. Macropinocytosis inhibition has shown to suppress PDAC growth in mice and thus, it has become a promising therapeutic target for PDAC treatment. Here, we describe that atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) isoforms Protein Kinase C zeta (PKC&#950;) and Protein Kinase C iota (PKC&#953;) regulate PDAC macropinocytosis in the context of glutamine stress. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of aPKC impair macropinocytosis promotion in PDAC cells exposed to a glutamine-deprived environment and in cells treated with DON, a glutamine analog that blocks glutamine metabolism. In epithelial cells, aPKCs are known to regulate the establishment of cell polarity in association with the scaffold proteins Par3 and Par6, constituting the cell polarity complex, which controls the function of different targets such as Par1 kinases. Loss of Par3, Par6 and Par-1a affects glutamine stress associated macropinocytosis in a similar extent than aPKC depletion, presenting a novel role of the cell polarity protein network in the modulation of macropinocytic uptake. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Metabolism,Glutamine,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

HIF activates the transcription of genes bearing hypoxia responsive elements (RE) in their promoter regions including genes related to angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. The HIF-1 pathway is thus an attractive target to prevent cancer aggressiveness and improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy. HIF-1&#945; activity is known to be mainly regulated through post-translational modification by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, but accumulating evidence indicate that it is also regulated by other mechanisms such as transcriptional initiation, translational initiation, protein-protein interaction, post-translational modifications and post-transcriptionally, primarily through the action of trans-acting factors (noncoding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins) that interact with the HIF-1&#945; mRNA to regulate its decay and translational rates. We recently identified the RNA binding protein hnRNP A18 as a regulator of HIF-1&#945; translation under hypoxic conditions. hnRNP A18 is a nuclear stress responsive protein that translocates to the cytosol in response to cellular stress including hypoxia to bind to a recognition motif in the 3&#8217;UTR of its targeted transcripts including HIF-1&#945; to stabilize the transcripts and increase their translation. Using a bicistronic reporter plasmid containing a HIF-1&#945; internal ribosome entry site (IRES) we now show that hnRNP A18 can also regulate HIF-1&#945; through its IRES in the 5&#8217;UTR. In fact, cells expressing hnRNP A18 significantly increase translation of a reporter CAT protein under the control of HIF-1&#945; IRES in the presence of the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl<sub>2<\/sub>. On the other hand, deletion of hnRNP A18 prevents the translation of the CAT reporter protein even in the presence of CoCl<sub>2<\/sub>. Moreover, we also identified several HIF-1&#945; REs in hnRNP A18 promoter. Two of the predicted HIF-1&#945; REs, located at -57 and -226 upstream of the hnRNP A18 start codon were validated as bonafide HIF-1&#945; binding sites by Electromobility Shift Assay with recombinant HIF-1&#945; protein and by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay in human pancreatic cancer cells Panc 01. These data thus indicate that a positive regulatory loop between hnRNP A18 and HIF1-1&#945; exist to amplify HIF-1&#945; expression under cellular stress. hnRNP A18 can upregulate HIF1&#945; protein expression by stabilizing its transcript at the 3&#8217;UTR and by binding to its IRES. On the other hand, HIF-1&#945; can upregulate hnRNP A18 by binding to its proximal promoter. Targeting hnRNP A18 could thus provide a new mechanism to regulate HIF-1&#945; expression and sensitize cancer cells to therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Regulation,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

In order to adapt stress conditions during cancer progression, the cancer cells will be subject to metabolism reprogramming to increase energy production and remove hazardous substances. One of the important organelles, mitochondria is responsible for cellular ATP production, ion homeostasis, and several metabolic pathways. Therefore, mitochondria require a series of transporters called solute carrier family 25 (SLC25) to transport metabolites crossing the mitochondrial inner membrane, and dysregulation of those transporters causes abnormal cell morphology and diseases. In this study, members of the SLC25 family were analyzed in CRC via bioinformatics analysis, and a mitochondrial glutathione transporter was identified to overexpress in several public datasets of CRC and our own clinical specimens. In addition, its role has not been reported in any disease, including cancer. To systemically analyze the underlying mechanism causing overexpression of glutathione transporter during CRC progression, several stress conditions had been applied to colon cancer cells. However, only hypoxia was identified to induce its protein expression but not mRNA expression. Since a previous study reported that glutathione deprivation induced its protein expression, hypoxia didn&#8217;t alter the abundance of glutathione level suggesting that another glutathione-independent regulatory mechanism might be involve it. Interestingly, our findings revealed that hypoxia-induced glutathione transporter protein expression was mediated through the activation of internal ribosome binding site-mediated translation under hypoxia. To identify the potential role of glutathione transporter during colon cancer progression, its mitochondrial metabolite profiles from knockout cells of previous studies were further analyzed and identified that the changes of metabolites were associated with the urea cycle which had been reported to be associated with the sensitivity of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cancer treatment. Importantly, our results showed that hypoxia-attenuated those chemotherapeutic effects were abolished by loss of glutathione transporter in colon cancer cells, indicating its crucial role in hypoxia-induced drug resistance. In conclusion, our study shows that glutathione transporter increased by hypoxia might lead to drug resistance of cancer therapy in colon cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Drug resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.-C.

Poor nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment forces cancer cells to adapt to alternate routes of metabolism, nutrient scavenging and autophagy leading to a shift in their metabolic phenotype. These adaptations promote evolution of invasive and aggressive phenotypes. To test this hypothesis and to characterize the evolution of cancer cells under nutrient stress, we generated nutrient stress adapted cells from MCF7-GFP cells by subjecting them to multiple cycles of nutrient starvation and repletion. Distinct clones that outgrew were selected as nutrient stress adapted cells (NSA). Here we show that MCF7-NSA cells that are adapted to grow in low nutrient conditions exhibited robust accumulation of lipid droplets compared to parental MCF7-GFP cells as shown by confocal microscopy after neutral lipid staining as well as immunofluorescence staining for PLIN2 (Perilipin 2), a lipid droplet coat protein. In addition, MCF7-NSA cells showed elevated expression of the nuclear receptor PPAR&#947; and the adipokine FABP4 indicating an adipogenic\/lipogenic signature. Strikingly, these nutrient stress adapted cells were capable of nutrient scavenging by macropinocytosis compared to control cells even under nutrient replete conditions. Macropinocytosis was assessed by DQ-BSA processing and TMR-Dextran uptake. NHE inhibitor EIPA (ethyl isopropyl amiloride), that blocks macropinocytosis, but not receptor mediated endocytosis confirmed dextran uptake through macropinocytosis. Similarly, macropinocytosis inhibitor KH7 blocked dextran uptake in these adapted cells. Furthermore, MCF7-NSA cells showed high expression of TFEB and TFE3, master regulators of autophagy and lysosomogenesis suggesting that the necrotic cell debris scavenged through macropinocytosis and processed through autolysosome machinery might be contributing to <i>de novo<\/i> lipogenesis. Although control and adapted cells exhibited similar growth kinetics <i>in vitro<\/i>, when implanted in mammary fat pads (MFP) of NSG mice, NSA cells formed significantly smaller and slow growing primary tumors. Interestingly, 80% of these mice showed metastasis to other organs (lung, liver, kidney) whereas control mice did not develop metastasis as parental MCF7 is not an aggressive cell line in xenograft models. MCF7-NSA cells were more migratory <i>in vitro<\/i> in wound healing assays and were capable of developing lung metastases in a mouse model where primary tumor from mammary fat pad was resected to allow for metastases to develop. Taken together, our data suggest that lipogenic phenotype confers survival advantage in the harsh tumor microenvironment and selects for more invasive and aggressive phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Lipogenesis,Lipid Phenotype,Macropinocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Our previous work identified a non-canonical mechanism wherein Smurf2 mediates HIF-1&#945; degradation under CDK4\/6 inhibition. Through proteomic analysis, we discovered that serine 451 phosphorylation occurs on HIF-1&#945; but not in palbociclib-treated samples. Point mutations at this site, substituting serine with alanine, resulted in decreased HIF-1&#945; levels and enhanced interaction with Smurf2. Intriguingly, under palbociclib treatment, we observed phosphorylation at the serine 643 site. This site has been previously associated with MAPK-dependent regulation of HIF-1&#945; localization and activity (Ilias Mylonis, <i>et al<\/i>., 2006), particularly relevant given the reported MAPK reliance in acquired CDK4\/6 inhibitor-resistant scenarios (Ren&#233;e de Leeuw, <i>et al<\/i>., 2018). To explore therapeutic implications, we investigated the impact of combined CDK4\/6 (palbociclib) and MEK1\/2 inhibition (trametinib, selumetinib, PD98059, U0126). Dual inhibition robustly reduced HIF-1&#945; expression in colorectal cancer cells (HCT116, SW480) and suppressed HIF-1&#945; activity in luciferase reporter assays. This effect extended to synergistic inhibition of cell viability under both normoxia and hypoxia in HCT116 and SW480 cells. Such effect is also applicable to other cancer types and cell lines (<i>e.g.<\/i> U251). In summary, our findings unveil a phosphorylation site on HIF-1&#945; associated with CDK4\/6 activity, influencing its protein stabilization. This discovery supports the rationale for combining CDK4\/6 and MEK1\/2 inhibition as a promising strategy in the treatment of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,CDK4\/6,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In prior work, we demonstrated that not all KEAP1 mutations observed in NSCLC patients are pathogenic. These benign mutations have a wild-type phenotype that does not impart therapy resistance. However, only roughly 100 of ~13,000 (&#60;1%) possible KEAP1 single amino acid substitution mutations have been characterized. Here, we performed saturation mutagenesis of KEAP1 to comprehensively evaluate all possible point mutation phenotypes <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: Saturation mutagenesis was accomplished using the High-throughput Mutagenesis by Integrated TilEs (MITE) method. In brief, the KEAP1 sequence was divided into 21 tiles each containing a 90 bp variable region flanked by a 30 bp constant region. At each codon position, mutations representing the 20 possible natural amino acids and a stop codon were included for a total of 13,076 KEAP1 variants. The tiles were assembled such that each full length KEAP1 construct contained a single desired mutation. The KEAP1 MITE lentivirus library was transduced into H1299-KEAP1<sup>NULL<\/sup> cells that were then treated with vehicle or H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2 <\/sub>for 24 days. The KEAP1 ORF was amplified from gDNA and mutations were quantified by next generation sequencing. Mutation enrichment analysis was used to derive functional annotations.<br \/>Results: Oxidative stress resulted in a bimodal distribution of KEAP1 mutations. Cells with KEAP1 nonsense mutations were enriched while cells with silent mutations were depleted. Using a threshold of 95% specificity for silent mutations to distinguish benign from pathogenic mutations, 94% of nonsense mutations and 88% of previously characterized pathogenic mutations were identified as pathogenic. While the majority of KEAP1 mutations were benign (64%), analysis of mutations found in TCGA NSCLC patients showed an enrichment of pathogenic mutations (72%). Overlaying mutation calls onto the KEAP1 structure showed enrichment of pathogenic mutations in the BTB homodimerization interface, hydrophobic core of the oxidative stress sensing IVR domain, and NRF2 binding pocket of the Kelch domain.<br \/>Conclusions: Saturation mutagenesis of KEAP1 generated a comprehensive list of pathogenic KEAP1 single amino acid substitutions. Assignments strongly agreed with biologic function and prior literature. The assessment of KEAP1 mutation phenotypes is important as benign mutations occur in a significant subset of NSCLC patients and are not expected to impart therapy resistance. Our results will allow identification of benign and pathogenic KEAP1 mutations in clinical studies, which will enable testing of personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with KEAP1 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oxidative stress,Radioresistance,Lung cancer: non-small cell,KEAP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Studies showed that &#946;-AR blockade of mice suppressed hypoxia induction of renal HIF-1&#945; accumulation, erythropoietin production, and erythropoiesis in vivo. In this work we assumed that through PHD3 activity, &#946;3-AR mediates hypoxia sensing needed for HIF-1&#945; stabilization, thus we investigated a putative correlation between &#946;3-AR\/HIF-1&#945; and PHD3. Data showed a similar outcome of &#946;3-ARs and HIF-1&#945; at short time of hypoxia, and that &#946;3-AR antagonist, SR59230A reduced HIF-1&#945; protein expression under hypoxia. &#946;3-AR silencing under hypoxia revealed an evident reduction of HIF-1&#945; protein expression that confirmed the &#946;3-AR modulation of HIF-1&#945; expression. SR59230A treatment strongly reduced the HIF-1&#945; target genes as GLUT1, HK-2 and HIF-1&#945; expression at long time treatment confirming the &#946;3-AR modulation of HIF-1&#945; transcriptional activity. Conversely, the HIF-1&#945;-transcriptional inhibitor Topotecan did not affect &#946;3-AR expression confirming that &#946;3-AR mediates HIF-1&#945; activation. Immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic fragmentation showed that &#946;3-AR co-localized with the nucleus under hypoxia, more than normoxia, and presence of both &#946;3-AR and HIF-1&#945; in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation of &#946;3-AR\/HIF-1&#945; revealed that under hypoxia, HIF-1&#945; dissociates from &#946;3-AR binding, but this process was abrogated by SR59230A. HIF-1&#945;, released under hypoxia from the link with &#946;3-AR, can play its transcriptional activity in the nucleus, while the binding with &#946;3-AR blocks its transcriptional activity. Moreover, the &#946;3-AR upregulation under hypoxia occurs trough an early inhibition of PHD3 activity that did not influence HIF-1&#945; expression. Hypoxic PHD2 inhibition results after PHD3 leading to HIF-1&#945; upregulation. Moreover, the blockade &#946;3-AR by SR59230A, inhibited HIF-1&#945; upregulation by increasing PHD2 activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Hypoxia-inducible factor,beta3-adrenoceptors ,Ewing Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

GRP78 is known as the master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, regulating ER stress by activating the UPR pathway to avoid cell apoptosis and regulates the activation of UPR pathway signals by binding PERK. Overexpression of GRP78 in PDAC results in the retention of misfolded and unassembled proteins, as well as the accumulation of ROS, leading to the promotion of genomic instability. However, there has been limited research on targeting GRP78 as a therapeutic strategy in PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of BOLD-100, an inhibitor of GRP78, in PDAC.<br \/>Methods: We used 9 PDAC cell lines (Capan-1, AsPC-1, HPAFII, MIA-PaCa2, Panc-1, Capan-2, SNU-213, SNU-324, SNU-2918). The mouse xenograft model of Capan-1 was established for in vivo study. BOLD-100 (GRP78 inhibitor), AZD6738 (ATR inhibitor), NAC (N-Acetylcysteine; ROS scavenger) and TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ER stress inhibitor) were used. MTT assay, CFA assay, cell cycle analysis, RT-PCR, western blot, immunoprecipitation, DCF-DA staining and Annexin V assay were used to elucidate the action of BOLD-100. The combination of BOLD-100 with AZD6738 has been evaluated in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> model.<br \/>Results: BOLD-100 suppressed the proliferation of PDAC cells and decreased the mRNA level of GRP78, which in turn disrupted the interaction between GRP78 and PERK. BOLD-100 increased ER stress and ROS, leading to activation of PERK, eIF2a, and CHOP. Activation of UPR pathway induced CHOP-dependent apoptosis and inhibited PDAC cell growth. Moreover, TUDCA reversed the ROS accumulation induced by BOLD-100, confirming that ER stress regulates ROS levels. The accumulation of ROS upregulated the active forms of ATR and CHK1, suggesting the activation of the DNA damage repair pathway. Notably, the treatment of NAC abrogated the activation of ATR-CHK1 axis by BOLD-100-induced ROS accumulation. AZD6738 synergized with BOLD-100 in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, by suppressing BOLD-100-induced ATR phosphorylation.<br \/>Conclusion: GRP78 could serve as one of the potential therapeutic targets in PDAC. The combination of BOLD-100 and AZD6738 demonstrates a synergistic effect suggesting GRP78\/ATR dual targeting as a promising therapeutic option for patients with PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-05 Unfolded protein response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Reactive oxygen species,Pancreatic cancer,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The relatively unexplored dual-specificity phosphatase 12 (DUSP12) is an attractive target due to its zinc finger-like domain suggesting potential interactions with nucleic acids and ribonucleoproteins. This highly conserved enzyme plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis across eukaryotes. Importantly, cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage often coincides with alterations in ribosome biogenesis, a phenomenon termed nucleolar stress, linked to changes in the localization and activity of nucleophosmin (NPM) and p53 proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of public databases revealed elevated DUSP12 expression in glioblastoma samples compared to normal tissue, displaying strong positive correlations with p53 and NPM. While DUSP12 expression did not impact tumor progression in wild-type p53 patients, its lower expression was associated with increased tumor progression in p53-mutant cases, emphasizing the significance of p53 status in understanding DUSP12's roles in GBM. Gene ontology analysis of DUSP12-correlated genes in glioblastoma patients showed robust enrichment in biological processes like ribosome biogenesis, chromosome organization, cell cycle, and DNA repair, with a substantial number of nucleoplasmic and nucleolar proteins being recently identified by our group through mass spectrometry as DUSP12 partners in other tumor models. A substantial difference in DUSP12 protein levels between the GBM cell lines U87MG (wild-type p53) and U138MG (mutant p53) was observed, with the latter presenting higher levels of this phosphatase. Some biological responses of these cell lines were assessed after exposure to the topoisomerase inhibitors doxorubicin (DX) and camptothecin (CPT) through viability assays in adherent and spheroid cultures, &#947;H2AX foci formation, and ATM\/Chk2 activation, showing marginal differences between the cell lines. Notably, DX treatment displayed strong nucleolar stress features, such as alterations in the number and size of nucleoli observed by NPM subcellular distribution changes in both cell lines, and induction of p21 expression only in the p53-profficient U87MG. These alterations were accompanied by nuclear accumulation of DUSP12, underlining its potential regulatory role in this process. The knockdown of DUSP12 with specific siRNA led to a substantial decrease of the treatment responsiveness in U138MG, consistent with the lower levels of this phosphatase associated with a more aggressive phenotype in mutant p53 patients. In summary, DUSP12 emerges as a pivotal player in glioblastoma, influencing nucleolar stress dynamics and tumor aggressiveness, particularly in the context of p53 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,p53,Protein phosphatase,Nucleolar stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Despite its prevalence and the adverse impact on quality of life and survival rates, effective clinical treatments for cachexia remain elusive. This study aims to bridge this gap by employing innovative in vitro models to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cachexia and identify potential therapeutic targets. To enhance the relevance of cell culture models, modifications were introduced to replicate in vivo conditions, where the muscle is exposed to the ongoing kinetics of constant tumor secretion of active factors. Patient-derived PDAC cells were cultured in a dense 3D stiffness extracellular matrix (ECM) to mimic the hypoxic desmoplastic tumor microenvironment. The conditioned medium from prolonged cultured patient-derived organoids (PDOs) was then used to supplement C2C12-derived myotubes. The investigation focuses on dynamic adaptations in muscle fiber type and metabolism when exposed to tumor paracrine factors. Metabolomic investigations of PDO-conditioned medium (PDO CM) on myotubes revealed distinct metabolic differences compared to non-treatment controls. Discriminatory metabolites included those associated with glycolysis, lipid, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism. PDO CM induced a significant shift in muscle fiber type from slow-twitch to fast-twitch phenotypes, accompanied by de novel expression of embryonic and neonatal Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC) isoforms. Fast fiber (F59) staining also confirmed the protein expression. Concurrently, PGC-1a, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, significantly decreased, along with reduced ATP and Mito tracker staining, indicating a metabolic switch under the influence of tumor paracrine factors. Metabolome results on C2C12 myotubes treated with PDO CM also revealed significantly changed ABC transporter-related pathways, an adaptive process required to optimize substrate use under the influence of tumor secretome. However, the genes involved in the proteasome degradation process, such as MAFbx and MuRF1, did not show altered expression. The establishment of an in vitro cachexia model, focusing on changes in energy metabolism and utilizing muscle fiber type alterations as markers, will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer-associated cachexia. The insights gained may pave the way for identifying potential therapeutic targets to mitigate muscle wasting in PDAC patients and improve overall outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Metabolism,Organoids,Energy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

This process is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), known for its prevalence and aggressiveness, often encounters hypoxic microenvironments. Mic19, a core protein of the mitochondrial cristae membrane, plays vital roles in maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. However, its involvement in mitophagy in hypoxic NSCLC and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately explored.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: NSCLC cells were cultured under conditions with 1% O2 oxygen concentration to simulate a hypoxic microenvironment. Protein expression levels of Mic19 were analyzed using Western Blot and immunofluorescence (IF). Cellular proliferation and metastasis capability were assessed through CCK8 and transwell experiments. Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to validate the interaction between Mic19 and key mitophagy regulatory proteins. IF, confocal microscopy, ATP measurement, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial membrane potential, and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess the formation of mitochondrial cristae and the level of mitophagy.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: In hypoxic conditions, Mic19 exhibited up-regulation in NSCLC cells. Subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed Mic19's pivotal role in promoting the growth and metastasis of lung cancer cell lines. Through clinical data analysis, Mic19 emerged as an independent prognostic indicator for NSCLC. Inhibition of Mic19 expression exacerbated the disruption of mitochondrial morphology and structure in lung cancer cells, accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial cristae. Notably, Mic19 expression closely correlated with ATP and OCR production in tumor cells. Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential and transmission electron microscopy revealed Mic19 as a critical downstream target of hypoxia, mediating mitophagy. Overall, these findings not only underscore the significance of Mic19 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics but also highlight its multifaceted role in tumor progression, positioning Mic19 as a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: This study provides novel insights into the mechanistic understanding of hypoxia-induced mitophagy in NSCLC, emphasizing the regulatory role of Mic19.

RSO-021 (thiostrepton or TS) is a redox-active drug that inhibits PRX3&#8217;s peroxidase activity via covalent adduction of its active site peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues, forming an irreversible crosslink across the protein dimer. Covalent inhibition of PRX3 results in tumor cell death due to a diminished ability to remove high levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells. To better understand the mechanism underpinning sensitivity and resistance, TS-tolerant human mesothelioma cell lines were generated under constant TS pressure and subjected to a drug-screen comprising chemotherapeutic agents, metabolic inhibitors, ROS modulating agents and ferroptosis-inducing compounds, to identify synergistic interactions compared with TS- sensitive cell lines. Erastin, an SLC7A11 inhibitor exhibited the greatest synergy when combined with TS, potentiated PRX3 covalent crosslinking and cellular ROS levels. Synergy with TS was enhanced by cystine depletion and could be phenocopied by siRNA knockdown of SLC7A11. SLC7A11 was up-regulated in TS-tolerant cells and resistance could be overcome with erastin. TS-tolerant cell lines have significantly reduced glutathione levels and slowed proliferation. Ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 did not inhibit TS or TS in combination with erastin. In summary, SLC7A11 up-regulation confers tolerance to TS through a mechanism involving a cysteine-dependent modulation of the redox state independent of canonical ferroptosis, that can be overcome by the addition of an SLC7A11 inhibitor. The correlation between SLC7A11 with response to TS in a 33-patient primary mesothelioma explant co-clinical trial, and patients enrolled into the MITOPE phase 1\/2 trial will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelioma,Oxidative stress,Mitochondria,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

During metastatic process in blood circulation, cancer cells lose the interaction with extracellular matrix and encounter the anoikis stress, resulting in successfully extravasate and form micrometastasis in distal organs. However, most patients develop chemo-drug resistance during the metastatic recurrence which leading to poor prognosis. Thus, it is a pressing matter to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer metastasis and the behaviors of the post-chemotherapy treated HNSCC cells. Our previous studies suggest that growth factor signaling stimulated HNSCC cells metastasis by the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3). Moreover, recent findings also reveal that chemotherapy mediated oxidative stress induce PTX3 expression and poor progression. Here, we raise the hypothesis that the expression of PTX3 through stress signal may promote cancer cells against from anoikis and promote the post-chemotherapeutic survival. The first, we identified that the secondary messenger-reactive oxygen species (ROS) dominate the gene activation of PTX3 by spheroid culture and platium-based agents&#8217; treatment. The ROS scavenger, NAC, inhibited cisplatin (CDDP)-induced PTX3 expression and rescue the cell viability by decreasing the ROS level. The oxidative stress inducer-H2O2 treatment also verify the PTX3 expression through AKT and NF-&#954;B pathways. In addition, both the spheroid selection and CDDP-induced PTX3 regulated the EMT phenotype and further strengthen the growth factor signaling. In addition, we found that PTX3 also regulate the survival during spheroid selection and drug treatment. The post-selected cells also exhibit the unique glycosylated modification on PTX3. Disrupted the PTM modification of PTX3 could inhibit the spheroid survival and cell invasion. The animal studies revealed that both spheroid selection and CDDP-treated HNSCC cells had stronger extravasation ability than parental cells in NOD-SCID mice. Depletion of PTX3 also repressed the HNSCC cells extravasation ability. The results indicate that PTX3 were essential for oxidative stress-induced tumor metastasis and recurrence. It also speculates that the combination of antioxidants and PTX3 antibody may prevent tumor metastatic recurrence after chemotherapy in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cisplatin,Metastasis,Reactive oxygen species,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.-W.

Hypoxic stress induces the activation of various factors, such as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which facilitate cellular adaptation and promote tumorigenesis. Given the complexity of this mechanism, identifying novel targets that sensitize hypoxic tumors to therapy could have significant clinical impact. Here we show that the pro-metastatic BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) transcription factor is prolyl-hydroxylated by the HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase (PHD), similar to HIFs, in an oxygen-dependent manner. We describe two major prolyl hydroxylation sites in BACH1 and demonstrate that prolyl hydroxylation increases protein turnover and decreases DNA binding in normoxia. We further demonstrate HIF-independent induction of BACH1 within multiple TNBC (Triple-Negative Breast Cancer) cell lines and patient-derived organoids under hypoxic conditions. Utilizing ChIP-seq, bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics across diverse BACH1 knockout tumor models, our study revealed that BACH1 selectively and directly modulates the transcriptional response associated with hypoxia and stress in TNBC.

It is highly resistant to its current standard-of-care regimen, which includes surgical resection followed by adjuvant ionizing radiation and temozolomide. Therapy resistance can be attributed to the abundance of genomic alterations in GBM tumors that evolve over time, which contribute to intra-and inter-tumoral heterogeneities that render targeted therapies as inadequate treatment options. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for effective therapies targeting primary and recurrent GBM. Here, we investigated the impact of ionizing radiation on the transcriptome of patient derived GBM tumor spheres to identify key alterations and biological pathways involved in therapy resistance.<br \/><u>Materials and methods:<\/u> We acquired four independent human GBM tumor sphere cell lines, which were derived from patients and cultured in serum-free media. Tumor spheres were treated with either a sham radiation or a single dose of 10Gy. Using poly-A enrichment whole transcriptome sequencing, we evaluated transcriptional alterations occurring in GBM tumors spheres at 96h post-radiation. To do so, we performed differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify top differentially expressed genes and significant changes in biological phenomena. Additionally, we evaluated the cell viability response of these GBM tumor spheres to radiation.<br \/><u>Results and discussion:<\/u> PCA analysis of the four human GBM tumor sphere cell lines demonstrates that cell type has a substantial impact on variation among samples compared to non-irradiated and irradiated treatment conditions. Upon analysis of genes in common that are either upregulated or downregulated followed by GSEA, we identified enrichment of genes associated with inflammatory responses and ferroptosis repression (e.g., NUPR1, PTGS1, AOX1), and depletion of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (e.g., INSIG1, PLA2G3, ACAT2). Furthermore, the GBM tumor sphere cell viability responses allowed us to stratify our models into radiosensitive and radioresistant subgroups.<br \/><u>Conclusion:<\/u> Radiosensitive human GBM tumor spheres exhibit transcriptional alterations in genes linked to inflammation and fatty acid metabolism to a greater extent compared to radioresistant tumor spheres. Our study characterizes the radiation response of patient derived GBM models, which is to be leveraged for combating therapeutic resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Radiation,Lipid metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The ISR is mediated by a family of four eIF2 kinases that each sense distinct cellular stresses. Activation of the eIF2 kinases results in reprogrammed gene expression through translational and transcriptional mechanisms that help prevent stress damage. Previously, we reported that prostate cancer (PCa) cells rely on GCN2 eIF2 kinase for maintenance of amino acid (AA) homeostasis to sustain growth (Cordova et al., 2022 <i>eLife<\/i> 11:e81083). GCN2 inhibition through pharmacological or genetic means results in decreased expression of AA transporters, depletion of intracellular AAs, and reduced growth of PCa cells in culture and mouse xenograft models. Although loss of GCN2 results in a significant reduction in PCa cell growth, minimal cell death is observed. We hypothesize that loss of GCN2 in PCa cells results in vulnerabilities that can be exploited and targeted to induce cell death. To optimize GCN2-targeted therapies for PCa, we utilized a targeted CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screen in castration-resistant 22Rv1 cells with functional wild type (WT) GCN2 or those with it deleted (GCN2 KO). The CRISPRi screen was performed in cells grown in culture or grown as tumor xenografts in mice and featured a guide library targeting genes that encode druggable targets, including kinases, phosphatases, and metabolic enzymes. While reduced expression of 152 genes was synthetically lethal with loss of GCN2 in the <i>in vitro <\/i>screen, more genes (202) were synthetically lethal with loss of GCN2 <i>in vivo<\/i>. Of note, reduced expression of many metabolic enzymes was synthetically lethal with GCN2 ablation only in the <i>in vivo<\/i> screen, potentially due to the abundance of nutrients in standard culture media. A group of six metabolism-related genes, identified as hits in the <i>in vivo <\/i>screen and targets of FDA-approved drugs, were selected for follow-up studies. One of these metabolic enzymes was GART, a trifunctional enzyme that carries out 3 of the 10 enzymatic steps in <i>de novo<\/i> purine biosynthesis. Based on our findings showing that GCN2 maintains AA levels to support nucleotide pools in PCa cells, we initially focused on this critical enzyme. Inhibition of GART using antifolates, including the FDA-approved Pemetrexed, resulted in minimal cell death of parental and GCN2 KO PCa cells cultured in standard culture media. However, when cultured in reduced nutrient media that better mimicked reduced nutrient availability <i>in <\/i>vivo, GART inhibition resulted in selective death of GCN2 KO cells. Our CRISPRi screening strategy uncovers new vulnerabilities in GCN2-inhibited PCa cells and reveals a general strategy to identify actionable targets with the potential to combine with GCN2 inhibitors for the treatment of PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Integrated Stress Response,GCN2,Purine Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Various factors in TIME, such as low pH and hypoxia, cause Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ERS). Immune cells exposed to ERS lack antigen presentation, exhibit a suppressor phenotype, and can initiate apoptosis. Therefore, relieving ERS can benefit immune surveillance and response to immunotherapy. Our research is focused on tumor-immune cells interaction, specifically in ovarian and renal cancers. We conducted in vitro co-cultures of these cancer cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and manipulated ERS using a well-established ERS inducer tunicamycin and a chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). We then employed various techniques such as MTT, RT-qPCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, scratch wound assay, and 3D co-cultures to analyze cellular viability, gene expression, protein levels of ERS markers (e.g., BiP, CHOP, PERK), immune cell activity (e.g., IL-2, INF&#947;, FoxP3, PD-1), migration, invasiveness, interaction, spheroid formation, and immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, we examined ERS and immune profiles in tumor samples from patients with ovarian and renal cancer who underwent conventional therapy or immunotherapy.Relieving ERS increased the infiltration of PBMC into tumor spheroids and reduced the expression of BiP and PERK in PBMC. In vitro, the viability of ovarian and renal cancer cells increased when cultured alone after ERS alleviation. However, when co-cultured with PBMC, their viability decreased, indicating enhanced immune cell response. Additionally, the growth and migration of ovarian and renal cancer cells were limited in these co-cultures, along with increased expression of BiP and CHOP and an elevated CHOP\/BiP ratio. We connected these findings to the molecular background of ERS in patient samples and observed a positive correlation between a favorable clinical outcome, higher lymphocyte infiltration at the tumor site, and increased levels of BiP and CHOP in cancer cells. We further applied these results to OC and RCC in vivo syngeneic mouse models, currently with very promising outcomes.Based on these results we expect ERS alleviation as a suitable approach to improving the survival and effectiveness of immune cell populations within hostile tumor-induced microenvironment with positive effects on anticancer immunotherapy. <i>\u0009Supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, grant nr.

Elevated levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NRF2), a redox balance-maintaining transcription factor, have been linked to enhanced tumor growth and therapy resistance. This study investigates the potential role of NRF2 in hypoxia-inducible factor-2&#945; (HIF-2&#945;) regulation in cancers. First, in a model of a 72-hour hypoxic incubation, chronic hypoxia led to CSC characteristics, including increased expression of KLF4 and OCT4, heightened cancer migration, and spheroid growth, which are associated with HIF-2&#945; accumulation. NRF2 inhibition mitigated these effects, while NRF2 activation enhanced chronic hypoxia-induced CSC traits. Mechanistically, NRF2\/miR181a-2 signaling emerged as a regulator of HIF-2&#945;-mediated CSC phenotypes in chronic hypoxic conditions. Second, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), characterized by pVHL gene mutation and constitutive HIF-2&#945; elevation, the role of NRF2 in aggressive cancer phenotypes was explored.

Under low oxygen condition, tumor cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming, largely mediated through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), triggering adaptive response pathways. We recently demonstrated a significant role of MYB in hypoxic survival of pancreatic cancer cells by facilitating adaptive changes in cellular metabolism in collaboration with HIF1&#945;. Here, we employed genome-wide deep sequencing approaches to study the impact of hypoxia on transcriptional reprogramming of pancreatic cancer cells and investigate the role of MYB in the hypoxia-dependent processes. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in pancreatic cancer cells subjected to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) and associated with multiple adaptive response pathways. Specifically, we found that pathways related to autophagy, cell migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, endocytosis, cytoskeleton reorganization were induced, while those associated with RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication and cell cycle were suppressed. To analyze the role of MYB in these adaptive responses, we compared the relative abundance of transcripts in MYB-overexpressing control and MYB knockout (KO) pancreatic cancer cells when cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. We observed that the transcriptional output of MYB was drastically changed under hypoxia with a vast majority of genes being distinctly altered in response to the loss of MYB expression under normoxia and hypoxia. To examine if it resulted from altered genomic occupancy of MYB under normoxia and hypoxia, we compared MYB ChIP-seq peaks under these conditions. We observed a decrease in overall MYB-bound genomic regions under hypoxia despite the fact that we did not observe a decrease in nuclear MYB expression. More interestingly, the genomic occupancy of MYB shifted substantially from regions proximal to transcription start site to distal intergenic or intronic regions under hypoxia. Studies are currently underway to examine the mechanisms underlying the altered MYB genomic occupancy and its impact on adaptive physiological response of pancreatic cancer cells under hypoxia.

Despite the association of tumor necrosis and a poor prognosis in GBM, the mechanisms underlying tumor necrosis formation remain unclear, likely due to the lack of appropriate experimental models to examine the development of tumor necrosis. In our study, we developed mouse models with tumor necrosis by intracranially injecting human GBM cells expressing KRAS or PI3K active mutants into immunodeficient mice. Surprisingly, despite all tumors displayed similar sizes, the control tumors expressing an empty vector (EV) did not exhibit tumor necrosis. This intriguing observation led us to explore the potential role of KRAS and PI3K in promoting cell death within the tumor microenvironment. Ischemia, which is characterized by insufficient nutrients and hypoxia, is often found in GBM. Under an in vitro ischemia mimetic condition, we found that the KRAS or PI3K activated GBM cells showed more cell death compared to EV cells. Mechanistically, ischemia activates the p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway to induce cell death, a process further enhanced by KRAS or PI3K. Notably, we observed elevated expression of p-MK2 in the peri-necrotic areas of GBMs harboring KRAS or PI3K mutants compared to the cellular tumor zones. Moreover, we revealed that ischemia induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Among UPR-related molecules, KRAS and PI3K upregulate ERN1, which encodes the transmembrane protein kinase IRE1, in ischemic conditions. Inhibition of ERN1 not only prevented ischemia-induced cell death but also inhibited the p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 under ischemic conditions, a response that was prevented by inhibitors of p38 MAPK or MK2. Lastly, we found that ischemia induces ATP release and calreticulin exposure, indicating the cell death possessing certain immunogenic cell death features. In summary, our findings revealed a pivotal role of KRAS and PI3K in inducing cell death in the ischemic GBM tumor microenvironment through activating the IRE1-p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway. The cell death under this circumstance displays pro-inflammatory and immunogenic properties. Therefore, the IRE1-p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway may be exploited for the treatment of GBM in which RAS or PI3K is activated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,PI3K,Tumor necrosis,Ischemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The long-term survival rate for OCa is less than 20% after five years. Intra-tumoral and inter-tumoral heterogeneity is implicated in tumor resistance to conventional therapies and the unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Addressing these issues necessitates innovative therapies that target intrinsic common vulnerabilities within OCa. Recent studies have highlighted that high basal level of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in OCa as a critical vulnerability. We have identified a promising compound, ERX-208 that potently induces ERS in cancer cells. The objective of this study is to characterize the mechanisms and activity of ERX-208 using preclinical models.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The biological activity of ERX-208 was examined across 17 distinct OCa cells, representing 5 diverse OCa subtypes. Mechanistic studies utilized Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA-Seq analysis, and CRISPR\/Cas9 knockouts (KO). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity studies were performed on C57BL\/6 mice. Comprehensive preclinical assessments were carried out through cell line-derived xenografts (CDXs), patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), organoids (PDOs) and explants (PDEs).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> ERX-208 demonstrated an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of approximately 50-100 nM inducing ERS and reducing cell viability in OCa cells. Conversely, normal ovarian surface epithelial cells exhibited minimal effects from ERX-208. <i>In vitro<\/i> experiments revealed strong ERX-208-induced apoptosis in OCa cell lines. Mechanistic studies employing RNA sequencing, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR, confirmed activation of ERS pathways observed as early as 5 hours post-ERX-208 treatment. Our studies identified LIPA as a potential target, and KO of LIPA significantly diminished ERX-208 activity. Moreover, LIPA KO substantially impeded <i>in vivo<\/i> OCa tumor growth. ERX-208 up to a dose of 25 mg\/kg showed no observable organ toxicity and had no effect on the mice's body weight. Dose range studies identified 10 mg\/kg intraperitoneal as the minimal effective dose, achieving more than 50% tumor reduction. In preclinical models, ERX-208 inhibited the growth of OCa CDXs, PDXs, and ex vivo PDEs and PDO&#8217;s. IHC analyses indicated reduced proliferation (Ki-67) and increased activation of ERS markers, such as GRP78 and p-PERK.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Collectively, our findings underscore the preclinical promise of ERX-208 as a potential therapeutic agent for treating OCa.

Hypoxia is also associated with PCa progression and treatment resistance. Modulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism seems to be one way how tumor cells adapt to hypoxia. However, not much is known about lipidomic profiles in hypoxic condition in advanced PCa and treatment resistance. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on treatment-resistant PCa cells and investigate alterations in the lipidome under hypoxic conditions.<br \/>Material and Methods: Testosterone (T)-sensitive, T-independent (castration-resistant), and enzalutamide (enza)-resistant VCaP PCa cells were cultured for three days under hypoxia (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>)<sub> <\/sub>and compared with cells grown under normoxia (21% O<sub>2<\/sub>). Additionally, cells were treated with the drugs SREBP-inhibitor fatostatin and mevalonate-pathway inhibitor simvastatin to examine the effects of modulating lipid and cholesterol production on hypoxia responses. Relative cell growth by crystal violet staining and live\/dead cell ratio were evaluated after each treatment. Intracellular lipidome was measured using liquid chromatography coupled with MS\/MS method. Random forest classification was used of the selection of the lipids. Based on the classification, concentration differences between the groups were calculated.<br \/>Results: Growth of the T-sensitive and castration-resistant cells was decreased under hypoxia compared to normoxia. However, enza-resistant cells tolerated hypoxic conditions. Lipid-modifying drugs exhibited similar inhibitory effects on cell growth in both normoxia and hypoxia. Based on live\/dead cell ratio, hypoxia induced cell death. Lipidome profiles varied markedly by oxygen content and cellular treatment resistance profile. Simvastatin treatment also influenced lipidome profiles.<br \/>Conclusions: Enza-resistant advanced PCa cells tolerated hypoxic conditions better compared to T-sensitive and T-independent cells. Lipidome was different between cell lines but also in hypoxia compared to normoxia, supporting its importance for PCa cells under varying conditions. Interference with lipid metabolism leads to growth inhibition regardless of hypoxia. These findings could be used in identifying potential markers for predicting or delaying disease progression in advanced PCa. Future studies should explore the efficacy of various lipidome-modulating drugs in delaying disease progression in PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-01 Hypoxia,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Lipid metabolism,Treatment resistance,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) is a key factor in regulation of ferroptosis through multiple pathways. Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), a key oncogene of dedifferentiated LPS (DDLPS), is one of the negative regulators of the TP53. In our previous study, we had showed that nutlin-3, a MDM2 inhibitor, could exert synergistic cytotoxicity with ferroptosis-inducing agent (erastin and RSL3) on DDLPS in a sequential manner, possibly through upregulation of SLC3A2 with altered cystine\/glutamate exchange (AACR Annual Meeting 2023 abstract#4777). Mutated in Ataxia-Telangiectasia gene (ATM) is a critical gene in DNA damage response. ATM could regulate ferroptosis either directly through altered iron pool, or indirectly through activating TP53 by phosphorylation of MDM2. In this study, we explored the role of ATM and MDM2-TP53 pathway, as well as interaction between them, in regulation of ferroptosis of DDLPS. We also studied the potential role of combination of DNA damaging agent (DDA), such as cisplatin, with ferroptosis-inducing agents in the treatment of DDLPS.<br \/>Methods: We explored the possible synergistically cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and ferroptosis-inducing agents in DDLPS cell lines. We also investigated the role of ATM in this synergistic effect by using siRNA or ATM inhibitor. In addition, we used cystine uptake assay (measurement of altered cystine\/glutamate exchange) and iron level assay (measurement of labile iron pool) to study the functional change responsible to ferroptosis-inducing effect of cisplatin. Finally, we used immunoblotting study to reveal the potential molecular mechanism responsible for synergistic effect of cisplatin and ferroptosis-inducing agent.<br \/>Results: Cisplatin and erastin showed synergistic cytotoxicity in DDLPS cell line, most likely through ferroptosis-inducing effect. Cisplatin could activate ATM, with resultant dissociation of TP53 and MDM2. Cisplatin could exert ferroptosis-inducing effect through down-regulation SLC7A11A with resultant decrease cystine uptake, as well as increase labile iron pool. ATM inhibition could offset the ferroptosis-inducing effect of cisplatin by reversing both effects.<br \/>Conclusion: Modulation of ferroptosis is a potential treatment strategy in DDLPS. MDM2-TP53 pathway and ATM as well as interaction of both may play an important role in regulation of ferroptosis in DDLPS. Combination of DDA, such as cisplatin, and ferroptosis-inducing agents is a potential strategy in DDLPS treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB04-02 Oxidative stress,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATM,MDM2,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.-C.
