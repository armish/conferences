[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Understanding the molecular underpinnings of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) has strong potential for clinical impact, given the unmet need for this rare cancer. vSCCs have two main etiologies, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or skin conditions such as lichen sclerosis. Clinically, few treatment options with limited efficacy are available for recurrent vSCCs and large whole transcriptome disease subtyping studies are limited due to the rarity of this cancer type. Here, we present a whole transcriptome subtyping study of 244 vSCC clinical samples with DNA genomic profiling. Furthermore, we compared vSCCs to other SCC disease subtypes (pan-SCC), including lung, esophageal, skin, urothelial, anal, and head and neck (HN). Our goal was to gain novel insights into the molecular landscape of vSCCs to inform new routes of therapy.<br \/>Methods: Deidentified records of SCC patients were selected from the Tempus clinico-genomic database. The vSCC cohort was predominantly composed of, but not exclusively, naive or pre-treatment primary tissue. The pan-SCC cohort was limited to randomly sampled primary pre-treatment female samples with paired RNA and DNA sequencing. To perform vSCC subtyping, we used bulk RNA-seq and clustered the samples using FastPG-CC, an internally developed consensus-clustering extension of FastPG, a graph-based parallelized clustering tool. We next performed differential expression, pathway analysis, and cell type abundance estimation.<br \/>Results: Unbiased gene expression clustering analysis identified three vSCCs clusters; an HPV+ cluster (HPV+, 32% of vSCC samples), HPV- cluster (HPV-, 33%), and an intermediate cluster which contained both HPV+ and HPV- samples (Mix, 35%). The HPV- cluster was enriched for TP53 and TERT promoter mutations, EMT and tumor microenvironment gene expression-derived pathways, and was most similar to HPV- oral HN tumors. The HPV+ cluster was enriched with PIK3CA mutations, cell cycle gene expression and was most similar to other HPV+ SCC samples, including cervical, anal, and HN. The Mix cluster was enriched for neutrophils, fatty acid metabolism and was most similar to skin SCC.<br \/>Conclusions: We performed a multi-modal molecular subtyping analysis on a large cohort of vSCCs and identified three molecular subtypes, which enabled us to identify heterogeneity within vSCC, and observe that a subset of vSCCs share features with SCC tumor types for which there are emerging therapy options. Thus, this approach identifies a subset vSCCs that may be responsive to existing SCC therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression profiling,Gynecological cancers: other,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), we have addressed this challenge by developing our own open source institutional trial matching software called MatchMiner. MatchMiner algorithmically matches patient genomic and clinical data with PM trial eligibility data. PM trial eligibility data is manually curated into a human- and computer-readable structured format called clinical trial markup language (CTML), for trial matching with DFCI&#8217;s institutional genomic assay OncoPanel. MatchMiner has 2 main modes of clinical use: (1) patient-centric, where clinicians can search for trial matches for individual patients and (2) trial-centric, where trial staff can identify patients that match their trial&#8217;s genomic eligibility. Thus far, more than 300 DFCI patients have enrolled onto trials facilitated by MatchMiner.<br \/>In its current implementation, MatchMiner uses limited clinical data (gender, age, and cancer type) to match patients to trials. Although this limited data gives clinicians a head start on assessing available trial options, incorporating more clinical data into MatchMiner would provide more precise trials options and reduce additional work to assess patient eligibility. Here, we investigated clinical trial eligibility criteria that were available for trials at DFCI with the goal of improving specificity of trial matching for MatchMiner. We attempted to answer 2 main research questions 1) what categories of clinical data comprise the eligibility criteria for precision medicine trials at DFCI and 2) which categories are most relevant for trial matching?<br \/>We first investigated the clinical eligibility criteria across several PM lung cancer trials. After extracting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the protocol documents, we found criteria could be classified into 10 distinct categories. The most common categories making up almost half of the eligibility criteria were &#8220;Prior Therapy&#8221; and &#8220;Prior or Concurrent Non-Cancerous Disease&#8221;. Within some categories, we found it appropriate to also make subcategories to make our analysis more informative such as &#8220;Prior Therapy, Surgery&#8221; or &#8220;Disease Status, CNS&#8221;. We next broadened our search to non-lung trials to see if criteria was consistent across other cancer types. We found similar proportions of clinical criteria for the non-lung trials compared to the lung trials, but did find some additional subcategories. Overall, having similar categories of criteria across trials suggests that common clinical data could be used for many different PM trials. Currently, we are investigating which categories are most relevant for trial matching and the use of AI for structuring unstructured clinical data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Molecular targets,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Due to their rarity and heterogeneity, it is challenging for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of sarcoma. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based comprehensive cancer genome profiling (CGP) has increasingly become a routine practice for patients with solid cancers worldwide. To collect genomic information and clinical characteristics of patients who underwent CGP, the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) has also been established since 2018 in Japan. Almost all the clinical and genomic data of patients who received CGP tests the had been collected in C-CAT. Here, we examined the utility of CGP test in the diagnosis and treatment of STS using this nation-wide database.<br \/>Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the records of patients with STS who received F1CDx between 2019 and 2022 and registered in C-CAT. This assay carries 324 genes and determines nucleotide substitutions, insertions\/deletions, and copy number (CN) alterations of 309 genes, fusions of 36 genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). High TMB (TMB&#8209;H) was defined as a TMB value &#62;10 muts\/Mb. Ranges of the MSI score were assigned MSI-High (MSI-H) or microsatellite stable (MSS).<br \/>Results: From 2019 to 2022, 1387 patients with STS were registered in C-CAT. The histological types included leiomyosarcoma in 357 patients, dedifferentiated liposarcoma in 178 patients, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in 82 patients, and the others. The most commonly altered genes included TP53, CDKN2A, Rb1, and CDKN2B. Among the 1387 cases, we observed 110 fusion events in 108 cases (7.7%), and 2 cases showed 2 types of fusion transcripts. Fifteen (2.8%) patients were re-classified based on the detection of highly histology-specific translocations. Among them, an initial diagnosis of sarcoma NOS was classified as Ewing Sarcoma (<i>EWSR1-FLI1<\/i> in 2 patients),<i> NTRK<\/i>-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm (NTRK fusion in 3 patients), <i>CIC<\/i>-rearranged sarcoma (<i>CIC-DUX4<\/i> in 3 patients), and<i> <\/i>sarcoma with <i>BCOR <\/i>genetic alterations (<i>BCOR-ZC3H7B<\/i> in 1 patient) as these gene fusions were identified. Druggable gene alterations was detected in 347 patients (25%) and 55 patients (4%) who received genotype-matched therapy. In 38 patients for whom the effect of treatment could be evaluated, complete response and partial response were achieved in 2 (5%) and 10 (26%) patients, respectively.<br \/>Discussion:<b> <\/b>In conclusion, the comprehensive genomic profiling test appears to be an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,sarcoma,Comprehensive Genomic Profiling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

In Japan, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) tests have been covered by insurance since June 2019. 99.7% of the CGP data under insurance coverage have been registered with the nationwide database: Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT). C-CAT data include CGP test results and clinical information such as companion diagnostic results for <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> as well as therapeutic history. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of CGP tests for identifying actionable genomic alterations in real-world lung cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Among the 3,240 lung cancer patients registered in the C-CAT database by September 2023, 2,076 non-small cell lung cancer cases were tested using tissue specimens and analyzed retrospectively. The analysis was based on the levels of evidence defined by C-CAT. Level A indicated approved drugs for the particular cancer type, while level C indicated approved drugs or presence of positive clinical trials regardless of cancer type. Level F indicated that the genomic alteration was an oncogenic marker.<br \/>Results: The cases were divided into two groups: 335 cases with known genomic alterations with positive results from companion diagnostic tests or use of specific inhibitors and 1,741 cases without. Genomic alterations with level A, A to C, and A to F were identified in 430 cases (24.7%), 1174 cases (67.4%), and 1718 cases (98.7%) with unknown genomic alterations, respectively. Genomic alterations with level A included rearrangement of <i>RET<\/i> (43 of 1741 cases, 2.5%), <i>ALK<\/i> (14 cases, 0.8%), <i>ROS1<\/i> (8 cases, 0.5%), and <i>NTRK1<\/i> (2 cases, 0.1%), and mutations of <i>EGFR<\/i> (124 cases, 7.1%), <i>MET<\/i> (38 cases, 2.2%), <i>ERBB2<\/i> (122 cases, 7.0%), <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> (66 cases, 3.8%), and <i>BRAF V600E<\/i> (15 cases, 0.9%). Genomic alterations with level C included mutations in <i>KRAS<\/i> (185 cases, 10.6%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (99 cases, 5.7%), <i>BRAF<\/i> (55 cases, 3.2%), and <i>PTEN<\/i> (32 cases, 1.8%) and amplifications in <i>ERBB2<\/i> (147 cases, 8.4%) and <i>MET<\/i> (68 cases, 3.9%). Among cases with known genomic alterations, <i>ALK<\/i> and <i>ROS1<\/i> fusion genes were not detected in 11 of 49 (22.4%) and 17 of 46 (37.0%), while <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation was not detected in 11 of 218 (5.0%) and 3 of 4 cases (75.0%), respectively. The detection rate of fusion genes was lower than that of mutated genes (70.5% vs 93.7%, p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: In non-small cell lung cancer patients with unknown driver genes, driver oncogenes with corresponding approved therapy were found in a quarter of the patients.

Standard of care for NSCLC includes immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and\/or platinum-based chemotherapy (CT). However, therapy success is limited with up to 70% of patients not responding to ICI. Mechanisms of resistance across treatments are not fully understood. In this study, we explore real-world data to characterize molecular and genomic changes in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI, ICI+CT, or CT.<br \/>Methods: Stage III\/IV NSCLC patients receiving first-line (1L) ICI, ICI+CT, or CT were identified from Tempus Labs, Inc.&#8217;s de-identified, multimodal real-world database. Patients&#8217; solid tissue biopsies taken pre- or post-1L underwent next generation sequencing with the Tempus xT assays (DNAseq of 648 genes at 500x coverage and whole transcriptome RNAseq). Patients&#8217; clinical and outcome data were abstracted from electronic health records. We analyzed changes in gene expression, pathway enrichment, estimated immune cell components, and somatic mutations in responders (complete\/partial response) and non-responders (progression\/stable disease) upon 1L treatment.<br \/>Results: 1L non-responders (70%, 51%, and 47%) were identified across cohorts (143 ICI, 764 ICI+CT, and 228 CT, respectively). 58% of pre-1L biopsies were taken from distal metastatic tissues. Distinct pathways altered post-1L include the downregulated E2F target pathway in CT cohort, and upregulated TNF&#945;\/NF&#954;B signaling and the hypoxia and protein secretion pathways in ICI cohort. Significant (FDR &#60; 0.05) augmented expression was observed for 90, 23, and 65 genes in non-responders vs. responders post ICI, ICI+CT, and CT, respectively. RNAseq deconvolution reveals decreased plasma and CD4+ activated T cell fraction in metastatic biopsies, whereas increased CD4+ activated T cell and monocyte fraction was seen after treatment only in ICI cohort. Genes with oncogenic driver mutations reported in NSCLC were detected including TP53 (68%), KRAS (30%), STK11 (13%), EGFR (11%), CDKN2A (10%), KEAP1 (9%), and NF1 (7%). Of the 250 mutated genes, 72 (29%) were commonly not detected post-1L, whereas 38, 3, and 8 unique genes with loss of detectable mutations were identified post-1L of ICI, ICI+CT, and CT, respectively. Since loss of detectable mutations is a sign of loss of subpopulations of cancer cells hosting such mutations that succumb to therapy, these genetic mutations could be used to select patients who can benefit from such therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Distinct molecular characteristics including tumor immune components and genomic alterations are associated with 1L response in advanced NSCLC. Real-world data analyses provide opportunity to explore distinct mechanisms of therapy resistance and identify potential biomarkers of therapy response for further validation in clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Somatic mutations,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Using the Center for Advanced Cancer Genomics and Therapeutics (C-CAT) database, we investigated the incidence of PGV and PGPV detected by CGP tests in Japanese lung cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: Among 3,240 lung cancer cases registered in C-CAT between June 2019 and August 2023, 321 were tumor\/normal paired NCC Oncopanel (NOP), 773 were FoundationOne Liquid CDx (F1L), and 2,145 were tumor-only FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx). We analyzed cancer susceptibility genes in accordance with the national guideline. In F1L and F1CDx, PGPV was determined based on variant allele frequency (VAF) and medical history. Differences between groups in the detection of PGV and PGPV were tested using chi-squared test, and differences in age were tested using t-test.<br \/>Results: The incidence of PGV in NOP and PGPV in F1L and F1CDx were 4\/321 (1.2%), 36\/773 (4.7%), and 141\/2145 (6.6%), respectively (NOP vs F1L vs F1CDx; p = 0.001 NOP vs F1L; p = 0.006, NOP vs F1CDx; p &#60; 0.001, F1L vs F1CDx;p=0.190). The 4 PGVs detected by NOP were in the <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>MSH6<\/i>, and <i>TP53<\/i> genes. Notably, two out of four patients were in their 30s while the other two were in their 70s. In the F1L dataset, 36 patients (4.7%) had PGPV: 8 patients (1.0%) had <i>PALB2<\/i>, 6 patients (0.8%) had <i>BRCA2<\/i>, and 4 patients (0.5%) had <i>CHEK2<\/i> variants. In the F1CDx dataset, 141 had PGPV: 19 patients (0.9%) each had <i>BRCA1<\/i> or <i>BRCA2<\/i> variants and 18 patients (0.8%) had <i>PALB2<\/i> variant. There was no significant age difference between PGPV(-) and PGPV(+) patients (F1L:63.3 vs. 62.4 years; p = 0.938, F1CDx: 65.5 vs 65.0 years; p = 0.749). Most cases with PGV or PGPV were non-small cell lung cancer: 4\/4 in NOP, 34\/36 in F1L, and 110\/141 in F1CDx.<br \/>Discussion: The incidence of PGV in lung cancer patients was at least 1% and found in both younger and older patients. A circulating tumor DNA panel and a tumor-only tissue panel detected PGPVs at a significantly higher rate than detection of true PGVs by tumor\/normal paired tissue panel, suggesting the use of tumor\/normal paired panels may mitigate the burden of both patients and clinicians with concerns from false positive PGPV. The majority of detected PGV\/PGPV were in homologous recombination repair genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Gene profiling,Cancer genomics,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

A third of these patients would not qualify for genetic testing based on current guidelines. In South East Asia, despite increased use of outsourced genomic profiling platforms, there are no published studies exploring the prevalence of these potentially pathogenic germline variants (PPGV). Our study determined the prevalence of PPGVs among adult patients with solid malignancies who underwent liquid or tissue-based tumor genomic profiling in the Philippines.<br \/>Methods: Annotated reports of patients with solid cancers who underwent tumor genomic profiling using <i>FoundationOne <\/i>or<i> FoundationOne Heme<\/i>between January 2021 to July 2023 were reviewed (Ethical Board ID: SL-23143). PPGVs were identified according to recommendations from American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics and expert review. PPGV criteria include having a variant allele frequency of <u>&#62;<\/u>30% and were categorized as: 1) high penetrance gene (HP), founder variant (FV), or variant associated with clinical presentation (VA). Cross-checking the pathogenicity through <i>ClinVar<\/i> database was also done.<br \/>Results: Out of 446 patients, 13 PPGV variants were found in 50 (11.2%) patients at a median age of 60.5 years. Of these, 28 (54%) had high penetrance (<i>BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, RAD51C, RAD51D<\/i>), 24 (46%) patients had VA (<i>APC, SMAD4, CDH1, CDKN2A,<\/i><i>PTEN<\/i>) and two patients with lung cancer had a founder variant (<i>EGFR <\/i><i>p.Thr790Met<\/i>). PPGVs were primarily found in colorectal (42% of 50 patients with PPGVs), breast (16%), ovarian (6%) and lung (6%) cancer patients (p&#60;0.001). HP genes were mostly found in females (71.4%, p = 0.03), driven by <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> variants (15 females and 2 males).<br \/>Conclusions: The presence of PPGVs warrants formal genetic counselling and germline testing. Given the similar prevalence of PPGVs in this study compared with data from other countries, and the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of detecting incidental PPGVs, we underscore the need for cancer genetics to be incorporated into standard oncologic care in the Philippines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paula Isabel Gimena Franco<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Frances Victoria Que<sup><\/sup>, Jose Jasper Andal<sup><\/sup>, Daphne Ang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City, Philippines","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d9e595d2-7434-4b5a-8164-36666eb1ae83","ControlNumber":"395","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Understanding the molecular alterations that drive CRC is critical for improving patient outcomes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized CRC molecular profiling by simultaneous analysis of multiple genes with high accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of CRC formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples to identify highly frequent gene mutations and co-occurring genes in CRC.<br \/>Methods: FFPE samples from CRC patients tested from January 2020 to May 2023 were analyzed using NeoTYPE&#174; Colorectal Tumor Profile. This profile analyzes 44 biomarkers through a combination of NGS focusing on a panel of 36 genes known to be frequently mutated in CRC, as well as 3 FISH and 3 IHC biomarkers. Gene mutation frequency, co-occurring mutation genes and clinical significance were explored and analyzed. In addition, immunotherapy markers, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) were assessed.<br \/>Results: A total of 2,920 patients (1,577 men and 1,343 women) with CRC were included in this study. Average sequence coverage was 2386X with mean minor allelic frequency of 30%. A higher average number of variant allele frequency were observed in metastatic versus primary colorectal cancer (P &#60; .001). We found that APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA and ARID1A were the most frequently mutated genes. APC truncated mutation p. R1450* were the most common mutations. KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 missense mutations are the prevalent consequence. Notably, a subset of patients exhibited high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or TMB high, indicating potential eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In addition, we found APC mutations co-occurring with TP53 or KRAS mutations (p &#60;.001) in our cohort.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results provide insight into the genetic landscape of CRC and highlight the importance of understanding co-occurring mutations in this disease. Specifically, APC mutations frequently coincide with TP53 mutations, jointly contributing to the onset of CRC. TP53 often play a role in promoting genomic instability and evading mechanisms that regulate cell growth. The identification of highly frequent mutations and co-occurring genes may have important implications for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment approaches for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Cancer genetics,Colorectal cancer,TP53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

A recent analysis of RWE presented at ASCO reported a significant increase in relative frequency of RWE abstracts from 2011-2021[1]. We conducted a similar trend analysis of RWE presented at AACR and predictive factors associated with publication.<br \/>Methods: EMBASE was queried for abstracts presented at AACR 2013-2022, using terms related to study designs and methodologies that employ use of RWE. Details on study design, location, data source, patient number, cancer site, analytical approach, endpoints, and presentation type (oral vs. poster) were extracted and analyzed. Searches in Google Scholar identified published manuscripts associated with each abstract. The Cochran-Armitage trend test and Monte-Carlo estimation of the exact test were used to detect trends over time; p-values are provided for descriptive purposes. Relative risk ratios were calculated to determine statistically significant predictors of publication.<br \/>Results: Of 56,920 total abstracts presented at AACR from 2013-2022, 611 (1.1%) RWE abstracts were identified. The proportion of presented abstracts with RWE increased from 0.6% in 2013 to 2.0% in 2022 (p&#60;0.001). Among the RWE abstracts, use of electronic medical record (2013: 0% vs. 2022: 9.3%; p=0.002) and genomics databases (i.e., GENIE) (2013: 0% vs. 2022: 8.3%; p=0.006) increased over time. While majority of RWE abstracts were presented as posters (95.9%), the proportion of oral presentations increased in the last decade (2013: 0.0% vs. 2022: 3.7%; p=0.005). Abstracts with sample sizes &#60;500 decreased significantly over time (p=0.002); those with sample sizes 5,000-&#60;50,000 increased significantly over time (p=0.001). The proportion of abstracts including multiple cancer sites (vs. single-site) increased from 5.1% in 2013 to 20.4% in 2022 (p&#60;0.001). The most common cancer sites were lung, breast, and colorectal. Statistically significant factors associated with publishing an abstract into a manuscript included study sample size 500-&#60;5,000 or &#8805;100,000, inferential statistics (vs. descriptive), propensity score matching, and effectiveness or disease burden endpoints.Conclusion: RWE studies presented at AACR increased in the recent decade, with more robust study designs, incorporation of novel clinico-genomic databases such as GENIE, and advanced analytical approaches. These findings suggest the value of RWE has been increasingly recognized by the oncology research community and that RWE is being used to provide critical insights and inform patient care. Given FDA&#8217;s recent guidance on RWE to support regulatory decision-making, this trend will likely continue.<br \/>[1] Azad Fet al.

This retrospective cohort study included all patients in Ontario, Canada, who were diagnosed with SCLC between April 2010 and March 2018. Data were analyzed between June 2022 and July 2023. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to compare overall survival (OS) between patient cohorts stratified by disease stage, BM diagnosis, or first-line intracranial treatment modality.<br \/>Results: 8705 patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range 18-103). Median OS of all patients was 7.46 months (95% confidence interval, CI, 7.23-7.69). 32% (n=2686) of patients developed BM (synchronous, 43.7%; asynchronous, 56.3%) and had median OS of 9.76 months (95% CI, 9.36-10.22). 102, 1654, and 880 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and no treatment, respectively, for their BM in the first-line setting or after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). In propensity score-matched analyses, OS was equivocal between SRS- and WBRT-treated cohorts among patients who did not receive PCI (hazard ratio, HR, 1.18, 95% CI, 0.75-1.81) and those who received PCI prior to BM development (HR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.53-1.13).<br \/>Conclusions: Survival for patients with SCLC remains poor, and many patients present with BMs. With careful selection, patients with SCLC may benefit from SRS treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Brain metastasis,Radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Despite distinctive molecular characteristics of MIP, there is a research gap regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying micropapillary transformation and prognosis factors for micropapillary LUAD.<br \/>Methods: Surgically resected tumor samples from 101 patients with stage I-III LUAD and MIP components exceeding 30% were collected. The tumor samples were microdissected to separate MIP components from non-MIP components, and both fractions underwent RNA and DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES). The molecular profiles between MIP and non-MIP components, along with MIP-na&#239;ve LUAD tissues from an external cohort, were compared. Associations between molecular characteristics and recurrence-free survival were also assessed.<br \/>Results: The genomic landscapes of MIP and non-MIP components within tumor tissues featuring MIP patterns exhibited remarkable similarity. At the transcriptomic level, MIP components displayed elevated PRB4 expression (FDR &#60; 0.001), an up-regulated cell cycle pathway (P = 0.004), and reduced natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (P = 0.066). Nevertheless, in comparison to MIP-na&#239;ve LUAD tissues, the MIP components showed higher chromosomal instability (P &#60; 0.001) and revealed eighteen enriched somatic alterations, encompassing EGFR mutations, EGFR amplifications, and CDKN2A\/CDKN2B deletions, all linked to up-regulations in cell proliferation pathways and down-regulated immune pathways. In the context of MIP transformation, shared mutations were observed in 97.8% (91\/93) of patients between MIP and non-MIP components within the same tissues, suggesting a common origin. The subclonal fractions were comparable between paired MIP and non-MIP components, while a significant co-occurrence of EGFR amplification, CDKN2A deletion, and CDKN2B deletion was identified in MIP components. A comprehensive analysis combining differential gene expression and Cox analysis, employing a both-direction stepwise Akaike Information Criteria selection, identified the high expressions of five genes (<i>GALNT4<\/i>, <i>MIAT<\/i>, <i>FOSL1<\/i>, <i>LAT2<\/i>, <i>SMN2<\/i>) as adverse factors associated with the recurrence of micropapillary LUAD.<br \/>Conclusions: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the molecular characteristics and transformation mechanisms of micropapillary lung adenocarcinoma, employing microdissection techniques to investigate at both genomic and transcriptomic levels within a substantial cohort, providing insights for the precision medicine of this aggressive cancer subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Micropapillary pattern,Multiomics,Microdissection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.

Real-world data aids in validating and extending trial results, but can introduce biases that invalidate the causal interpretation. Here, we propose a robust statistical framework, which uses real-world EHR data to evaluate the efficacy of cancer treatments at both population and individual levels. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to deliver personalized insights in metastatic prostate cancer treatments.<br \/>Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of metastatic prostate cancer patients from a large academic medical center. We gathered demographic, comorbidity, cancer treatment, and outcome data from the EHR or natural language processing of clinician narratives, and social determinants of health from Census data. We used doubly robust machine learning with bootstrap standard errors to compute the ATE and personalized treatment estimates (PTEs), comparing the impact of ADT (androgen depravation therapy) + chemotherapy (ACT) and ADT + combination anti-androgen therapy (ACAT) on percentage reduction in PSA levels in metastatic prostate cancer.<br \/>Results: The baseline characteristics of our cohort are summarized in Table 1a. Our approach found that ACAT reduces PSA levels significantly more than ACT, and captured the heterogeneity in treatment effects across individuals (Table 1b). Through simulation studies, we demonstrated that any reasonable bias from unobserved confounding or missing information was small compared to the estimated treatment effects and their standard errors.<br \/>Conclusion: We presented a doubly robust framework and demonstrated its utility in analyzing real-world data, enabling us to uncover the diversity in treatment responses among individuals with metastatic prostate cancer.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{007BA976-16E1-4620-94B7-F7C217AE6D63}\"><caption>Results summary<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>a.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Baseline demographic characteristics.<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ADT + chemotherapy N = 302<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ADT + combination therapy N = 114<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Treatments<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Any ADT + Docetaxel or Cabazitaxel<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Any ADT + Abiraterone or apalutamide or Enzalutamide<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Age<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mean (SD)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">69.3 (8.76)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66.7 (8.17)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median [Min, Max]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">69.0 [47.0, 94.0]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66.5 [46.0, 86.0]<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Race<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Asian<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8 (2.6%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (1.8%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Black or African American<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48 (15.9%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (6.1%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">White or Caucasian<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">224 (74.2%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">99 (86.8%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22 (7.3%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (5.3%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Max PSA treatment start (ng\/mL)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mean (SD)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34.9 (98.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">83.3 (448)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>b.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Treatment effects estimation<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><br><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ATE (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32.0% [24.6%, 40.8%]<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PTEs: 25th and 75th percentiles<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.0%, 34.3%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Personalized medicine,Causal inference,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sumana Srivatsa*<sup>1<\/sup>, David Walsh*<sup>1<\/sup>, Mayada Aljehani<sup>2<\/sup>, Jason Weinreb<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Becker<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin H.

Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared between ethnic groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS) between HI and NH populations. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching was performed.<b> <\/b><b>Results:<\/b>Of 5517 of NLPHL patients, 379 were HI, and 4904 NH. Male gender and white race predominated for both. HI were diagnosed at a younger median age of 44 years (y) vs 48 y for NH, p=0.001. Most patients were diagnosed between years 2016-2019. Stage I predominated for both, p&#60;0.001. As to Charlson-Deyo score &#8805;2, both HI and NH had 4%. Private insurance as primary payer was the most prevalent type for HI (53%) and NH (65%). HI had a higher percentage of unknown\/uninsured, 12% vs 6% for NH, p&#60;0.001. In relation to census median income (2008-2012), the most prevalent bracket for HI (27%) was $48,000-$62,000, and for NH (35%) was &#62;$63,000. Regarding median income of &#60;$38,000, HI were 29% vs 16% for NH, p&#60;0.001. For median distance in miles (mi) between the patient&#8217;s residence and the hospital that reported the case (great circle distance), HI lived at a median of 6.3mi, vs NH at median of 9.5mi. Majority of HI (56%) were treated at Academic\/Research programs; while most of NH (39%) were treated at Comprehensive Community Cancer programs, p&#60;0.001. On survival analysis, the survival probability at 2, 5 and 10 y for HI was 96%, 92%, 86%, vs for NH was 96%, 92%, 84%, respectively. The median survival time wasn&#8217;t reached for both HI and NH, and no statically significant difference was seen, p=0.57. On multivariate analysis, HI was not associated with worse OS (HR 0.76, CI 0.44-1.31, p=0,33). The propensity matched analysis confirmed not reached OS on both cohorts.<b> <\/b><b>Conclusion:<\/b>NLPHL is a disease that affects young males, at early stages, for both HI and NH. Unlike previous studies, in this analysis white race predominates; which could be explained by the increase in reported cases over years. Despite HI having more uninsured population with lower median income quartiles, this wasn&#8217;t a barrier to access care at academic\/research programs. Although no difference in OS was seen among ethnicities, there is a tendency that might favor HI.

However, a reliable predictive marker to immune checkpoint inhibitor has not been discovered in this patient population. We sought to assess the incidence of mismatch repair (MMR) gene alterations and their association with tumor mutational burden (TMB) in MSS GI cancers.<br \/>Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced GI cancer who had molecular profiling of the tumor using either Guardant360 blood-based or Tempus tissue next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms between 2020 and 2023. We assessed four MMR genes including <i>MLH1<\/i>, <i>MSH2<\/i>, <i>MSH6<\/i> and <i>PMS2<\/i> for alterations. Continuous variables were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and proportions and compared using Fisher&#8217;s exact test.<br \/>Results: A total of 2920 patients with Guardant360 were included with a median age of 65 (IQR: 56-73) years. 870 (30%) patients had pancreas cancer; 846 (29%) patients had colorectal cancer; 688 (24%) patients had biliary tract cancers; and the rest had other GI cancers. Among patients evaluable for microsatellite instability (MSI) status, 58 patients (2%) had MSI-high GI cancers, 31 (53%) of whom had MMR gene alterations. 2445 (98%) patients had MSS GI cancers, 130 (5.3%) of whom had MMR gene alterations. Patients with MSS GI cancers bearing MMR gene alterations had a median age of 70 (IQR: 62-75) years, significantly older than those without MMR gene alterations (p&#60;0.001). In addition, patients with MMR gene alterations had significantly higher median blood TMB of 11 (IQR: 7.4-16) mut\/Mb compared to 7.7 (IQR: 4.8-11) mut\/Mb in patients without MMR gene alterations. In MSS GI cancers, MMR gene alterations are more commonly associated with the presence of alterations in <i>APC<\/i> (p=0.03), <i>TP53<\/i> (p=0.01), <i>CTNNB1<\/i> (p&#60;0.001) and <i>SMAD4<\/i> (p=0.01). 1453 patients with GI cancer and Tempus tissue NGS data were included as a validation cohort. They had comparable demographics with the Guardant360 cohort. 14 (1.6%) of 896 patients with MSS GI cancers had MMR gene alterations, significantly fewer (p&#60;0.001) than those found in the Guardant360 cohort. Patients with MMR gene alterations and wild type POLE had significantly higher (p=0.001) median TMB of 9.8 (IQR: 4.8-14) mut\/Mb compared to 4.7 (IQR: 3.2-6.3) mut\/Mb in patients without MMR gene alterations.<br \/>Conclusions: MMR gene alterations can be identified by clinical NGS platforms in a small proportion of patients with MSS GI cancers. They are associated with elevated TMB, which may suggest a hypermutated profile serving as a basis for potential role of immune checkpoint inhibitor in MSS GI cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Mismatch repair,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Epidemiological data have shown that insurance-associated healthcare outcomes vary by diagnosis, geographic location, and demographics. Thus, it is critical for cancer providers to understand local impacts of insurance status on patient outcomes. Here, we present real-world outcomes for pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in 11 Midwest hospitals based on insurance status.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We identified patients diagnosed with colorectal, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary cancers within 11 Midwest hospitals from 2011-2021 with North American Association of Central Cancer Registries data. Health insurance was defined as private, Medicaid, Medicare, and uninsured. Effect of insurance status at diagnosis on overall survival (OS) in selected cancers combined and by cancer type were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) model controlling for age, sex, race, stage, time to treatment initiation (TTI), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We evaluated differences in TTI by insurance status using t-tests. We analyzed stage and treatment modality by insurance status using chi-square tests. Post-hoc analysis of TTI by OS used CoxPH.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Relative to private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare insurance status significantly reduced OS for all selected GI cancers combined (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17 - 1.62 and HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 - 1.40, respectively; <i>p<\/i><i>&#60;0.001<\/i>) and for CRC (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 - 1.98 and HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.54, respectively; <i>p&#60;0.01<\/i>). Uninsured patients had significantly reduced OS only for pancreas cancer (HR 6.36, 95% CI 2.56 - 15.8; <i>p&#60;0.001<\/i>). No significant associations between insurance status and OS were noted in Hepatobiliary cancer. TTI was significantly associated with insurance status (<i>p&#60;0.001<\/i>) and mean TTI for Medicaid (35.8 days) and Medicare (27.9 days) patients was longer than mean TTI for privately insured patients (23.3 days;<i> p&#60;0.01<\/i>). TTI for uninsured patients was not significantly different than for privately insured. Analysis of TTI and OS showed no increased hazard for patients with TTI of 36 days versus 23 days (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.02; <i>p=0.085<\/i>). Treatment modality and stage did not differ as a function of insurance status in this dataset.<br \/><b>Discussion: <\/b>Our results expand previous work by demonstrating a survival impact for GI cancer patients with Medicaid or Medicare insurance. This disparity persists despite controlling for known prognostic factors such as age, stage, CCI, and TTI. Notably, TTI varied by insurance suggesting it may account for a portion of this disparity but did not independently drive survival. Further work is required to identify and develop targeted interventions to address other drivers of reduced survival in those without private insurance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Risk factors,Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Gastrointestinal cancers: liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, in a prior study from the US, almost a quarter of patients (pts) with new diagnoses of AML between years (yrs) 2003 and 2011 did not receive chemo (Bhatt et al., Blood Advances, 2018). Our study examined trends in chemo utilization in the last 15 yrs to test the hypothesis that chemo use has increased in more recent yrs. We also examined any disparities in chemo use.<br \/>Methods: We utilized the National Cancer Database to identify 78,864 pts diagnosed with AML between 2004 and 2019 and divided them into 2 cohorts based on date of diagnosis, 2004-2010 and 2011-2019. We used logistic regression to estimate effect of demographic and disease characteristics on odds of receiving chemo and evaluate differences in these effects between the constructed patient cohorts.<br \/>Results: Seventy-seven percent of total pts received chemo. Compared to 73% in 2004, 81% of pts received chemo in 2019. The receipt of chemo declined with increasing age with higher use of chemo in all groups in 2011-2019 compared to 2004-2010: &#62;80 (yrs)= 40 vs 33%, 71-80 yrs= 72 vs 63%, 60-70 yrs= 87 vs 84%, 41-59 yrs= 93 vs 92%, and 18-40 yrs = 95 vs 94%.The receipt of chemo was lowest in white pts overall; in black pts, receipt of chemo increased in 2011-2019<br \/>compared to 2004-2010: black= 83 vs 76%, white= 78 vs 75%, and others 83 vs 83%. The receipt of chemo was lowest in therapy-related (t)-AML in 2011-2019 and 2004-2010: t-AML 64 vs 60%, acute promyelocytic leukemia= 88 vs 87%, core binding factor AML 93 vs 88% and other 77 vs 74%. In multivariable analysis, the odds of receiving chemo increased in 2011-2019 compared to 2004-2010 in all pts, particularly in older adults. Compared to white, black pts had similar odds of receiving chemo in 2004-2010, but odds were higher in 2011-2019 (Odds ratio, 1.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3. Pts with t-AML were less likely to receive chemo compared to all other subtypes in 2004-2010 and 2011-2019. Female sex, lower income, public insurance, higher comorbidity score, and shorter distance to treatment facility were associated with a lower likelihood of receiving chemo; however, chemo utilization did not differ over the two time periods based on these variables.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>To our knowledge, this is the largest scale analysis of chemo utilization in AML in real-world practice. Chemo receipt increased significantly over the yrs, particularly among older adults, black pts, core binding factor, and t-AML. These recent trends are encouraging and represent novel findings. Despite these results, healthcare disparity based on sex, socioeconomic, and healthcare system factors continues to persist. In addition to developing safer and more effective chemo regimens, other innovative strategies to tackle these disparities are crucial to improve outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Databases,Outcome,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) block single-strand DNA break repairs and have activity in cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency; they are FDA approved for patients with metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer with germline BRCA1\/2 mutations. While preclinical studies suggest that PARPi have CNS penetration, clinical data is limited. The goal of our study is to describe the clinical benefit of PARPi in patients with breast cancer CNS metastasis.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective case series was conducted at three academic cancer centers (Johns Hopkins, Dana-Farber, and Duke) and included patients with the following criteria: (1) age&#8805;18 years with a breast cancer diagnosis (any subtype); (2) diagnosis of parenchymal brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease (LMD); and (3) received PARPi (olaparib, talazoparib) for CNS metastasis. Clinical and pathologic information were analyzed with descriptive statistics (median, range) and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank p-values.<br \/>Results: Although this analysis includes one center&#8217;s experience, we will present a combined dataset (N = 45) at the main conference. 11 patients were identified at Johns Hopkins. 4 (36.4%) were Black and 6 (54.5%) were White; 6 (54.5%) had ER+HER2- disease and 5 (45.5%) had TNBC at time of brain metastasis; 5 (45.5%) had BRCA1 mutations, 5 (45.5%) had a BRCA2 mutations, and 1 patient (9%) had a BARD1 mutation; 7 (63.6%) had brain metastasis and 4 (36.4%) had LMD. Median lines of therapy prior to PARPi was 6 [1 - 11]; 8 patients (72.7%) had previous CNS radiation (5 SRS and 3 WBRT) and 3 (27.3%) had previous CNS surgery. On average, patients remained on PARPi for 5 months [0.5 - 66], and overall survival (OS) time from PARPi to death was 16 months [2 - 66]. Time on PARPi was 5 months [2 - 66] for patients with brain metastasis and 3 months [0.5 - 10] for those with LMD (p=0.22). Duration of PARPi and OS did not differ significantly between ER+HER2- and TNBC (p=0.74 and 0.69, respectively), BRCA 1 and 2 (p=0.78 and 0.72, respectively), or brain and LMD metastasis (p=0.22 and 0.91, respectively). Black patients had significantly shorter PARPi duration and survival than White patients (PARPi 2 vs. 8 months, p=0.028 and OS 4 vs 18 months, p=0.028). Prior CNS radiation was significantly associated with longer PARPi duration and survival (PARPi 5 vs 1 month, p=0.02 and OS 17 vs. 3 months, p=0.032). Prior CNS surgery was significantly associated with longer PARPi duration, but not overall survival (PARPi 18 vs 3 months, p=0.05 and OS 28 vs. 7 months, p=0.14).<br \/>Conclusions: PARPi are associated with significant clinical benefit in patients with breast cancer CNS metastasis. Larger data series will help confirm these observations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,PARP inhibitors,Brain metastasis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Chart review was conducted to pull clinical data on patients including telehealth versus in person visits, demographic data, clinical stage, comorbidities (diabetes, smoking status, BMI), rural\/urban status by zip code (&#62;50,000, <u>&#60;<\/u>50,000 individuals) and income levels by zip code (25K-49.9K, 50K-99.9K, <u>&#60;<\/u>100K), payor status (Medicare, Managed care, Medicaid, other government, ODRC, or self-pay), patient distance, and gas savings\/carbon footprint.<br \/>Results: 430 patients completed in person visits while 268 completed telehealth visits. There was no statistically significant difference for in person visits vs. telehealth visits regarding patients&#8217; race (p=0.541), ethnicity (p=0.394) age (p=0.862), urban\/rural status (p=0.507), payor status (p=0.127), mean zip code income (p=0.175), and comorbidities (p=0.626 for diabetes, p = 0.706 for smoking, p = 0.459 for BMI), and clinical stage (p=0.07). There was a statistically significant difference in mean distance (14.85 miles versus 26.86 miles, p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusion: Patients&#8217; with bladder cancer receive care from their urologist via in person visits versus telehealth at similar rates irrespective of their urban\/rural status, demographics, payor status, relevant comorbidities, or relative income. Patients are more likely to engage in care with their urologist via telehealth if they live farther from a large urban academic center, which produces an economical and environmental impact via gas\/time savings and reduced carbon footprint.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Telehealth,Patient distance from provider,Carbon footprint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the real-world factors on TAT for actionable variants in NSCLC, detected using commercially available molecular diagnostic tests. These test services are run in a single, centralized laboratory site and utilized primarily by practices in the community across the United States.<br \/>Methods: In this study, de-identified reference data was reviewed for a ddPCR test that evaluates hotspot mutations including Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (INDEL), and gene fusions. The NGS panel additionally tests for Copy Number Amplification (CNA) mutations. Specimen processing was initiated when the specimen was entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and ended when the test result was ready for release. The turnaround time evaluation excluded holidays, and weekends unless the start or end-point occurred on a non-business day.<br \/>Results: In total, 35,441 specimen results were analyzed. Specimens were typically received in the laboratory within 24 hours of being shipped (88% in 24 hours). Tests by ddPCR included 30,490 (86%) results, while NGS testing accounted for 4,951 (14%) of results. The average analytic lab processing TAT for the ddPCR and NGS test ranged between 2 and 3 days (ddPCR median = 24.5 hours; NGS panel median = 69.7 hours). When no information was missing on the specimen test request form, the turn-around time for the ddPCR tests averaged 30.2 hours and NGS panel averaged 66.2 hours. The percentage of missing or inaccurate information was similar when test requests were initially received. The largest impact factor impacting initiation of specimen processing was information related annotation of the stage of cancer, followed by demographic information related to patient and specimen identifiers.<br \/>Conclusion: The focus on rapid turnaround times from specimen collection to results released is critical in oncology. Site and patient information, shipping methods, technologies and workflows used in the laboratory are all part of the test process and impact the release of potentially actionable results. Our study has highlighted that rapid turnaround of results is highly feasible for molecular tests being sent out from community practices across the US to a centralized reference laboratory. Specifically, actionable variant results related to NSCLC were successfully detected in the laboratory and were ready for delivery in 2 to 3 days. Automated methods for parsing the information necessary for test requests and delivery will continue to be important in maintaining rapid test result turnaround times.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,NSCLC,Circulating cell-free DNA,Molecular markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"B.

Current therapeutic options offer a dismal overall survival with the 5-year survival at just ~12%. Analysis of the clinical and molecular underpinnings of pancreatic cancer is critical to developing both early detection methodologies as well as novel therapeutic options. The aggressiveness and deadly nature of this disease warranted the development of a data repository and analysis system dedicated to pancreatic cancer data. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network&#8217;s (PanCAN) SPARK platform is a cloud-based data and analytics platform, powered by Velsera, that integrates real-world patient health data from PanCAN research initiatives and accelerates research by making pancreatic cancer data easier to access and use. Encompassing clinical, imaging, and genomics data from over 600 patients with pancreatic cancer within PanCAN&#8217;s Know Your Tumor &#174; (KYT) precision medicine service, the SPARK platform connects with petabytes of publicly available cancer data via the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), also powered by Velsera. The CGC is part of NCI&#8217;s Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), a cloud-based data science infrastructure that connects data with analytics tools to allow researchers to share, integrate, analyze, visualize, and drive scientific discovery.<br \/>Here, we demonstrate the application of these datasets by providing a case study demonstrating how to combine and enrich data to accelerate pancreatic cancer research. Currently, the genomic and proteomic data available on CRDC amounts to 402 and 304 cases of pancreatic tumor samples, respectively. We will use the capabilities of the SPARK and CGC platforms, which provide ready-to-use tools for multi-omics analysis that require no coding knowledge. Using the KYT and CRDC open-access pancreatic cancer data, we aim to demonstrate how to perform integrated analysis of data from diverse scientific domains, and share with collaborators all in one space, streamlining and increasing the potential for new scientific discoveries.<br \/>Further expansion of the PanCAN and CGC datasets will undoubtedly provide a more comprehensive understanding of pancreatic cancer tumor biology. SPARK and CGC&#8217;s cloud based computation infrastructure, along with numerous available cancer datasets and easy-to-use multi-omics data processing workflows and data analytic tools will be instrumental in this process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Genomics,Precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.

However, researchers often lack resources to curate data in-house. Organizations are challenged with timely data curation at the quality and scale needed for real world applications.<br \/>Methods: As members of the AACR Project GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) Biopharma Collaborative (BPC), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) partnered with Vasta Global, an Omega Healthcare company, to build a model for curating RWD at scale, allowing for cost-effective RWD curation while leveraging expert resources and best practices. The approach includes managing a hybrid onshore and offshore team with clear communication and recurring check-ins, cross-training curators on different EHRs to reallocate Vasta Global resources and maintain project pace, building program-specific clinical data curation training, establishing QA and delivery methods, standardizing data curation, assigning productivity standards, aligning data quality practices and benchmarks, and developing data visualizations and analytics to show progress and insights.<br \/>Results: In Phase 1 of the AACR GENIE BPC, data was curated from four sites: MSK, DFCI, Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in Nashville, and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto. During Phase 1, MSK and DFCI, with Vasta Global&#8217;s assistance, delivered high-quality RWD for 6,475 patients (NSCLC = 1,591; CRC = 1,264; Bladder = 639; Breast = 957; Pancreas 989; and Prostate = 1,035). All data for these cohorts will be publicly available by Spring 2024 in the AACR Project GENIE cBioPortal. MSK and DFCI generated usable and fit-for-purpose RWD to help advance oncology clinical decision-making and data sharing.<br \/>Conclusion: Accelerating RWD curation will empower the oncology community to leverage data-driven insights and advance treatment opportunities for cancer patients. Working alongside lead sites, a partner like Vasta Global enables researchers to leverage extensive expertise in the BPC data model, allowing for consistency and scalability of the BPC program. In this hybrid model, research partners can curate RWD in a cost-effective way, while remaining focused on core research responsibilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Cancer genomics,Bioinformatics,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Multivariable linear regression with patient- and hospital-level characteristics as covariates was used to identify factors associated with long hospital stays.<br \/>Results: From 2018 to 2020, there were 97,795 hospital encounters with a primary diagnosis of an intracranial neoplasm. Of these patients, 64.6% underwent a tumor excision procedure during their hospital visit. The average age of these patients undergoing excision was 57.80.2 years. Most patients were male (58.6%), white (79.1%), private insurance beneficiaries (46.3%), and of the highest income quartile (26.8%). These patients most commonly presented to hospitals in the West (34.9%), with a medium number of beds (36.4%), and presented to rural hospitals (41.7%). The most common locations of these neoplasms were the frontal (29.1%), temporal (21.3%), and parietal (12.1%) lobes. Neoplasms in more than one location in the brain occurred in 4.5% of patients.

Due to its rarity, there has not been large population studies that have demonstrated the effect of demographic variables on a patient&#8217;s risk to have metastases.<br \/>Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample was queried from the last quarter of 2015 to 2019 to identify patients with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Multivariable logistic regression, with patient- and hospital-level characteristics as covariates, was used to identify factors associated with a higher chance of developing a metastasis and specific metastasis locations.<br \/>Results: From the last quarter of 2015 to 2019, there were 7,561 ED encounters with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Of these patients, 5.8% had at least one metastasis. Most patients with a metastasis were at least 65 years of age (47.1%), male (54.4%), a Medicare beneficiary (45.2%), and belonged to a family in the highest income quartile (29.7%). The median age of these patients was 61 years (IQR: 32-74). Most patients presented to hospitals in the South (40.7%), with a Trauma Level I designation (56.1%), and to a metropolitan teaching hospital (72.9%). The most common sites of metastasis were liver (17.0%), brain (5.3%), and bone (2.0%). Multivariable logistic regression identified the following factors to be associated with increased risk of developing a metastasis: private insurance (odds ratio [OR]=1.62; p=0.012), highest income quartile (OR=2.30; p&#60;0.001), and 2<sup>nd<\/sup> highest income quartile (OR=1.78; p=0.002). The following factors were associated with higher odds of developing a liver metastasis specifically: no-charge\/charity work (OR=15.8; p=0.012), highest income quartile (OR=1.99; p=0.003), and second highest income quartile (OR=1.66; p=0.035). Presenting to a Trauma Level I hospital was associated with decreased risk of developing a liver metastasis (OR=0.57; p=0.016). Belonging to the highest income quartile was associated with a higher chance of developing a brain metastasis (OR=2.13; p=0.023) or a bone metastasis (OR=2.74; p=0.045). Among patients with a metastasis, the in-hospital mortality rate was 8.3%.<br \/>Conclusion: Metastasis is an important complication to monitor in uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we have demonstrated that income and insurance status are factors that are associated with higher rates of metastases. Physicians should place special attention to these groups to ensure that metastases are minimized.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

However, there is not much research into the primary reasons for these patients to present to the ED and their outcomes.<br \/>Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample was queried from the last quarter of 2015 to 2019 to identify patients with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Multivariable logistic regression, with patient- and hospital-level characteristics as covariates, was used to identify factors associated with increased risk of in-hospital death.<br \/>Results: From the last quarter of 2015 to 2019, there were 7,561 ED encounters with a secondary diagnosis of uveal melanoma. Most patients were at least 65 years of age (43.5%), male (52.5%), and a Medicare beneficiary (44.2%), or belong to a family in the 3rd income quartile (25.6%). The median age of these patients was 61 years (IQR: 32-74). Most patients presented to hospitals in the South (40.8%), with a Trauma Level I designation (47.2%), and to a metropolitan teaching hospital (72.6%). The most common diagnosis for presentation to the ED were the following general clinical categories: blood disorders (7.1%), genitourinary tract disorders (5.1%), infections (6.0%), respiratory diseases (9.0%), nervous system disorders (4.8%), endocrine\/nutrition disorders (4.3%), and vascular disorders (8.3%). The rate of metastatic uveal melanoma was 5.8%. The rate of in-hospital mortality was 3.6%. In a multivariable logistic regression identified the following clinical categories as factors associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death: infections (odds ratio [OR]=10.22; p&#60;0.001), metastases (OR=10.22; p&#60;0.001), genitourinary tract disorders (OR=7.05; p&#60;0.001), respiratory diseases (OR=3.31; p=0.031), and vascular disorders (OR=3.14; p=0.044). Nervous system, blood, and endocrine\/nutrition disorders were not associated with a higher rate of in-hospital mortality. The only demographic variable associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death was being part of the top income quartile (OR=3.10; p=0.14).<br \/>Conclusion: Physicians have to be mindful of different complications associated with uveal melanoma that can lead to presentation to the ED and possible in-hospital death. Specifically, physicians need to be mindful of infections, metastases, genitourinary tract disorders, respiratory diseases, and vascular disorders in these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.
