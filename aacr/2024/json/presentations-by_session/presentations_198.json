[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose due to its asymptomatic presentation at early stages. Therefore, there is an unmet need for non-invasive imaging markers that can help identify the aggressive pancreatic lesions at an early time point. One of the most promising imaging biomarkers is the conversion of hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate to lactate<sup>1-3<\/sup>. With HP metabolic imaging, the conversion will be monitored among different premalignant models at different timepoints as well as tested against pancreatitis, a known confounder of pancreatic cancer in the clinic.<br \/>Methods: HP [1-<sup>13<\/sup>C]pyruvate Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) was employed to study the metabolic processes in tamoxifen inducible genetically engineered mouse models (P48CreERT2;LSL-K<i>ras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup>(iKC)) with pre-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) precursor lesions, invasive pancreatic cancer model (P48CreERT2;LSL-K<i>ras<\/i><sup>G12D<\/sup>; LSL-<i>p53<\/i><sup>R172H<\/sup> (iKPC)) and control animals (P48CreERT2 (iC)) at 7T Bruker MRI scanner. These mice were imaged before tamoxifen induction at 10-, 20-, and 30-weeks post induction. For the pancreatitis model, iC and iKC mice they were treated with caerulein for three weeks, 7 weeks after tamoxifen induction. The pancreatitis mice were imaged 24 hours after the last caerulein injection.<br \/>Results\/Discussion: HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratio is increased in the cancer models compared to the control model. In the iKPC mouse model, at the 20-week post induction imaging there was a significant increase of the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio compared to the 10-weektime point after induction. The 20-week iKPC time point ratio compared to the iKC and control mouse models was significantly higher, indicating the aggressive nature of the disease. Even in the iKC model there is a slight increase<br \/>of the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio at 20-weeks post induction compared to both previous time points, pre-induction and 10-week. No change in the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio was not observed with the pancreatitis phenotype. In the future, we plan on imaging at earlier timepoints or at smaller intervals in the iKPC model, to observe the exact moment the metabolism switches to lactate.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrates that the metabolic flux to lactate is only increasing in the premalignant models of pancreatic cancer but not in the pancreatitis model, suggesting that the differentiation between early pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis can be achieved by hyperpolarized metabolic imaging. We are currently in the process of translating this in a clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

This investigation tests the potential of whole-organ <i>ex vivo<\/i> optical imaging of freshly excised FTs to label and sample abnormal tubal epithelium prior to formalin fixation and paraffin embedding for standard histopathology.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><br \/>This investigation prototyped &#8220;OVASEEK&#8221;, a whole-organ, near-infrared optical imaging platform for identification of STICs. This prospective biospecimen protocol with annotated clinical data was approved by the IRB. Following salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy for benign indications, FTs from study participants are longitudinally bivalved. Half of the FT is retained for routine evaluation using the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbriated end (SEE-FIM) protocol by Johns Hopkins gynecologic pathologists (Gyn Path), while the other half is sent overnight in organ transplant media to MIT for imaging on OVASEEK. Hyperspectral &#8220;label free&#8221; first pass imaging is performed using a series of band-pass filters. Second pass fluorescence imaging is then performed using nanoparticles tagged with anti-LAMC1 antibodies targeting laminin &#947;1, a known STIC surface marker. Abnormal signal(s) on OVASEEK imaging of the FT epithelium are tattooed with black ink, the tissue is formalin fixed and returned to Gyn Path for serial sectioning. Research findings are reported in an addendum to the formal pathology report in the electronic medical record and discussed with the patient by the gynecologic oncologist co-investigator.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><br \/>OVASEEK enabled non-destructive imaging over a wide field-of-view ~ 12&#215;12 cm, with features of interest in the 1,050-1,550 nm range.

Strategies for the differentiation of precancers and PDAC are needed. Recently proposed molecular imaging targets to accomplish this goal include integrin &#945;<sub>v<\/sub>&#946;<sub>6 <\/sub>and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). To discover and quantitatively evaluate potential imaging and therapeutic targets, we performed Visium spatial transcriptomic (ST) sequencing on human surgical sections of normal tissue adjacent to precancers, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and PDAC. All human tissues were collected in accordance with the Stanford Institutional Review Board. The resulting data were correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and combined with analysis with publicly available spatial and single cell PDAC datasets to create a quantitative PDAC cancer surfaceome score. Pseudotime and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also performed. We found that clusters with high cancer surfacesome scores were spatially correlated with a cellular morphology consistent with cancer. In the cancer cluster, the expression of surface markers <i>CLDN4<\/i>,<i> GPRC5A<\/i>, <i>TSPAN8<\/i>, and <i>CEACAM5<\/i> was enhanced more than 13-fold compared with the normal pancreas, while <i>FAP<\/i> and <i>ITGB6<\/i> were differentially expressed by less than 4-fold. Within cancer clusters, the fraction of spots overexpressing <i>CLDN4<\/i>, <i>S100P<\/i>, <i>ITGB6<\/i>, <i>MUC5AC<\/i>, <i>TFF1<\/i>,<i> CEACAM5<\/i>, and <i>FAP<\/i> was 88%, 87%, 78%, 66%, 59%, 47%, and 38%, respectively. The Pearson&#8217;s correlation across space and expression intensity between <i>CLDN4<\/i>, <i>S100P<\/i>, <i>GPRC5A<\/i>, <i>TSPAN8<\/i>, <i>MUC1<\/i> and <i>TFF1<\/i> was greater than 0.6 for all combinations. The correlation of mRNA encoding <i>ITGB6<\/i> and <i>FAP<\/i> with cancer surfaceome markers was smaller, e.g. 0.37 and 0.01 versus <i>S100P<\/i>, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the differentiation of PDAC from normal or precancerous tissue for <i>CLDN4<\/i>, <i>S100P<\/i>, <i>MUC5AC<\/i>, <i>TFF1<\/i>, <i>CEACAM5<\/i>, and <i>TSPAN8<\/i> was 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.4, respectively. From pseudotime trajectory analysis, we found that <i>MUC5AC<\/i> and <i>TFF1<\/i> increased at a precancerous pseudotime whereas <i>CLDN4 <\/i>increased in time and space in spots corresponding to a PDAC-specific surfaceome score. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using spatial transcriptomics and IHC in human pancreatic cancer samples to discover and compare the expression of cell surface markers that can be employed in imaging and therapeutic protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Sequencing,Pancreatic cancer,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The purpose of this project was to understand what biology is associated with brain tumor edema abundance and if that association was sex distinct. We have developed a two-compartment model of MRI signal intensity to quantitatively estimate relative edema abundance from T2-weighted MRIs. Multiparametric MRIs were preprocessed with bias field correction and intensity normalization. The images were co-registered and segmented for abnormal regions and normal tissue. The segmentations and preprocessed images were utilized in the edema mathematical model to estimate the fraction of extracellular space (Fecs) and fraction of intracellular space (Fics). Through an ongoing image-localized biopsy collection protocol, we analyzed 179 samples (Female: 75; Male: 104) from 55 patients (Female: 21; Male: 34) for bulk RNA-Seq. Samples were characterized by their edema Fecs scores and underwent differential expression, gene set enrichment analysis using MSigDB hallmarks and cellular deconvolution using CIBERSORTx. Through differential expression and gene set enrichment analyses of these spatial biopsies, we have identified sex-distinct gene expression and pathways corresponding to regions of high vs low edema. Within highly edematous regions, male samples were amplified for respiratory pathways, while female samples were suppressed. Connecting changes on MRIs with molecular markers from image-localized biopsies provides an opportunity to identify the biological drivers of brain tumor associated imageable edema. Specifically, elucidating the sex-distinct patterns connecting changes on MRI with cellular populations and molecular pathways could be used to better interpret imaging of patients and interpreting treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Magnetic resonance imaging,Modeling,Biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Here, we introduce a novel spatial sequencing platform employing a rapid 4-color SBS chemistry with sub-micron resolution imaging and an ultra-high throughput capacity. The platform simultaneously profiles RNA transcripts and proteins within formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. With up to 40 cm^2 of tissue area imaging within a 24-hour timeframe, the platform can power extensive, multi-omic studies in cancer research.<br \/>To evaluate the performance of the platform, we prepared 5 um serial sections from healthy and tumor kidney FFPE block and used a novel tool to precisely position multiple tissue sections on a slide. Following probe binding and amplification, we used SBS readout to profile 105 transcripts and 6 proteins (via DNA-conjugated antibodies). Images were analyzed using a custom pipeline for feature detection and decoding, and cell segmentation using Cellpose. Results showed strong correlation to single-cell transcription profiles and cell type signatures defined by scRNA-Seq. Additionally, we see good agreement between single cell transcript and protein profiles. Existing spatial biology platforms are known to struggle with degraded and challenging clinical sample types (e.g. decalcified bone marrow), due to RNA fragmentation. We successfully profiled immune cells in FFPE-embedded bone marrow biopsies, measuring 143 transcript targets and 8 proteins. We believe this represents a significant step forward for in-situ analysis of bone marrow samples, and could be valuable for studying the pathology and response to treatment in blood cancers such as AML and CML.<br \/>In-situ sequencing of antibody genes and T-cell receptors provides a deeper view of cellular immune response. As a step towards this goal, we demonstrated in-situ sequencing of antibody heavy and light chains within a B cell line, resulting in accurate readout of 28 bases within the CDR3 regions.<br \/>In conclusion, we present an SBS-based approach for in-situ detection of targeted gene transcripts and proteins at an unprecedented throughput, and its application to the analysis of human kidney and bone marrow FFPE tissue samples. The capability to deeply profile tissues at high throughput could enable larger translational studies, and assembly of 3D maps of gene and protein expression at sub-cellular resolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"In situ hybridization,Renal cell carcinoma,Multiomics,FFPE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael Lawson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yuji Ishitsuka<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Pawlowski<sup><\/sup>, Zhenmin Hong<sup><\/sup>, Jake Koh<sup><\/sup>, Kenneth Gouin<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Ing<sup><\/sup>, Richard Que<sup><\/sup>, Yeoan Youn<sup><\/sup>, Sara Ding<sup><\/sup>, Tony Facchini<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Costello<sup><\/sup>, Katelyn Nelson<sup><\/sup>, Jamie Stover<sup><\/sup>, Howon Lee<sup><\/sup>, Sarthak Duggal<sup><\/sup>, Taylor Plaziak<sup><\/sup>, Kaitlin Cameron<sup><\/sup>, Mimi Abdu<sup><\/sup>, Daan Witters<sup><\/sup>, Martin Fabani<sup><\/sup>, Eli Glezer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Singular Genomics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c4e4885b-3b04-42b9-9d7c-c020d8bc6c51","ControlNumber":"8348","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Patients with SMM are at risk of developing active multiple myeloma (defined by the CRAB criteria). The best stratification system with respect to the risk of progression to active myeloma is the 20\/2\/20 (20% plasma cells, M protein &#62;2.0 g\/dl, and involved to uninvolved immunoglobulin free light chain ratio &#62;20). The presence of &#8805;2 criteria predicts a 50 - 60% risk of progression within 2 years. Thus, many patients considered &#8216;high-risk&#8217; may <i>not<\/i> progress in this time frame, and patients with &#8804;1 risk factor <i>can<\/i> progress to active myeloma. Therefore, improved risk stratification methods are needed to correctly identify patients at high risk of progression. We hypothesized that Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of serum combined with artificial intelligence (AI) can correctly risk stratify patients with SMM.<br \/>Methods: We identified 192 SMM patients: 96 who progressed and 96 who did not progress within 2 years of diagnosis. We used stored sera from the time of diagnosis to perform FTIR to determine differences in the spectra of patients who did\/did not progress and train an AI algorithm. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation analysis was performed using 172 samples (86 from each group) for training and the remaining 20 for testing to assess the model across 10 independent iterations. Subsequently, we blindly tested the trained model against an independent set of serum samples (N=24) from patients who progressed &#8804;3 years of diagnosis. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the FTIR AI algorithm output compared to the clinical outcome data.<br \/>Results: From the 96 patients who <i>progressed<\/i>, 48 had complete data for the 20\/2\/20 risk stratification. 11 patients (23%) had &#8804;1 of the criteria and so would have been considered at low likelihood to progress. Of the 96 who did <i>not progress<\/i> within 2 years, 49 had complete data for risk stratification. Of these, 27 (55.1%) met the high-risk criteria of the 20\/2\/20 classification and would have been predicted to progress within 2 years. FTIR\/AI model correctly identified the patients at risk of progression (95% accuracy) with AUC of 0.96. Similarly, it was able to classify patients who did not progress within 2 years of diagnosis (94% accuracy) with an AUC of 0.96. FTIR\/AI correctly predicted the patients at risk of progression within 2 years (90%) and 3 years (87.5%) in the blinded validation group with an AUC of 0.89 and 0.82, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: Analysis of serum in patients with newly diagnosed SMM with FTIR is able to correctly identify those at risk of progression within 2 or 3 years of diagnosis with an accuracy of ~90% in a blinded external validation study. FTIR may, therefore, be used to assess SMM patient risk before committing to potentially toxic therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Early detection and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnosis,Biomarkers,Multiple myeloma,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Even advanced immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor-armored T-cell therapies, are ineffective in GBM due to tissue-specific niche-dependent escape strategies employed by glioma cells. Immune effectiveness, a finely regulated spatial and context-dependent process, underpins such a dismal state of the present therapeutic options. Herein, we applied CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), a state-of-the-art multiplex imaging platform, to elucidate the immune cell networks of the tumor microenvironment. By harnessing computational tools on multiplexed regions of interest across whole-slide images, we characterize the immune repertoire of GBMs by studying intratumor heterogeneity across space-histological territories- and time, matching pre- and post-treatment tissue sections of GBMs from seven patients under treatment (Stupp protocol). We aimed to assess changes in the interactions between the two main compartments of the immune system, myeloid and lymphoid, pre- and post-treatment using spatial statistics. We designed a computational workflow for the georeferencing, classification, and phenotyping individual cells of CODEX images across 105 regions of interest, representative of a mosaic of histologically defined cellular tumor (CT) or infiltrating tumor. We defined six major immune phenotypes and evaluated their spatial association with Cd45<sup>-<\/sup>Nestin<sup>+<\/sup>Olig2<sup>+<\/sup> glioma cells. We modeled the GBM ecosystem and the cells&#8217; spatial coexistence as spatial point processes that allowed the projection of coexistence networks. After stringent quality control, we detected and phenotyped 2.3M cells. Despite interpatient heterogeneity, some patients maintained an even immune composition, while others showed an enrichment in microglia, particularly in CT. Spatial network analyses revealed an increased coexistence between myeloid and lymphoid cells after treatments despite T cells being canonically considered moderately abundant. Quantitatively, the immune meta-network displayed higher edge density and lower modularity post-treatment compared with pre-treatment, reflecting increased lymphoid-myeloid engagement. In summary, we detected an increased spatial myeloid-lymphoid engagement in GBM undergoing chemo-radiation treatments. Spatiotemporal rearrangement of tumor-immune interactions indicates mechanisms implicated in disease recurrence and resistance to standard treatment, opening the frontiers for developing new targeted immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Single cell,Immune cells,Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Recent results indicate that it is likely to become part of the standard first-line treatment regimen for advanced UC in the near future. Accurate readout of Immunohistochemical (IHC) PD-L1 expression is therefore essential to inform UC treatment decisions. However, manual PD-L1-scoring is prone to high inter- and intra-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help to improve standardization, accuracy and efficiency of PD-L1 IHC scoring. Yet, previous AI-based approaches struggled to show consistency across images that are diverse with regards to the source institutions, antibody clones, and scanning hardware used. Methods: We developed an AI software for PD-L1 tumor proportion scoring (TPS\/TC) on whole-slide images (WSIs) of UC without human supervision. PD-L1 analysis by the software is fully-automated, does not require any adaptation steps, and is concordant with current clinical guidelines. The performance of the software was evaluated on two cohorts of PD-L1 stained UC samples against ground-truth (GT) TPS\/TC scores given by human pathologists in clinical routine. The first cohort (n = 53) consisted of samples stained with the 22C3 antibody clone (Agilent) derived from four institutions and three scanner models. It contained both tissue microarray samples and scans of UC resectates. A second validation cohort consisted of n = 83 WSIs stained with the SP263 clone (Ventana), collected from two institutions. Results: For the threshold of TPS&#8805;1% (cut-off established for adjuvant therapy with Nivolumab), agreement rates of AI scores with human GT scores were 92.5% for cohort 1 (22C3) and 96.4% for cohort 2 (SP263). Sensitivity\/specificity values were 92.3%\/92.9% for cohort 1 and 100%\/93.6% for cohort 2. Across both cohorts (n = 136) the agreement rate between AI and human was 94.9%. Conclusions: Across 136 UC samples stained with two PD-L1 antibody clones, and derived from a total of four institutions and three scanner models, the fully automatic AI system showed excellent agreement with human pathologist scores. These results on challenging validation data show the potential of AI applications to standardize and optimize PD-L1 scoring and demonstrate consistency and safety of suitable AI-based systems for application in clinical routine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Artificial Intelligence,Digital Pathology,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

The application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to whole slide images (WSIs), may reveal new insights into tumor morphology and therefore patient prognosis.<br \/>Melanoma morphology appears to be of greater significance than in other solid tumors, with Breslow thickness remaining the strongest prognostic indicator. Other biomarkers based on tumor morphology have been generated and although some have been found to be prognostically superior to Breslow thickness, none have been integrated into clinical workflows. This may in part be explained by their demands on pathologist time. Therefore, this work outlines the development and evaluation of a CNN for invasive cutaneous melanoma detection in WSIs, which may be used for prognostic biomarker generation.<br \/>1,157 WSIs containing cutaneous melanoma from five datasets (three from the University of Leeds, one from the Melanoma Institute Australia, as well as The Cancer Genome Atlas) have been used in the initial development and evaluation of the CNN. A custom-designed 2-class tumor segmentation network with a fully convolutional architecture was trained using annotations. The CNN was evaluated using various methodologies, including comparison at per-pixel and per-tumor levels as compared to manual annotation, as well as variation across 3 scanning platforms (Leica Aperio AT2 (Milton Keynes, UK), Roche Ventana DP600 (Arizona, US) and Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360 (Hamamatsu City, Japan).<br \/>The CNN detected and located invasive melanoma tissue of no specific type with an average per-pixel sensitivity and specificity of 97.6% and 99.9% respectively across the 5 test sets. There were no statistical differences between tumor dimensions generated by the CNN as compared to manual annotation. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences between CNN generated tumor dimensions across three scanning platforms.<br \/>We have developed and performed initial evaluation of a CNN which appears to accurately detect invasive cutaneous melanoma of no specific type in WSIs for objective evaluation of tumor morphology. Future work should interrogate these data further for its propensity to predict survival outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Machine learning,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

In this study, we developed a computational approach based on DL to predict the overall survival (OS) of HCC patients from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histopathology whole slide images. A DL model for classifying good and poor prognosis was developed on a total of 460 patients with 2 independent cohorts from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. The primary outcome was OS. The training set (SSM1, n = 292) included HCC patients that had undergone surgical resection. The classifier was then independently tested on the second HCC dataset (SSM2, n = 168). The area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was 0.850 and 0.781 for SSM1 and SSM2 datasets, respectively. In addition, we have tried to establish DL model for prediction of OS based on clinicopathological features, including Edmondson-Steiner grade, pT stage, vascular invasion, Ki-67 index, and cytokeratin 19 immunohistochemical expression. Random forest model was applied to classify the good and poor prognosis groups and The AUROCs for the random forest was 0.705 for the SSM1 dataset, which are inferior to that of DL prediction.

Despite low relapse risk, post-recurrence survival in a stage I population is poor with a median post relapse survival of around 25 months. There is a need for a biomarker that can enrich for stage I patients with relapse risk to identify a population likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. In this study, we aim to identify a predictive biomarker of relapse in early-stage lung cancer following surgical resection using AI-based computational pathology.<br \/>The retrospective patient cohort analyzed in this study consisted of a total of 166 patients that underwent surgical resection for a clinical stage I LUAD. Out of these, 54 patients experienced disease recurrence within 5 years, and 112 patients had a confirmed disease-free period of at least 5 years post-surgery. For each patient, at least one digitized slide (average = 2.46) stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) was available for analysis. The project was accepted by the IUCPQ ethics committee (2022-3751, 22138).<br \/>Manual annotations delineating the tumor core (TC) were drawn by pathologists. We then applied several proprietary image analysis models capable of distinguishing epithelium, stroma, and necrosis within the tumor tissue as well as detecting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cell nuclei. In this project, we additionally introduce a novel approach rooted in mathematical graph theory to encoding topological aspects of the tissue morphology. A cell-graph constructed from the positions of cell nuclei was used to calculate cell-level graph-theoretic measures which were then aggregated to the slide-level by computing the median. In total, 23 data readouts were obtained of which 14 were based on the standard image analysis pipeline alone, and a further 9 originated from our newly developed graph-based approach.<br \/>We identified promising biomarkers using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC); robustness of this evaluation was investigating using resampling methods, using 100 bootstrap samples and 100 repeats of 3-fold cross-validation, respectively. This allowed us to evaluate the prognostic value of the biomarkers with respect to 5-year relapse or death.<br \/>We were able to identify the best prognostic biomarker for relapse to be the median weighted clustering coefficient (CC) across all cells in the TC area, which is derived from the graph-based analyses. The median CC was able to achieve a whole-cohort AUROC of 0.695 (average cross-validated AUROC = 0.675, 95% interval 61.7%-70.4%) as well as a relapse vs relapse-free Wilcoxon test p-value of 4.65x10-5 (bootstrapped average = 0.0002). In addition, we were also able to demonstrate that the biomarker shows some relation to the architecture patterns.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Image analysis,Graph Theory,Pathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Although H&#38;E-stained slides are routinely collected during cancer care, specialized IHC staining is typically required to ascertain antigen expression. Such stains are not always available or readily deployed. The need to perform separate IHC tests for each candidate ADC may burden clinical labs and can hinder access to care in resource-limited settings. Here we develop an ensemble of machine learning models to accurately predict the expression of 166 distinct ADC targets directly from H&#38;E images.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> For each ADC-targeted gene, patients with copy-number amplifications (CNAs) were identified from somatic whole exome sequencing. Genes differentially expressed in patients with CNAs were identified from bulk transcriptomics. For each gene, an expression signature was developed based on the expression levels of differentially upregulated genes. Next, whole-slide, H&#38;E-stained histopathology images were embedded into a lower-dimensional representation via a transformer model trained with self-supervised learning. Neural networks were developed to predict a patient&#8217;s probability of having a CNA in an ADC-targeted gene, as indicated by an expression signature exceeding the p90. All evaluation metrics were ascertained by 5-fold cross-validation, with training and evaluation on independent patients.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For each of the 166 ADC-targeted genes, a median of 154 patients were found to harbor a CNA, and the expression signature included a median of 180 genes. In all cases, patients with CNAs had significantly higher expression signatures than those without. For predicting likely CNA status directly from H&#38;E histopathology images, the mean AUROC was 0.888 (95% CI, 0.876-0.900) and the mean AUPRC was 0.571 (95% CI, 0.531-0.611). Among the 166 ADC-targeted genes, the AUROC exceeded 0.95 for 31.3%, 0.8 for 80.7%, and 0.725 for 100%. The best-predicted ADC target was SLC7A5 (AUROC: 0.995 [95% CI, 0.994-0.998]; AUPRC: 0.967 [95% CI, 0.963-0.976]).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We have developed models that accurately predict the likely expression of ADC targets based solely on H&#38;E images. The ability to accurately discern the presence of ADC antigens from H&#38;E images has numerous potential applications, including cohort refinement, computer-aided diagnosis, and personalized treatment planning.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Machine learning,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Accurate assessment of tumor purity is crucial for understanding tumor behavior, guiding treatment decisions, and predicting patient outcomes. Traditional methods of analyzing hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained slides for tumor purity are predominantly pathologist manual readouts. This process is both time-consuming and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability, leading to inconsistencies in diagnosis and treatment planning. Here, we introduce an automated AI-based product designed to streamline tumor purity analysis. The RevealAI-HE digital assay leverages state-of-the-art AI algorithms to automate the segmentation and classification of nuclei in H&#38;E slides, enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and speed of tumor purity assessment. RevealAI-HE aims to assist pathologists in decision-making, support oncology research, streamline molecular testing workflows, and improve personalized care.<br \/>Methods<br \/>H&#38;E stained solid tumor slides were imaged using 3D-Histech Pannoramic 1000 and 250 scanners. From this dataset, 104 regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected to cover a wide range of H&#38;E stain intensities in 14 different indications. A nuclear segmentation model based on StarDist-H&#38;E was deployed on these ROIs, and a pathology expert manually assigned one of three classifications to each nuclei: tumor, immune, and stroma. The resulting ground-truth dataset of over 26,000 classified nuclei was used for training a classifier model based on a ResNet architecture. For model evaluation, the nuclei dataset was randomly split into training (80%) and testing (20%) the model, and the training data was batched and randomized for each training epoch to ensure robustness and generalizability. The nuclear segmentation, nucleus classifier, and tumor purity statistics models were integrated into an end-to-end digital assay (RevealAI-HE) using Reveal Biosciences&#8217; proprietary digital assay development pipeline. RevealAI-HE is integrated into Reveal Biosciences&#8217; flagship whole slide image management system, ImageDx.<br \/>Results<br \/>The RevealAI-HE digital assay&#8217;s nucleus classification model achieved a high accuracy across all 14 indications. Compared to manual methods, the AI system significantly reduced the time required for tumor purity analysis. Furthermore, the AI model exhibited excellent consistency in its analyses, addressing the issue of variability seen in manual assessments. These results indicate that our AI product, in many aspects, surpasses the current gold standard of tumor purity analysis (pathologist readout), offering a more efficient, accurate, and reproducible approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor Purity,H&E Staining,Nuclei Classification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

HIFs were selected for analysis using K-means consensus clustering and describe the frequency of lymphocytes in cancer epithelium (cTILs); macrophages, fibroblasts, and granulocytes in stroma; and the abundance of cancer cells relative to all other cells in tumor. Bulk RNAseq was performed for 186 samples yielding 177 WSI-RNAseq pairs. Spearman correlation between HIFs and gene expression or signature was computed. Top gene associations were analyzed via gene-set enrichment analysis. HIFs were used for immunophenotyping (immune excluded, inflamed, and desert) via prespecified cutoffs on tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte abundance, and for biomarker discovery via Cox modeling of PFS and OS.<br \/>Results: Gene expression and signatures were associated with HIFs quantifying immune spatial abundance in TME (e.g., cTILs vs. immune checkpoint signature<sup>2<\/sup>).

Identifying key prognostic factors is essential for better outcomes in this group. This study focused on the prognostic value of stromal grading in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of African American CRC patients, using both manual grading and digital pathology. A retrospective analysis of CRC cases in African Americans was conducted. Two cohorts were established: a control cohort (patients without recurrence) and a recurrence cohort (patients with recurrence). Stromal grading was performed manually, categorizing tumors into Grade 1 (low risk), Grade 2 (moderate risk), and Grade 3 (high risk), and we also quantified the TME percentages by digital pathology: myxoid, collagen, immune and tumor. In the control cohort (N=40), stromal grading identified 30 Grade 1, 7 Grade 2, and 3 Grade 3 cases. Conversely, the recurrence cohort (N=17) demonstrated a starkly different distribution, with 1 Grade 1, 3 Grade 2, and 13 Grade 3 cases. The Chi-square statistic was notably significant (p&#60;0.0001), indicating a strong association between higher stromal grades and the likelihood of recurrence. By unpaired t-test, high myxoid stroma (p&#60;0.0001), low collagen (p&#60;0.0001), and low tumor (p=0.0002) by digital pathology were associated with recurrence. TME phenotypes are a significant prognostic and recurrence indicator in African American patients with CRC. The marked difference in stromal grades and digital pathology features between the control and recurrence cohorts suggests that higher stromal grades, along with higher myxoid, lower collagen and lower tumor percentages are associated with an increased risk of recurrence. These findings underscore the need for tailored therapeutic strategies and more vigilant surveillance in African American patients exhibiting high-risk TME phenotypes. The efficacy of manual and digital pathology evaluation of the TME also warrants further exploration to enhance prognostic accuracy and treatment personalization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,African American,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

These therapies have shown significant success in a subset of NSCLC patients, leading to durable response and improved overall survival. However, clear predictive biomarkers for response are still yet to be defined. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as one important part of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have proven to be predictive biomarkers in other tumor types such as melanoma, whereas not fully understood in NSCLC. The assessment of TILs typically involves techniques such as flow cytometry (FC) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). While the former has the advantage of being quantitative and relatively easy to standardize it lacks translational value as most clinical samples will be examined using IHC. The current study aims to compare both methods at terminal end point and for treatment outcome, using a panel of 14 NSCLC PDX models, implanted in humanized NSG mice and treated with anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1 and the combination thereof. Based on FC analyses of the untreated tumor tissue the PDX models were stratified into seven hot (&#62;5% TILs) and seven cold (&#60;5% TILs) tumors. The IHC samples were analyzed by digital pathology for TIL infiltration by making use of automated segmentation of the three main tissue classes: tumor, stroma and necrosis. Small number of IHC slides were manually annotated to form a training set, which were then used to train a deep learning model using Visiopharm, a commercial AI platform for image analysis. By quantification of TILs in a spatial context of the tumor tissue, across all models, tumor was the most prominent tissue class. The tissue class distribution as well as the TIL rate (FC or IHC measure) is a model immanent feature. Under treatment, the ratio was stable in case of the cold tumors. In the hot tumors the stroma compartment increased while tumor tissue decreased. Treatment sensitive models displayed an increase of TILs confirmed by FC and IHC. The latter revealed that the TILs specifically increased in the tumor tissue whereas decreased or was stable in the stroma. This observation was significantly more pronounced in cold tumors compared to hot tumors (Oneway ANOVA, p &#60; 0.001). Furthermore, a positive correlation between FC and IHC results on CD45 positive cells in the tumors (p&#60; 0.002) could be confirmed. In this study, we proofed the feasibility of software-based image analysis as translational relevant read-out in preclinical animal experiments. The possibility to reproducibly quantify tissue classes, immune cell markers and including spatial information paves the way towards discovery of novel features predicting response in translational immuno-oncology research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Immuno-oncology,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

Membrane GPC3 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and moderately in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (SQ-NSCLC) with limited expression in normal tissues which makes it an attractive target for immune cell engagers. This study aims to develop an AI-powered algorithm to evaluate GPC3 expression and compare it with manual immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring in HCC, adeno-NSCLC and SQ-NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: 147 NSCLC (94 SQ-NSCLC and 53 adeno-NSCLC) and 113 HCC FFPE tumor blocks were obtained from commercial sources. GPC3 protein level was quantified by a qualified IHC assay for tumor cell membrane and cytoplasm individually. PD-L1 expression is reported as tumor cell proportion score (TPS), combined positive score (CPS) and immune cell proportion score (IPS\/IC) TPS, regardless of staining pattern and intensity. FFPE slides were stained for GPC3+ (GC33, Ventana), PD-L1+ (22C3, Dako) cells and then scanned at 20x using the Aperio Versa8 scanner. Machine learning (ML) models were developed using the digitized whole slide images to identify GPC3+ tumor area. Data-driven cutoffs were applied to model-generated human-interpretable features of GPC3+ percentage of tumor area to classify samples as positive and negative. As an orthogonal approach to the GPC3+ percentage cutoff method, tissue and cell annotations were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify GPC3 positivity.<br \/>Results: The epidemiology profiling results revealed that GPC3 protein is highly expressed in HCC (57.5% cases with &#62; 1% positive cells), followed by SQ-NSCLC (52.1%) and adeno-NSCLC (5.7%). GPC3 expression was only detected in tumor cells with two staining patterns observed: membrane + cytoplasm and cytoplasm-only. There was no significant correlation between GPC3 and PD-L1 expression across tumor types, although a trend of lower level of PD-L1 was observed in the samples with GPC3 &#8805;50%. ML model quantification of GPC3+ and GPC3- showed high concordance with the consensus score of 2 independent pathologists on a test set of held-out samples not used in training. This concordance was comparable to that of individual annotators to consensus. Instead, GPC3 positivity results using both cutoff and CNN methods showed moderate concordance with 2-way pathologist consensus.<br \/>Conclusions: Here we profiled GPC3 expression across tumor types and showed high level of expression in HCC followed by SQ-NSCLC. We have established an AI-powered digital pathology platform that can provide a standardized, scalable, and reproducible method of characterizing GPC3 positivity to support further patient selection in clinical study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glypican-3,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

However, as TMAs become increasingly prevalent, the implication of core selection within the tumor microenvironment (TME) on downstream discoveries is not well understood. This raises the question of which TME contexts are most predictive for scientific analyses.<br \/>Methods: We segment whole tissue section (WTS) slides with a U-Net trained on pathologist annotations of tumor, DCIS, LCIS, normal, stromal, immune, and necrotic microenvironment contexts in 100 TCGA BRCA slides. We focus on 5-way PAM50 subtype prediction in breast cancer. We produce image embeddings for each core using a vision transformer pre-trained on histopathology images and use an attention-based aggregation model to predict PAM50 subtype. To evaluate the impact of core TME contexts in a held-out test set, we sample 0.6mm radius circular sections from 281 WTS images from 54 patients to produce one dataset of &#8220;majority non-cancerous&#8221; cores that the TME annotation model predicts as majority normal breast epithelial or necrotic tissue and one &#8220;majority cancerous&#8221; TMA dataset for the remaining cores.<br \/>Results: We find that core microenvironment context directly influences diagnostic accuracy. Maximizing tumor content improves diagnostic accuracy on the PAM50 task, with the majority cancerous TMAs obtaining an AUROC of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.75-0.85), relative to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.78) for majority non-cancerous TMAs and 0.82 (95% CI 0.80-0.84) for WTS images.<br \/>Notably, our context-aware TMA sampling achieves accuracy within 2% of the WTS images, while poorly selected TMA cores underperform the WTS baseline by 10% on average. While TCGA is curated to contain patients with a very high tumor burden, and consequently random TMA selection performs well on this cohort (AUROC 0.77; 95% CI 0.74-0.79), our study indicates that tissue context is an important consideration when selecting cores from real donor tissue blocks.<br \/>Our results demonstrate that TMA core sampling protocols should be informed by TME context to maximize analysis accuracy, and that intelligent core sampling can largely close the gap to WTS image accuracies on clinically-relevant tasks like PAM50 subtype prediction. These findings highlight the need for thoughtful TMA dataset construction and usage, especially as core selection becomes increasingly automated. We argue both for more targeted core selection from donor tissue blocks and for filtering of existing datasets. To avoid performance degradation, pipelines should identify and exclude these less task-relevant TMEs, where simulation serves as an efficient and task-specific approximation of TME context relevance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tissue microarrays,Tumor microenvironment,Machine learning,PAM50 subtype,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Aneuploidy has been suggested as a factor in the development, initiation or progression of EAC in patients with BE, and it has been found predictive for EAC progression (Hadjinicolaou, et al. 2020, Sikkema, et al. 2009). However, current assays for detecting aneuploidy require valuable tissue, hence validation studies are limited. We hypothesise that routine histology images can be used to detect ploidy status. We aim to develop a sensitive, accurate, and easy-to-use deep learning tool for this purpose.<br \/>Methods<br \/>We used a weakly supervised deep learning-based approach called clustering-constrained-attention multiple-instance learning (CLAM) (Lu et al., 2021) to detect aneuploidy on hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images of endoscopical biopsies from BE, for which the ploidy status had been determined by flow cytometry. To benchmark the model&#8217;s performance, we also trained a traditional fully supervised algorithm, ResNet50 (He et al., 2016), with the same dataset. The models were trained on 388 slides (51 aneuploid) from the Seattle Barrett&#8217;s Esophagus Annotated Resource (BEAR) and then applied to an independent test cohort of BEAR patients, consisting of 279 slides (36 aneuploid).<br \/>Results<br \/>The multi-attention-branch CLAM model achieved AUC of 0.82 and 76.4% balanced accuracy for aneuploidy on the internal test subset (10% of the cohort). On the independent test dataset, the model achieved AUC of 0.85 and 79.3% balanced accuracy, while performance of the fully supervised model was AUC of 0.65 and 33.1 balanced accuracy. In a challenging subset for image-based diagnosis, including 253 samples (29 aneuploid) without dysplasia or atypical mitosis (a major feature of aneuploidy samples) the model achieved a 67.6% accuracy and an AUC of 0.83. Both the flow results (p=2.84e-7) and the model's predictions (p=2.18e-3) revealed a correlation between progression to EAC and ploidy status.<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>We developed a deep learning model for predicting aneuploidy in BE biopsies. The weakly-supervised approach can perform much better compared to the traditional fully-supervised model. Aneuploidy is correlated with cancer progression and stands as a promising candidate for the prediction of cancer progression in BE patients. Although atypical mitosis is the primary histological indicator of aneuploidy, our model can still make aneuploid predictions in the absence of atypical mitosis, as it doesn't rely solely on a single parameter. Our model is efficient, capable of processing hundreds of samples resource-effectively, and thus an ideal adjunct to standard histologic evaluation. This classifier may facilitate molecular-based improvements in identifying individuals at high risk of progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Barrett's esophagus,Aneuploidy,Premalignancy,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, collecting molecular data is expensive, time-consuming, and can be sensitive to sample handling protocols. These factors prevent routine implementation at many care centers, thereby limiting benefit to patients. This work examines the viability of an image-centric method for inferring molecular endophenotypes and predicting overall survival in OV, leveraging commonly gathered histopathology scans.<br \/>Methods: Embedding representations of digitized Hematoxylin and Eosin slides were produced using a self-supervised histology model. First, we assessed the ability of the embeddings to predict overall survival using Cox proportional hazards models by calculating the concordance index. Next, these embeddings served as input features to machine learning models trained to predict genomic patterns within tumors, including molecular subtypes, driver gene alterations, and mutational processes, leading to a more comprehensive analysis of the prognostic potential of our approach.<br \/>Results: Histopathological embeddings were found to be more predictive of patient survival than traditional factors such as age, histological grade, and clinical stage. Embedding risk combined with clinicopathological risk had a higher predictive value than clinicopathological risk alone (0.578 vs 0.569, p = 0.025). Moreover, embedding risk alone was more predictive of survival (0.577 vs 0.569, p = 0.038). Risk scores derived from embeddings and all clinicopathological features were uncorrelated (R = 0.03), indicating that embeddings provide unique prognostic information. Motivated by these findings, we investigated the reasons behind the enhanced accuracy in survival prediction. We found that models trained on embeddings predicted previously defined molecular subtypes (TCGA, 2011), achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores as follows: Differentiated (0.86), Immunoreactive (0.85), Mesenchymal (0.9), and Proliferative (0.89). Similarly, our models identified crucial oncogenic events, including the loss of TP53 and CDKN2A, and instances of whole genome duplication (AUROCs of 0.85, 0.99 and 0.8).<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, this work showcases the potential utility of standard of care digitized histopathology scans for imputing genomic patterns and predicting overall survival in OV. Our results suggest that imputation could provide a fast and scalable solution for deploying patient screening biomarkers, thereby playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histopathology,Machine learning,Ovarian cancer,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

But pathologist-led identification of TLS on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) stained images is time-consuming &#38; lacks standardization. We developed a deep learning (DL) approach to identify TLS on digitized H&#38;E whole slide images (WSI) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also elucidate underlying identified TLS biology by investigating corresponding transcriptomic profiles &#38; multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images.<br \/>Methods: DL model was trained using mature TLS (mTLS) annotated by 5 board-certified pathologists following standardized definitions across WSI of NSCLC, breast &#38; bladder cancers. Model was validated using blinded, exhaustive annotations on 60 WSI by the same pathologists in consensus. To identify underlying biology associated with model-identified TLS presence, phase 3 clinical trial of advanced NSCLC with H&#38;E and corresponding bulk RNA-Seq was analyzed using differentially expressed genes(DEG). Cellular phenotypes of model-identified TLS were elucidated in procured NSCLC WSI labeled with mIF panel &#38; then H&#38;E stained.<br \/>Results: DL model achieved a validation F1-score of 0.56 (precision=0.52). DEG analyses resulted in significant association of TLS related gene signatures with model-identified TLS presence (q&#60;0.05). Immuno-histopathological evaluation of model-identified mTLS revealed concordance with central clusters of CD20+ B cells surrounded by a mix of CD20+ B &#38; CD3+ T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a DL model to detect TLS in H&#38;E WSI &#38; demonstrated their concordance in transcriptomics and mIF. With further validation, DL identified TLS could potentially serve as an imaging-based biomarker in clinical outcome datasets.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{C5221500-9470-44A3-84BB-3F9A7E8F2637}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"11\">A.<b> Model development<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>Cancer type<\/i><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b><i>Training<\/i><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b><i>Validation<\/i><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Digitized H&#38;E Slides with mTLS by Pathologists<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">mTLS countby Pathologists<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Digitized H&#38;E Slides tested<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mTLS count by Pathologists (in consensus)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">True positive mTLS count(Model identified)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>NSCLC<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">98<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">283<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">99<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Breast<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">107<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">315<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Bladder<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">103<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">262<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">20<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">65<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">48<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"11\"><b>B.

However, to date these factors are not accounted for in clinical evaluation of PCa patients. Our team has developed methods based on matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) imaging to identify sets of ECM glycan and collagen molecules associated with PCa. In this study, we leverage computational imaging methods and pathomic textural features to assess the potential of MALDI imaging to guide the identification of regions in PCa hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&#38;E) images as tumor or non-tumor.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used a cohort of PCa patients (n=10), who have undergone radical prostatectomy, with grade groups GG3&#8722;GG5, and with available H&#38;E and N-glycan MALDI images. We used five MALDI images per patient representing the distribution of N-glycan species at 1419, 2539, 2686, 1663, and 1809 m\/z. For each MALDI image, an N-glycan mask was generated and co-registered with the corresponding H&#38;E image via computational imaging methods (i.e., Otsu thresholding, largest connected components labeling, sequential affine and B-spline registration using mutual information). To quantify the overlap of each mask with tumor regions, we calculated Dice scores between the masks and the pathology annotation in H&#38;E. To assess differences in imaging patterns of regions indicated by the different masks, we extracted a set of pathomic textural features (n=70) from the H&#38;E image within each mask using PyRadiomics, and we performed Wilcoxon signed rank tests across all pathomic textural features for all paired combinations of the five masks.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The mean Dice scores between the pathology tumor annotation and the N-glycan masks from 1419 (0.56 [0.44&#8210;0.65]) and 2539 m\/z (0.64 [0.59&#8210;0.82]) was significantly higher (p&#60;0.008) than the Dice score of 1663 (0.24 [0.17&#8210;0.36]), 1809 (0.31 [0.13&#8210;0.45]), and 2686 m\/z (0.32 [0.19&#8210;0.37]). This suggests a large overlap between 1419 and 2539 m\/z and tumor, and large overlap between 1663 and 1809 m\/z and non-tumor regions. Consistent with these results, our pathomic textural analysis showed that 50 out of 70 features were significantly different (p&#60;0.05) between the masks derived from 1419 and 1663 m\/z, 52 between 1419 and 1809 m\/z, 62 between 2539 and 1663 m\/z, and 57 between 2539 and 1809 m\/z (p&#60;0.05). Moreover, there were only 23 significantly different features between 1419 and 2539 m\/z (p&#60;0.05), and 0 features between 1663 and 1809 m\/z.

Here, we developed an interpretable deep-learning model that robustly predicts patient overall survival (OS) and identifies unique PD-L1 enriched neighborhoods linked to patient prognosis.<br \/>We utilized a dataset of 507 NSCLC patient biopsy samples prospectively acquired as part of the DFCI ImmunoPROFILE project. Each sample was stained for Cytokeratin as tumor marker, PD-L1, PD-1, CD8, and FOXP3 using a targeted multiplex immunofluorescence assay. Inner tumor regions of interest were automatically processed for spatially resolved identification and quantification of marker expression at the single-cell level.<br \/>The dataset was divided into 380 patients for model development and 127 for testing. The deep-learning model, a graph neural network (GNN), was trained to predict OS based on local cell neighborhoods using a weakly supervised training paradigm. The GNN models neighborhoods as a graph, with cells and their corresponding marker expression representing nodes and edges connecting adjacent cells, for an average of 42 cells per neighborhood. Survival predictions were obtained by averaging predictions over all neighborhoods from one sample.<br \/>The GNN model demonstrated robust performance with a concordance index (c-index) of 0.79 on the test data, surpassing traditional metrics such as TPS and immune marker density-based models (c-index: 0.50 and 0.74, respectively).<br \/>Beyond assessing performance, we investigated the features learned by the GNN using k-means clustering in the model&#8217;s feature space. We identified three clusters that were notably enriched in PD-L1 positive tumor cells. The first cluster shows an especially &#8220;high TPS&#8221; phenotype, where the GNN predicted such neighborhoods to be generally poor for survival. The other two clusters were additionally enriched with PD-L1 positive immune cells (ICs) and associated with favorable survival predictions. Notably, one cluster was also enriched with other types of ICs (&#8221;PD-L1 IC mixed&#8221;), which the GNN predicted as especially favorable for survival compared to exclusive enrichment of PD-L1 ICs (&#8221;PD-L1 IC dominant&#8221;). A score summarizing these three PD-L1 expression patterns was significantly associated with OS (p-value: 0.01; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.16-1.27), validating the features learned by the GNN.<br \/>In sum, we developed a highly interpretable deep-learning model leveraging cellular neighborhood graphs, which effectively identifies expression patterns correlating with NSCLC prognosis, offering promise for developing personalized treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor microenvironment,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

While both receptors are well established targets for cancer therapy, greater understanding of the relationship of their expression patterns in human cancer is needed to establish the scope of therapeutic potential. To evaluate the co-expression pattern of EGFR and HER3, cancer FFPE tissue microarrays from several cancer types were evaluated by immunofluorescence imaging and digital pathology, including cell-by-cell marker intensity and spatial analyses within the tumor and stromal compartments. Tissue cores were assigned H-scores, and individual cells were binned into 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ scoring based on established digital pathology methods using QuPath software. Spatial cytometry was used to further evaluate single-cell expression intensity. Analysis was conducted widely on multiple normal human tissues as well as cases of NSCLC adenocarcinoma n=86, NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma n=84, SCLC n=43, TNBC n=45, Biliary tract cancers n=80, Nasopharyngeal carcinomas n=60. Overall, the results of this analysis show the intermediate to high prevalence of EGFR and HER3 co-expression within each indication, as well as the frequency of EGFR and HER3 expressing cells. Furthermore, EGFR and HER3 heterodimers were confirmed by proximity ligation assay in certain index cases. Notably, of several observations, we observe NSCLC cases show a profound absence of EGFR- HER3+ tumor cells. Additionally, we observe that co-expression of EGFR and HER3 in normal human tissues is rare and of low signal intensity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,ErbB3,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Using deep learning, we can predict properties of the TME from standard Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) stained slides, including specific gene expression signatures. While past models were limited to single signature predictions, we explore the potential of multi-task deep learning to identify multiple biomarkers at once, allowing more complex relationships and interactions to be modeled simultaneously. Our study focuses on the prediction of expression patterns of tumor, stromal, and immune cells in breast cancer (BC).<br \/>We developed a multi-task transformer-based deep regression model, trained in a weakly-supervised setting, to predict biomarkers in the TME from routine H&#38;E-stained pathology slides of a BC cohort (n=876). The performance was evaluated using Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient (r) and spatial heatmaps generated via gradient-weighted class activation mapping.<br \/>Our model achieved a significant correlation coefficient above 0.40 (p&#60;0.0001) for all predicted TME biomarkers in the holdout test set (n=176). This includes the biomarkers lymphocyte infiltrating signature score (r=0.46, p&#60;0.0001), tumor infiltrating lymphocyte regional fraction (r=0.48, p&#60;0.0001), leukocyte fraction (r=0.43, p&#60;0.0001), stromal fraction (r=0.42, p&#60;0.0001), and tumor cell proliferation (r=0.47, p&#60;0.0001). Notably, the model's heatmaps highlighted the pertinent cells and histological characteristics for its predictions.<br \/>These data show that our deep learning model accurately predicts multiple TME biomarkers concurrently from routine pathology slides. This approach offers a promising avenue for cost-effective and efficient biomarker quantification in the TME, with potential applicability across various cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Tumor microenvironment,Computational pathology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

However, current immunohistochemistry protocols in clinical practice are restricted to one to six markers (cell types) and rely on multiple rounds of antigen retrieval and sequential staining over two days. This current workflow has high risk for tissue and signal loss. Hence, we explored utility of a single step staining workflow using 15 distinct antibodies conjugated novel flours (Argo Dye System) of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor microarrays and imaged on the Orion microscope (Rarecyte). Fidelity of the staining was assessed by comparing data from the Orion platform to internally developed clinical grade assays. The implementation of higher plex imaging will enable greater insight into immune surveillance, mechanisms of resistance and patient stratification while minimizing patient tissue required for analysis.<br \/>Study Design: We utilized a custom panel developed by RareCyte (Hoescht, CD3e, CD4, CD8a, CD20, CD68, CD163, FOXP3, Ki67, Pan-CK, PD1, PDL1, CD45, Granzyme B, LAG3) to evaluate expression of immune markers on a pan-tumor and melanoma TMA including Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, ovarian cancer, esophageal carcinoma, hepatic cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer. Serial sections were stained with 6-plex clinical grade assays, and correlation scores were determined between the 15-plex Orion and 6-plex assays utilizing TSA-based amplification.<br \/>Results: In this study, the performance of Orion platform was assessed by quantitative and qualitative measures. Linear regression between the 6-plex clinical grade assays and 15-plex Orion workflow were calculated for a panel of biomarkers including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD163, CK, FOXP3, GZMB, Ki67, and PD1. Our results demonstrated that the Orion performed similarly to clinical grade assays both in terms of proportion of cells and fluorescence intensity (R<sup>2<\/sup> ~ 0.7-0.98, Slope ~ 0.7-1.1).<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that the Orion platform offers a reliable and efficient solution for comprehensive biomarker analysis. Our results demonstrate that this platform can successfully capture the expression of 15 biomarkers on a single FFPE slide which offers workflow advantages over traditional TSA-based fIHC multiplexing that is limited to detection of 6 biomarkers on a single slide. The ability to analyze a wider range of biomarkers through a single platform has the potential to enhance the efficiency of biomarker analysis, leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes in clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Immuno-oncology,Imaging,Multiplex automation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.
