[{"Abstract":"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and combinations of immuno-oncology therapies with standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapeutic agents has shifted therapeutic paradigms for patients with multiple cancer indications. For many patients, these combinations have shown a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes and disease management. However, additional combination therapies are still needed. Preclinically, a comparison of responses from SoC chemotherapies and ICI combinations in multiple disease models may be helpful in identifying optimal treatment combinations in the clinic. Here we report the results of multiple SoC\/ICI in vivo combination efficacy studies in a large panel of mouse syngeneic models spanning seven tissue origins: 1) Colon: CT26, MC38; 2) Breast: EMT6, 4T1; 3) Kidney: Renca; 4) Bladder: MB49, MBT2; 5) Skin: B16F10, CM3; 6) Lung: TC1, LL\/2, M109; 7) Brain: GL261. The advantage of using syngeneic models is not limited to the rapid and reproducible tumor growth, but importantly that the animals also have an intact immune system and clinically relevant tumor microenvironment, which are required for ICI combination studies. We tested &#62; 10 chemo SoC combinations with a murinized anti-PD-1 antibody (DX400) in 14 syngeneic mouse models. We found that multiple SoC regimens combined well with DX400 treatment, including FOLFIRI, FOLFOX (colon), Carboplatin\/Paclitaxel, Carboplatin\/Pemetrexed (lung), Capecitabine\/Docetaxel, Cisplatin\/Gemcitabine (bladder), Cisplatin\/5-FU\/or capecitabine, and Oxaliplatin\/5-FU\/ or capecitabine (gastric). Specifically, we observed that the SOC\/ICI combinations resulted in enhanced antitumor activities compared to single-agent treatments in many of the models. These data, particularly specific SoC combination regimens that combine well with ICIs in each disease, are useful for optimizing promising combination approaches for clinical development and will be presented here.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Combination therapy,Syngeneic tumor model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

LMD is an aggressive, late-stage development of cancer, which is increasing in prevalence as improved treatments for systemic malignancies are discovered. It leads to significant neurological morbidity and mortality, and outcomes remain poor despite improving cancer treatment strategies. There is a large population of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressing cancers, such as breast and lung cancers, who suffer from leptomeningeal metastasis. There has been evolving research looking at antibody drug conjugates for treatment of these primary pathologies, such as Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (TDxd), which shows improved progression free survival and overall survival in those with HER2 expressing primary cancers, as well as in intraparenchymal brain metastasis. However, as of yet there has been no study of its utility in LMD. Additionally, use of immune check point inhibitors (ICI) for treatment of LMD has been studied, showing some efficacy, but less robust response than that in intraparenchymal brain metastasis. Given the significant population of patients who continue to be affected by leptomeningeal metastasis, there is significant need for an improved treatment regimen. We hypothesize that TDxd will have a killing effect on HER2 expressing LMD cells, which can be further potentiated by the addition of ICIs. To test this hypothesis, we developed breast and lung cancer cell lines (SKBrM-LMD, and H2030BrM-LMD) that express HER2 and preferentially metastasize to leptomeningeal space. These cell lines were also labeled with luciferase. We then treated these cell lines with TDxd and found that TDxd had significant growth inhibitory effect on these cells <i>in vitro<\/i> when compared to the control. Furthermore, we educated human T Cells against the SkBrM-LMD cells and treated these cells with the aforementioned T cells plus the ICI Anti-PD1. Our results showed that ICI had significant killing effect when compared to the control. We have also created an <i>in vivo<\/i> LMD model by performing intraventricular injection of HER2 expressing tumor cells into a mouse model, which can be used for testing the efficacy of TDxd and ICI by intrathecal injection. In conclusion, our results indicate that TDxd and ICI have significant killing activity against HER2 expressing LMD cells, and therefore intrathecal administration of these drugs is a promising treatment modality that will be demonstrated using a mouse LMD model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2\/neu,Anti-PD-1,Leptomeningeal Disease,Trastuzumab Deruxtecan,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

While immunotherapies have shown promise in improving long-term melanoma survival, its treatment efficacy is limited, with only 50% of patients responding. Focused ultrasound (FUS) offers as a non-invasive strategy for targeted tumor ablation, thereby strengthening immunotherapy efficacy by release of tumor associated materials. However, control over tumor material release through FUS, without causing excessive thermal damage to surrounding healthy tissue remains challenging. To address this challenge, our group has previously developed acoustically active nanoparticles (AANPs) responsive to low intensity ultrasound for mechanical tumor ablation by generating strong and durable acoustic cavitation in the tumor tissue. Building upon previous success with AANPs, our current work focuses on sensitizing melanoma tumors to checkpoint inhibitor therapy by releasing tumor antigens into circulation using AANPs and FUS. Our findings revealed sensitization of an immunologically cold B16-F10 metastatic melanoma tumors following treatment, which resulted in a notable 12-day stall in tumor growth. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors &#945;-PD-L1 and &#945;-CTLA-4, this approach showed a complete response in B16-F10 bearing mice with impressive memory immune response upon a tumor rechallenge. Herein, these novel AANPs represent a promising advancement to enable accurate immune surveillance by boosting the release of tumor antigens and offers new strategies for improved immunotherapy of melanoma and other solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Nanoparticle,Ultrasound,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

It is abundantly expressed on thyroid tumor cells, making TSHR a compelling target for advanced thyroid cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

Inhibition of ERBBs using either monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for use for the treatment of various types of cancers. Despite relative success, many patients acquire resistance to long-term benefit due to alternative compensatory signaling pathways. Accordingly, activating mutations or overexpression of HER3 has been reported in many cancers, such as breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, melanoma, head and neck, cervical and prostate cancers. Here, we report the discovery of a humanized anti-EGFR x HER3 IgG-like bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The ADC takes a asymmetric 1+1 form through HC-HC and HC-LC charge-based heterodimerization, which is then conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload via a cleavable linker. The affinity of EGFR and HER3 was optimized to improve the therapeutical window, and has shown potent anti-tumor efficacy in various tumor models with limited toxicity supporting further development in clinic.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>An anti-EGFR x HER3 bispecific ADC (PM1300) was generated by introducing unique mutations to the CH1-CL domains of each binding arm to avoid HC-LC mispairing. KIH mutations were also introduced to each CH3 domain to support HC\/HC heterodimerization and generate an IgG-like bispecific with one arm binding to EGFR and the other to HER3. TOP1i payload was conjugated to the IgG-like bispecific by the endogenous cysteine residues at DAR 8 via a clearable linker.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Through affinity optimization, PM300 was found to preferentially bind to EGFR\/HER3 double-positive cells rather than EGFR single-positive cells. PM1300 showed significantly increased internalization and anti-proliferation activity against EGFR\/HER3 double-positive cells, with limited activity towards single positive-cells. PM1300 used an optimized linker for better payload release and serum stability. PM1300 induced a potent anti-tumor efficacy in various CDX models representing different EGFR and HER3 expressing levels and mutations. Importantly, PM1300 exhibited a good safety profile in NHP consistent with the optimal affinity for EGFR and HER3. These results demonstrate that PM1300 has a promising efficacy\/safety therapeutical window in preclinical models supporting further development in the clinic.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>A bispecific ADC targeting EGFR x HER3 was discovered, named PM1300, which has an asymmetric 1+1 IgG-like structure and optimized affinity. This allows for preferential binding to EGFR\/HER3 double-positive cancer cells, rather than EGFR single-positive cells. This may significantly contribute to minimizing safety risk that is common for EGFR-targeting agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Tumor antigen,EGFR,EGFR TKI resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

The Gas6\/Axl signaling pathway contributes to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by increasing the expression of PD-L1 and tumor-derived chemokines. This results in increased infiltration of macrophages, monocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, but decreased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells in the tumor bed. The PD-1\/PD-L1-mediated signaling pathway is a well-known mechanism responsible for T-cell inhibition, consequently disrupting their ability to eliminate tumor cells. In addition, AXL and PD-L1 are concurrently highly expressed in many tumors. Therefore, bispecific antibody that inhibits both axes seems like a promising therapeutic strategy engaging anti-proliferative effect by AXL inhibition, and cytotoxic properties of effector T cells by breaking the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Bispecific antibody CPL976 was designed as a VHH-Fc-VHH format, with two VHHs raised against PD-L1 and two against AXL. Activity, selectivity, and potential for internalization and degradation of targets were studied on cancer cell lines with different expression levels of the targets. In addition, CPL976 efficacy was verified in syngeneic mouse models, when antibodies were administered intravenously at different doses for 3 weeks.<br \/>Results: We confirmed the CPL976&#8217;s innovative mechanism of action based on the strong and simultaneous engagement of both therapeutic targets, and potential internalization and degradation of target proteins in cancer cell lines with different expression levels of AXL and PD-L1 (MDA-MB 231, A375, A549, H1299). Potent and dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity was observed in the syngeneic mouse model, where at a dose of 15mg\/kg remission of the tumor was observed in 5\/8 compared to 0\/8 in the control group.<br \/>Conclusions: CPL976 is the bispecific antibody that combines the effects of cancer inhibition by interacting with AXL and immunotherapy by disrupting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis. The use of the bispecific antibodies simultaneously targeting PD-L1 and AXL provokes internalization of the targets to maximize the biological effect of the inhibition of the receptor\/ligand complexes (AXL\/cGAS6, PD-1\/PD-L1) formation. <b> <\/b> Simultaneous action on both therapeutic targets may help achieve an enhanced immune response against cancer cells and lead to tumor eradication and overcoming the primary and secondary resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Axl,Bispecific antibody,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Functionally, it is involved in trans-cellular flux of phosphate in the small intestine and in the synthesis of surfactant in lung alveoli. NaPi2b is reported to be expressed at a high frequency in ovarian carcinoma as well as in NSCLC, bladder, endometrial and papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup>1<\/sup>, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis <sup>2, 3<\/sup>. The purpose of this study was to characterize the <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity and tolerability of NaPi2b-PL2202, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized, Fc-silenced IgG1 antibody directed against human NaPi2b, to which PL2202, a novel payload containing a valine-alanine cleavable linker and a camptothecin warhead, has been site-specifically conjugated with a drug to antibody ratio of 6. In addition, the level of NaPi2b expression in selected human tumor specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). <i>In vitro<\/i>, NaPi2b-PL2202 showed good binding affinity for mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and human NaPi2b, and displayed highly potent, targeted cytotoxicity against various NaPi2b-expressing tumor cell lines. NaPi2b-PL2202 also exhibited strong <i>in vitro<\/i> bystander activity. <i>In vivo<\/i>, intravenous (IV) administration of a single dose of NaPi2b-PL2202 at 6.6 mg\/kg resulted in substantial tumor regression in the OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma xenograft model, with 3\/10 partial responders (PR) and 7\/10 complete responders (CR), and all CRs being tumor-free at the end of the study (Day 44). In the G-402 renal leiomyoblastoma xenograft model, administration of a single IV dose of NaPi2b-PL2202 at 3.3 mg\/kg was associated with durable antitumor activity and resulted in 1\/10 CR, with this animal remaining tumor-free by the end of the study (Day 42). With respect to toxicity, in single dose studies in male rats, NaPi2b-PL2202 was tolerated up to 300 mg\/kg IV. Furthermore, in a dose-range finding study in male cynomolgus monkeys, NaPi2b-PL2202 was well tolerated up to 40 mg\/kg IV given on Day 1 and 22. Finally, cell membranous NaPi2b expression was confirmed by IHC in a panel of tissue microarrays including ovarian, lung, bladder and endometrial cancers. In conclusion, NaPi2b-PL2202 demonstrated specific and potent<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity, and was tolerated at high doses in toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, indicating a good therapeutic index. Together, these observations support future clinical development of NaPi2b-PL2202 for the treatment of NaPi2b-expressing cancers. 1- Bodyak N.

While Trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 directed ADC, has shown impressive clinical activity in HER2-expressing cancers, the ability to predict responses of ADCs by IHC has been limited. Dato-DXd is a TROP2 directed ADC that is currently being studied in a number of registrational phase 3 trial incld. TROPION-Lung01. In the phase 1b TROPION-Pan tumor 01 trial (TP01) response to Dato-DXd did not correlate to TROP2 IHC expression. Here we investigate molecular determinants of sensitivity to Dato-DXd using short-term microfluidic culture of patient derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS).<br \/>Methods: Surgical NSCLC cases collected from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and St. Elizabeth&#8217;s Medical Center under an IRB approved protocol were studied. PDOTS were generated as previously described. <i>Ex<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> response was assessed by live\/dead imaging, TROP2 antigen density on EPCAM+ cells by flow cytometry (FCM) and by immunofluorescence (IF). T cell and myeloid cell populations were analyzed by FCM of CD45+ cells isolated during tumor preparation. For a subset of samples single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed.<br \/>Results:Eleven NSCLC explants were studied. Two specimens were excluded due to excess of fibrotic material. Response to Dato-DXd was measured by change in raw live cell area compared to control samples. Median response to Dato-DXd was -48.5% (ranging from +33.9% to -77.8%). Using a cut-off of -40%, four cases were characterized as non-responders (NR) and 5 as responders (R). Tumor TROP2 expression by IF ranged from 0 to 3+ with no relationship between TROP2 expression and response being observed. TROP2 staining positivity by IF didn&#8217;t correlate to Dato-DXd sensitivity <i>ex vivo<\/i>. TROP2 FCM, on the other hand discriminated between responsive and non-responsive models in 100% of the cases, using a cutoff of MFI &#62;13000. Furthermore, we observed an increase of tumor CD8 abundance in Dato-DXd R compared to NR (median %CD8 in R 10.3% (range 5.1%-62.5%); median %CD8 of live cells in NR 2.3% (range 1.2%-3.7%) p-value 0.029). Conversely, we also observed a trend of higher granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells abundance in NR compared to R (NR median %gMDSC of CD15+ cells 84.1% (range 73.4%-90.2%) ; R median %gMDSC 61.7% (range 54.3%-90.6%); p-value 0.069)<i>. <\/i>In 2 cases with high and low TROP2 MFI available scRNAseq data showed TROP2 expression exclusively in tumor cells, with further analysis ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: By functionally profiling NSCLC PDOTS that retain immune cells, we correlated multiple parameters with <i>ex vivo<\/i> response to Dato-DXd. Our results have important implications for precision deployment of ADCs and suggest that target tumor antigen density in conjunction with addition immune cell features may refine patient selection strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Ex vivo,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

It has become an attractive target for cancer therapies in recent years. ILB-3101, a potential best-in-class ADC, was constructed by conjugating a potent mitotic inhibitor Eribulin to a proprietary anti-B7H3 mAb through a proprietary linker. This ADC molecule has been developed and preclinically evaluated as both the 1st line ADC treatment with B7H3 expressed patients in Eribulin sensitive cancer types and the later line treatment for patients whose cancer are B7H3 positive but TopoI inhibitor resistant.<br \/>The humanized antibody of ILB-3101 is IgG1 type and shows high affinity to both human and monkey B7H3 proteins. It also shows better internalization than benchmark antibodies such as that of DS-7300 analog. The DAR value of ILB-3101 is 3.5. ILB-3101 has potent and dose-dependent cytotoxicity to B7H3-positive tumor cells and shows better activities than DS-7300 analog as positive control. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies based on xenograft tumor models reveal that ILB-3101 has potent anti-tumor activities in various tumor types including TNBC, sarcoma, ovarian cancer and AML etc., which are superior or comparable to DS-7300 analog. Furthermore, ILB-3101 shows strong anti-tumor activity on Dxd based ADC resistant tumors in xenograft tumor models. The PK study of ILB-3101 in cynomolgus monkeys shows dose-dependent exposure and desirable PK profile. ILB-3101 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with HNSTD at 6 mg\/kg. No serious adverse events were observed, and the main safety findings were limited and reversible hematological and immunological effects, which are consistent with the safety profile of Eribulin as an approved chemotherapy.<br \/>The <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical results above demonstrate that ILB-3101 has good efficacy and safety profile and it is a promising and potentially best-in-class B7H3 targeting ADC drug candidate.

It potently regulates a network of downstream effector kinases in the AMPK family, thereby exerting major effects on cell signaling, metabolic activity, and epigenetic patterning. Clinically loss of STK11 in NSCLC is associated with poor response to immune checkpoint blockade. Several mechanisms of immune resistance have been identified involving both tumor intrinsic pathways as well as changes in the immune microenvironment. Dysregulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, specifically cIAP1 has been identified as a specific resistance mechanism, which was shown to also influence the STING pathway in the context of STK11 loss. However, there is a gap in understanding how loss of STK11 influences cIAP1 signaling.We evaluated cIAP1, its TRAF family member binding partners, and downstream NF-kB and immune signaling using a multiomic approach. Using CPTAC multiomic data of 110 lung adenocarcinomas, we observe discordance between protein vs mRNA expression for cIAP1, which shows no significant association with STK11 loss in mRNA, but is significantly over-expressed at the protein level (P&#60;1e-4). Conversely, we identify TRAF2 as the only TRAF member whose expression is increased in STK11-deficient NSCLC, with concordant increase in both mRNA (P&#60;1e-8) and protein (P&#60;1e-10). Further, on the protein level TRAF2 and cIAP1 levels were highly correlated (P&#60;1e-12), strongly suggesting that TRAF2 is the proximal factor driving dysregulation of cIAP1 signaling in these tumors. We also observe a correlated pattern of phosphorylation sites within cIAP1, TRAF2, and other NF-kB signaling members that we putatively link to STK11 loss. We confirm that TRAF2 mRNA is consistently over-expressed in STK11 deficient NSCLC across multiple additional transcriptomic datasets together comprising &#62;2000 tumors. Across this large dataset we observe that among STK11-deficient tumors, TRAF2 is anti-correlated with NF-kB signaling and immune infiltration signatures, a relationship that is strikingly absent among the STK11-WT subset. Using GEMM cell lines (KRAS, TP53, STK11 GEMM; Winslow lab, Stanford), we derived STK11 mutant vs WT isogenic pairs and performed T-cell co-culture experiments using ovalbumin antigen and OT-I CD8 T-cells. This showed that inhibition of cIAP1 using birinapant was synergistic to CD8 cytotoxicity, as previously known, but the synergy was much more pronounced in STK11 mutant vs STK11-WT context (Bliss index 38, P&#60;1e-10). Together, these data demonstrate that the link between STK11-loss and cIAP1 dysregulation is likely through over-expression of TRAF2, and support the strategy of targeting TRAF2\/cIAP1 to overcome immune resistance STK11-deficient NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Targeted therapy,Serine\/threonine kinase,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

It remains one of the few malignant tumors with rapidly increasing mortality and morbidity. Patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer continue to experience poor outcomes. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a class of targeted therapeutic modalities that offer biomarker-based therapeutic options for patients with endometrial cancer. In this study, we proposed to identify a novel molecular target for the preclinical development of an ADC for endometrial cancer-targeted therapy.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Firstly, to determine the level of target expression within endometrial cancer tissue components as well as differences, we performed immunohistochemical staining of human endometrial cancer and paracancerous tissue. Secondly, the expression of the target on the cell membrane surface was quantitated and qualitatively verified using flow cytometry and single-photon confocal microscopy. In the third step, an endocytosis assay was used to verify the endocytosis of the target antibody by EC cells. Confocal imaging can directly observe the endocytosis of the target antibody, and flow cytometry can be analyzed and quantified. Co-localization experiments with antibody fluorescence can verify the specific site where the target antibody is endocytosed into cancer cells. We then designed and characterized two targeted ADCs. Next, the <i>in vitro<\/i> inhibitory activities of these ADCs against endometrial cancer cell lines and normal cells were evaluated using the CCK8 assay.

The high cell surface expression of ICAM1 was verified in a panel of various human endometrial cancer cell lines. Moreover, two ICAM1 ADCs were established using clinically-approved ADC linker and payload combinations. It was visually confirmed that ICAM1 ADCs selectively recognize endometrial tumors and efficiently enter endometrial cells via antigen-mediated endocytosis. We compared the anti-tumor activity of ICAM1 ADCs with standard-of-care chemodrugs, and ICAM1 ADCs outperformed chemodrugs in the CDX model of endometrial cancer without toxicity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified that ICAM1 is a promising ADC target for endometrial cancer and confirmed the potent anti-tumor activity and biosafety of ICAM1 ADCs <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, warranting further pre-clinical and clinical investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),ICAM1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Although surgical removal of tumors and chemotherapy can initially eradicate cancer, many patients eventually experience relapse with chemotherapy-resistant tumors, resulting in poor long-term outcomes and chemotherapy complications. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are formed by integrating the tumor specificity provided by antibodies (Ab) and small molecule cytotoxicity drugs and can facilitate highly targeted delivery with minimal toxicity to normal tissues. Our group has identified that the overexpression of a novel target, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), is associated with poor prognosis and survival of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. We have developed a monoclonal antibody (AM6) that effectively targets HSPG2-expressing tumors. In this study, we used a novel glycoengineering strategy to introduce artificial azide groups at the N-glycan sites of AM6 without affecting its antigen affinity and intracellular localization. The azide groups were then used for site-specific conjugation of the cleavable dibenzyl cyclooctyne - monomethyl auristatin E (DBCO-PAB-MMAE) linker (drug conjugate) to form an AM6 antibody-drug conjugate (AM6 ADCs). Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and liquid chromatography\/quadrupole time-of-flight\/mass spectrometry (LC\/Q-TOF\/MS) confirmed the successful conjugation of the DBCO-PAB-MMAE to the AM6. In-vitro cytotoxicity studies of AM6 ADCs in OVCAR8 (high HSPG2 expression) and CAOV3 (regular HSPG2 expression) showed the cell line dependent response with lower IC50 in OVCAR8. These results suggest that the effectiveness of AM6 ADCs is proportional to the HSPG2 expression levels of the cells. Future studies will be aimed at the in-vivo evaluation of optimized antibody-drug conjugates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Targeted drug delivery,Glycosylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) and pathologic response were used to evaluate the efficacy of the NACI treatment. Adverse events apparently related to NACI treatment were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared using the log rank test. Additionally, we calculated the area under curve (AUC) to compare the predictive value of PD-L1 expression with baseline serum lipid biomarkers for patient response.<br \/>Results: Our analysis involved 104 advanced OSCC patients who received NACI. Notably, the top three grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were Alopecia (104; 100%), Anemia (81; 77.9%) and Pruritus (62; 59.6%). Only one patient developed grade 3-4 TRAEs due to increased aminotransferases. The pathological complete response (PCR) rate was 47.1%, and the major pathological response (MPR) rate was 65.4%. Importantly, patients achieving MPR exhibited higher CPS. The diagnostic value of CPS as a biomarker for NACI efficacy was enhanced when combined total cholesterol (TC) level. Our findings from DFS and OS suggested that patients who underwent NACI before surgery experienced improved survival compared to those who accepted the surgery alone.<br \/>Conclusions: The data from this study proved evidence that NACI treatment is safe and encouragingly efficacious in treating advanced OSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Cancer chemoimmunotherapy,Combination therapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In many patients, failure of antigen-directed therapies such as CAR T-cell therapies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) or radioligand therapies (RLT) has less to do with a lack of potency or specificity of the agent and more to do with variable and suboptimal antigen expression in the patient. We are developing combination therapies that introduce a priming agent designed to optimize antigen expression in the patient and improve the therapeutic window of existing antigen-directed therapies. Our high-throughput platform utilizes machine learning and automation to scale functional combinatorial screening for small molecule priming agents using cell lines and patient samples. Using this platform, we are identifying priming therapies for CD123, CD33, CD22, and CD19 in hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and HER2, HER3, and TROP2 in solid tumors including breast cancer.For our CD123 program, we have identified priming agents that selectively upregulate CD123 expression &#8805;2-fold on AML cells without increasing expression on normal myeloid progenitor cells, which also express CD123. AML cells treated with a CD123 priming agent in combination with a CD123 ADC showed greater tumor-cell killing compared to the ADC alone. In comparison, normal myeloid progenitor cells from healthy bone marrow treated with the same CD123 priming-ADC combination treatment did not show an increase in ADC-mediated cell killing. From our mechanistic studies, we have identified a somatic mutation associated with CD123 upregulation that may lead to selective upregulation on cancer cells and not on normal cells. Additionally, this marker can be used for patient selection. We have also observed CD123 upregulation in vivo using mouse models of AML and are currently conducting additional in vivo proof of concept studies to demonstrate that CD123 priming therapy enhances efficacy.There are two distinct advantages of a priming approach paired with an antigen-directed therapy, which include: (1) improving the durability of patient responses and (2) expanding the patient population. Our priming combination approach has the potential to overcome antigen heterogeneity and thereby improve the clinical success of antigen-directed therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),ErbB2,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

To date 6 ADCs have been approved in solid tumors against 5 targets (HER2\/ERBB2, Folate alpha, Tissue Factor, Nectin-4, and Trop-2). Thus far, no ADCs have been approved for head and neck cancers.<br \/>Methods: We queried protein expression data from a publically available consortium of datasets (TNMPlot.com) containing protein expression data from over 56,000 tumor and normal samples from GEO, GTex, TCGA, and TARGET databases. Genes examined for protein targets, included those with ADC targets of both presently approved and investigational drugs from clinical trials.The level of overexpression was determined as the percent of tumors over the 75<sup>th<\/sup> percentile of expression in normal tissue.<br \/>Results: Protein expression data were available for 99 HNSCC samples. Among targets with ADCs available, increased protein expression was seen in HNSCC for 0% of ERBB2 (n=0\/99), 38% of FOLR1 (n=38\/99), 0% of TACSTD2 (n=0\/99), and 42% of F2 (n=42\/99) genes.Among gene targets with investigational ADCs, increased protein expression was seen in HNSCC for 35% of of AXL (n=35\/99), 13% of B7H3\/CD27 (n=12\/99), 50% of EGFR (n=50\/99), 63% of VTCN1 (n=63\/99), 10% of MSLN (n=10\/99), 77% of CDH3 (n=76\/99), and 39% of PDGFRA (n=39\/99).<br \/>Conclusion: Increased protein expression for approved ADC targets were infrequent in HNSCC.

They present a diagnostic challenge with overlapping morphological features and variable patterns of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. There is a lack of consensus on how to best manage advanced NMCSpC and limited reports of immunotherapy (IO) responses. This study reviews the efficacy of IO in NMCSpC and performs comprehensive tumor profiling to identify biological rationale for IO use in this rare group of tumors.<br \/>Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective review of all locally-advanced or metastatic NMCSpCs treated with IO. Blinded histopathology reviews occurred to confirm each diagnosis. Overall response rates (ORR) were collected as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria 1.0. Comprehensive tumor profiling included whole exome sequencing for tumor mutational burden (TMB) and ultraviolet(UV)-signatures, and IHC for immune-cell infiltration (CD103\/CD4\/CD3\/CD8\/CD20) and immune-checkpoint expression (PD-L1\/TIGIT\/LAG3).<br \/>Results: 7 patients were identified. Median follow up was 18.1 months (range: 5.3-34.7). ORR 86% (6\/7) with five complete responses (CR). One patient who achieved stable disease progressed. Responses were durable with two patients in CR &#62;30 months after IO commencement. Blinded pathological review identified 3 SpSCC, 2 PDS and 2 spindle cell tumors of unclear sub-classification. All patients had high TMB and UV-signatures. One patient had PD-L1 100% (combined positive score) with abundant immune-cell infiltration and LAG3 expression (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: In advanced NMCSpC, excellent responses to IO with durable disease control was observed. IO is worthy of further exploration in these patients. UV-signatures and high TMB could be used to help select patients for treatment.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

In absence of guideline recommendations, it is unclear what factors drive providers in selecting 1L treatments for aRCC. To address this gap, we described the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with aRCC who received 1L NIVO+CABO, PEM+LEN, or NIVO monotherapy in the RW setting.<br \/>Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, treating oncologists from a US nationally representative network abstracted electronic health record data from patients with aRCC who initiated 1L NIVO+CABO or NIVO monotherapy (off-label in the US) between 2\/1\/2021 and 6\/12\/2023, or PEM+LEN between 9\/1\/2021 and 6\/12\/2023. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized descriptively.<br \/>Results: Compared with patients who received NIVO+CABO (n = 200) or PEM+LEN (n = 100), patients who received NIVO (n = 147) were relatively older at 1L initiation (Table). Sex, race, and region of residence were comparable across cohorts. Patients who received NIVO were more likely to have an ECOG PS score of &#8805; 2 (59.2%) compared with NIVO+CABO (14.5%) or PEM+LEN (20%) cohorts. The distribution of MSKCC or IMDC risk scores at 1L initiation was comparable across cohorts . Grade 3 or 4 tumors were reported among 56.5%, 41.0%, and 43.5% of those who received NIVO+CABO, PEM+LEN, and NIVO, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: This study suggests that 1L treatment for aRCC using IO monotherapy may be more likely to be considered than IO-TKI therapy for older patients and those with poorer ECOG PS, possibly reflecting perceived tolerability of TKI combinations in these patient populations. Further research is needed to understand the impact of these 1L treatment selection patterns on outcomes.<br \/>Table: Key patient characteristics at 1L initiation.<table class=\"AbstractTable\"

ICI-PI ranges from asymptomatic hyperamylasemia to acute pancreatitis(ICI-AP), and its clinical features are not fully understood. We investigated the frequency and clinical features of ICI-PI and ICI-AP as well as their possible risk factors. Of the 186 consecutive cases who received ICI for GI cancers in our hospital from January 2020 to May 2022, 185 could be evaluated for serum amylase(AMY) levels pre- and post- ICI treatment. We retrospectively examined the clinical features and predictors of ICI-PI. Hyperamylasemia of grade 2 or higher according to CTCAE(v.5.0) was considered ICI-PI, and cases with other obvious factors were excluded. In the case of ICI-AP, we analyzed the pathological features of the tissues collected by EUS-FNA as well as the clinical features. The median of ICI doses was 6.0(range, 1-64), and the median duration of observation was 236 days(range, 17-1162). There were 25 cases of hyperamylasemia (higher than ULN) before starting ICI treatment. After starting ICI treatment, 14 patients(7.6%) developed ICI-PI, in all cases grade 2. The median time to onset of ICI-PI was 37.5 days(7-715). No cases discontinued ICI dosing due to ICI-PI, and no cases developed obvious pancreatic endocrine or exocrine insufficiency during the observation period. Overall survival was significantly longer in cases with ICI-PI than in those without ICI-PI(MST; 855 vs. 347days, p=0.029) and there was a trend toward longer PFS(MST; 160 vs. 96 days, p=0.057). Multivariate analysis revealed that only pretreatment serum AMY level(&#8805;80 U\/L) was a significant independent predictor of developing ICI-PI(HR: 5.00, 95% CI: 1.057-23.668, p=0.04). ICI-AP occurred in 2 cases(1.1%), both of them discontinued ICI treatment. Both cases showed enlarged pancreas on CT scan, negative serum IgG4 level, and responded well to steroid therapy. Pathological findings showed lymphoplasma cell infiltration, flower-like fibrosis, and obstructive phlebitis, which were similar to type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis(AIP) in one case. In the other case, neutrophil infiltration was observed in the stroma and epithelium, similar to type 2 AIP. The best overall response was PR in both cases with ICI-AP. The findings of this study indicate that higher pretreatment serum AMY levels may increase the probability of ICI-PI. ICI-PI cases without pancreatitis did not show any pancreatic endocrine or exocrine insufficiency during the observation period without interruption of ICI treatment and had favorable prognosis, but a more long-term evaluation of the impact on pancreatic function is needed. The clinical implications of ICI-related hyperamylasemia and its differences from ICI-AP remain uncertain and need to be explored in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Pancreas,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, the real-world evidence of Atezo+Bev in uHCC is limited, especially in China. We aimed to investigate the real-world effectiveness and safety of Atezo+Bev in Chinese patients with uHCC.<br \/>Methods: Patients with uHCC treated with Atezo+Bev were included at 5 centers in China from Jan. 2021 to Jan. 2023. Overall response (ORR), organ-specific response rate (OSRR), disease control rates (DCR), time to disease progression (TPP), progression&#8208;free survival (PFS), metastasis-specific PFS and overall survival (OS) were calculated.<br \/>Results: Among 48 patients, the median age was 58.4 years with 85.4% being male. A total of 35 and 13 patients received Atezo+Bev as 1<sup>st<\/sup> and 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line treatment, respectively. The median number of treatment cycles were 8, and 27 (56.3%) patients received locoregional therapies. Detailed treatment response is in the Table. The overall ORR and DCR assessed by mRECIST were 60.4% and 75.0%, while the intra- and extrahepatic OSRR were 59.4% and 62.5%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 14.5 months, the median PFS was 8.5 months (95%CI: 4.4, 11.2) in 1<sup>st<\/sup> line setting and 5.1 months (95%CI: 2.1, 7.9) in 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line setting.

However, second-line treatment options are still controversial with limited overall survival. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of different second-line regimens for relapsed ES-SCLC after first-line immuno-chemotherapy.<br \/>Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 96 ES-SCLC patients receiving first-line immuno-chemotherapy in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from Jan 2019 to Dec 2022. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. The clinical outcomes, including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and standard log-rank test.<br \/>Results: From January 4, 2019 to December 18, 2022, a total of 96 ES-SCLC patients received first-line immuno-chemotherapy and 49 of them went through second-line treatment in our center. Patient characteristics were listed as follows : median age 63 (31-79), male 76 (79.2%) , heavy smoker 59 (61.5%), liver metastasis 40 (41.7%), brain metastasis 33 (34.4%) and refractory recurrence 58 (60.4%). Second-line treatments included immunotherapy crossover and combination with chemotherapy (n=40), anlotinib with or without chemotherapy (n=5), chemotherapy alone (n=4). ORR of the whole group in the second-line setting was 22.4%. Median PFS was 3.23 months (95% CI 1.96-4.50).

BALVERSA (erdafitinib), a selective pan-<i>FGFR<\/i> kinase inhibitor, has shown clinical activity against <i>FGFR<\/i> altered solid tumors in pts who exhausted standard treatment options. It is important to understand the prevalence of <i>FGFR<\/i> alts and relationship between <i>FGFR<\/i> alts and PD-L1 expression levels in different cancer types.<br \/>Methods: In this real-world study, 9937 Chinese solid tumor pts with the PD-L1 (22C3) immunohistochemistry and OrigiMed 450-gene next-generation sequencing panel results were selected. Chi-square test and Fisher test were used to explore the association between the <i>FGFR<\/i> alts and PD-L1 expression.<br \/>Results: <i>FGFR1-4<\/i> somatic alts were found in 9.0% of Chinese cancer pts evaluated. <i>FGFR1<\/i> amplification (amp) was the most prevalent alts identified (1.9%). There were no significant differences in frequency of FGFR alts between the Chinese cohort and MSK-IMPACT cohort in each cancer type tested. Up to 40.6% of pts evaluated were PD-L1 positive (CPS &#8805;1 or TPS &#8805;1%). The PD-L1 positive rate (TPS &#8805;1%) in SCLC (12.4%, n=121) and NSCLC adenocarcinoma tumors (LUAD) (26.1%, n=2902) was relatively low. In few tumor types, higher expression of PD-L1 in FGFR altered samples was observed compared with FGFR unaltered samples in pan-tumor (mean TPS 14.8% vs.8.6%, <i>P<\/i>=6.0*E-9; mean CPS 6.3 vs. 6.1, <i>P<\/i>=3*E-4). Those includes LUAD (mean TPS 14.2% vs. 7.4%, <i>P<\/i> = 1.7*E-16), colorectal tumor (mean CPS 4.6 vs. 3.9, <i>P<\/i> = 4.6*E-8), and uterine tumor (mean CPS 8.1 vs. 6.5, <i>P<\/i> = 9.6*E-5). While PD-L1 expression is lower in FGFR altered samples than FGFR unaltered samples in UC (n=154; mean CPS 3.9 vs. 6.8, <i>P<\/i> = 0.004). No relationship was observed between FGFR alts and PD-L1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma (n=610). Specific <i>FGFR<\/i> alts eligible for erdafitinib UC treatment were further investigated in UC and observed with rate 10.4%, including <i>FGFR3<\/i> short variants (9.7%) as main alts. Specific FGFR altered tumors showed similar trend with lower PD-L1 expression than <i>FGFR <\/i>unaltered tumors in UC. The inverse relationship between <i>FGFR<\/i> alts and PD-L1 expression in UC compared to other solid tumors may explain variable role of <i>FGFRs<\/i> since the predominant <i>FGFR<\/i> alt types vary among different cancer types (<i>FGFR3<\/i> short variants enriched in UC vs no such predominant <i>FGFR<\/i> alt types in other cancer types).<br \/>Conclusion: The large Chinese solid tumor cohort analysis showed comparable <i>FGFR<\/i> alts prevalence between Chinese and Western population.

While baseline molecular assessments have provided clues to prognostic factors, insights into resistance drivers remains elusive. This is partially due to the difficulty in getting access to post progression samples from patients that were either primary resistant or developed acquired resistance after an initial response to ICB. Thus, the tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic features that are selected for during progression and potentially drive primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy remain underexplored.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To compare clinical features and immunogenomic drivers of acquired and primary resistance to ICB across major cancers, we analysed and annotated de-identified patient records in the Tempus real-world database. We built an immuno-oncology cohort consisting of &#62;2500 multimodal (DNA, RNA and clinical outcome data) pre-treatment baseline with &#62;1500 post-treatment tumour biopsy samples from mainly NSCLC, TNBC, HNC and Bladder cancer patients. We used bulk RNA-seq data to estimate activation of the hallmark oncogenic pathways and immune cell composition and used panel DNA-seq data (&#62;500 genes) to quantify mutation selection at the gene and pathway levels using <i>dndscv<\/i>.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Compared to acquired, primary resistant patients tended to have a higher observation of liver lesions at progression. Post-ICB, acquired resistant NSCLC and HNC patients showed a significantly inflamed tumour microenvironment (TME) characterised by higher estimation of infiltration of T cells and myeloid cells and higher activation of interferon gamma (IFNg) signalling as compared to primary resistant patients. In addition, in post-ICB acquired resistance in NSCLC we observed selection for mutations in genes involved in known immunomodulatory pathways, including loss-of-function mutations in <i>B2M<\/i>. Consistently, acquired resistance patients showed stronger selection for mutations in Hedgehog and Notch pathways as compared to primary resistance patients across NSCLC, HNC and TNBC post-ICB.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Acquired and primary ICB resistant patients have distinct clinical and molecular features at progression. Their tumours&#8217; TME is fundamentally different with acquired resistance TMEs being infiltrated with immune cells albeit escaped post progression. In addition, ICB selects mutations that potentially activate pathways such as Notch and Hedgehog. This multi-modal Real-World Data with post therapy biopsies has given insights for patient selection strategies and provides rational into combination treatment options for acquired resistant patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Acquired Resistance,Tumor microenvironment,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

MET exon 14 (METEx14) mutated and MET amplified NSCLC tumors have shown varied response to immunotherapy. Therefore, we sought to compare the genomic and immune landscape of MET-altered NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: The genomic profiles of 3,821 NSCLC tumors sequenced using the Strata Select assay on the Strata Oncology Platform were analyzed. Tumors were sorted based on METex14 mutations, MET amplification (METamp) defined as copy number gain (CNG) &#8805;6 and MET wild-type (METwt). The RNA expression of 19 immune regulatory genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), Strata Immunotherapy Response Signature (IRS) score and the frequency of gene co-alterations were compared across groups. Statistical comparisons of medians were done with Kruskal-Wallis testing and categorical comparisons with Chi square using R Studio version 4.3.2.<br \/>Results: 122 (3.2%) METex14, 70 (1.8%) METamp, and 3,629 (95.0%) METwt were identified. Patients with METex14 were older and more frequently female. MET gene expression was found to be higher in METamp (median 14.4) compared to METex14 (median 12.3) (P&#60;0.01). TMB was lowest in METex14 (median 2.7) group compared to METamp (median 7.1) and METwt (median 5.1) (P&#60;0.001). High PD-L1 expression occurred in 71.4% of METamp, 68.0% of METex14 and 41.3% of METwt (P&#60;0.001). Overall, METamp tumors had a greater proportion of high IRS scores (52.9%) compared to METex14 (35.2%) and METwt (45.4%) (P&#60;0.01). mRNA expression of immune checkpoints CTLA4, PD-1, LAG3, IDO1, TIGIT and HAVCR2 were all higher in METex14 compared to METamp and METwt (P&#60;0.001 for all). METex14 tumors also exhibited higher gene expression of CD4, CD8A and FOXP3 compared to METamp and METwt (p&#60;0.001). METex14 had higher prevalence of MDM2 amplification (34% vs 3% vs 4%) and lower prevalence of alterations in EGFR (0.8% vs 22% vs 21%), KRAS (0.8% vs 10% vs 26%), CDKN2A (17% vs 29% v 28%) and TP53 (34% vs 87% vs 64%) compared with METamp and METwt tumors, respectively (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusion: METex14 and METamp tumors harbor distinct immune-gene expression profiles and co-occurring gene alterations that distinguish themselves from each other and METwt tumors. Further analysis must be conducted to determine how these variations impact immunotherapy in MET-altered NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
