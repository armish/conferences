[{"Abstract":"The median survival time for newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is 15 months, highlighting the need for improved therapies. Current treatment for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM consists of tumor resection and chemoradiation therapy. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a central obstacle in the treatment of GBM. Lack of NK cell and CD8+ T cell infiltration prevents efficacy with immunotherapies like immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).One approach our lab is pursuing to enhance tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is through harnessing the anti-viral cGAS-STING pathway. Upon cGAS activation by cytosolic double stranded DNA, the TBK1 kinase is phosphorylated, initiating a subsequent type I interferon (IFN) response and the recruitment of immune cells. This pathway is commonly altered in many cancer types to evade immune activation. Our lab has demonstrated survival benefits with STING agonist treatment in immunocompetent GBM mouse models. We have also shown strong STING localization in the vasculature, implicating endothelial cells as a potential treatment target for anti-tumor efficacy. Here we investigated the potential role of tumor vasculature in mediating the effects of STING agonists in GBM therapy.We have shown robust cGAS-STING activation in brain endothelial cell lines through enhanced secretion of CXCL10, IFN-&#946;, and RANTES upon STING agonist treatment <i>in vitro<\/i>. Western blotting also shows pathway activation in response to treatment through increased phospho-TBK1 levels. Activation was further potentiated by manganese.To investigate the effects of STING activation in brain endothelial cells in detail, we performed RNA sequencing. This showed 262 differentially expressed genes in response to pharmacologic cGAS-STING activation, with 183 of these being upregulated. The top gene ontology terms enriched include type I interferon signaling pathway, defense response to virus, and antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, TAP-independent. In addition, gene expression of tight junction protein Claudin 5 was also enhanced. We have also shown increased resistance in response to activation, through transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) assays. Taken together, these results suggest that cGAS-STING activation in endothelial cells leads to tight junction remodeling in addition to immunomodulatory changes, implicating roles for endothelial cells in barrier function and immune cell interactions respectively. Current research in our lab focuses on elucidating the mechanisms behind these changes. Our goal is to identify beneficial endothelial cell changes which promote anti-tumor immunity in order to inform future treatment strategies. We are currently performing studies aimed at demonstrating that cGAS-STING activation in endothelial cells is critical for the efficacy of STING agonist treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Endothelial cells,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The efficacy of immunotherapies for BC is limited, with response rates of &#60;10% for anti-PD-1\/PDL1 monotherapy in pre-treated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients and even lower in subtypes that express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) and\/or hormone receptors. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve immune based strategies for BC. One possible approach to enhance response is the application of intratumoral (IT) immunotherapy utilizing IL-12; a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that is critical in producing an anti-tumor response. However, systemic delivery of IL-12 has substantial toxicity and localized delivery of protein has insufficient residence time. To circumvent these issues, we have previously reported the efficacy of intratumorally injected plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12-EP) followed by electroporation in a TNBC mouse model and in clinical trials. Following pIL-12-EP, treated tumor expressed genes that were associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, activation, trafficking, antigen presentation, and exhaustion. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of tumor infiltrating immune cells from treated tumors revealed a striking enrichment of the CXCL9\/10\/11\/CXCR3 family. This CXCR3 axis is upregulated in response to IFN&#947; production and has been studied extensively in melanoma and NSCLC patients as a potential predictive biomarker for responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors but has not been well characterized in BC. We hypothesized that this axis may be the critical component downstream of pIL-12-EP treatment that is responsible for anti-tumor responses and that targeting it will be effective in other molecular subtypes of BC beyond TNBC. We first evaluated the expression of CXCR3 by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in biopsies of human HER2+ BC. Using a single cell resolution spatial transcriptomic Xenium instrument we find not only expression of CXCR3 by TILs, but can also track the distance and gradients of the chemokine ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 in this tumor microenvironment. Having confirmed the activity of this axis in human HER2+ BC, we used our well-established spontaneous HER2-driven mouse model to compare treatment of HER2+ tumors with pIL-12-EP or pCXCL9-EP intratumorally. We observed tumor growth inhibition in both treatment groups as compared to control treated tumors. Interestingly, the abscopal effect previously seen with pIL-12-EP was not evident for distant tumors in mice treated with pCXCL9-EP. These data suggest that IT CXCL9 therapies may benefit from combination with a systemic immune activator like a vaccine or immunogenic chemotherapy. Ongoing studies will continue to evaluate ways to better target this axis therapeutically and define clinically active combination therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,Cytokines,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Here we demonstrate that ADT-030 binds RAS with high affinity and inhibits MAPK\/AKT signaling with high potency and selectivity in KRAS mutant cells to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis. ADT-030 also inhibits phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10) that is overexpressed in cancer cells to selectively activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)\/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling, which induces phosphorylation and degradation of the oncogenic pool of &#946;-catenin. ADT-030 exhibited cytotoxicity to a variety of murine cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>, and inhibited tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent mice when orally administered. The antitumor activity of ADT-030 was diminished in mice that were immunodeficient or depleted of CD8+ T cells, indicating a critical role of the host immune system. In a metastatic breast tumor mouse model (4T1), ADT-030 not only delayed the growth of the primary tumor but also reduced tumor colonization in the lungs, leading to increased survival. CyTOF and scRNAseq analyses provided a plethora of information revealing the impact of ADT-030 on the immune milieu in the tumor microenvironment. Notably, ADT-030 selectively induced apoptosis of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) while CD8+ T cells were not affected. Consequently, ADT-030 treatment resulted in a marked reduction of MDSCs, which was accompanied by increased tumor infiltration of effector CD8+ T cells. ADT-030 treatment of cancer cells led to immunogenic cell death and enhanced dendritic cell activation. Furthermore, the ability of ADT-030 to augment the antitumor activity of immune checkpoint blockade therapy underlines its potential as a desirable immune-potentiating agent to improve the outcome of cancer immunotherapy. ADT-030 represents a development candidate ready for IND-enabling safety assessment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Immunomodulation,Oncogene,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"M.

The early successes of Blincyto, a CD3 engager, demonstrated its capacity to activate host pan-T cells irrespective of their TCR-pMHC restriction status. However, this broad activation has been linked to off-target immunotoxicities, thus limiting its therapeutic applicability. In response, targeting immune co-stimulatory receptors like CD28 or 4-1BB has gained attention by their expression being induced on activated immune effector cells, presenting a more targeted approach to cancer therapy.<br \/>Methods: We developed RACE, a novel bispecific 4-1BB engager. This platform fuses a 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) trimer with antibody F(ab&#8217;)2 fragments, excluding Fc domains. A Key and lock design on the 4-1BBL trimer interface facilitates asymmetric assembly of 4-1BBL dimer and monomer in the endoplasmic reticulum, achieving over 95% assembly efficiency in mammalian systems.<br \/>Results: RACE differs from conventional 4-1BB agonistic antibodies in its ability to form natural hexagonal hyper-clusters of 4-1BB receptors, enhancing NF-&#954;B signal transduction. Unlike first-generation 4-1BB antibodies, which incurred off-tumor hepatotoxicity, RACE selectively activates 4-1BB receptors only in the presence of tumor antigens. Enhanced cytotoxicity requires successful TCR signaling complex formation between T cells and cancer cells. In CT26 and MC38 tumor models, RACE not only induced strong anti-tumor effects without hepatic or systemic toxicities but showed synergistic efficacy with anti-PD-1 antibodies as well.<br \/>Conclusion: The novel RACE platform represents a potent as well as safe immuno-oncology strategy, demonstrating significant potential for clinical application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,T cell engager,Tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"D.

Despite the ongoing development of numerous STING and TLR agonists for this purpose, none of them have progressed to late-stage clinical evaluation. Alpha protein kinase-1 (ALPK1) is an intracellular innate immune receptor newly identified for its ability to detect ADP-heptose, a metabolite released during the biosynthesis and degradation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Since heptose is not naturally present in mammalian cells, the recognition of heptose metabolites by ALPK1 serves as a reliable mechanism to identify bacterial infections. When ADP-heptose binds to ALPK1, it initiates the phosphorylation of TIFA, thereby triggering a cascade of immune responses. Systemic administration with ADP-heptose induces robust ALPK1-dependent cytokine responses in mice. While high doses of ADP-heptose demonstrate anti-tumor effects, its instability and low <i>in vivo<\/i> potency hinder its clinical development. Through a SBDD medicinal chemistry effort, a novel, stable, and potent ADP-heptose analog, designated PTT-936, has been discovered and is progressing into clinical evaluation in cancer patients. PTT-936 exhibits remarkable nanomolar potencies for ALPK1 activation in various cellular assays. Notably, in human PBMCs, PTT-936 induces both concentration-dependent release of cytokines and activation of NK and T cells. Consistent with <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, oral administration of PTT-936 triggered significant cytokine responses in mice at microgram dose levels. However, overt toxicities were observed only at milligram dose levels, indicating a wide therapeutic window for this compound. In syngeneic tumor models, oral administration of PTT-936 induced dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, which correlated with elevations in several cytokine biomarkers. Mechanistic studies show that PTT-936, working exclusively through the ALPK1 pathway, elicited strong innate and adaptive immune responses, as evidenced by robust cytokine induction and immune cell activation and recruitment. In syngeneic mouse models, the anti-tumor effects of PTT-936 were significantly hindered by either CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell depletion or neutralization of select cytokines. Besides monotherapy studies, compelling evidence demonstrates strong synergistic anti-tumor effects when combining PTT-936 with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Intriguingly, PTT-936 exhibits favorable tolerability and a wider therapeutic index compared to certain clinical-stage STING and TLR agonists. Furthermore, PTT-936 does not enhance cytokine elevations induced by checkpoint inhibitors, which have been linked to adverse events (including CRS) observed in clinical combination studies. The dosing frequency of PTT-936 in the upcoming first-in-human clinical trial is carefully designed to prioritize both tolerability and patient compliance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,ALPK1 agonist,Liver-targeting,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yupeng Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nana Du<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaona Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuebing Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Hong<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaolong Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhijiang Ji<sup>1<\/sup>, Qianyu Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yun Lv<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhichen Shi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yajuan Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaofu Hou<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaxin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Juan Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Rui Mao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yinxin Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Liang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingjin Ding<sup>2<\/sup>, Hexiang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Nan Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Counde O’Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhihong Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Keith Bley<sup>3<\/sup>, Feng Shao<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pyrotech (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Pyrotech Therapeutics, Inc., Reno, NV,<sup>4<\/sup>National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd91f0d7-d5d8-4576-845c-ed37d7f6900d","ControlNumber":"2336","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Immune responses were measured by flow cytometry and Nanostring transcriptomic analyses of bladder tissues. An intravesical dose of ZH9 after orthotopic MB49 tumour inoculation demonstrated significant survival benefit compared to both vehicle control and equivalent colony forming unit (CFU) BCG treatments. Repeat, weekly dosing studies showed a single administration of ZH9 was sufficient for maximum efficacy. To explore the durability of protection, surviving intravesical ZH9 treated animals were rechallenged, demonstrating protection from both bladder and subcutaneous MB49 tumors suggestive of lasting local and systemic anti-tumor immunity. Flow cytometry analysis of bladders showed that intravesical ZH9 treatment resulted in cellular immune response characterised by recruitment of NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and dendritic cells with an activated, cross-presenting phenotype, in all cases of greater magnitude than after treatment with an equivalent dose of BCG. Based on observations that pre-existing immunity to BCG has been associated with improved outcomes to intravesical BCG therapy in NMIBC, we explored whether systemic priming with ZH9 benefits local bladder therapy. Systemic prime with ZH9 followed by a single intravesical dose of ZH9 showed a trend for improved survival and will be explored in the clinical setting. This systemic immune priming effect was associated with enhanced local bladder immune cell infiltrates and the upregulation of more than 150 immune response genes in the bladder compared to intravesical therapy alone. These data form the basis of preclinical package accepted by the FDA for a Phase 1\/1b study evaluating the safety, pharmacology, and clinical effect of ZH9 treatment in patients with NMIBC, currently recruiting patients. The investigation includes thorough translational and biomarker studies to delve into the mechanism of action of ZH9 and explore patient stratification approaches. By easing the treatment burden on patients, lowering healthcare costs, and featuring a scalable manufacturing process, ZH9 has the potential to revolutionize the treatment paradigm in NMIBC and reshape the patient journey.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bacterial therapy,Bladder cancer,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

The high presence of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in TME cause a suppressive environment that promotes the tumor growth and its treatments failure. Tregs trafficking is controlled by CXCR4. In RCC, the new CXCR4 antagonist R54 was explored in peripheral blood Tregs isolated from primary RCC patients.<br \/><i>Experimental Design:<\/i> To investigate the mechanism by which the new CXCR4 antagonist R54 impairs Tregs activity, peripheral blood (PB) Tregs were explored on primary RCC patients. PB-Tregs were isolated from 77 RCC patients and 38 healthy donors-(HD) and CFSE-Tregs suppression assay, IL-35 secretion and Nrp-1+Tregs frequency was conducted. PB-Tregs were analyzed for PTEN, CD25, TGF-&#946;1, FOXP3, DNMT1 expression. PTEN-pAKT signaling was evaluated in the presence of R54 and\/or triciribine (TCB), Akt inhibitor. TSDR (Treg-specific Demethylated Region) methylation analysis was conducted.<br \/><i>Result:<\/i> Ex vivo R54 impaired PB-RCC-Tregs function, reduced IL-35 release and Nrp-1+Tregs. As PTEN and CD25 expression significantly decreased in R54-PB-RCC-Tregs, PTEN signaling was evaluated. While CXCL12 recruited PTEN+CD25+Tregs cells, R54 significantly reduced it in PB-RCC-Tregs. Tregs activation through IL-2\/PMA impaired pAKT+Tregs while R54 increased it. The Akt inhibitor, triciribine, prevented the pAKT+Tregs R54 induction. As active Tregs present demethylated Treg-specific region (TSDR), a significant decrease in demethylation rate (DMR) of Foxp3-TSDR was observed in R54 treated PB-RCC-Tregs. As consequence of TSDR modulation, the expression of Tregs regulating genes was evaluated with significant reduction in DNMT1 and FOXP3 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that R54 causes an impairment of peripheral Tregs functionality in primary RCC patients through regulation of PTEN\/PI3K\/AKT pathway, resulting in impaired Tregs activity.<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> The CXCR4 antagonist R54 affects Tregs function in primary RCC patients through regulation of PTEN\/PI3K\/AKT pathway, reduction in TSDR demethylation and Foxp3 and DNMT1 expression. CXCR4 targeting is thus a strategy to inhibit Tregs activity contributing to the CXCR4 function in RCC tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CXCR4,Tregs,PTEN,Tumor suppressor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) along with melanoma has traditionally been viewed as an immunotherapy responsive disease with a storied history of immunotherapy treatments including high dose interleukin 2 (IL2), interferon, and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Indeed, RCC was one of the first tumor types to garner FDA approval for PD1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). However, unlike melanoma, most RCC tumors do not have a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) to potentially explain their immunotherapy responsiveness. We and others have sought to explain this unanswered question and have demonstrated that <i><u>non-canonical tumor associated antigens<\/u><\/i> like endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) may in part explain ICI response in RCC. We have noted that ccRCC tumors have the highest level of retained introns (RI) across all TCGA tumors, that RI levels are secondary to suppressed non-sense mediated decay (NMD) activity, and that one can subset ccRCC into RI-high and normal-like tumors. Moreover, we have found that mTOR signaling plays a key role in regulating NMD and intron retention and that mTOR inhibition can promote intron retention. We hypothesized that these aberrantly retained introns could serve as a rich source of highly foreign, tumor associated neoantigens and that of retained intron neoantigens, the ones not observed in normal tissue would be the most immunogenic. We derived a so called &#8220;Neo-RI-antigen burden&#8221; that represents the burden of retained intron neoantigens not found in normal tissues and demonstrate that the Neo-RI-antigen burden of complete responders is numerically higher than those with partial response or progressive disease in a dataset of immunotherapy treated melanoma patients. Our work suggests the possibility of using NMD-targeting drugs as a potential therapeutic in combination with ICI to enhance the overall treatment response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,NMD,ICI response,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The tumor immunoprevention efficacy is long-lasting (&#62;14 weeks) and contingent upon CD4<sup>+<\/sup> immune cells, NK cells, and IFN-&#947;, but not CD8+ T and B cells. Trained immunity mediated by previously activated myeloid cells has been shown to have efficacy against cancer. The objective of this study was twofold: i) assess the role of trained immunity and ii) elucidate the mechanistic underlying of cancer immunoprevention.<br \/><b>Study Design: <\/b>Wild-type C57BL\/6 mice and various transgenic (CD4<sup>+<\/sup> OT-II.Rag<sup>+\/+<\/sup>, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> OT-II.Rag<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>OT-I\/Rag2<sup>-\/- <\/sup>KO, and Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) mice on C57BL\/6 background were pretreated subcutaneously with SA-4-1BBL or an agonistic Ab that does not have immunoprevention efficacy (3H3) twice two weeks apart. Mice were challenged two weeks later with a cervical cancer cell line (TC-1) and monitored for tumor development. A group of mice was also treated with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), an agonist of TLR4 involved in trained immunity, using the above scheme.

To enhance response to immune-based therapies, specific targeting of immunomodulatory pathways has been investigated through co-stimulatory gene targets, the microbiome, and more. An emerging biomolecule is Transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are a class of RNAs that transport amino acids from the cytoplasm to ribosomes, and synthesize new proteins encoded by mRNA transcripts. tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a category of cleaved, mature tRNA that participate in post-transcriptional regulation and have been implicated in the modulation of cancer and other immune-associated diseases. While tRFs are primarily implicated in diagnostic signatures for various cancers, few studies have investigated their role in modulating the immunotherapy-based response in HNSCC. In this study, we characterized the role of tRFs in modulating immunotherapy gene targets pertinent to HNSCC.<br \/>Methods: We extracted tRF read counts from MINTbase 2.0 for 455 primary HNSCC tumor samples and 44 adjacent normals. Differential expression analysis was first performed to identify tRFs implicated in HNSCC tumors, with respect to adjacent normal tissue. Next, these tRFs were associated with immunotherapy target genes and response markers with Spearman&#8217;s correlation. Further characterization of these tRFs was performed by correlating their abundance to infiltrating immune cells, pathway enrichment of immunotherapy targets, and clinical variables.<br \/>Results: Significant differential expression of tRFs were found between HNSCC primary tumor samples and adjacent normal tissue, including 7 tRFs (FDR &#60; 0.05, |log fold change| &#62; 0.5). All were enriched in normal samples. AlaCGC5tRF appeared to be an important regulator of immunotherapy target genes through increased co-expression of PTPN11, STAT3, and PTEN (p-value &#60; 0.05, R &#62; 0) and decreased co-expression of CD58 and TNFRSF14 (p-value &#60; 0.05, R &#60; 0). Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) genes were significantly correlated with several tRFs. Among several pertinent tRF markers, AlaCGC5tRF was strongly associated with negatively correlated with infiltrating activated NK cells na&#239;ve CD4 T cells (p-value &#60; 0.05, R &#60; 0).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study is the most comprehensive to date to characterize the role of tRF elements in modulating HNSCC immunotherapy targets. We found several potential tRF biomarkers that may be indicative of enhanced immunotherapy treatment susceptibility, including AlaCGC5tRF and ArgTCT3tRf. Further studies are needed to investigate how these tRFs may be targeted alongside immunotherapies to enhance response to treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint,Head and neck cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

RP2 is an enhanced-potency oncolytic HSV-1 that expresses GM-CSF, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, and the fusogenic gibbon ape leukemia virus membrane R&#8722; glycoprotein (GALV-GP-R&#8722;). Here, we present the biomarker data of RP2 monotherapy and RP2 + nivolumab (nivo; anti-PD-1) in patients (pts) with MUM from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04336241).<br \/>Methods: Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected pre-treatment and at Day 43 (D43). The tumor microenvironment (TME) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Systemic peripheral anti-tumor immunity was assessed by sequencing the CDR3&#946; region of the T-cell receptor (TCR) using immunoSEQ Assay. HLA typing was obtained from patient history when available. Correlations between baseline tumor PD-L1 and CD8 expression, HLA type, prior treatment with ipilimumab (ipi)\/nivo, and HLA status&#8212;vs clinical response status&#8212;were assessed.<br \/>Results: As of August 2022, 17 pts with MUM were enrolled (RP2 monotherapy, n = 3; RP2 + nivo, n = 14). The majority of pts had previously received both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy (12\/17, 70.6%), and 17.6% had received &#8805;3 prior lines of therapy. ORR for the 17 pts was 29.4% (5\/17; all PRs; RP2 monotherapy, 1\/3; RP2 + nivo, 4\/14). Eight pts (2 PR, 3 SD, and 3 PD) had evaluable baseline and post-treatment biopsies for IHC, and 13 pts (4 PR, 4 SD, and 5 PD) had evaluable baseline and post-treatment PBMCs for TCR sequencing analyses. Of the 10 patients that achieved clinical benefit (PR\/SD), IHC analysis of all available (n = 5, 2 PR, 3SD) paired biopsies demonstrated an increase in intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression, and 4 patients (2 PR, 2 SD) exhibited an increase in CD8+ T-cell infiltration into tumors at D43. No increase in either CD8+ T-cell infiltration or PD-L1 expression was observed at D43 in patients with PD. There was no correlation between HLA-A2*02:01 status or prior treatment with ipi\/nivo and response. In addition, TCR sequencing revealed expansion of pre-existing TCRs (including a tumor antigen-specific clone targeting MART-1 in a responding patient) and generation of new T- cell clones, following RP2 + nivo.<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminary RP2 + nivo data demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in pts with MUM. Biomarker data indicated a conversion of the TME from an immune-excluded to an immune-infiltrated phenotype in responding patients following treatment with RP2 + nivo. Furthermore, systemic peripheral T-cell clonal expansion was noted. These results support further clinical development of RP2 + nivo in pts with MUM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Metastatic tumors,Oncolytic virus,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Image-guided percutaneous cryoablation is an established minimally invasive oncologic treatment that has demonstrated immune modulatory effects. We hypothesized that cryoablation may prime the tumor microenvironment (TME) through direct modulation of the tumor, thereby generating an anti-tumor response in ICI refractory tumors.<br \/>Methods: In this non-randomized phase II single-center study, subjects with unresectable melanoma progressing on ICI underwent cryoablation of an enlarging metastasis, and ICI was continued for a minimum of two additional cycles. The primary endpoint was safety and feasibility, with objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in non-ablated lesions a key secondary endpoint. To better understand the inflammatory state of TME as well as factors determining response to cryoablation, we performed immunohistochemistry (PD-L1, CD8+ TIL) as well as single-cell RNA-sequencing (ScRNAseq) on evaluable pre- and post-cryoablation biopsies obtained from metastatic sites of 15 patients.<br \/>Results: From May 2018 through July 2020, 17 patients were treated. This regimen was feasible with all patients ongoing cryoablation with no unexpected safety signal. The ORR and DCR was 23.5% (95% CI 6.81-49.9) and 41.2% (95% CI 18.44-67.08), respectively, with four patients experiencing PR and three patients SD. Durable control, defined as tumor control &#8805;6 months, was achieved in 35%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 59 days (95% CI 42, 179) with a 6-month PFS rate of 23.5% (95% CI 7.3%, 44.9%). Median overall survival (OS) was 387 days (95% CI 106, 608) with a 1-year OS rate of 53% (95% CI (27.6%, 73%). Correlative analysis demonstrated pre-ablation tumors were uniformly associated with a &#8220;cold&#8221; TME, as all samples were PD-L1 negative and the majority had low levels of CD8+ TIL, defined as &#706;5% of tumor cells associated with CD8+ TILs. ScRNAseq revealed no clear trends of cell type composition to predict best response to cryoablation, however an increase in B\/plasma cells was seen in patients with disease control, suggesting these cells may play a role in mounting a durable anti-tumor response after cryoablation.<br \/>Conclusion: The anti-tumor efficacy of combining cryoablation and post-progression ICI was superior to what would be expected with the use of post-progression ICI alone with an acceptable safety profile. Our data support further study of this novel, synergistic therapeutic approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Cryoablation,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

We purposely search for molecules that are critical for multiple cell types in the TME and identified nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) as one such molecule. NR4A1 has been shown to promote the aggressiveness of cancer cells and maintain the immune suppressive TME. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we establish NR4A1 as a valid therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Importantly, we have developed the first-of-its kind proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC, named NR-V04) against NR4A1. NR-V04 effectively degrades NR4A1 within hours of treatment in vitro and sustains for at least 4 days in vivo, exhibiting long-lasting NR4A1-degradation in tumors and an excellent safety profile. NR-V04 leads to robust tumor inhibition and sometimes eradication of established melanoma tumors. At the mechanistic level, we have identified an unexpected novel mechanism via significant induction of tumor-infiltrating (TI) B cells as well as an inhibition of monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (m-MDSC), two clinically relevant immune cell populations in human melanomas. Overall, NR-V04-mediated NR4A1 degradation holds promise for enhancing anti-cancer immune responses and offers a new avenue for treating various types of cancer such as melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,PROTAC,B Cell,NR4A1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Our approach consists in redirecting pre-existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through &#945;v integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a &#946;-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising &#62;10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world&#8217;s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. CMV infected mice receiving iRGD + CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells that produced significant amounts of IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; upon CMV peptide recall. Furthermore, tumor regulatory T cells (Treg) were significantly reduced and the CD8\/T reg ratio was greatly increased. Survival studies showed a 68% increase in median survival in the treated and infected group. Combining this strategy with anti-PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of iRGD + CMV therapy alone. Other combinations with chemotherapy and TME remodeling agents are being tested.Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors via iRGD and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity and iRGD in combination with chemotherapy is already in phase II clinical trials for advanced pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Antitumor effect,Neoantigens,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

However, cancer vaccine approach using conventional modalities such as protein, peptide, and mRNA is considered a powerful cancer treatment only when the patients have healthy immune systems. In addition, dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccine can be a great alternative therapy, but manufacture of DC vaccines in vitro is a labor-intensive, time- and money-consuming procedure. Here, we developed <u>S<\/u>pecific <u>T<\/u> cell <u>A<\/u>ctivating <u>M<\/u>odulator (STAM) on our engineered IgM backbone, ePENDY (engineered PENtamer boDY), with high avidity based on multivalent binding sites to overcome the disadvantages of other therapeutic cancer vaccines. STAM on ePENDY (STAM.eP) consists of ten peptide-loaded-HLAs linked to ePENDY to simulate priming signal of CD8+ T cell by TCR cluster and a costimulatory signal molecule is linked to J chain of ePENDY to prevent CD8+ T cell from becoming anergic status. With these features, STAM.eP mimics cognately licensed DC that can present tumor peptide-loaded MHC class I molecule to CD8+ T cell and promote its priming. Thus, one of the greatest advantages of STAM.eP is to be a potential treatment for immunosuppressive cancer patients with DCs that do not respond appropriately. Another advantage is that any tumor specific antigen (TSA), including from intracellular proteins, can be applied to STAM.eP concept to activate specific CD8+ T cells for targeting cancer cells. In this study, we used Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E7-derived peptide which is an oncoprotein associated with cervical and head\/neck cancers. We observed that HPV E7-derived peptide loaded STAM.eP, named IMB-401, increases antigen-specific CD8+ T cell population and shows cytotoxicity activity against cancer cells expressing HPV E7 protein in vitro test model. In vivo test model, it was also observed that population of specific CD8+ T cells and memory T cells were increased in the blood and spleens of transgenic mice treated with IMB-401. Furthermore, we confirmed that IMB-401 shows anti-tumor efficacy due to an increase of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell in vivo humanized mouse model. These results suggest that IMB-401 can be a new therapeutic cancer vaccine technology that replaces DC function and is expected to have robust anti-tumor activity in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Tumor targeting,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.-g.

ENPP1 expression in tumors is common and correlates with a cold tumor phenotype. Its loss has been reported to suppress metastasis, restore immune cell infiltration into the tumor and potentiate the response to immune checkpoint blockade, while, conversely, the overexpression of ENPP1 promoted metastasis and rendered tumors resistant to checkpoint blockade. RBS2418 was designed as a potent and selective inhibitor of ENPP1 and is in clinical development.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> ENPP1 enzyme inhibition was measured in vitro using cGAMP and ATP substrates. Effects of pH and serum and selectivity against related enzymes were evaluated. In vivo efficacy was assessed in Hepa1-6, and GL261-luc syngeneic liver and glioblastoma mouse models. Compound exposures were determined in tumor and blood samples. Cures were confirmed by re-challenge of cured animals with the same cancer cells.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>RBS2418 inhibited hydrolysis of cGAMP and ATP in vitro with similar potency (Ki =0.14 and 0.13 nM). Inhibition was also similar in human serum, consistent with low binding affinity to human serum albumin. In humans, oral dosing at doses of 100 mg could inhibit ENPP1 enzyme activity during the full dosing interval. Dosing of RBS2418 was performed in mice to achieve trough concentrations of RBS2418 in tumors and plasma exceeding ENPP1 EC90 levels for the complete dosing interval. In the Hepa1-6 model treatment with RBS2418 for either 2 or 10 days resulted in significant reduction of tumor growth and prolongation of survival as compared to vehicle control. There was no significant difference between the RBS2418 groups. Complete tumor regression was observed in 44% of treated mice across the two treatment groups. These mice were resistant to rechallenge with Hepa1-6 tumor cells. In the GL261-luc model treatment with RBS2418 showed significant reduction of tumor burden and prolongation of survival as compared to vehicle control. The mice that achieved complete tumor regression were resistant to rechallenge with GL261-luc tumor cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> RBS2418 inhibited ATP and cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 with similar high potency. The pharmacology profile was optimized to achieve low serum protein binding and oral bioavailability in humans. RBS2418 treatment was well tolerated in mice under conditions where tumor and plasma levels exceeding ENPP1 serum EC90 levels were achieved. In the syngeneic mouse models Hepa1-6 and GL261-luc significant tumor growth reductions, complete tumor regression and cures were observed.

PD-(L)1 blockade represents a recent breakthrough in immunotherapy with solid tumors, but only 20-30% of patients can benefit from the therapy and most responders eventually develop resistance. In more recent clinical studies with small number of subjects, HD IL-2 has shown promising responses in patients who progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy and combination therapy of HD-IL-2 and PD-1 blockade has resulted in high rate of objective response. In an attempt to maximize the clinical benefit of these immunotherapies to a broader patient population with deeper response and in the meantime to minimize the severe toxicity of HD IL-2, we have generated a novel bifunctional PD-1-proIL-2v fusion protein harnessing the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade and PD-1-cis directed tumor conditional IL-2R activation. PD-1-proIL-2v shows dose dependent inhibition of PD-1 immune checkpoint pathway measured by GM-CSF and IFN&#947; production in an MLR assay. Protease activated PD-1-proIL-2v, but not the intact drug, stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT5 of NK and T cells, the proliferation of CD8 T cells as well as the cytokine production in human whole blood. The potency of pSTAT5 by protease activated product is enhanced by 10-20 folds on PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells than T cells without PD-1. When tested in mouse tumor models resistant to PD-1 blockade, PD1-proIL-2v demonstrated high potency of tumor inhibition at as low as 0.1 mg\/kg dose. In contrast, non-targeted proIL-2v at molar equivalent or higher dose showed minimal antitumor effect in either monotherapy or combination with anti-PD-1. Analysis of PD-1-proIL-2v treated mice showed dramatically increased tumor infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, including PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>Tcf-1<sup>+<\/sup> and PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> IL-18Ra<sup>+<\/sup>TIM3<sup>-<\/sup> CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, referred to &#8220;stem-like&#8221; progenitor effector cells and &#8220;fresh&#8221; effector cells, respectively. Activation of the IL-2 procytokine in PD-1-proIL-2v was observed in mouse tumor tissues but not in the plasma. In monkey GLP-compliant 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study, PD-1-proIL-2v demonstrated excellent safety profiles without overt irAEs that are characteristic of IL-2. In conclusion, our preclinical data demonstrated that PD-1-proIL-2v effectively stimulated the expansion and reinvigoration of antigen specific T cells in the tumor tissue resulting in strong anti-tumor efficacy while it did not cause significant peripheral toxicity. Phase 1 clinical trial of PD-1-proIL-2v is planned to start in early 2024 to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity in advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Immune checkpoint blockade,Prodrugs,Immunocytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

To improve the developability of cytokines, AskGene has invented a proprietary cytokine platform (Smartkine&#174;) to achieve its overarching objective of modulating immune reactions at a disease site in a selective and controlled manner. Several antibody-cytokine fusion molecules using the SmartKine&#174; platform have been moving into preclinical and clinical development. ASKG812 is a unique fusion molecule composed of anti-PD-1 antibody and engineered IL-2 (eIL-2). The eIL-2 moiety also comprises a specific mask such that the eIL-2 molecule binding biases towards PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T effector cells in a <i>cis<\/i> agonism manner for improved efficacy and therapeutic window. In <i>ex vivo<\/i> human PBMC assays, we demonstrated that ASKG812 significantly reduced activity in PD-1<sup>- <\/sup>T and NK cells, and enhanced activity in PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T cells judged by levels of pSTAT5, Ki67 and Granzyme B. In a cytotoxicity assay, ASKG812 can efficiently induce PBMC-mediated killing of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in both anti-PD-1 therapy responsive and non-responsive syngeneic mouse tumor models, ASKG812 showed robust efficacy; without noticeable toxicity compared to a reference anti-PD-1-IL-2v fusion molecule. In conclusion, these findings provide the basis for the development of this new generation of PD-1 cis-targeted IL-2R agonists with enhanced therapeutic potential for the clinical treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Therapeutics,PD-1,Tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Notably, the high affinity of IL-2 for the IL-2 receptor &#945; (IL-2R&#945;) activates immune-suppressive Treg cells and endothelial cells, leading to undesired outcomes. To address this challenge, a number of clinical studies are under development including non-&#945; IL-2 variant (IL-2v) drugs and further the anti-PD-1 x IL-2v for targeted delivery of its IL-2v to PD-1 enriched T cells. Nevertheless, concerns about peripheral toxicity have not yet been solved. Thus, here we present MB5029, a novel anti-PD-1 x IL-2v bispecific fusion protein with modulated IL-2R binding affinity to mitigate the peripheral toxicity maintaining the anti-tumor efficacy. MB5029 has unique characteristics with no binding affinity to IL-2R&#945; and reduced binding affinity to IL-2R&#947;, which is widely and highly expressed in various immune cells. MB5029 exhibited strong STAT5 phosphorylation activity under activated conditions but weak activity in the resting conditions, while the anti-PD-1 x IL-2v (non-&#945;) showed strong STAT5 phosphorylation in both resting and activated conditions. In addition, MB5029 strongly induced the expansion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the activated conditions but less expansion of CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in the resting conditions, in contrast to anti-PD-1 x IL-2v (non-&#945;). The murine surrogate of MB5029 showed remarkable anti-tumor efficacy without body weight loss at the dose range of 1 to 10 mg\/kg, whereas anti-muPD-1 x IL-2v (non-&#945;) showed significant body weight loss in several tumor-bearing mice models. Moreover, MB5029 showed 100% complete regression (6\/6) at the dose of 5 mg\/kg or higher in the MC38 tumor model. The mice with complete response showed no signs of relapse upon tumor re-challenge until day 56, indicating a durable memory response. MB5029 exhibited a comparatively superior safety profile in normal mice. While anti-muPD-1 x IL-2v (non-&#945;) led to significant body weight loss at the dose of 5 mg\/kg in normal mice, the murine surrogate of MB5029 was shown to be well-tolerated up to a dose of 30 mg\/kg without body weight loss. MB5029 exhibited dose-proportional PK properties and induced expansion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in a dose-dependent manner in cynomolgus monkeys. MB5029 is shown to be well-tolerated up to 9 mg\/kg without severe clinical signs and no significant increase in eosinophil and cytokines in the blood. Overall, MB5029 represents a promising potential as an immunotherapeutic approach, as it has demonstrated both strong efficacy and good tolerability, along with improved safety margins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immuno-oncology,Fusion proteins,Interleukin-2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Frequently, DC functions are dysregulated by the immunosuppressive signals present within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Consequently, DC manipulation holds great potential to enhance the cytotoxic T cell response against cancer diseases. The Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 ligand (Flt3L) is a pluripotent growth factor that regulates the maturation and differentiation of DCs in hematopoiesis. The <i>in vivo <\/i>administration of Flt3L itself is limited by its short serum half-life. To overcome this major drawback, our group developed a novel fusion protein albumin-Flt3L (alb-Flt3L), which is the conjugation of albumin to Flt3L. Our hypothesis is that the Flt3L, which has extended bioavailability, is a feasible therapeutic strategy to overcome these treatment limitations.<br \/>Method: A novel alb-Flt3L DNA, a plasmid encoding the alb-Flt3L protein, was administrated for its anti-tumor effect on TC-1 tumor-bearing C57BL\/6 mice. For the generation of pcDNA3-albFlt3L, mouse Flt3 ligand was amplified by PCR using cDNA template of pcDNA3-Flt3L<sup>1<\/sup> and a set of primers, 5&#8242;- TTTGAATTCGGGACACCTGACTGTTACTTC-3&#8242; and 5&#8242;- AAACTTAAGCTACTGCCTGGGCCGAGGCTCTGG -3&#8242;. alb-Flt3L DNA (10ug), Flt3L DNA (10ug) or vehicle control was injected intratumorally followed by electroporation for a total of three times in 5-day intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor-infiltrated immune cells were isolated after treatment. Flow cytometry was performed for immune cell analysis.<br \/>Results: In this current study, the electroporation-mediated delivery of alb-Flt3L DNA demonstrated the ability to induce an anti-tumor immune response. This albumin fusion construct possesses more persistent bioactivity in targeted organs. Furthermore, mice receiving alb-Flt3L DNA treatment presented better tumor control and superior survival. Cellular analysis revealed that alb-Flt3L DNA administration displayed greater systemic DC population. In addition, robust cDC1 expansion, which is associated with superior antigen cross-presentation and cellular immunity against tumors, developed extensively in the tumor, lymph node, and blood. In addition, increased levels of IFN-&#947;-secreting CD8<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes and tumor-infiltrated immune cells were found in correlation to greater cDC1 population.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data showcases a novel DC-based immunotherapy using electroporation to administer alb-Flt3L DNA. The treatment effect is revealed by a controlled tumor response, characterized by enhanced DC mobilization and accumulation in both the lymph nodes and TME, coupled with an increase in the expansion of cDC1 subsets and a heightened level of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FLT3,DNA,Dendritic cells,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.-H.

Next generation cytokine approaches include conditional signaling focused on sites of interest, such as the tumor microenvironment or specific immune cell populations. Here, we share a novel approach for generating detuned cytokine therapeutic candidates using the&#8239;AlphaSeq platform, which involves the re-engineering of yeast agglutination and mating to quantitatively measure protein-protein interactions at a library-on-library scale. Engineering interferon-alpha (IFN&#945;) and interleukin-21 (IL-21), we show how&#8239;AlphaSeq measures cytokine-receptor interactions and identifies cytokine variants with a broad range of affinities. A saturated mutational library was created for IFN&#945; and IL-21and subsequently screened against a second library consisting of human IFNAR2 or human IL-21R, species orthologs and off-target receptors. AlphaSeq enabled identification of hundreds of detuned IFN&#945; and IL-21 variants against both human and mouse receptors in parallel assays. Cytokine variants with lower affinity than parental IFN&#945; or IL-21 were recombinantly expressed as Fc fusion proteins to orthogonally measure affinity with biolayer interferometry and characterize potency with an&#8239;in vitro&#8239;human PBMC phosflow assay, which showed strong correlation with AlphaSeq affinity measurements. Finally, detuned cytokine candidates were fused to anti-CD8 and other localizing antibodies to demonstrate cell population-specific signaling. Candidate molecules showed 1000-fold or greater potency in the targeted cell population than non-targeted populations. Our results show the&#8239;AlphaSeq&#8239;platform can accurately quantitate thousands of cytokine variant affinities simultaneously against multiple relevant receptors, enabling the selection of candidate immunocytokine antibody fusion proteins with targeted cell biased signaling.&#8239;AlphaSeq&#8217;s&#8239;rapid, comprehensive affinity determination is being used to develop clinically relevant IFN&#945; and IL-21 therapeutic immunocytokines with accompanying preclinical data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Immunocytokines,Antibody engineering,Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Therefore, ATP metabolism is an attractive anti-tumor target. Several enzymes are involved in the immunosuppressive process used by the TME to convert ATP to AMP and adenosine. Among them, CD39 (gene: <i>ENTPD1<\/i>), an extracellular ATPase, is a promising target. Analyzing mRNA expression from the TCGA, we show that CD39 is consistently expressed at high levels in comparison to the other extracellular ATP-converting enzymes, ENPP1 and TNAP. We further demonstrate that CD39 has greater enzymatic activity at the slightly acidic physiological pH (pH = 6.8) of the TME than either ENPP1 or TNAP. Flow cytometry profiling of dissociated primary human gastric tumors showed that CD39 was highly expressed on both myeloid and lymphoid cells, including several populations of T cells present in the tumors. This is distinct from findings in healthy primary human PBMCs that show high expression of CD39 on myeloid subsets and relatively few subsets of T cells with high CD39 expression. AB598 is a novel, humanized, Fc-silent anti-CD39 therapeutic antibody that potently binds to CD39 and inhibits its enzymatic activity with sub-nanomolar potency. Treatment of dissociated primary human gastric tumor cells with AB598 resulted in a decrease in the rate of ATP degradation, indicating both the effectiveness of AB598 and the relevance of CD39 as a main contributor to the ATPase activity of the TME. Although eATP is low in healthy tissues, high levels of ATP can be released when cancer cells are treated with immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing agents, increasing the eATP in the TME, providing a rationale for the combination of ICD-inducing chemotherapy and AB598. Thus, cancer cells were co-cultured with monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and treated with chemotherapy and AB598 to preserve the eATP released by dying cancer cells. The increased expression of CD83 and CD86 on moDCs demonstrated that the combination treatment enhanced the maturation of moDCs, compared to single or no treatment. To further elucidate the anti-tumor effects of the combination treatment, autogenous T cells were introduced into this system. AB598 significantly enhanced T cell activation in the presence of chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that using AB598 results in elevated eATP, which boosts immune cell activation to promote anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,ATP,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The CD28&#8208;CD80\/CD86 pathway is widely known as the most classical and critical costimulatory signal for the initial activation of T cells. Bispecific T-cell engagers targeting CD3e can activate cytotoxic T-cells and have shown remarkable tumor regressions in clinical trials. However, the absence of a costimulatory signal through CD28 results in insufficient T-cell activation and early exhaustion. Combination of both CD3e and CD28 targeting antibodies offers attractive approach to optimally boost T-cell activity. Development of superagonistic CD28-targeting antibody has been paused after TeGenero&#8216;s TGN1412 Phase 1 trial in 2006 due to life-threatening cytokine release syndrome. Unlike superagonist TGN1412, which activates T cells and induce cytokine storm, tumor targeting antigen and cross-linking dependent CD28 bispecific antibody is supposed to display little or no toxicity. In the present study, we explored Alpaca immunized phage library approach to generate cross-linking dependent agonist CD28 single domain antibody for bispecific antibody development. Alpacas were immunized subsequently with recombinant human CD28 extracellular domain and 293F cells stably expressing human CD28. Serum samples after immunizations showed decent immune response against CD28. At the end of Boost 2 and 3, peripheral blood was collected and phage display libraries were constructed using VHH specific primers. Phage display libraries were panned against recombinant CD28 ECD protein and CHOK1 cells overexpressing CD28. After one round of panning, both protein and cell panning tracks showed robust enrichment in output titer and repeating sequences. Next, 600 clones were randomly picked for screening by the binding to U266B1 cells endogenously expressing CD28. Of the 326 clones showed positive binding to U266B1, 79 unique sequences were identified. Secondary screening by ELISA and FACS using periplasmic extract confirmed 69 unique sequences that bound to both CD28 protein and cells expressing CD28. Seventeen unique sequences were selected for VHH-Fc production. All purified VHH-Fc showed sub-nanomolar affinity by ELISA and bind to primary T cells by flow cytometry. Three VHH-Fc induced IL-2 production in a primary T cells activation assay only when cross-linked and in the presence of CD3 co-stimulation and are suitable for further bispecific T cell engager development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Costimulation,BiTE antibody,Bispecific antibody,Single domain antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

Up to 2% of patients on ICI develop ICI-myocarditis, which is associated with significant mortality. Treatment guidelines for ICI-myocarditis are limited. The initial treatment starts with high dose glucocorticoids, but the subsequent lines of treatment remain ill-defined.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively identified patients at our institution from 2021 onwards who were treated for ICI-myocarditis and who had an inadequate response to steroid treatment (thus steroid refractory). Baseline characteristics, laboratory and imaging data, and outcomes were reviewed.<br \/>Results: Of the 34 patients diagnosed with ICI-myocarditis, 18 (53%) were steroid refractory. Amongst the 18, 11 were female and 7 were male, with a mean age of 73. Cancer types included head and neck, thoracic, urologic, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal. Patients had received a median of 2 ICI doses prior to myocarditis presentation. Thirteen (72%) patients had prior or concurrent irAE, most commonly neurologic or neuromuscular such as myasthenia gravis\/myositis (44%) or hepatitis (33%). For initial treatment, 14 (41%) patients received a max dose of methylprednisolone 1g\/day, while 4 (12%) received smaller doses (less than 500mg\/day). Following steroids, the most common next treatment was mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for 9 (50%), IVIG for 6 (33%), and Abatacept for 3 patients (17%). MMF was most often added and uptitrated to wean steroids, with 8 (44%) patients being able to be tapered off after a median duration of 112 days. IVIG was more commonly used for patients with concomitant neurologic symptoms while Abatacept was more commonly used for patients presenting with grade IV toxicities. The most encountered side effects following steroids were hyperglycemia, weight gain, adrenal insufficiency, and myopathy and following MMF were cytopenias and hypertension. The median survival since myocarditis diagnosis was 412 days. The patient with the longest documented survival of 645 days received IVIG and then MMF following steroids. Two patients with severely immunosuppression-resistant myocarditis responded well to tofacitinib, with one patient living 521 days after diagnosis (after methylprednisolone, IVIG, MMF, Abatacept, Tofacitinib) and one still alive more than 400 days after diagnosis (after methylprednisolone, MMF, Abatacept, IVIG, Infliximab, Tofacitinib).<br \/>Conclusion: Steroid-refractory ICI-associated myocarditis can be responsive to other immunosuppression agents. Our case series, one of the largest studies of this population, highlights their effectiveness and the populations they can cater to. Adjunctive treatments for ICI-myocarditis require further study to identify right doses and order of treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Cancer immunotherapy,Cardiotoxicity,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.
