These personalized vaccines rely on accurate epitope prediction and selection. We previously reported phase I trials of neoantigen targeting PCV in melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Recently we concluded a trial in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) where the neoantigen targeting PCV was immunogenic in all patients, targeted cancer drivers, and demonstrated in vitro reactivity to primary patient tumors. The neoantigen selection pipeline at DFCI supporting clinical trials utilizes immunopeptidome-trained epitope prediction algorithms to design synthetic long peptides as vaccine antigens containing predicted HLA Class I neoantigens. We also prioritize highly expressed neoantigens and neoantigens originating from cancer drivers as vaccine epitopes. For future iterations of this pipeline, we aspire to include novel classes of neoantigens originating from endogenous human retroviruses (ERV), fusion epitopes, novel or unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs), and immunopeptidome-identified neoantigens. The neoantigen selection pipeline is currently supporting multiple cancer vaccine trials at DFCI targeting melanoma, GBM, RCC, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Derin Keskin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

However, identifying tumor specific antigens that are highly presented within tumors, and identifying and validating T cell receptors (TCRs) that are specific to those antigens, remains a non-trivial exercise. Even identifying and validating a single antigen-specific T cell clonotype for advancement into a clinic trial remains a daunting task. In this talk, I will discuss a number of new experimental and computational tools that are designed to accelerate this process. The experimental toolsets include reagents and strategies that allow for the capture and analysis of T cells specific to hundreds to thousands of tumor-associated Class I and Class II antigens simultaneously, with as many as 100 patient bloods analyzed in a single experiment. Single cell analysis of the resulting data yields a deep characterization of the captured T cells, including T cell receptor &#945;\/&#946; genes, antigen-MHC specificity, T cell phenotype, and donor identification. This type of analysis, in turn, provides large data bases that can fuel new computational strategies that can be harnessed (at a still early stage) to predict which TCR&#945;\/&#946; genes associate with which putative antigen-MHCs, or to extract the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of TCR-antigen pairings that influence T cell phenotype. Thus, this presentation will span both new experimental and new computational toolsets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Bioinformatics,Antigen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James R.
