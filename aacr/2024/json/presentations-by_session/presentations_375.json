The complexity and ubiquity of structural alterations in cancer genomes make it difficult to identify enhancer hijacking with genome sequencing alone. Here we describe a 3D genomics-based analysis called HAPI (Highly Active Promoter Interactions) to characterize enhancer hijacking caused by various types of structural alterations. Applying HAPI analysis to HiChIP data from 34 cancer cell lines, we identified novel enhancers hijacked through chromosomal rearrangements to activate both known and potentially novel oncogenes such as <i>MYC, CCND1<\/i>, <i>ETV1<\/i>, <i>CRKL<\/i>, and <i>ID4<\/i>, which we validated using CRISPRi assays and RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, we found that ecDNAs often contain multiple oncogenes from different chromosomes, which cause nested enhancer hijacking among them. For instance, we found that<i> MYC<\/i> ecDNAs relocate additional oncogenes from other chromosomes such as <i>CDX2,<\/i> <i>ERBB2,<\/i> or <i>CD44<\/i><i> <\/i>near the <i>MYC<\/i> locus, co-opting <i>MYC<\/i>&#8217;s enhancers for their overexpression, which we validated using dual-color DNA FISH and CRISPRi assays. This multiple oncogenes-involved enhancer hijacking mechanism may suggest novel therapeutic strategies such as targeting either the co-opting oncogenes or the hijacked enhancers for ecDNAs. Our study provides a robust strategy to detect enhancer hijacking events using our publicly available HAPI analysis tool and reveals novel mechanisms underlying oncogene activation caused by chromosomal and extrachromosomal structural alterations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-06 Promoters and enhancers of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Oncogene,Gene regulation,Promoter analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Katelyn  L.

LUAD progression is driven by both genetic alterations and epigenetic changes that confer increased lineage plasticity and heterogeneity, but underlying mechanisms dictating cell identity in LUAD remain incompletely understood. The lineage defining transcription factors, NKX2-1 and FoxA1\/2, coordinately maintain a pulmonary identity in LUAD. Recent work suggests that NKX2-1-positive (NKX2-1+) LUAD evolves from an alveolar-like state and adopts various disparate cell fates that drive progression, including &#8220;dual-identity&#8221; states, characterized by acquisition of gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary-like states in the same cell. Using sophisticated genetically engineered mouse models and 3D organoid cultures, we demonstrated that the gastrointestinal transcription factor HNF4&#945;, which robustly marks the dual-identity state, is critical for growth in NKX2-1+ LUAD. We performed bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq in vitro and in vivo, and we found that loss of HNF4&#945; alters the differentiation state of NKX2-1+ LUAD, causing cells to shed elements of their gastric identity in favor of alternate differentiation states. Using paired chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq in dual-identity organoids, we found that HNF4&#945; can access and activate many of its canonical gastrointestinal target genes despite being aberrantly expressed in the lung, where it is typically epigenetically silenced early in development. Surprisingly, HNF4&#945; also colocalizes with NKX2-1 and FoxA1\/2 and binds at novel sites, suggesting that HNF4&#945; acquires expanded activity in this state beyond its canonical roles. Together, our work unveils key insights into the mechanisms by which lineage defining transcription factors regulate cellular identity and growth in LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

The scaffolding protein Menin regulates transcription through interactions with transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes and has both oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles, depending on the cellular context. The half-life of Menin is prolonged in EwS cells leading to high levels of the protein that is dependent on EWS::FLI1 expression. To investigate tumorigenic functions of Menin in EwS, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 to generate clonal A673 and TC32 Menin knockout cells. Consistent with our earlier studies using shRNA-mediated knockdown, loss of Menin had little effect on proliferation in 2-D culture but resulted in reduced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assays. When MEN1-KO cells were injected into NSG mice, either subcutaneously or by tail vein, tumor formation was delayed. Injection of MEN1-KO cells into the renal subcapsule of NSG mice resulted in locally invasive tumors but their capacity to metastasize to the liver was reduced compared to control cells. To elucidate how loss of Menin led to diminished tumorigenic and metastatic potential, we performed RNA-seq of control and MEN1-KO cells. This analysis revealed significant and reproducible down-regulation of MYC target genes and up-regulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway and extracellular matrix protein-encoding genes in MEN1-KO cells. To determine if genes altered in MEN1-KO cells were dependent on the role of Menin in Menin\/MLL methyltransferase complexes, we analyzed transcriptomes of EwS cells that had been exposed to the Menin\/MLL interaction inhibitor, VTP-50469. Only a subset of genes altered by the MEN1-KO were also altered by the Menin\/MLL inhibitor, suggesting that Menin regulates gene expression in EwS cells by both MLL-dependent and MLL-independent mechanisms. To test this, we performed CUT&#38;RUN to define Menin binding sites and discovered that Menin binds not only at H3K4me3-marked gene promoters but also at intragenic enhancers marked by H3K27Ac. Importantly, comparison of RNA-seq data revealed substantial overlap between Menin-regulated and established EWS::FLI1 target genes and we identified that a subset of EWS::FLI1-bound intragenic enhancers are also bound by Menin. Significantly, these co-bound, co-regulated loci encode for pro-metastatic genes, including <i>IL1RAP<\/i>, <i>STEAP1<\/i>, and <i>CAV1. <\/i> Finally, we found that Menin and EWS::FLI1 co-immunoprecipitate in EwS nuclear extracts suggesting that they may exist in complex with one another at sites of shared gene regulation. Taken together, these data indicate that Menin promotes EwS metastasis and that this is achieved by its function as a scaffolding protein that augments the transcriptional activity of EWS::FLI1 at intragenic enhancers of pro-metastasis genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-03 Mechanisms of transcription,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,EWS-FLI1,Menin,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

A recent transcriptome analysis of human SCLC tumors revealed that SCLC could be characterized by the expression pattern of certain transcription factors (TFs), including ASCL1 (achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1) and POU2F3 (POU domain class 2 transcription factor 3), exemplifying SCLC as a TF-driven malignancy. ASCL1-driven SCLC (SCLC-A) manifests a neuroendocrine phenotype, while POU2F3-driven SCLC (SCLC-P) is characterized as a tuft-cell-like variant. Recent studies revealed that POU domain class 2 transcription factors uniquely rely on coactivators to achieve their lineage-defining functions in the tuft cell and B cell lineages. In tuft-cell-like SCLC cells, the coactivators of POU2F3 (POU2AF2 and POU2AF3) endow POU2F3 with a critical transactivation domain by forming a master regulator complex, which supports enhancer-mediated cancer-promoting gene activation in SCLC-P cells. This indicates a potential therapeutic vulnerability of tuft-cell-like SCLC whereby strategies aimed at blocking POU2F3-POU2AF2\/3 function may lead to clinical benefit.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a domain-targeted CRISPR screen to identify druggable targets for SCLC-P, followed by pharmacological validation in preclinical SCLC models. Multi-omics techniques, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and RIME, were employed to elucidate the SWI\/SNF complex's regulatory influence on the POU2F-POU2AF axis.<br \/>Results: Here we identified that the POU2F3 molecular subtype of SCLC (SCLC-P) exhibits an exquisite dependence on the activity of the SWI\/SNF epigenetic complex. SCLC-P cell lines were sensitive to low nanomolar levels of a SWI\/SNF ATPase degrader when compared to other molecular subtypes of SCLC. Co-factors of POU2F were found to interact with components of the SWI\/SNF complex. The POU2F3 transcription factor complex is evicted from chromatin upon SWI\/SNF ATPase degradation. A novel, orally bioavailable SWI\/SNF ATPase PROTAC degrader demonstrated preferential efficacy in SCLC-P relative to the SCLC-A subtype. The SWI\/SNF ATPase PROTAC degrader did not alter normal tuft cell numbers in lung or colon, nor did it exhibit toxicity in mice. B cell malignancies which displayed a dependency on the POU2F co-factor, POU2AF1, were also remarkably sensitive to SWI\/SNF ATPase degradation. In a POU2AF1-dependent, disseminated murine model of multiple myeloma, AU-24118 had an enhanced survival benefit as compared to pomalidomide, an approved treatment for multiple myeloma.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, our studies suggest that POU2F-POU2AF driven malignancies have an intrinsic dependence on the SWI\/SNF complex representing a striking therapeutic vulnerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Neuroendocrine tumors,SWI\/SNF,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

However, the specific molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unknown. In an effort to identify drivers of prostate cancer progression, in a previous study, we determined that TBX2, a developmental T-box transcription factor (TF) master regulator, is over-expressed in CRPC and drives bone metastatic progression. A recent report confirmed that TBX2 and GR are two of the four TFs that drive enzalutamide resistance in advanced PCa. Our current study demonstrates that TBX2 with known repressor and activator functions, is the molecular switch that represses AR levels while activating GR expression thereby resulting in the replacement of AR signaling to control tumor growth.<br \/>Methods: We genetically modulated TBX2 using multiple approaches: a) dominant negative, DN, to block TBX2 (TBX2DN), and b) overexpression, OE, to increase TBX2 expression (TBX2OE), c) shRNA mediated knockdown (shTBX2). RNA-seq was performed, and qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were used for validation. Further, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and site directed mutagenesis (SDM) to confirm TBX2 binding on the AR promoter. We also used co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to determine protein partners of TBX2.<br \/>Results: Mechanistically, our studies revealed that TBX2 bound to the promoters of both AR and GATA2, an AR coregulator, thereby resulting in a bimodal repression of AR expression. Conversely, TBX2 upregulated GR via direct GR promoter binding and TBX2-GR protein-protein interaction. Together, concurrent repression of the AR and activation of GR resulted in enzalutamide resistance. Importantly, we found that SP2509, an allosteric inhibitor of the demethylase-independent function of LSD1, a TBX2-interacting protein in the COREST complex, can disrupt both TBX2-LSD1 and TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions thereby uncovering a unique mode of SP2509 action in CRPC. Together,<b> <\/b>our study supports a molecular model of CRPC wherein: 1) TBX2, LSD1 and GR proteins interface with each other, and 2) pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 blocks the TBX2-driven AR-to-GR switch through disruption of TBX2-GR interaction.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, our study identifies TBX2 as the molecular switch that drives the AR to GR signaling bypass thereby conferring enzalutamide resistance. Further, our study provides key insights into a potential therapeutic modality for targeting the AR to GR signaling switch via disruption of the TBX2-LSD1 and TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Glucocorticoid receptor,Regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Since molecular heterogeneity of TNBC may contribute to variable responses to NACT, we aimed to deconvolute TNBC&#8217;s histological and spatial transcriptomics (ST) patterns.<br \/>METHODS: In total, 90 pre-treatment biopsies were collected from NACT-treated TNBC patients from archival samples and the ongoing FORCE (NCT03238144) clinical trial at Guy&#8217;s Hospital, London, UK. Of these, 38 achieved pCR (Responder), 46 had residual disease (Non-Responder) whilst 6 are currently undergoing NACT; 46 post-treatment surgical resections were collected from Non-Responders.Each sample was H&#38;E stained, imaged, and annotated by a pathologist. A 6-digit classifier was designed to capture the histology of each region of interest (ROI), characterizing the tumour region, epithelial type and immune cell localization, population, distribution, and abundance.H&#38;Es were used to guide ST profiling of serial sections which was performed on the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. Tissues were stained with fluorescent antibodies against PanCK and CD45 to visualize the tissue, select ROIs and illuminate spatially resolved tumor and immune-enriched compartments, defined as PanCK+\/CD45- and PanCK-\/CD45+, respectively.Data analysis was performed in R 4.3.1 using the limma, dplyr, EdgeR, GeoMx Tools, GeoMx Workflows, RUV4, Spatial Experiment, SpatialDecon and GSVA packages, facilitating quality control, batch correction, differential and topographical gene expression, immune cell deconvolution and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), respectively.<br \/>RESULTS: To date, we have performed ST profiling of 120 TNBC samples from 82 patients (46 Non-Responders; 36 Responders), totaling 3917 tumor or immune-cell enriched regions. Preliminary analyses revealed KEGG pathways involved in tissue adhesion are upregulated in tumor compartments of Non-Responders compared to Responders, whilst those involved in genomic integrity are suppressed. Unsupervised clustering of PanCK+CD45- regions in Non-Responders identified tumor clusters present in both pre- and post-NACT samples, suggesting potential chemo-resistant properties. Moreover, immune cell deconvolution of the PanCK-\/CD45+ regions revealed spatially distinct patters of immune cell composition mapped to histological annotations identified by our ROI classifier.<br \/>CONCLUSION: (S)Large scale ST of TNBC before and after NACT reveals novel patterns associated with response to treatment. We have designed a novel ROI classifier to spatially resolved transcriptomes of histological features, as such provide an in-depth characterization of the histo-genomics of TNBC.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor heterogeneity,Chemotherapy response,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

However, despite the consistency of the findings, there remains considerable debate concerning the mechanisms through which SUMO inhibition represses tumorigenesis. Our downstream analysis suggested ETS Translocation Variant 1, encoded by <i>ETV1<\/i> gene, acts as a SUMO-sensitive transcription factor that drives mammary oncogenesis and cancer growth. To examine oncogenic properties of SUMO-conjugated ETV1 in breast cancer,<b> <\/b>we cloned HA-tagged WT Etv1, SUMO-resistant Etv1<sup>5xKR<\/sup>, or SUMO mimetic SUMO-1-Etv1<sup>5xKR<\/sup> into a lentiviral vector with a GFP cassette. Proliferation, colony formation in soft agar, and <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft assays were evaluated in the Ube2iF\/F cell line derived from a tumor in a MMTV-<i>c-neu\/Ube2i<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup><\/i>animal. We did ChIP-seq in Ube2iF\/F cells using SUMO-1 and Etv1 antibodies to examine the effects of SUMO conjugation on Etv1 genomic occupancy. RNA-seq using siEtv1 or AdCre was also performed to compare changes in gene expression with SUMO-conjugated Etv1 genomic occupancy. Inhibition of SUMOylation via AdCre caused a significant reduction in proliferation and colony formation <i>in vitro<\/i> and completely block the formation of flank xenografts <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, expressing a SUMO-resistant ETV1<sup>5xKR<\/sup> rescued <i>in vitro<\/i> growth effects, whereas a SUMO mimetic SUMO-1-ETV1<sup>5xKR<\/sup> had no effect on restoring proliferation. On the contrary, <i>in vivo <\/i>xenograft assays demonstrated that the Etv1<sup>5xKR<\/sup>-SUMO1 efficiently induced tumor formation despite the loss of Ube2i while the sumo-resistant Etv1<sup>5xKR<\/sup> was unable to rescue tumorigenesis. Bulk RNA-seq and ChIP seq performed demonstrated different patterns of gene regulation between sumoylated and unsumoylated Etv1. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed genes associated with cancer stemness were significantly enriched in cells expressing Etv1<sup>5xKR<\/sup>-SUMO1. Collectively, these observations support Etv1 acting as a SUMO-sensitive transcription factor that drives a stem cell phenotype necessary for mammary oncogenesis and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Tumorigenesis,Transcription,Sumoylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.
