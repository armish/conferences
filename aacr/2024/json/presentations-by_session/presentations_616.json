[{"Abstract":"Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) has potentially curative outcomes for patients with certain hematologic malignancies but also has toxicity due to graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), where donor-derived T cells attack the immune suppressed recipient, leading to significant mortality and morbidity. Natural killer T (NKT) and T-regulatory (Treg) cell levels in the donor product or in the recipient associate with protection from acute GVHD (aGVHD) and thus may represent therapeutic targets. RGI-2001 is a liposomal formulation of an NKT cell agonist, expanding both NKT and Tregs in animal models, resulting in prevention of aGVHD without compromising general immune function. Phase 1\/2a studies of RGI-2001 demonstrated safety and potential efficacy in reducing aGVHD in alloHSCT using single doses. In this Phase 2b study, RGI-2001 was given weekly x 6 doses (100 ug\/kg) in combination with standard GVHD prophylaxis.<br \/>Results: RGI-2001 was given to 48 subjects undergoing matched (8\/8) alloHSCT. Control data from the CIBMTR (n=207) was obtained and used as comparison. Patients receiving RGI-2001 did not have any serious infusion reactions, related serious adverse events, cases of cytomegalovirus disease, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, or graft failure. Compared to the CIBMTR group, the RGI-2001 group demonstrated lower grade II-IV aGVHD (day 180) and higher aGHVD-free survival (GFS) and overall survival. Relapse and cGVHD rates were similar between the groups. In addition, the number of NKT cells in the blood of the RGI-2001 group correlated with specific outcomes within this group. Grade II-IV at day 100 or d180 or GFS d180 occurred in &#62;8 patients, and the mean NKT numbers at day 28 for these patients is lower than patients without occurrence. The number and percentages of Tregs, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells did not correlate with any clinical endpoints.<br \/>Conclusions: RGI-2001 given weekly x 6 doses is safe and well tolerated. Compared to matched cohort, the RGI-2001 cohort had decreased aGVHD and increased overall survival, suggesting that RGI-2001 could be added to alloHSCT regimens to reduce aGVHD while not affecting overall immune responses against infection and tumor relapse. Future studies will focus on optimizing dosage based on blood levels of NKT cells, elucidating the mechanisms of actions of RGI-2001, and identifying potential biomarkers of response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Leukemias,Natural killer cells,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

A high unmet need remains for therapies that improve tumor control and extend survival after relapse. Odronextamab, an off-the-shelf CD20&#215;CD3 bispecific antibody, demonstrated compelling efficacy, generally manageable safety, and maintenance of pt-reported overall quality of life scores from baseline in an interim analysis of the ELM-2 study (NCT03888105) in heavily pretreated pts with R\/R FL (Villasboas et al. ASH 2023). Here, for the first time, we present the primary analysis of R\/R FL in ELM-2.<br \/>Methods: IV odronextamab was administered in 21-day cycles (C) until disease progression\/unacceptable toxicity. Steroid prophylaxis and step-up dosing (0.7\/4\/20 mg) were used in C1 to mitigate the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), followed by 80 mg on Days (D) 1, 8, and 15 of C2-4. Maintenance dosing continued at 160 mg Q2W, or Q4W if complete response (CR) was durable for 9 months (mo). Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per Lugano criteria by independent central review (ICR). Secondary endpoints included CR rate, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Primary analysis was performed when 128 pts had &#8805;52 weeks&#8217; follow-up.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (Oct 20, 2023), 128 pts with FL Grade (Gr) 1-3a were evaluable for efficacy and safety: median age 61 yrs (range 22-84); FLIPI risk score 3-5 57.8%; POD24 49.2%; median 3 prior lines of therapy (2-13); 71.9% refractory to last treatment (Tx); 74.2% refractory to an anti-CD20 antibody. The median no. of Tx cycles was 19.4 (0.1-95.9); 95.3% and 85.2% of pts completed C1 and C4, respectively.Median efficacy follow-up was 20.1 mo; ORR was 80.5% and CR rate was 73.4% confirmed by ICR. Responses were durable (median DOR 22.6 mo; median DOCR 25.1 mo). Median PFS was 20.7 mo and 24-mo PFS was 46.1%. Median OS was not reached and 24-mo OS was 70.1%.The odronextamab safety profile was generally manageable and consistent with previous reports. Tx-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in all pts (Gr &#8805;3 85.9%); 15.6% had AEs leading to Tx discontinuation. With 0.7\/4\/20 mg step up (n=60), CRS events were mostly low grade (Gr 1 45.0%; Gr 2 10.0%; Gr 3 in 1 pt), occurred mostly in C1, and resolved in a median of 2 days; ICANS was reported in 1 pt (Gr 2). Infection rates were consistent with heavily pretreated, immunosuppressed pts (Leonard et al. JCO 2019; Hayne et al. BBMT 2020), occurring in 79.7% (102\/128) of pts (Gr 4\/5 14.0%; COVID-19 36.7% [Gr 5 6.3%]).Conclusion: Odronextamab demonstrated deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated pts with R\/R FL; 91% of responders achieved CR, correlating with favorable PFS and OS at 24 mo. Odronextamab had a generally manageable safety profile and a low incidence of Gr 3 CRS\/ICANS. Odronextamab could offer an important off-the-shelf Tx option for pts with heavily pretreated R\/R FL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Bispecific antibody therapy,indolent lymphoma,Phase 2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

It enrolled R\/R NHL patients treated with at least two lines of therapy (must-have anthracycline and CD20-targeted agents) or after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. All patients received a single infusion of HR001 at the 2.0 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR+T cells\/kg dose. The disease response was evaluated by the independent review committee with Lugano response criteria [2014].<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As of May 16th, 2023, 81 R\/R NHL patients with ECOG 0-1 at baseline received the infusion HR001 from the Jinshan manufacturing facility [51.9% male; median age 53.4 years (range 23~74); 3.7% CD19 negative; 91.4% diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 79.0% III-IV of Ann Arbor classification or Lugano] with a median follow-up of 160 days (range 7 to 454).

However, the clinical impact of early treatment intervention a time of detectable MRD (dMRD) prior to clinical relapse is unknown. Checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has activity in some pts with DLBCL. We hypothesized that early CPI therapy in patients with dMRD without clinical relapse may lower relapse rate. We conducted a pilot study in high risk pts in remission after most recent line of therapy (LOT) in whom maintenance nivolumab (MN) was offered at time of dMRD to assess effect on MRD clearance and relapse rate.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Pts &#62;18 years (yrs) with high-risk DLBCL (ABC-subtype, high grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL), MYC translocation, relapsed\/refractory disease, or Ki67 &#62;90%) who had achieved CR on most recent LOT were eligible. Patients were monitored for detectable MRD (dMRD) based on the clonoSEQ assay for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Pts had monthly MRD assessment and every 4 month imaging for 2 yrs. If conversion from uMRD to dMRD without clinical relapse, pts received MN (240 mg IV q2 weeks) for up 2 yrs. Pts with overt relapse at time of dMRD or dMRD at initial MRD assessment were ineligible for MN. The primary endpoint was rate of conversion from dMRD to undetectable MRD (uMRD).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>20 pts were screened and 15 pts enrolled between June 2018 and March 2022. 4 had transformed DLBCL (2 from FL, 1 from MZL, and 1 Richter&#8217;s transformation from CLL), 2 pts had HGBCL (one of which was also transformed).<br \/>All pts with dMRD had radiographic relapse within 4 months of molecular relapse. No pts with uMRD by ctDNA had clinical relapse on study during 2 yrs follow up.<br \/>Of the 8 pts who enrolled after first LOT, none had molecular or clinical relapse. Of the 7 pts with 2+ prior LOT, 3 had dMRD: two had clinical relapse at same time as dMRD and were taken off study (one had dMRD at baseline MRD assessment and the other 135 days post enrollment after initial period of uMRD). In the single patient eligible for MN, dMRD preceded radiographic relapse by 105 days, 410 days after enrollment. The pt received 2 cycles of MN before clinical progression and was taken off study. This pt failed to achieve conversion of dMRD to uMRD.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Due to small sample size and lower than expected relapse, we were unable to demonstrate conversion of dMRD to uMRD using MN. However, this pilot study did confirm high correlation of uMRD and dMRD status with disease free survival and clinical relapse within 4 months, respectively. If strong negative predictive value is confirmed in a larger study, ctDNA MRD testing may be used to spare pts from imaging or to guide additional work up in pts with inconclusive findings on scans.<\/sub>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Molecular markers,Checkpoint Inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Shazia Nakhoda<sup>1<\/sup>, Tamarrah Sklarz<sup>1<\/sup>, Cheyenne Pagan<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Matasar<sup>2<\/sup>, Zachary  A.

The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. The secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of November 17, 2023, 123 patients (108 [87.8%] male, median age 64 [range: 33-80], and 11.4%\/88.6% ECOG PS 0\/1) were enrolled and treated, with a median follow-up of 7.92 months (range, 0.7, 16.5) and a median duration of treatment of 6.24 months (range, 0.7, 15.9). At data cutoff date, 82 patients (66.7%) discontinued treatment, with disease progression (46 patients [37.4%]) being the most common reason. Among 123 patients, IRC confirmed-ORR was 49.6% (61\/123, 95% CI, 40.5 to 58.8) and DCR was 88.6% (109\/123, 95% CI, 81.6 to 93.6). The median TTR was 1.38 months (range, 1.12 to 5.55). The median DOR was 12.78 months (95% CI, 6.21 to NE). The median PFS was 7.56 months (95% CI, 5.55 to 9.69), and the median OS was not reached.

Updated efficacy results are shown in the Table. Overall, 30 pts (69.8%) experienced Grade &#8805;3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The most common Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs were neutrophil count decreased (34.9%), anemia (30.2%), WBC count decreased (25.6%), stomatitis (9.3%), and rash (7.0%). No TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation or deaths occurred.

In DESTINY-Lung02 (DL-02), T-DXd 5.4 mg\/kg showed clinical benefit with an acceptable and manageable safety profile in pts with pretreated HER2m metastatic NSCLC. DL-02 did not include any Chinese pts. We report the primary analysis of T-DXd in Chinese pts with pretreated HER2m metastatic NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: In this open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 trial (NCT05246514), Chinese pts with HER2m (locally or centrally confirmed activating <i>HER2<\/i> exon 19 or 20 mutation) metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with disease progression on or after &#8805;1 prior anticancer therapy (no prior HER2-directed) received T-DXd 5.4 mg\/kg IV once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review (ICR). Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed (INV) confirmed ORR; ICR and INV duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and safety.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: At data cutoff (September 23, 2023), 72 pts with HER2m NSCLC received T-DXd 5.4 mg\/kg (full analysis set). Median T-DXd exposure was 7.9 (0.7-13.5) months. Pt characteristics and efficacy data are in the table. 71 pts had drug-related adverse events (AEs), of which 51.4% were grade (G) &#8805;3. Most common G&#8805;3 AEs by grouped term: neutropenia (26.4%), thrombocytopenia (18.1%), and leukopenia (11.1%). Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuations occurred in 2 (2.8%) pts. 17 (23.6%) pts had serious AEs, with no INV-adjudicated G5.

MET amplification is the most common known resistance mechanism to osi. Combining osi with savo, a MET-TKI, has shown antitumor activity in EGFRm, MET-amplified aNSCLC. We conducted a Phase II, double-blind, randomized study (NCT04606771) to assess the individual contribution of savo to the combination.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Pts with EGFRm (Ex19del, L858R), MET-amplified (MET gene copy &#8805;5 or MET\/CEP7 ratio &#8805;2; central confirmation by FISH), aNSCLC with progression on &#8805;1 tx, including osi, were randomized (1:1) to savo 300 mg QD + osi 80 mg QD or savo 300 mg QD + PBO. Tx continued until PD, unacceptable AEs, or other discontinuation criterion. Primary endpoint: ORR per RECIST 1.1 (investigator-assessed). Efficacy was also assessed by exploratory, higher MET cutoffs (determined retrospectively): 3+ staining &#8805;90% tumor cells (IHC90+) and\/or MET gene copy &#8805;10 (FISH10+). Plasma was collected for exploratory analyses.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>30 pts were randomized (savo + osi n=14; savo + PBO n=16). Table shows efficacy data. Grade &#8805;3 AEs and sAEs occurred in: 3 (21%) and 4 (29%) pts receiving savo + osi; 5 (31%) and 3 (19%) pts receiving savo + PBO, respectively. Most common any-grade AEs with savo + osi vs savo + PBO were nausea (50% vs 19%), peripheral edema (36% vs 25%) and vomiting (21% vs 31%).<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Savo + osi demonstrated clinical activity, with savo + PBO showing lower clinical activity. Clinical activity was observed in pts with higher MET cutoffs (FISH10+ and\/or IHC90+). Due to small sample sizes, these data need to be interpreted with caution. Safety was consistent with known AE profiles of each tx. This study was terminated early as the contribution of savo to the savo + osi combination is being further assessed in SAVANNAH (NCT03778229), which uses a different savo dosing regimen and higher MET-amplification cutoffs.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7A1E0CCF-85CD-47F8-A1B5-13FEB2C4F568}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Savolitinib + osimertinib<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Savolitinib + placebo<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">FISH10+ and\/or IHC90+<sup>a<\/sup> (n=8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">All patients(n=14)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">FISH10+ and\/or IHC90+<sup> a<\/sup> (n=7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All patients (n=16)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ORR, % (95% CI)<sup>b<\/sup><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63 (24, 91)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">57 (29, 82)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29 (4, 71)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (2, 38)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Complete response, n (%)<sup>b<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Partial response, n (%)<sup>b<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (63)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">8 (57)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (29)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (13)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median duration of response, weeks (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.6 (23.0, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">30.6 (18.9, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (12.4, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NR (12.4, NC)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PFS events, n (%)<sup>c<\/sup><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (50)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">9 (64)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (71)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (81)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Median PFS, months (95% CI)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.2 (4.1, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">7.4 (5.6, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.0 (1.3, NC)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6 (1.3, 4.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><sup>a<\/sup>As IHC was not used to determine pt eligibility, this subgroup does not comprise all randomized pts due to limited sample availability; <sup>b<\/sup>Responses included unconfirmed responses; <sup>c<\/sup>Only included events that occurred within 2 missed visits of the last evaluable assessment.

Nicotinamide, a sirtuin inhibitor, has demonstrated potential in re-activating epigenetically silenced RUNX3 in cancer cells. This study assessed the therapeutic benefits of combining nicotinamide with first-generation EGFR-TKIs for patients with stage IV lung cancer carrying EGFR mutations.<br \/>Patients and Methods: We assessed the impact of nicotinamide on carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinomas in mice and observed that nicotinamide increased RUNX3 levels and inhibited lung cancer growth. Subsequently, 110 consecutive patients with stage IV lung cancer who had EGFR mutations were recruited: 70 females (63.6%) and 84 never-smokers (76.4%). The patients were randomly assigned to receive either nicotinamide (1 g\/day, n = 55) or placebo (n = 55). The primary and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively.<br \/>Results: After a median follow-up of 54.3 months, the nicotinamide group exhibited a median PFS of 12.7 months (95% CI, 10.4-18.3), while the placebo group had a PFS of 10.9 months (9.0-13.2; p = 0.2). The median OS was similar in the two groups (31.0 months with nicotinamide vs. 29.4 months with placebo; p = 0.2). Notably, subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in mortality risk for females (p = 0.01) and never-smokers (p = 0.03) treated with nicotinamide.<br \/>Conclusion: The addition of nicotinamide with EGFR-TKIs demonstrated potential improvements in PFS and OS, with notable survival benefits for female patients and those who had never smoked.<br \/>(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02416739)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,EGFR,Survival,Nicotinamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.-K.

Immunotherapy has shown benefit in many tumor types, including SCLC. In preclinical and clinical studies of solid tumors, co-inhibition of T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motif domains (TIGIT) and PD-1 enhanced antitumor activity of anti-PD-1. AdvanTIG-204 (NCT04952597) investigated the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab + tislelizumab + cCRT in patients with untreated limited-stage SCLC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Patients with limited-stage SCLC and no prior systemic therapy were randomized 1:1:1 to Arm A (ociperlimab [900 mg IV Q3W] + tislelizumab [200 mg IV Q3W] + cCRT for 4 cycles, then ociperlimab + tislelizumab), Arm B (tislelizumab + cCRT for 4 cycles, then tislelizumab), or Arm C (cCRT for 4 cycles). Study drugs (Arms A and B) were continued for up to 12 months or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Primary endpoint: investigator-assessed PFS per RECIST v1.1. Secondary analyses included additional efficacy and safety endpoints in the ITT population, and efficacy in patient subgroups by PD-L1 and TIGIT expression (both &#60;1% vs &#8805;1%), using tumor area positivity (PD-L1) and immune cell scoring (TIGIT). No hypothesis testing was predefined (p-value for descriptive purposes only). Descriptive comparisons were conducted for Arm A vs C, B vs C, and A vs B.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: As of July 26, 2023, 126 patients (median age, 61.5 years) were randomized to Arm A (n=41), Arm B (n=42), or Arm C (n=43). Median follow-up: ~18 months (all arms). There was a trend of improvement in median PFS in Arm A (12.6 months) and Arm B (13.2 months) vs Arm C (9.5 months); HR (95% CI): Arm A vs C, 0.84 (0.46-1.52; <i>p<\/i>=0.2793); Arm B vs C, 0.80 (0.45-1.44; <i>p<\/i>=0.2414). ORR was 85.4% (3 CR) in Arm A, 88.1% (4 CR) in Arm B, and 76.7% (1 CR) in Arm C. Median DoR was 10.1 months in Arm A, 11.5 months in Arm B, and 8.2 months in Arm C. Median OS was not reached in any arm. Analyses showed that PD-L1 or TIGIT expression did not correlate with efficacy, however, small subgroup size limits interpretability. All patients experienced &#8805;1 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE); rates of grade &#8805;3 TRAEs were 73.2%, 78.6% and, 65.1% in Arms A, B, and C, respectively. The most common TRAEs included anemia (80.5% in Arm A vs 83.3% in Arm B vs 81.4% in Arm C), nausea (80.5% vs 76.2% vs 65.1%), and WBC count decreased (78.0% vs 76.2% vs 62.8%).

A safety lead-in was performed for the first 21 days of treatment in cohort C in &#8804;10 pts evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), followed by efficacy evaluation. Pts in safety lead-in were not randomized. Primary endpoints were safety (DLTs in safety lead-in phase, AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs) and ORR per RECIST v1.1 by BICR.

Current therapies have limited efficacy in SCLC, and despite a highly mutated genome, SCLC is largely unresponsive to immunotherapy. We sought to leverage the immune surveillance triggered by DNA damage in patients with relapsed SCLC using bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein targeting both PD-L1 and TGF-beta. Hyperprogressive disease (HPD), characterized by the rapid acceleration of tumor growth, has been reported in approximately 13% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the mechanistic basis is poorly understood.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This is a safety run-in and phase II clinical trial. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with relapsed SCLC across Arms A (bintrafusp alfa 2400 mg q3 wks), B (bintrafusp alfa 2400 mg on D1 plus topotecan 1 mg\/m2\/day on D1-5 q3 wks), and C (bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg on D1 q2 wks plus temozolomide 200 mg\/m2\/day on D1-5 q4 wks). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Thirty-seven patients enrolled. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) included transaminitis (27.0%), anemia (24.4%), lymphopenia (10.8%), and maculopapular rash (5.4%). Grade 4 TRAE included thrombocytopenia (8.1%), lymphopenia (5.4%) and transaminitis (5.4%). One patient experienced grade 5 tumor hemorrhage. By RECIST 1.1, partial responses were observed in 5 (13.5%), stable disease in 11 (29.7%), and progressive disease in 21 (56.8%) patients. Importantly, 13 (35.1%) patients developed HPD (&#8805; 2x increase in tumor growth rate from pre-trial vs on-trial, time to treatment failure &#8804; 2 months, and &#8805; 50% increase tumor burden). Changes in circulating cell-free DNA (n=20) tumor fraction using DELFI-TF, a mutation-independent, low-coverage whole genome sequencing approach, correlated with treatment responses. Pre-treatment serum from HPD (n=10 vs. 9 non-HPD) patients showed significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (CXCL10, CCL13, CCL8, CCL19, TRAIL) and Granzyme H, and higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10. Consistently, pre-treatment tumor transcriptomes of HPD (n=5 vs. 7 non-HPD) patients revealed suppression of IFN-gamma response, allograft rejection, and inflammatory response pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Concomitant TGF-beta and PD-L1 blockade is associated with a high frequency of HPD in SCLC patients. cfDNA could be critical for monitoring HPD.

Stool from pts before and after FMT were transplanted into avatar mice (MCA-205 or B16 OVA) and then treated with dual ICI.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In the 20 pts enrolled, 13 (65%) were male and median age was 56. Median follow-up was 6 months (range (IQR) 3.23; 12.33). FMT alone resulted in grade 1 toxicities. Grade 1-2 immune related adverse event (irAE) occurred in 80% of pts and 65% developed grade <u>&#62;<\/u>3 irAE. Diarrhea or colitis was the most frequent grade 3 irAE occurring in 4 (20%). 2 pts developed myocarditis (grade 3 and grade 4, respectively). 6 (30%) pts completed all 4 cycles of dual ICI. 6 (43%) pts that developed irAE grade 3 received FMT from the same donor. ORR was 70% (2 complete responses (CR) and 12 partial responses (PR)). Two pts died; one from unknown cause in PR and one from disease progression. Microbiome profiling beta-diversity analyses revealed separate clustering of responders (R) and non-responders (NR) post-FMT (p=0.024). We observed an enrichment of <i>Prevotella<\/i><i> <\/i><i>copri<\/i>, <i>Ruminoccocaceae<\/i> and <i>Eubacterium<\/i><i> <\/i>in R pts post-FMT<i>.<\/i> Pts who developed colitis were found to have a higher level of sST2 in plasma 1 week after FMT in comparison to those who did not develop colitis (p&#60;0.05). In both avatar murine tumor models, microbiome composition with R pts&#8217; feces (without ICI) 1 month post-FMT had reduced tumor growth compared to those treated with respective NR pt feces. Additionally, dual ICI led to significantly improved tumor control in mice treated with R pts&#8217; feces post-FMT(p&#60;0.005).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><b> <\/b>The addition of FMT to dual ICI resulted in significant irAEs that occurred earlier, although the proportion was similar to previously described literature, with encouraging ORR. Metagenomic analysis depicted differences in the microbiome profiles of R compared to NR pts post FMT. These results support the study of FMT and immunotherapy in the randomized setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Microbiome,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Therapies targeting commonly mutated G-protein pathway-associated GNAQ and GNA11 have not been met with clinical success. Recent kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens revealed that FAK and RAF\/MEK co-targeting may provide a new network-based precision therapeutic strategy for MUM treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-arm, single-institution, phase II study evaluating the combination of a FAK inhibitor (defactinib, VS-6063) with a RAF\/MEK inhibitor (avutometinib, VS-6766) for the treatment of MUM [NCT04720417]. Defactinib was given 200mg twice daily and avutometinib was given 3.2mg twice a week. Both drugs were given for 3 weeks on and 1 week off (28-day cycle). The primary endpoint of the study is disease control rate (DCR) including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) as determined by RECIST version 1.1 after two cycles. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. The trial was designed using a Simon&#8217;s two stage design where in stage I, a total of 8 patients would be accrued and if there are &#8804;2 overall responses, further enrollment would be stopped with the conclusion that DCR cannot be &#8805;50%. An additional 10 patients would be accrued in stage II, resulting in a total sample size of 18 patients.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Twelve patients with MUM were treated with the combination. Median lines of prior therapy was 2 (range 0-7), with 3 patients (25%) being treatment na&#239;ve. After 2 cycles, 6 patients achieved SD (50%) while the other 6 patients developed PD. No patients achieved CR or PR. Median duration of treatment was 2.6 months for all patients, and 5.6 months for patients with SD. With a median follow up of 16.5 months, the median PFS was 2.6 months and median OS was 18.4 months. All adverse events (AE) were Grade 1-2 except one Grade 3 AE of asymptomatic elevated CPK that resolved with holding treatment and did not recur upon restarting. Most common AEs were rash (100%), diarrhea (66.7%), peripheral edema (50%), nausea (50%), fatigue (50%), and blurred vision (41.7%). No dose reductions were required for any patients. Reduction of active ERK (pERK) was observed in 2 patients that achieved SD, but not in 2 patients that had PD. Trial enrollment was stopped early by study sponsors before the anticipated accrual of 18 patients due to no patients having significant reduction in disease.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In this phase II study of the combination regimen of FAK and RAF\/MEK inhibitors, stable disease was achieved in half of patients with MUM. Treatment was well tolerated with only one transient asymptomatic grade 3 CPK elevation. Further research should seek to elucidate an optimal combination treatment strategy such as FAK and PKC inhibitors for improved blocking of the downstream pathways of<i> GNAQ\/GNA11 <\/i>driver mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),MEK inhibitor,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Rino S.

Few therapies rationally target biologically selected subpopulations of melanoma. In the Cleveland Clinic Familial Melanoma Registry, a high rate of germline mutations in proteins that regulate DNA repair were seen. PARP inhibitors can lead to synthetic lethality and clinical benefit in patients with <i>BRCA<\/i> mutations or mutations associated with DNA damage repair (&#8220;BRCAness phenotype&#8221;). Additionally, preclinical models have shown that PARP inhibitors lead to STING activation, raising the hypothesis that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 could augment immune responses. We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the combination of the PARP inhibitor talazoparib with nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring germline or somatic DNA repair mutations. We enrolled a cohort of patients with multiple melanoma subtypes including cutaneous melanoma (3), melanoma arising from a blue nevus (2) and uveal melanoma (2). Mutant DNA repair genes included <i>BAP1<\/i> (4), <i>BRCA2<\/i> (1), <i>ATM<\/i> (1), <i>ATR<\/i> (1) and <i>ARID2<\/i> (1), 3 of which were germline. The patient population had highly refractory disease with 6 of 7 patients having progression after ipilimumab + nivolumab (5 of these were primary progression). The 7<sup>th<\/sup> patient had a recurrence after adjuvant nivolumab. Of the 7 patients enrolled, all progressed within 6 months (using RECIST and iRECIST criteria).The toxicity profile was consistent with known profile of PARP inhibitors (anemia). Although patient enrollment was limited, this study suggests that in heavily pretreated patients selected for DNA repair mutations the combination of PARP inhibitors and anti-PD-1 has no effect on RECIST-based tumor response. Additional studies are needed. Possible alternative selection strategies include evaluating for genomic evidence of homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) or targeting specific mutations (BRCA).<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{470439EC-F426-4578-84CC-4B7670825465}\"><caption>Patient Characteristics and Treatment Outcome<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Subtype of Melanoma<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gene Alteration<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Somatic or Germline<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TMB<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRAF Status<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior Therapy&nbsp;<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Status of Prior IO response<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Clinical Trial Response<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">76<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATM<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Germline<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N\/A<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression after Adjuvant<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Somatic<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">V600E<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab + Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Primary Progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">75<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Uveal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRCA2 and BAP1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Germline<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab + Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Primary Progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous\/Blue Nevus<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BAP1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Somatic<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab + Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Primary Progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">51<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous\/Blue Nevus<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BAP1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Germline<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab + Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Primary Progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">69<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Uveal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BAP1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Somatic<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pembrolizumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Primary Progression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cutaneous<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ARID2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Somatic<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ipilimumab + Nivolumab<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Secondary Resistance<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Progression<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Checkpoint Inhibitors,PARP inhibitors,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

This study presents the first results of ipilimumab and nivolumab in the sarcomatoid carcinoma of lung cohort (#11) of the SWOG S1609 Dual Anti-CTLA-4 &#38; Anti-PD-1 blockade in Rare Tumors (DART) trial.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>DART is a prospective, open-label, multicenter\/multi-cohort phase 2 clinical trial of ipilimumab (1mg\/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240mg intravenously every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST v1.1) (confirmed complete (CR) and partial responses (PR)); progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), stable disease (SD) &#62;6 months, and toxicity are secondary endpoints.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Fourteen evaluable patients (median age, 64 years) with sarcomatoid carcinoma lung tumors were analyzed.

Three patients with PR showed 100% regression with resolution of one of two non-measurable non-target lesions (DoR 36.8 months), 92% regression (DoR 6.6 months), and 52% regression (DoR 23.0+ months), respectively. Clinical benefit rate (CBR; no progression &#62; 6months) was 50.0% (7\/14). The median PFS was 6.1 months, median OS was 10.9 months. The most common adverse events were fatigue and dyspnea (46.2%, n=6 each), and pruritus and hypothyroidism (30.8%, n=4 each). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 30.8% of patients (n=4).

Chondrosarcoma is one of the most common bone malignancies in adults, occurring as conventional chondrosarcoma (CS) or the more-aggressive dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (dCS). There is no standard of care therapy approved for these malignancies. The activity of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in alveolar soft part sarcoma, together with case reports of ICI activity in these other sarcoma subtypes, prompted us to conduct a phase 2 clinical trial of atezolizumab (atezo), in patients (pts) with advanced CCS, CS, or dCS (NCT04458922).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We evaluated the effect of targeting PD-L1 with atezo upon the growth and immune landscape of CCS, CS, and dCS. Pts received intravenous atezo 1200 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> once every 21 days. Prior ICI therapy was not allowed. Tumor biopsy pairs for immuno-pharmacodynamic (IO-PD) studies were collected at baseline and on Cycle 3 Day 1(C3D1); paraffin sections were analyzed using immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy after staining with two multiplexed antibody panels (CD4\/FOXP3 and PD-L1\/CD8\/CD3&#950; pY142). Biomarker-positive cells within the tumor area and margins were quantified using image analysis algorithms. Activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were defined as CD8+ CD3&#950; pY142+ and reported as the percentage of the total CD8+ cell density.<br \/><b><i><\/i><\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Nine pts were enrolled per disease cohort. No RECIST objective responses were observed; accrual was closed due to futility. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.66 months (range: 1.3 to 11.7) in CCS, 3.22 (range: 1.4 to 8.9) in CS, and 2.04 (range: 0.4 to 11.7) in dCS. IF microscopy of biopsy pairs from five CCS pts revealed varied immune landscapes: 4\/5 C3D1 biopsies contained PD-L1+ cells, 4\/5 contained CD8+ cells, and 3\/5 contained activated CTLs. Immune phenotype did not generally correlate with response; however, the highest percentage of activated CTLs occurred in the CCS pt with the longest PFS and this pt showed an increase in PD-L1+ cells on treatment&#8212;consistent with target engagement of the PD-L1\/PD-1 immune checkpoint. dCS biopsy pairs (N=3) also contained a range of biomarker densities that did not correlated with PFS. In dCS and CCS, on-treatment increases in the percentage of activated CTLs were accompanied by increased Treg cell density in some pts. In contrast, CS biopsies (N=5) were uniformly devoid of infiltrating immune cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The tumor microenvironment of CS is an immune desert, while dCS and CCS tumors contain a range of immune cell compositions. Atezo treatment increased the percentage of activated CTLs and density of PD-L1+ cells in some tumors, but an increase in Treg cells may explain why that pharmacodynamic evidence of ICI activity (the increase in activated CTLs) was not associated with clinical response.

Trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate approved in <i>HER2<\/i>-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Here we present efficacy and safety data of trastuzumab emtansine in pts with <i>HER2<\/i>mut advanced\/metastatic solid tumors (excluding <i>HER2<\/i> amplifications) from Cohort F of the TAPISTRY trial (NCT04589845).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TAPISTRY is a phase II, global, open-label, multi-cohort basket trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of multiple therapies in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors. Pts in Cohort F were &#8805;12 years old, with tumors harboring an activating <i>HER2 <\/i>mutation identified by NGS, and measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg\/kg IV was administered every 21 days; tumor assessments were performed at screening, every 6 weeks from day 1\/cycle 1 for one year, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Primary endpoint: objective response rate (ORR) by independent review committee (IRC). Key secondary endpoints: ORR by investigator; duration of response; progression-free survival; overall survival; safety.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> At data cut-off (16 Jul 2023), 35 pts with 10 different tumor types were efficacy evaluable; the most common tumor type was non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 31%). Baseline characteristics and key outcomes are presented in the Table. After a median follow-up of 7 months, ORR by IRC in efficacy-evaluable pts was 14.3% (n\/N=5\/35; 95% CI 4.8-30.3]). Responses were observed in 3 tumor types: NSCLC (n\/N=1\/11), breast (n\/N=3\/5), endometrial (n\/N=1\/1). The most frequent adverse events were decreased appetite, fatigue, and nausea (25.7% each). No new safety signals were identified.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Trastuzumab emtansine in pts with <i>HER2<\/i>mut tumors (excluding <i>HER2<\/i> amplifications) did not meet its primary endpoint.
