[{"Abstract":"Ovarian cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, remains a formidable challenge, especially in the context of platinum-resistant disease. This study investigated the potential of the benzimidazole derivative BNZ-111 as a novel treatment strategy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. With improved pharmacokinetic parameters, BNZ-111 effectively disrupts tubulin polymerization through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. It demonstrated strong cytotoxicity in both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines, inducing apoptosis and G2\/M cell cycle arrest. In vivo experiments using orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models showed significant tumor growth inhibition without apparent toxicity to vital organs. Unlike paclitaxel, BNZ-111 proved effective in paclitaxel-resistant cells, potentially by bypassing interaction with MDR1 and modulating &#946;-3 tubulin expression to suppress microtubule dynamics. This study suggests that BNZ-111, with favorable drug-like properties, holds promise as a therapeutic option for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, addressing a critical clinical need in gynecologic oncology","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Resistance,Paclitaxel,Tubulin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.-W.

Here, we present seven novel flavonoid derivatives, and test them for their anti-tumor activity in various models derived from hematological cancers and solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: MTT assessed anti-proliferative activity after 72h of exposure to increasing concentrations of drugs. Tubulin Polymerization Assay was performed with 3-fold dilutions (15-0.02 &#956;M), compared to paclitaxel (1-3 &#956;M) or vinblastine (3 &#956;M) as references. The OncolinesProfiler analysis was used to compare IC50 fingerprints determined on the Oncolines cell line panel to the IC50 fingerprints of 213 pre-profiled reference drugs.<br \/>Results: SDN207, SND210, SND216, SND462, SND504, SND524, and SND562 were designed and synthesized using a flavonoid polyphenol scaffold selectively modified to markedly increase cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. All seven compounds showed dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity across 15 lymphoma cell lines derived from germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=6), activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL (n=2), mantle cell lymphoma (n=4), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (n=3). Activity in the nM range was seen with five compounds: SDN207 (median IC50 1.6 nM; 95%CI, 1.3-3.2), SND210 (1.4 nM; 95%CI, 0.9-3.3), SND216 (19.5 nM; 95%CI, 10-38 nM), SND562 (28.9 nM; 95%CI, 15.4-57.7), and SND524 (46.7 nM; 95%CI, 32-133.3). Both other compounds had a median IC50 of 2 &#956;&#924; (SND462, 95%CI, 1.1-4.5 &#956;M; SND504, 95%CI, 0.5-3.9 &#956;M). There were no differences based on lymphoma histology. The anti-tumor activity was maintained in MZL cell lines with acquired resistance to BTK and PI3K inhibitors (n=3). Six compounds were also assessed for their anti-tumor activity in models other than lymphomas (SDN207, n=31; SND210, n=20; SND462, n=4; SND504, n=4; SND524, n=9; SND562, n=35), confirming the higher activity for SDN207, SND210, SND562, and SND524. Regarding the mechanism of action, up to now, a tubulin polymerization assay was performed for three compounds. Microtubule depolymerization (SND207), and microtubule polymerization (SND524, SND562) were observed at concentrations as low as 20 nM. The OncolinesProfiler identified the tubulin-targeting agents vinblastine, vincristine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel among the top reference compounds most correlated with SND207 and SND210 (<i>i.e., <\/i>Pearson correlation &#62; 0.5).<br \/>Conclusions: Novel compounds developed using plant-derived skeletons have shown in vitro anti-tumor activity in lymphomas, leukemias, and solid tumors, including models of resistance to targeted agents.

The aim of the current study was to delineate the molecular mechanism of microtubule destabilization by AUS_001 and to provide insight into its high potency and low toxicity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments revealed the direct interaction of AUS_001 with tubulin with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 2.13&#215;10<sup>-5<\/sup>M. Size exclusion competition assays and an X-ray crystal structure of the tubulin-AUS_001 complex at 2.1 &#197; resolution establish ligand binding within the colchicine site on tubulin. Since colchicine-site ligands are well known to inhibit the curved-to-straight conformational transition of tubulin, which is an essential process for microtubule formation, these results readily explain the microtubule-destabilizing activity of the compound. Notably, while both combretastatin A4 (CA-4) and AUS_001 are both colchicine-site stilbene ligands, CA-4 binds in the <i>cis<\/i> configuration, while AUS_001 maintains a <i>trans <\/i>configuration leading to a substantially different pocket engagement. Comparison of the tubulin-AUS_001 complex structure with the ones of tubulin-colchicine and tubulin-plinabulin revealed that AUS_001 elicits different rearrangements in the T7 loop of &#946;-tubulin versus colchicine and occupies a different zone of the pocket relative to plinabulin, further elaborating its unique binding properties. Interestingly, AUS_001 exhibits a higher relative affinity than colchicine itself, as assessed by i) an ultrafiltration-based tubulin-ligand release assay and ii) a radioligand colchicine competition assay. However, fitting steady state SPR data for AUS_001 binding to tubulin revealed fast association and dissociation rates and was indicative of reversible binding. The latter finding is corroborated by AUS_001-triggered reverse biological effects including morphological alterations, cell cycle G2\/M arrest, and by a decrease of cell viability upon discontinuation of the drug treatment in glioma and pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, colchicine, CA-4 or paclitaxel administered at the same doses as those applied for AUS_001 failed to reverse the drug-induced phenotypes upon removal resulting in sustained cytotoxicity. In conclusion, we fully characterized the unique binding mode of AUS_001 to the colchicine site of tubulin and elucidated the reversible nature of the target engagement. AUS_001 features a distinctive and reversible molecular interaction with tubulin which provides a plausible explanation for its favorable safety profile compared to other microtubule targeting agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microtubules,Small molecule drugs,Trans configuration,Reversible binding,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"H.

Employing copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), two distinct series of ED variants were synthesized. The initial series included thirteen dimers, derived from 17&#945;-ethinyl estradiol, incorporating varied five-atom linkers with central carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, and, in some instances, modified with benzyl groups containing hydroxy or methoxy substituents. These dimers were evaluated for their cytotoxic properties and impact on the cell cycle, revealing certain structures with substantial efficacy, compared with the original ED. The subsequent series, encompassing twelve variants, concentrated on structural alterations within the aromatic bridges linking the estradiol units. In this series, linkers of simpler composition and fewer substituents demonstrated increased selectivity and potency against cancer cell lines, particularly ED3 and ED5, which exhibited cytotoxicity levels comparable to established tubulin inhibitors. Both dimers series showed the ability to disrupt microtubule assembly and mitotic processes, confirmed through cell-based evaluations and in vitro tubulin assembly assays. Complementing these results, in silico modelling and binding free energy calculations exhibited a strong correlation with the demonstrated biological activities, especially in terms of binding affinity to the colchicine site. Collectively, these findings highlight the promise of estradiol dimers as potential anticancer agents and emphasize the critical role of linker structures in enhancing their biological effectiveness.

BPR0L075 inhibits tubulin polymerization (microtubule de-stabilizer) by binding to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin. We previously reported that BPR0L075 overcomes paclitaxel (microtubule stabilizer) resistance and induces vascular-disruption in vitro and in vivo. We observed that breast and ovarian cancer cells treated with BPR0L075 in vitro induced key hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In both human and murine, ovarian (OVCAR3, ID8) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, 4T1) cell lines, treatment with low nanomolar concentration of BPR0L075 significantly decreased the viability of cells evidenced by SRB assay. Using a known ICD inducer mitoxantrone as a positive control, both flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence staining assays demonstrated that BPR0L075 treatment led to a time- and dose-dependent translocation of calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein, on the plasma membrane of dying cells which sends an &#8220;eat me&#8221; signal. The BPR0L75 treatment also led to secretion of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), a non-histone chromatin-binding nuclear protein, as well as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the cell into the extracellular space using ELISA assay. These damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are known to lead to antigen-presenting cell recruitment, phagocytosis, maturation of dendritic cells, and chemotaxis. The appearance of the ICD biomarkers (calreticulin exposure, HMGB1 and ATP release) supports BPR0L075 as an ICD-inducing antimitotic agent. Further in vivo studies are warranted to delineate the effect of BPR0L075 on immune activation and recruitment of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Ovarian cancer,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This study presents the first data on this small molecule and its activity as an anti-cancer therapy in multiple preclinical models. USP1 is a deubiquitinase, member of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family that plays an important role at the replication fork during DNA replication. Its prominent role in DNA repair, targeting Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) that regulates polymerase recruitment in the translesion synthesis (TLS), makes it an emergent target in the DNA damage repair (DDR) field.<br \/>Methods: In silico docking has been used to identify a likely binding site of Debio 0432. Biochemical and cellular assays have been performed to show its activity on the target and in cell lines of different cancer types. In vivo models in cell line derived xenograft (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) were then used to confirm the activity of the compound and to study PK\/PD relationship.<br \/>Results: Debio 0432 likely binds USP1 in an allosteric pocket and is very selective across the 58 members of the USP family. Furthermore, it does not affect any kinase. Its biochemical activity on USP1 is in the low nanomolar range and cellular activity ranges between from single digit nM to above 1uM. In vivo, Debio 0432 shows antitumor activity in the BRCA mutant breast cancer model MDA-MB-436. The downstream target Ub-PCNA, selected as pharmacodynamic marker, is modulated in a dose and plasma exposure-dependent manner. Further in vivo experiments in PDX models showed dose-dependent activity in different cancer types, in both BRCA wild type and mutant models.

Despite the significant therapeutic benefits in patients with BRCAm or HRD, innate and acquired resistance to PARPi is still a challenge in the clinic. To address this clinical challenge, we developed HSK39775, a potent, highly selective inhibitor of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (USP1), which acts as an oncogenic and PARP inhibitor resistance driver involved in DNA damage repair pathway through the deubiquitylation of proteins in Translesion Synthesis pathway and Fanconi Anemia pathway, paired with BRCA as a synthetic lethality target. HSK39775 was active in enzymatic level to inhibit USP1\/UAF1 complex. Enzymatic panel screening containing 50 deubiquitinase demonstrated high selectivity of HSK39775. Ubiquitinated PCNA was accumulated treated by HSK39775, indicating target engagement. HSK39775 also demonstrated potent anti-proliferation activity against cancer cell lines with BRCA mutation and excellent selectivity between BRCA WT vs. BRCAm. Combining HSK39775 with PARP inhibitors indicated synergy in cell lines with partial or insensitivity to each agent alone. Triple-negative BRCA mutant breast cancer xenograft model demonstrated strong dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of HSK39775 as a single agent with Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) of 63.2% at 30 mg\/kg QD, and ubiquitinated PCNA was also accumulated in HSK39775 treated tumor tissue. Meanwhile, combination with PARP inhibitors significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of HSK39775 in xenograft model and led to tumor regressions and durable tumor control even at low dose (TGI:89% (HSK39775, 5 mg\/kg + Olaparib, 50 mg\/kg)). Interestingly, HSK39775 inhibited the tumor growth of a HRP and BRCA wild-type lung cancer xenograft as a single agent with TGI of 94% at 30 mg\/kg QD, suggesting the therapeutic effect of USP1 inhibitors beyond canonical BRCA mutant or HRD tumors. In summary, these results indicate HSK39775 as a potent and selective USP1 inhibitor and support further development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,HRD,Synthetic lethality,USP1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

USP1 contributes to oncogenesis by playing critical roles in DNA damage repair processes including translesion synthesis and the Fanconi anemia pathway. Despite the clinical benefit achieved with PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) or homologous recombination deficient (HRD+) populations, some patients either do not respond to therapy or develop resistance. USP1 inhibitors may have the potential to address this unmet clinical need as USP1 functions in distinct DNA damage repair pathway as compared to PARP. ASN-3186 is a novel, potent, and selective USP1 inhibitor with enzyme IC50 value of single digit nanomolar and selectivity &#62;1000-fold against other family members. ASN-3186 demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activity in the BRCA1m triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-436 (IC50 &#60;30 nM). MDA-MB-436 CDX mouse model confirmed dose-dependent, single-agent inhibitory activity of ASN-3186 in vivo with higher potency than KSQ4279, possibly due to ASN-3186&#8217;s higher oral bioavailability. Efficacy is consistent with increase of pharmacodynamic biomarker ub-PCNA. The combination of ASN-3186 and PARPi Olaparib yielded a more robust and durable anti-tumor response, with near-complete tumor regression demonstrated at higher combination dose. Moreover, addition of ASN-3186 significantly sensitized Olaparib&#8217;s minimal anti-tumor activity in CAOV3 (ovarian, HRD high) and MX-1 (TNBC, BCRA1\/2 mut) models, which are resistant to PAPRi, indicating that it has the potential to overcome PARPi resistance. Synthetic lethal activity was also observed when ASN-3186 was combined with DNA damage drug Gemcitabine. Furthermore, ASN-3186 displayed desirable ADME and PK profiles with high oral bioavailabilities (&#62;75%) across species. These data support further clinical development of ASN-3186 as a potential best-in-class USP1 inhibitor, both as a single agent as well as in combination with PARPi, for treatment of BRCA1\/2 mut and HRD+ cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,Ubiquitin-specific protease 1,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

FEN1 is an attractive target for development of anticancer therapeutics because it is overexpressed in many tumor types and has a large number of synthetic lethality partners including genes in Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway (Mengwasser et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2020).<br \/>Utilizing fragment-based drug discovery approach we identified a novel metal-binding pharmacophore that binds to the two magnesium ions in the FEN1 active site. Further elaboration using fragment growth strategies resulted in highly potent and selective inhibitors. The current lead (BSM-1516) is ~65-fold more potent against FEN1 than its related enzyme Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) in biochemical assays (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 7 nM and 460 nM, respectively), an improvement of more than an order of magnitude in selectivity compared to earlier efforts. FEN1 target engagement in live cells was validated by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 24 nM). Inhibition of FEN1 led to its increased association with chromatin in S-phase cells and recruitment of PARP1 enzyme.<br \/>In clonogenic assay, BRCA2-deficient DLD1 cells were ~15-fold more sensitive to FEN1 inhibition than their isogenic BRCA2-wild-type counterparts (EC<sub>50<\/sub> of 350 nM and 5 &#181;M, respectively), confirming the increased susceptibility of HR deficient cancer cells to FEN1 inhibition. Treatment of BRCA2-deficient but not wild-type DLD1 cells with BSM-1516 resulted in cell cycle arrest and dose-dependent decrease of S-phase BrdU incorporation into DNA. Cell cycle arrest of BRCA2-deficient DLD1 cells was accompanied by DNA damage signaling and by accumulation of chromatin-bound RPA32, a marker of ssDNA.<br \/>To explore synthetic lethal interactions of FEN1 with other DNA repair genes we performed FEN1-inhibitor-anchored CRISPR screen. This analysis revealed that in addition to HR pathway inactivation, genomic perturbations in EXO1, USP1 and PARP1 genes sensitized cells to FEN1 inhibition. Synergistic relationships of BSM-1516 and its combination potential were further explored in viability studies with a panel of DDR inhibitors (n=25) in BRCA2-proficient and deficient cell lines. Strong synergy was identified with multiple drug classes that included inhibitors of USP1 (KSQ-4279), PARP (Olaparib, Niraparib, Talazoparib, AZD5305), PARG (PDD 00017273) and ATR (AZD6738, VE-822, Elimusertib).<br \/>In vitro ADME assays and in vivo PK studies showed that BSM-1516 has properties suitable for in vivo testing, either as a single agent or in combination with synergistic DDR inhibitors, an investigation that is currently underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Inhibitors,Synthetic lethality,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jason Munguia<sup><\/sup>, Sanjay Agarwalla<sup><\/sup>, Elaine Guo<sup><\/sup>, Dave Martin<sup><\/sup>, Junhua Fan<sup><\/sup>, Dave Lonergan<sup><\/sup>, David Puerta<sup><\/sup>, Zachary Zimmerman<sup><\/sup>, <b>Konstantin Taganov<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Blacksmith Medicines, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f6ebe70b-e888-4608-b6ad-8a606f18245b","ControlNumber":"5635","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

USP1, a specific deubiquitinating enzyme, has gained attention as a potential synthetic lethality target for BRCA-mutated cancers. At AIGEN Sciences, Inc., we've integrated the advanced capabilities of our human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI drug discovery platform, AIGEN ChemTailor. This cutting-edge platform thrives on continuous learning enhanced by expert feedback, refining our approach to drug discovery. Using AIGEN ChemTailor, we synthesized a specific USP1 inhibitor. Its inhibitory capabilities were validated through the Ubiquitin-rhodamine 110 assay. Notably, our inhibitor presented remarkable anti-proliferative effects on BRCA1 mutant cells (MDA-MB-436) while showing no activity against BRCA wild-type cells (HCC1954), highlighting its specificity. The efficacy of our inhibitor was enhanced when combined with PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib or AZD5305, especially in UWB1.289 cells. Impressively, the USP1 inhibitor also effectively targeted PARPi-resistant cell lines, including A2780-ola, UWB1.289-nir, HCC38-ola, MDA-MB-468-ola, U251MG-ola, and OVCAR8-ola. Clonogenic assays with MDA-MB-436 and MCF-10A emphasized our inhibitor's selectivity towards BRCA mutant phenotypes. Subsequent studies demonstrated the compound's mechanism: inducing replication stress by impairing of DNA synthesis and activating DNA damage pathways via ATR signaling. Preclinical mouse studies highlighted favorable pharmacokinetics and involved the assessment of anti-tumor effects in animal models. In summation, our USP1 inhibitor, developed using AIGEN ChemTailor and advanced molecular modeling techniques, stands out as a potent therapeutic against BRCA-mutated cancers and PARP inhibitor-resistant strains.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Ubiquitination,PARP inhibitors,BRCA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In recent years, more attention has been paid to HER2 and HER3&#8217;s roles in colorectal cancers, as they may cause resistance to targeted therapies. We are investigating the role of naturally co-occurring HER3 and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, as about 6% of all colorectal cancers contain a HER3 mutation and 41% contain a KRAS mutation. We have observed that there is a statistically significant co-occurrence of HER3 and KRAS mutations in CRCs while there is mutual exclusivity with mutations in EGFR or HER4 and mutant KRAS in CRC examining 6791 samples from 17 studies. There is a tendency for co-occurrence with HER2 and KRAS mutations that is not statistically significant in these CRC tumor samples. We have found that genetic knockdown of both KRAS and HER3 with siRNA targeting KRAS and HER3 in the CRC cell line SNU-407 (HER3<sup>V104M<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>) results in a statistical reduction in cell proliferation in comparison to genetic knockdown with only KRAS or HER3. Using the SW620 CRC cell line (HER3<sup>WT<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>) as a comparison, we have observed that knocking down HER3 using siRNA had no effect on cell proliferation whereas KRAS knockdown reduced proliferation and the combination showed no statistical difference compared to knocking down only KRAS. Additionally, we have found that there is a striking increase in total HER3 levels in SNU-407 cells when treated with the KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitor MRTX1133. This feedback loop could limit the efficacy of the KRAS inhibitor. We wished to delineate mutant HER3&#8217;s binding partner(s) as HER3 is kinase impaired. Strikingly, we have found that EGFR immunoprecipitates with HER3 in SNU-407 cells. We are expanding our studies to CRC patient derived xenografts (PDXs) with co-occurring HER3 and KRAS mutations and have generated patient derived organoids from these PDXs. Ongoing studies are determining if there is a synergistic relationship with KRAS inhibitors and HER family inhibitors including a HER3 antibody-drug conjugate. Our findings may present a new paradigm for targeted combination therapies in colorectal cancer with the eventual goal of increased overall patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,KRAS,HER3,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Most women with this disease experience a recurrence after curative-intent therapy for early breast cancer, while a smaller proportions are diagnosed with distant metastases initially. Cancer cells are characterized by their reprogramming of glucose metabolism. Cancer cells show increased proliferation along with higher energy and substrate demands. Through our efforts to find effective therapies for TNBC, we have identified CET019, a new small molecule that effectively suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Cell viability and clonogenic assays were performed on a range of TNBC cells, including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SUM159, HCC1395, HCC1806, EMT6, and 4T1. Cell cycle distribution was assessed through flow cytometry. LC-MS\/MS analysis was performed on TMT-labeled samples for global proteome profiling. The efficacy of CET019 (30 mg\/kg) was tested using tumor and patient derived xenograft studies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our studies show that CET019 suppresses the clonogenic potential and growth of various triple-negative breast cancer cells. The CET019 treatment causes cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells at the G2\/M phase. Proteomics analysis suggests that CET019 specifically affects metabolic and proteosomal pathways. In vivo studies with CET019 found an inhibition of tumor growth kinetics in the mouse xenograft study with different TNBC models, as compared to the control group. We also observed that CET019 inhibited metastatic lung nodules. The results were further substantiated in three Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In summary, our study has identified a novel small molecule candidate CET019 as a promising lead candidate for TNBC treatment, paving the way for further development.&#8220;The complete chemical structures of the compounds used will be disclosed at the time of presentation at the meeting.&#8221;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Although the development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provided new treatment options, patients with FLT3-mutant AML still suffer from high relapse rates when treated with FLT3 TKI alone. Accumulating evidence supports a combination treatment strategy to lower the recurrence rate. We have previously shown that PHI-101 demonstrated potent activity in various FLT3 mutant AML cell lines when used alone. Here we explore the use of PHI-101 in combination with other therapeutics in preclinical models of AML. We investigated the preclinical efficacy of the combination of PHI-101 with FDA-approved AML therapeutic agents in FLT3 mutant (MV4-11, Molm13, Molm14) and wild-type (THP-1) AML cell lines. Cell growth inhibition was assessed by CCK-8 and\/or CellTiter-Glo assays. The Chou-Talalay method was used to calculate the combination index (CI) to test for synergy. Western blotting analysis was performed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the combination effects. AML xenograft mouse models were used to assess the in vivo<\/i> efficacy of PHI-101 combination therapy. Statistical comparisons included unpaired t-tests or one-way ANOVA. Combination treatment of PHI-101 with venetoclax or azacytidine showed strong synergistic effects on growth inhibition against both FLT3-ITD mutant (CI&#60;0.3) and wild-type AML cells (CI &#60;0.6). It is noteworthy that the FLT3-ITD homozygous cell line (MV4-11) showed especially strong synergism (CI &#60;0.1). In the xenograft mouse model experiments, 14-day treatment with either PHI-101 alone or in combination with venetoclax or azacytidine showed significant suppression of tumor growth compared to venetoclax or azacytidine alone (in average tumor growth inhibition (TGI) 88.3% vs 8.6%)(p&#60;0.05). In particular, PHI-101 3 mg\/kg\/day (mpk) with venetoclax 80mpk resulted in a stronger anti-tumor effect (TGI 94.2%) compared to PHI-101 (TGI 87.4%) or venetoclax alone (-9.6% of TGI) (p&#60;0.05) even 21 days after stopping the treatment. In addition, PHI-101 treatment showed a survival advantage in AML animal models, and the combination with venetoclax led to significantly longer survival compared to the control groups. Our preclinical data showed that the combination of PHI-101 with venetoclax or azacytidine resulted in a highly effective anti-leukemic response against AML cells by inducing DNA damage, BCL-2 inhibition, and MCL-1 degradation. Additionally, treatment of mice with low-dose PHI-101 inhibited tumor regrowth and further potentiated venetoclax or azacytidine response in vivo<\/i>. Our results suggest that the combination of PHI-101 and venetoclax or azacitidine may have the advantage of improving clinical responses in FLT3-ITD AML patients and offers a potential therapeutic option to treat patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed\/refractory FLT3-mutant AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,FLT3,Combination studies,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-s.

As cancer cells maintain elevated polyamine pools through dysregulated polyamine metabolism, its pharmacological modulation is a promising avenue in cancer therapeutics. The polyamine analogue ivospemin has shown efficacy in slowing pancreatic and ovarian tumor progression in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated encouraging results in pancreatic cancer clinical trials. Considering nearly 75% of late-stage ovarian cancer patients develop resistant to platinum-based chemotherapies, limiting treatment options, the aim of our study is to determine the potential efficacy of ivospemin in combination with doxorubicin, a common chemotherapeutic used in platinum-resistant ovarian tumors. We have previously shown that ivospemin exposure decreases polyamine content in a variety of cancer cell lines through downregulation of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and induction of the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine\/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). Here we examine the potential of combining ivospemin with doxorubicin. Ivospemin treatment reduces cell viability in ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines and increases the toxicity of doxorubicin regardless of cisplatin sensitivity. Cells treated with the combination exhibit a greater decrease in polyamine levels than cells treated with either single agent. This increased polyamine depletion and decreased survival is accomplished through modulation of polyamine metabolism, predominately through an additive induction of SSAT activity. Using the syngeneic VDID8+ ovarian murine model, we further evaluated the ability of ivospemin to improve response to doxorubicin at clinical and sub-clinical dosing. Ascites fluid was used as a marker for tumor burden and evaluated for polyamine content. We found that the combination treatment increases median survival, delays tumor onset, and decreases overall tumor burden compared to either clinical or subclinical doxorubicin dosing schemes. Combination treatment also decreases overall polyamine content in the ascites by 75%. N1-acetylated spermidine is enriched in ascites from combination-treated mice, consistent with an upregulation of SSAT in response to treatment. Recognizing the non-representative mutational status of the VDID8+ model as a limitation, we are currently evaluating the combination of ivospemin and doxorubicin in genetically defined murine models that better recapitulate human high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Ongoing studies will determine influences on the tumor microenvironment and will mechanistically evaluate the cooperativity of ivospemin and doxorubicin on pathways outside of polyamine metabolism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polyamines,Doxorubicin,Metabolism,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The development of chemoresistance contributes to poor overall prognosis associated with ovarian cancer and high cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Herein, we found that Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pan-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, is a potent agent to overcome Cisplatin (CP) resistance in ovarian cancer treatment. Firstly, we elucidated that phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (pPDH) was elevated in CP-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Then, blockage of pPDH by DCA treatment significantly inhibited cell migratory and invasive capacity in CP-resistant ovarian cancer cells through the transition of motile mesenchymal phenotypes into epithelial characteristics. DCA markedly decreased the number of sphere formations and attenuated the stem cell-like properties in CP-resistant ovarian cancer cells. In combination with CP treatment, DCA effectively inhibited cell proliferation in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells by triggering apoptosis. Collectively, we suggested that DCA is a promising drug to reverse CP resistance for ovarian cancer treatment. We further tested the underlying mechanisms of DCA to restore CP sensitivity in ovarian cancer. We found that CP treatment promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce cell death in CP-sensitive ovarian cancer. However, CP-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibited higher basal levels of ROS compared with sensitive cancer cells, and CP treatment failed to generate ROS production. That means ovarian cancer cells steadily adapted to elevated ROS levels, then becoming ROS-adapted ovarian cancer cells to survive. Interestingly, DCA treatment results in the buildup of ROS production, causing cell death in CP-resistant ovarian cancer. Therefore, our study suggests that ROS production can be an attractive target in DCA treatment to restore CP sensitivity in ovarian cancer.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-14 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Dichloracetate,Ovarian cancer,ROS production,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

Our western blot analyses in multiple osteosarcoma cell lines demonstrated that PCT inhibits &#946;-catenin pathway. Fluorescence microscopy and PCR analyses substantiated PCT's ability to hinder the nuclear translocation of &#946;-catenin, providing mechanistic insights into its anti-tumor properties. Our preliminary data also suggests that AXL, an upstream regulator of &#946;-catenin pathway, was modulated by PCT.
