[{"Abstract":"Background: Cancer survivors are at an increased risk of cardiovascular comorbidity, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure, due to negative impacts of cancer treatments on vascular function. Exercise is recommended in recent cardio-oncology rehabilitation guidelines and has been shown to improve vascular function in clinical populations; however, its effects on vascular function are understudied in clinical oncology settings.<br \/>Purpose: This pilot study examined whether a circuit, interval-based exercise intervention can improve vascular function, assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (baFMD) and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: Overweight or obese (BMI&#62;25.0 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), sedentary breast, prostate or colorectal cancer survivors were randomized to exercise (n=60) or usual care (n=30). Survivors in the 4-month exercise intervention trained three times\/week, in a circuit, interval-based supervised moderate-vigorous aerobic (65-85% of VO<sub>2<\/sub>max) and resistance (65-85% of 1-repetition maximum) program. cIMT and baFMD were measured at baseline and post-intervention via an ultrasound. Paired t-tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance were run to assess within- and between-group differences.<br \/>Results: The study sample included breast (n=38), prostate (n=24), colorectal (n=28) cancer survivors who were 63.2 &#177; 10.8 years old, completed chemotherapy and\/or radiation (75%) and were obese (87%). Post-intervention, baFMD significantly increased in the exercise group compared to the control group (between-group mean difference: 6.3%; 95% CI: [1.9 to 9.3], p=0.001). There was also a significant reduction in cIMT in the exercise group compared to the control group (between-group mean difference: -0.039mm, 95% CI: [-0.080 to -0.009], p=0.002).<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings in this pilot study support that a circuit, interval-based aerobic and resistance exercise intervention may improve vascular function in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors. Future studies are recommended to understand how exercise interventions can be utilized clinically to improve cardiovascular disease risk and co-morbidity among cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Physical activity,Survival,Cancer,Cardio-Oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Pre- and Post-adherence to physical activity was determined within two years from cancer diagnosis. The primary outcome was incident ischemic stroke.

Notably, these advantages are not limited to individuals who were physically active before their diagnosis, and it is not too late to start post-diagnosis. Preventive strategies against ischemic stroke in cancer survivors should emphasize the incorporation of regular physical activity at any stage of their cancer journey.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Physical activity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, the effect of opioid receptor activity on immune function is complicated, facilitated by several mechanisms and can lead to enhancement or inhibition. Similarly, the relation between cannabinoid ligands of diverse types and endocannabinoid receptors on various immune cells is complex. We hereby delineate the effect of prescription opioids and recreational cannabis use on immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in various cancers, as well as efficacy outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC).<br \/>Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with advanced cancers who received ICI with or without chemotherapy for at least two months at an urban safety net hospital from January 2016 to June 2022. All patients, as well as a subset of patients with aNSCLC, were divided into two arms based on whether they were prescribed opioids during ICI therapy or not (OP vs. NO). Similarly, they were grouped based on whether they reported recreational cannabis use during ICI therapy (since initiation of therapy) or not (CA vs. NC). Incidence of IRAEs, median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) calculated per RECIST 1.1 were the outcome variables. Multivariate logistic regression and alternative log-rank test were utilized for analysis with adjustments for demographics, insurance status, BMI, ECOG, PD-L1, TMB, smoking and concurrent chemotherapy.<br \/>Results: 230 patients received ICI-based therapy; 47% were female, 34% were African American and 6.5% were Hispanic. There was no significant difference in the incidence of IRAEs between OP (n=144) and NO (n=86; p=0.225). However, CA (n=44) had higher IRAEs than NC (n=186) with an odds ratio estimate of 2.023 (X<sup>2<\/sup>=4.18, CI 1.03-3.97, p=0.04). Among 110 patients with aNSCLC, 46% were female. Patients with aNSCLC in the OP arm (n=69) had no significant difference in mOS (HR=1.34, CI 0.8-2.25, p=0.26) or mPFS (HR=1.21, CI 0.69-2.1, p=0.51) compared to patients in the NO arm (n=51). Similarly, the two arms CA (n=21) and NC (n=89) had no difference in mOS (HR:0.96, CI 0.5-1.83, p=0.89) or mPFS (HR:1.18, CI 0.61-2.29, p=0.63) for aNSCLC.<br \/>Conclusion: Recreational cannabis use during ICI therapy increased the incidence of IRAEs. Prescription opioids and recreational cannabis use did not significantly affect survival outcomes for ICI in aNSCLC. Prescription opioid use also did not significantly influence the occurrence of IRAEs. This study suggests that recreational cannabis may need to be used with caution in this patient population due to its influence on IRAEs. On the other hand, opioids appear to be a safe option for pain management in these patients. Larger studies are warranted to shed more insight into the effect of these substances on ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Overall survival,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Palliative care,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, there are no standard recommendations for assessing CVD risk in patients with CRC. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a measure of the quantity of coronary artery calcification using noninvasive scanning and has been shown to be predictive of CVD risk. This prospective cohort study utilizes CAC to evaluate the occurrence of subclinical atherosclerosis at the time of CRC diagnosis and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). <b>Methods:<\/b> The ColoCare Study is a prospective cohort study across six U.S. and European sites. Data from one of the ColoCare consortium sites in Los Angeles, California was analyzed. Adults with newly diagnosed stage I- IV colorectal cancer and available non-contrast CT scans were included. Electronic medical records were reviewed for assessment of baseline cardiovascular risk factors and adverse events. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as the presence of CAC (CAC&#62;0). CAC was manually measured from routine oncologic diagnostic CT and PET-CT scans at the time of cancer diagnosis using the Agatston method. MACE was defined as hospitalization due to heart failure, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, or ischemic stroke after the diagnosis of CRC cancer. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between CAC at diagnosis and the risk of MACE. <b>Results:<\/b> Among 109 individuals with CAC measured at the time of CRC diagnosis, 41 (37.6%) had subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC=1-399 [n=29], CAC&#62;400 [n=12]). Individuals with CAC&#62;0 were older (67.0 vs. 51.9 years, p&#60;0.01), more likely to be former or current smokers (48.0 vs. 29.0 years, p=0.04), and to have hypertension (61% vs. 23%, p&#60;0.01) compared to those without CAC (CAC=0). Among individuals with CAC (n=41), 51.2% had scores &#62;100, and 29.2% had scores &#62;400, indicating moderate and severe atherosclerosis respectively. Among patients with moderate or greater CAC burden (&#62;100; statin therapy indicated), 28.6% were not on statin therapy. CAC&#62;0 was associated with an increased incidence of MACE (13% vs. 53%, p&#60;0.01). <b>Discussion:<\/b> Subclinical atherosclerosis was observed in nearly 40% of patients with CRC at diagnosis and MACE occurred in 38.2% of patients. Most patients were under-optimized for CVD risk, with nearly 30% of statin-eligible patients with at least moderate CAC burden not prescribed statin therapy. These findings highlight an opportunity for improved CVD risk mitigation in patients with CRC, including guidelines-based CVD risk factor modification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Risk factors,Prevention,Statins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, long term exposure to TKIs has been associated with severe adverse events such as heart failure, impairing patient survival and life quality, and limiting treatment options. Cardioprotective effect of MAPK11 has been described against cardiac ischemic disease. In addition, MAPK11 has also been reported as an important mediator in cancer development and progression. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic and dual anti-cancer and cardio-protective effect of MAPK11 inhibition during TKI treatment.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures:<\/b> For this study we used the TKI ponatinib as a paradigm of cardiac toxicity. Ponatinib has been used as a gold standard therapy for the drug resistant type of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) due to T315I-ABL1 mutation, and has been associated with high risk of cardiac toxicity. We performed <i>in<\/i><i> vitro<\/i> functional assays to evaluate the cardiotoxicity and cardiac protection using human iPSC-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and anti-cancer effect in T315I mutated KCL-22 CML cells. The cardiotoxicity was evaluated by impairment of cardiomyocytes contractile function during TKI (ponatinib) treatment, the cardiac-protection was evaluated by restoration of contractile function post-inhibition of MAPK11 with RNA silencing (siRNA) technique. The anti-cancer effect was evaluated using a cell viability and proliferation assay during inhibition of MAPK11 by siRNA and ABL1 inhibition as a positive control.<br \/><b>Summary of unpublished data:<\/b> Pretreatment with siRNA MAPK11 inhibition significantly improved the contractile function of the cardiomyocytes during treatment with ponatinib when compared to those that did not receive MAPK11 inhibition. Moreover, when compared to the positive control of siRNA ABL1 inhibition, the MAPK11 inhibition showed similar anti-cancer effect in the T315I mutated KCL-22 CML cells proliferation and survival assay.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our study suggests that the inhibition of MAPK11 is a potential druggable therapeutic target with dual action of anti-cancer effect for the mutant form of CML, as well as a substantial protective effect against the cardiac toxicity associated with the TKI ponatinib that could bring insights in the development of safer oncological drugs. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,p38 MAP kinases,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Reasons behind this disparity are not fully understood, and studies examining these disparities have been limited. One contributor may be variations in communications about CTRCD risk and risk prevention strategies between providers and patients by race and ethnicity. This study assessed racial differences in Black versus White breast cancer patients with provider communication regarding cardiotoxic treatments.<br \/>Methods: Study participants were recruited from a comprehensive cancer center. Eligibility included identifying as a Black\/African American or White woman, a diagnosis of stage I-III breast cancer, and receipt of anthracyclines and\/or trastuzumab. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with survivors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and were reconciled using Dedoose.<br \/>Results: Interviews were conducted with 16 survivors (8 Black, 8 White) with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years. Prior to starting treatment, 100% of white survivors reported that a provider discussed CTRCD risk, however only 75% black survivors reported CTRCD discussion. Although all women received information on prevention strategies including exercise and nutrition, there were differences in timing of information delivered. Black women desired to have information at the beginning of treatment, but no White women mentioned a desire to receive information earlier. A greater proportion of White women reported engaging in prevention strategies such as exercising and eating healthy during treatment. In terms of knowledge gained, 75% of White Women reported being satisfied with the information given regarding cardiotoxic risk and prevention whereas only 45% of Black women reported being satisfied.As 65% of Black women (vs. White) reported being less than satisfied with the information given, Black women were also more likely to recommend access to additional resources. For example, one Black woman suggested that &#8220;they [care team] should get a cardiologist to be a part of the team when they first go.<br \/>Conclusion &#38; Implications: Fewer Black women reported being satisfied with their medical visits regarding CTRCD risk and prevention strategies. Racial differences in assessments of these experiences highlight opportunities to develop culturally-tailored communication interventions to reduce racial disparities in CTRCD; however, future research is needed to assess interpersonal aspects of care during the receipt of cardiotoxic treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Breast cancer,Anthracycline,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, this monitoring approach does not appear cost effective in patients with HER2-positive gastrointestinal (GI) cancers given poor overall survival (OS). Here, we aim to examine the incidence of clinically significant TRCT in this target population.<br \/>Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced HER2-positive GI cancers who received trastuzumab-containing therapies (trastuzumab +\/- pertuzumab, chemotherapy +\/- immunotherapy + trastuzumab, trastuzumab deruxtecan) between 2011 and 2023. HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and\/or next generation sequencing. LVEF was estimated by serial transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE). Continuous variables were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR). Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare serial LVEF. OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.<br \/>Results: A total of 243 patients were included in this study with a median age of 64 (IQR: 55-70) years. 139 (57%) patients had esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinoma; 45 (19%) patients had gastric cancer; 37 (15%) patients had colorectal cancer; and the rest had other GI cancers. Median follow-up time was 18.6 (IQR: 9.2-36) months. Median OS from cancer diagnosis and the first dose of trastuzumab-containing therapy were 24.1 (95%CI: 20.2-30.2) and 11.7 (95%CI: 10.4-15.6) months, respectively. Patients received a median of 13 cycles of trastuzumab-containing therapy for a median duration of 4.1 (IQR: 1.4-10.1) months. The median number of TTE each patient had throughout therapy was 2 (IQR: 1-4). Median baseline LVEF was 61% (IQR: 56-65%) which was significantly higher (p&#60;0.001) than the median lowest LVEF of 58% (IQR: 53-62%) during therapy, but not different (p=0.14) from the most recent median LVEF of 60% (IQR: 56-64%) after discontinuation of trastuzumab. Among 176 patients with serial LVEF data, 16 (9%) had &#62; 10% LVEF drop; 7 (44%) of these 16 patients had LVEF recovery. None of the cardiovascular risk factors prior to trastuzumab treatment including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke were significantly associated with the development of TRCT.<br \/>Conclusion: The incidence of clinically significant LVEF drop appears low in patients with advanced GI cancers as post-treatment LVEF recovery to baseline was observed at the population level. The value of using TTE to monitor TRCT in these patients with short OS should be further assessed in the perspective of cost effectiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-03 Cardio-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,HER2,Trastuzumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Here we perform psychometric evaluation of a tool developed to report spiritual well-being in chronic illness in a cohort of 248 patients with primary brain tumors (PBT) enrolled in a natural history study (NCT02851706, PI: T. Armstrong). Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being 12 (FACIT-SP 12) as part of yearly clinical outcome assessments. Total score, Meaning\/Peace and Faith scores were calculated. Internal consistency (Cronbach&#8217;s alpha) and construct validity (principal components analysis with varimax rotation) evaluated psychometric properties of the FACIT-SP 12; one-way ANOVAs, one-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests evaluated group differences (sig. p&#60;0.05) on patient report of spirituality\/beliefs including belief in god(s)\/higher power, being religious, and prayer and in comparison to scores of previously reported studies. Participants were majority male (57%), white (79%) with high grade tumor (59%) and a median age of 48 (range: 20-82). Seven different religions were reported (majority Christianity [55%]) but also spiritual non-religious (9%), no beliefs (13%), and 6% preferring not to answer. The principal components analysis confirmed the original 2 factor solution (Meaning\/Peace and Faith) and explained 66.8% of the variance (KMO =0.87, 43% of residuals &#60; 0.05), with one item not loading cleanly on either factor (&#8220;I know that whatever happens with my illness, things will be okay&#8221;). Cronbach&#8217;s alphas were 0.90, 0.90, and 0.89, for the total, Meaning\/Peace, and Faith scales, respectively. For all three spiritual\/belief questions, patients who responded &#8220;yes&#8221; had higher total and faith scores than those who responded &#8220;no\"; but not in the Meaning\/Peace score when reporting religion (p=0.108). This cohort reported lower total scores (mean=32.5), Meaning\/Peace scores (mean=23.4, median=24.0) and Faith scores (mean=9.2, median=10.0) compared to the initial validation in other solid tumors and HIV\/AIDs (means=38.5, 25.2, 13.6, respectively) and to a smaller, less diverse PBT sample (medians: Meaning\/Peace=25.8, Faith=14.0). The FACIT-SP 12 demonstrated internal consistency and construct validity, with lower scores in comparison to populations in prior studies. More diverse belief systems than previously reported may contribute to differences among studies. Future analysis should explore the increased percentage of &#8220;prefer not to answer&#8221; respondents compared to earlier reports, associations with clinical and self-reported outcomes including symptoms and quality of life, evaluation of illness-related factors that contribute to poor spiritual well-being, and a longitudinal look at spiritual well-being.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-05 Psycho-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Statistical approach,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

This progression can be exacerbated by the burden of stress arising from HNC and IMRT. While stress has been linked to inflammation, the associations of biological aging measures including inflammatory markers and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) with stress over cancer treatment remain underexplored. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between biological aging and stress in patients with HNC receiving IMRT across four time points (i.e., pre- (T1), end of (T2), 3 months (T3), and 12 months (T4) post-IMRT).<br \/>Methods: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) across four time points along with the assessment of biological aging markers: peripheral inflammatory markers (i.e., interleukin [IL-6], IL-1&#946;, IL-10, IL-1ra, C-reactive protein [CRP], soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 [sTNFR2], and TNF-&#945;) and EAA. EAA was calculated using DNAmPhenoAge, adjusted for chronological age. Liner mixed effects models were used to examine the associations between biological aging measures and stress across time.<br \/>Results: A total of 176 patients with HNC were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 59.9&#177;10.0 years, 72.7% male, and 77.3% non-Hispanic White. Stress scores increased from T1 to T2 (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), decreased significantly at T3 (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) which were lower than the baseline scores (T1), and then gradually decreased at T4 (<i>p<\/i>=0.029). Significant associations of CRP, IL- 1ra, and TNFR-2 with stress were identified across time (all <i>p<\/i> values &#60;0.05), controlling for covariates (i.e., age, human papillomavirus status, chemotherapy, and surgery): elevated inflammatory markers were associated with higher levels of stress. In a separate model, higher stress scores were also associated with increased EAA controlling for the same covariates (<i>p<\/i>=0.015): an increment of 10 units in stress scores was associated with an age acceleration of 7.2 months across time.<br \/>Conclusions: Findings from our study suggest that biological aging measures (inflammatory markers and EAA) are associated with stress across time in patients with HNC receiving IMRT. Clinicians and researchers may use the findings to develop personalized psychosocial interventions that reduce stress so as to deaccelerate biological aging for patients with HNC during their treatment and survivorship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-05 Psycho-oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Radiation therapy,Aging,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Although it does not pose a life-threatening risk, CIA can significantly affect patient&#8217;s self-esteem. Regarding the mechanism of action, stress induced by chemotherapy treatment can lead to the shedding of hair follicles, generating varying degrees of hair loss. In recent years, scalp cooling has emerged as a beneficial preventative agent for CIA due to its ability to induce vasoconstriction in the scalp and reduce follicular metabolic rate. To assess the efficacy of scalp cooling in preventing CIA, we conducted a review of randomized control trials published on PubMed in the last 10 years. Five studies met our inclusion criteria, in which three examined hair preservation and two evaluated treatment duration efficacy. All studies investigating hair preservation with scalp cooling reported highly significant results from the cooling device when compared to a placebo (56.3% vs. 0%, 39.3% vs. 0%, and 50.5% vs. 0%, respectively). Additionally, one of these studies also assessed hair regrowth, revealing higher rates in the scalp cooling group compared to the control at 6 weeks (89% vs. 12%) and at 12 weeks (100% vs. 59%). Both studies evaluating the effectiveness of scalp cooling based on treatment duration concluded that 20 minutes of cooling was as effective as 45 and 90 minutes in preventing CIA. Collectively, these findings add to the mounting evidence endorsing scalp cooling as a powerful management strategy in averting CIA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Chemoprevention,Alopecia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Here, we explore the concordance between 2 tools and their use in reporting seizures over time among PBT patients enrolled in a natural history study (NCT02851706, PI: T. Armstrong). Patients complete the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT), which measures symptom severity (including seizure) within the last 24 hours from 0-10; and, as part of the same visit, pairs of clinicians and patients complete the Seizure Control Composite Index (RANO-SCCI), which includes the questions &#8216;Have you ever had a seizure&#8217; (RANO-SCCIQ1) and &#8216;Have you had a seizure since your last clinic visit&#8217; (RANO-SCCIQ2). Responses to each measure are reported in aggregate and by IDH status. Participants included 89 patients with gliomas who were primarily white (84%) males (62%) with a median age of 48 years (range: 27-78) and KPS &#8805; 90 (85%). Based on patient reports, 65% endorsed ever having a seizure (RANO-SCCIQ1), 17% had a recent seizure (RANO-SCCIQ2), and 12% had a seizure within the last 24 hours (MDASI-BT). For the RANO-SCCIQ1 data, patients and clinicians generally agreed except for 6 pairs (7%) where clinicians indicated a seizure but patients did not. Of the 59 who reported recent seizures (RANO-SCCIQ2), two pairs (3%) disagreed, with patients indicating a recent seizure but clinicians not endorsing a seizure had occurred. Good overall agreement (86%) was observed between the RANO-SCCIQ2 and MDASI-BT for both clinician and patient responses, with 3 and 2 paired disagreements respectively, in which seizures were indicated in the last 24 hours but not recorded as a recent seizure on the (RANO-SCCIQ2). Comparing clinician report of seizures in those with IDH-mutated (n=39) to IDH-wildtype (n=15) tumors, 85% (33\/39) versus 47% (7\/15) reported ever having a seizure and 7 of 33 (21%) with IDH-mutant and 1 of 7 (14%) with IDH-wild type (IDH-WT) tumors respectively reported a seizure since the last visit. Disparities in recognition of seizures between patient and clinician highlights a need for patient education to increase awareness of events and recognition of ongoing risk. Although those with IDH-mutated tumors are at higher risk of having seizures, nearly half of those with IDH-WT reported ever having seizures, underscoring the need for all patients to be educated on recognizing and assessing seizure symptoms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Glioma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

In other cancers, physical function impacts mood, quality of life, and even mortality. This exploratory study aims to identify factors associated with activity-related functional interference in a cross-sectional cohort of 584 primary brain tumor patients enrolled in a natural history study (NCT03251989, PI: T.S. Armstrong).<br \/>Methods: Sociodemographic (age, race, ethnicity, income, education, employment, body mass index [BMI]) and disease-related clinical data were collected at study entry. Activity-related interference (work, walking, and general activity) and health status were reported via the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor. Activity-related interference means &#8805; 2 were categorized as moderate\/severe. Logistic regression assessed univariate associations with moderate\/severe interference, with sig. &#60;0.05.<br \/>Results: This sample had a median age of 49 years (range 18-85), and was mostly male (57%), with a high-grade tumor (grade 3\/4) (74%), glioblastoma (39%), on active treatment (21%) and prior tumor recurrence (49%). Risk factors for moderate\/severe activity-related interference included: &#8805; 2 surgeries (OR = 1.55, 95% CI [1.11, 2.18], <i>P<\/i> = 0.011), &#8805; 2 radiation treatments (OR = 2.87, 95% CI [1.59, 5.17], <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001), currently on active treatment (OR = 1.47, 95% CI [0.97, 2.22], <i>P<\/i> = 0.066), disease progression (OR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.24, 2.84], <i>P<\/i> = 0.003), prior recurrence (OR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.13, 2.19], <i>P<\/i> = 0.007), and poor KPS (OR = 3.61, 95% CI [2.55, 5.12], <i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001), but not tumor grade (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.72, 1.54], <i>P<\/i> = 0.790). Sociodemographic risk factors for moderate\/severe activity-related interference included: less than a high school education (OR = 2.03, 95% CI [1.18, 3.51], <i>P<\/i> = 0.011), on disability (OR = 3.20, 95% CI [1.79, 5.71], <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.001), or unemployed (OR = 3.81, 95% CI [2.34, 6.19], <i>P<\/i> &#60;<br \/>0.001), an annual income less than $49,999 (OR = 2.62, 95% CI [1.28, 5.35], <i>P<\/i> = 0.008), or childhood in a rural area (OR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.24, 2.84], <i>P<\/i> = 0.003), but not BMI, smoking status, or past physical activity in the 10 years prior to report.<br \/>Conclusion:<i> <\/i>As expected, activity-related interference is associated with disease and treatment associated clinical characteristics, with significant risk derived from sociodemographic factors such as education, childhood environment, employment, and household income. Future studies should further explore these associations longitudinally to identify individuals at the highest risk of activity-related interference due to their brain tumor as well as interventions designed for those who may be socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL12-06 Supportive care, palliation, and pain management,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Outcome,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Brain tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.
