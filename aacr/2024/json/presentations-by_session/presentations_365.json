[{"Abstract":"The aberrant activation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway causes the progression of therapy-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we aimed to unravel the biological significance of Gli-family proteins and their functional involvement of Gsk3&#946;-mediated regulatory mechanism(s) in CRPC. We have discovered a novel function of the truncated form of Gli (t-Gli3) in advancing CRPC. This was accomplished through <i>in silico<\/i> analysis, <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments, PCa patient clinical data, and <i>in vivo<\/i> PCa MYC overexpression mouse models. Our investigation into the Gli3 regulation, typically influenced by receptor-mediated ciliary localization, uncovered a Smo-independent mechanism. Surprisingly, despite the lack of a transactivation domain in t-Gli3, we found a specific requirement for an androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) for its action, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Mechanistically, Gsk3&#946; activation leads to the t-Gli3 generation, and inhibition of Gsk3&#946; supported the accumulation of full-length Gli3 through a non-canonical mechanism. Knockdown of Gsk3&#946; (Gsk3&#946; KD) reduces CRPC cell proliferation in <i>2-D<\/i> and <i>3-D <\/i>culture models, inhibiting key proliferative signaling pathways and inducing apoptosis via mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings were supported using an orthotropic PCa mouse model. RNA-seq analysis also showed upregulated phenotype enrichment of the apoptosis, P53, and glycolysis pathway genes in 22Rv1Gsk3&#946; KD cells. Compared to scramble, a lower OCR\/mitochondrial respiratory rate is evident in 22Rv1Gsk3&#946; KD cells. Next, our exploration of potential therapies for PCa showed that individually targeting Smo or Gli1 is insufficient to inhibit cell viability. Interestingly, we uncovered that solely targeting Gli3 was sufficient to inhibit the growth of CRPC cells. In conclusion, our study provides the significance of Gli-family proteins and novel insights into the interplay of Gsk3&#946;, t-Gli3, and AR, offering therapeutic implications in CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hedgehog,Apoptosis,Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The glycosylation-regulating metabolic enzyme uridine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) is required in oncogene-transformed cancer cells, but not in normal cells. UGP2 heavily regulates glycosylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at asparagine 361 (N361), a key site near the ligand binding domain. EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that promotes cell proliferation via growth cascades. Mutations and amplifications in EGFR account for a significant fraction of non-small cell lung carcinomas and breast adenocarcinoma, with L858R being the most common oncogenic hotspot. Other glycosylation sites on EGFR have been implicated in ligand binding, dimerization, and phosphorylation of downstream targets. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that N361 may be important for dimerization or ligand binding. However, the functional relevance of how glycosylation of EGFR at N361 impacts EGFR protein and cellular behaviors remains unclear. To determine the functional relevance of glycosylation at N361, we created glycosylation-defective EGFR N361A mutant, with or without an additional oncogenic EGFR L858R mutant. We expressed these constructs in MCF10A and 293T cells, which do not have pre-existing activation of this pathway. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed that the mutants were each well expressed at the cell membrane. Proximity ligation assays measuring dimerization of EGFR in cells showed that EGFR N361A greatly increased dimerization relative to wildtype controls. Loss of glycosylation of EGFR N361 impacted cell viability when grown in dose courses of its high affinity ligand EGF or lower affinity ligand amphiregulin. Furthermore, EGFR N361A desensitized cells expressing the oncogenic EGFR L858R to inhibitors targeting the extracellular domain, possibly because the mutation alters the antibody binding interface. N361A sensitized EGFR L858R to inhibitors targeting the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR. These findings help us understand the intricate relationship between EGFR and N-glycosylation, reinforcing the critical functional relevance of post-translational modifications on oncogenes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Glycosylation,Ligand binding,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Next Generation Sequencing of BLCA has revealed an enrichment of alterations in genes classified as chromatin modifiers compared to other solid tumors. Among these is <i>EP300<\/i>, the gene encoding the p300 histone acetyltransferase, which is mutated in ~12% of BLCA with the majority putative loss of function frameshift and nonsense mutations. To investigate the biological role of <i>EP300<\/i> loss-of-function in BLCA pathogenesis, we generated isogenic <i>EP300<\/i> null RT112 bladder cancer cells using a 2-step CRISPR knockout (KO) and knockin strategy. <i>EP300<\/i> KO cells demonstrated increased proliferation, anchorage independent cell growth, tumor formation in mice, and enhanced invasive potential. To investigate the mechanism(s) whereby <i>EP300<\/i> loss-of-function enhances oncogenicity, we performed an unbiased Tandem Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT MS) screen to identify pathways dysregulated in <i>EP300 <\/i>KO versus parental cells. <i>EP300<\/i> loss-of-function was found to induce IL-6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling via upregulated expression of IL-1&#945;, a canonical pro-inflammatory cytokine. Knock down of <i>IL1A<\/i> gene expression was sufficient to downregulate STAT3 activation in <i>EP300<\/i> KO cells, whereas ectopic stimulation using IL-1&#945; increased STAT3 activation in parental RT112 cells, suggesting that IL-1&#945; was the predominant upstream activator of JAK\/STAT3 signaling in our model. Pharmacological inhibition of downstream targets of IL-1&#945; signaling such as IRAK1\/4 were also able to inhibit STAT3 signaling in <i>EP300<\/i> KO cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Further investigations indicated that activated IL-1&#945; signaling not only drove transcriptional upregulation of IL-6 but also the production of soluble IL-6R, activating IL-6 trans signaling. Finally, to elucidate how IL-1&#945; upregulation is triggered by <i>EP300<\/i> loss-of-function, we performed immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, which revealed that IL-1&#945; binds directly to p300. Additionally, ectopic p300 expression in <i>EP300<\/i> KO clones dramatically reduced IL-1&#945; protein expression, indicating that p300 acts as a negative regulator of IL-1&#945; in a bladder cancer context. In summary, <i>EP300<\/i> loss-of-function relieves p300&#8217;s transcriptional and\/or physical-tethering inhibition on IL-1&#945; signaling, subsequently activating the IL-6\/JAK\/STAT3 pathway to drive oncogenesis in BLCA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,STAT3 activation,Interleukin-1,Interleukin-6,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway was considered a permissive signal for the development of CCA. To explore how the PI3K\/AKT signal contributes to CCA development, we deleted <i>Pten<\/i>, the lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K\/AKT signal in the liver. The Lv-PTEN (<i>Pten<\/i><i>loxP\/loxP<\/i>; Alb-Cre<sup>+<\/sup>) mice developed a mixed HCC and CCA tumor phenotype with all mice developing CCA by 12-month age. Treatment of Lv-PTEN mice with DDC at 3 months to obstruct the bile duct leads to an earlier CCA oncogenesis. Deletion of <i>Akt2<\/i> in the Lv-PTEN mice (Lv-DM, <i>Akt2<sup>loxP\/loxP<\/sup><\/i>; <i>Pten<\/i><i>loxP\/loxP<\/i>; Alb-Cre<sup>+<\/sup>) significantly attenuates tumor development. Compared with the Lv-PTEN mice, loss of AKT2 in Lv-DM mice robustly and significantly reduced the expression of SOX9, a cholangiocyte gene. This data suggests that the AKT signal may permit a cholangiocyte fate by inducing SOX9 expression. Supporting the role of PTEN\/AKT in permitting a cholangiocyte fate, SOX9 expression is also induced in the livers of mice where <i>Pten<\/i> deletion is targeted to the hepatocytes via injection of AAV8-TGB-Cre (Hp-PTEN, <i>Pten<\/i><i>loxP\/loxP<\/i>; <i>R26R<\/i><i>YFP<\/i>;<i> <\/i>AAV8-TBG-Cre). Similar to the Lv-PTEN mice, treatment with DDC induced early onset of CCA development in the Hp-PTEN mice. We next explore Notch signal for its crosstalk with PTEN loss that permits CCA development. Notch signal is robustly induced in the tumors of the Lv-PTEN mice and induced with DDC treatment in both Lv-PTEN and Hp-PTEN livers. We showed that exposure to Jag1 ligand-coated extracellular matrix or expression of NICD also induced the expression of SOX9 while DAPT time-dependently attenuated the expression of SOX9. In the Hp-Pten mice treated with DDC, inhibiting the Notch pathway with DAPT attenuated ductal reaction and led to downregulation of SOX9 in the Lv-PTEN livers, suggesting a positive regulatory role of Notch on SOX9. These data support that Notch activation regulates SOX9 and collaborates with PTEN loss to drive cholangiocyte fate and CCA development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Cell fate,Notch,PTEN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis is associated with various human diseases, including ribosomopathies and cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how ribosome biogenesis is regulated during normal cell homeostasis and how it is deregulated in human diseases. Here, we report that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP36 acts as a novel SUMO ligase to promote nucleolar protein SUMOylation. Using affinity purification, we found that USP36 associates with a large number of nucleolar and ribosome biogenesis-related proteins, including all 10 components of the nucleolar RNA exosome complex, EXOSC1 to EXOSC10, as well as the Las1L-Nol9 endonuclease-kinase complex. We showed that USP36 interacts with the RNA exosome through EXOSC10 and SUMOylates ECOSC10 at Lys 583. Mutating K583 impaired the binding of EXOSC10 to pre-rRNAs and the K583R mutant failed to rescue the defects in rRNA processing and cell growth inhibition caused by knockdown of endogenous EXOSC10. Likewise, USP36 interacts with the Las1L-Nol9 complex and promotes Las1L SUMOylation at K565. In addition, USP36 deubiquitinates Las1L and Nol9 and regulates their protein stability. Mutating K565 does not affect the levels of Las1L and the formation of the Las1L-Nol9 endonuclease-kinase complex. However, induced expression of a K565R mutant of Las1L failed to rescue the defects in rRNA processing and cell growth inhibition caused by knockdown of endogenous Las1L. Together, these results suggest that USP36 plays an important role in regulating ribosome biogenesis by post-translationally regulating the function of RNA exosome and Las1L-Nol9 complexes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-08 Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sumoylation,Ubiquitination,Cell growth,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a pivotal role in PC development and is a primary target for intervention in patients with advanced disease. Aberrant activation of AR is also suggested to play a significant role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite advancements in anti-androgen therapies with new targeting agents, such as enzalutamide, metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) remains incurable. CYP3A5, a monooxygenase expressed in the prostate, liver and intestine, is involved in drug metabolism and steroid biosynthesis. We earlier reported that intratumoral CYP3A5 activated AR signaling by facilitating its nuclear translocation of AR. More notably, we found a higher CYP3A5 expression in AAs, attributed to the *1 CYP3A5 variant, as compared to non-Hispanic White Americans (NHWA) possessing the *3 variant. Analysis of RNA-seq data using patient tumor samples revealed that elevated CYP3A5 in AA PC patients was associated with Wnt-&#946; catenin signaling activation via TCF4 overexpression. Here, we investigated the role of CYP3A5 in enzalutamide resistance and Wnt signaling by generating enzalutamide-resistant PC cell lines of NHWA (low CYP3A5-LNCaP) and AA-origin (high CYP3A5-MDAPCa2b). RT-qPCR assay was used to examine the changes in AR and CYP3A5 expression between the parental and the enzalutamide-resistant cell lines. The data show heightened CYP3A5 expression in enzalutamide-resistant cells of AA origin (MDAPCa2b\/EnzR) but not of NHWA origin (LNCaP\/EnzR). Interestingly, MDAPCa2b\/EnzR exhibited no change in AR levels whereas it was increased in LNCaP\/EnzR cells relative to parental lines. A loss of function assay was performed for siRNA-mediated silencing of CYP3A5 to study its effect on Wnt signaling. RNA sequencing results show that CYP3A5 inhibition in MDAPCa2b downregulated Wnt pathway genes (Wnt5A, Wnt10B, Wnt11, Fzd2, and Dvl3). These observations align with our previous RNA seq results using patient samples where we observed upregulated Wnt-&#946; catenin signaling in high CYP3A5 expressing patient tumor samples. Western analysis post-CYP3A5 inhibition in LNCaP and MDAPCa2b cells revealed upregulated Axin and downregulated LRP6 and Dvl-3, signifying CYP3A5's regulation of the canonical Wnt-&#946; catenin pathway. Additionally, MDAPCa2b saw downregulated Wnt 5A and Wnt 10B, known to influence the Wnt non-canonical pathway.

An analysis by the team identified a novel mutation present in all ChGs: <i>PRKCA<\/i> p.D463H. This mutation involves a D463H substitution at the kinase domain of the Protein kinase C alpha (PKC&#945;), it is not found in any other cancer, and represents the hallmark of ChG. The aim of the project is to identify novel and biologically relevant PKC&#945;<sub>D463H<\/sub> signaling pathways, which will demonstrate the involvement and the role of this mutated kinase in cellular functions implicated in the development of ChGs. The D463H mutation affects a critical residue of the kinase domain of PKC&#945;, suggesting that such a change modifies substrate affinity. Following the purification of PKC&#945;<sub>D463H<\/sub>, we have shown its inactivation via <i>in vitro<\/i> kinase assays and peptide array. <i>In cellulo<\/i> fret-based activity reporter assays have shown that PKC&#945;<sub>D463H<\/sub> has a dominant negative effect over PKC&#945;<sub>WT<\/sub><i>.<\/i> Through co-immunoprecipitation we have shown that the mutant protein can bind the WT form and also colocalizes in the cell. Our results also show that the mutation affects the tertiary structure of the protein, resulting in a more open, unstable protein compared to the WT. Phosphoproteomic analysis of HEK cells overexpressing PKC&#9082;<sub>D463H<\/sub> show a decrease of phosphorylation specifically on proteins involved with cell-cell adhesion, including functionally relevant phosphosites. This is in line with our Co-IP mass spectrometry data which shows a decrease in interaction of PKC&#9082;<sub>D463H<\/sub> with proteins involved in cell junctions. The cell of origin, tanycytes, are highly specialized cells that contain important cell-cell junctions and therefore their perturbation could be a potential route of tumorigenesis. By understanding these changes integrated with our snRNAseq and bulk RNAseq of ChGs, and exploration in cellular models, we hope to elucidate the mechanism by which the mutation leads to the development of Chordoid Glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C,Brain tumors,Phosphorylation,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Moreover, no targets for effective chemotherapeutic intervention (other than immune checkpoint inhibitors) have been identified for these tumors. Thus, our goal is to identify candidate targets for therapeutic intervention in <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanomas. ERBB4 (HER4) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR\/ERBB1\/HER1), ERBB2 (Neu\/HER2), and ERBB3 (HER3). We have previously demonstrated that <i>ERBB4 <\/i>is both sufficient and necessary for the proliferation of <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell lines. However, the constitutively homodimerized <i>ERBB4<\/i> Q646C mutant inhibits the proliferation of <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell lines. We have also previously demonstrated that ERBB4-EGFR and ERBB4-ERBB2 heterodimers stimulate proliferation and other oncogenic phenotypes in a variety of tumor model systems. Hence, here we test the hypothesis that ERBB4-EGFR or ERBB4-ERBB2 heterodimers drive <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanomas.<br \/>Experimental Approach: We are testing whether wild-type <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>ERBB2<\/i> alleles stimulate the proliferation of four different human <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell lines. We are testing whether the dominant-negative <i>EGFR<\/i> (K721A) or <i>ERBB2<\/i> (K753A) mutant alleles inhibit the proliferation of these cell lines. Likewise, we are testing whether <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>ERBB2<\/i> shRNAs inhibit the proliferation of these cell lines. Finally, we are testing whether <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>ERBB2<\/i> enables <i>ERBB4<\/i> mutant alleles found in <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma samples to drive greater levels of proliferation in 32D cells than wild-type <i>ERBB4<\/i>.<br \/>Unpublished Results: Wild-type <i>ERBB2<\/i> causes a significant increase in the proliferation of the MEL-JUSO and IPC-298 <i>BRAF <\/i>WT female melanoma cell lines. The <i>ERBB2<\/i> dominant-negative allele causes a significant decrease in the proliferation of these cell lines. Finally, preliminary data suggest that the <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>ERBB2<\/i> dominant-negative alleles inhibit the proliferation of the MeWo <i>BRAF<\/i> WT male melanoma cell line.<br \/>Preliminary Conclusions: Our data suggest that ERBB2-ERBB4 heterodimers drive two female <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell lines, whereas ERBB2-ERBB4 and EGFR-ERBB4 heterodimers drive a male <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanoma cell line. Thus, we predict that FDA-approved ERBB2 inhibitors (and in some cases, EGFR inhibitors) may be effective in <i>ERBB4<\/i>-dependent, <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanomas. Moreover, ERBB4 heterodimerization with ERBB2 or EGFR may account for the gender disparities observed in <i>BRAF<\/i> WT melanomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,ErbB receptors,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Although substantial evidence has been attained in the involvement of EMT and its regulatory mechanisms in cancer, few effective EMT-targeted therapies have been available in the clinic thus far. It is urgent to develop new therapeutic strategies for improving patient outcomes. We have identified RAB6A as a master regulator of EMT-driven secretory trafficking, which coordinates cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression in LUAD. We found that RAB6A expression was associated with a poor prognosis in LUAD patients and that RAB6A inhibition in our LUAD models reversed resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition with PD-L1 blockade, an emerging clinical problem. Thus, RAB6A machinery is a therapeutic target of interest in EMT-driven cancers. Screening approaches to identify selective RAB inhibitors are in their infancy, a challenge that can be overcome only by obtaining insights into the regulation of RAB6A. RAB6A is a small GTPase whose activity is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like RIC1 and RGP1, and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) like RABGAP1, as well as other effector proteins. While these GEFs, GAPs, and effectors are all known regulators of RAB6A function and are frequently amplified in different cancer types, their specific functions in cancer progression are still unknown. To establish the causal relationship between these proteins and EMT-driven LUAD progression, we utilize human and murine LUAD cell lines that have been characterized with respect to EMT status. Our findings here show that the intervention of RAB6A activity via depletion of these regulators impairs the recruitment of RAB6A to the Golgi. We demonstrate that knocking down the GEFs, RIC1 and RGP1, significantly decreases invasion while having negligible effects on the migrative and proliferative abilities of these cells. RABGAP1 depletion, on the other hand, reduces cell proliferation but has no effects on the migration and invasion of the cells. Consistent with these results, inactivation of RAB6A abolishes the EMT-dependent pro-metastatic secretion. Mechanistically, the EMT activator, ZEB1, upregulates RGP1 via silencing miR-148a that targets this GEF to activate RAB6A. These findings elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying the EMT-driven secretory program, providing a foundation for therapeutic intervention to prevent the progression of LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Lung adenocarcinoma,Secretory trafficking,Rab GTPase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Despite the exponential increase in identifications, only a small number have been extensively characterized functionally. In this study, we are focused on receptor tyrosine kinase OFs (RTK-OFs) prevalent in aggressive cancers. Our primary objective is to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of 182 in-frame RTK-OFs identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas.<br \/>An automated high-throughput PCR technique will be used to clone individual gene fusions using the sequences obtained from RNA-Seq data sourced from the TCGA dataset. These clones will be used to establish an RTK-OF-expressing isogenic cell line library. Multiple Approaches Combined (MAC)-tag workflow combining Affinity Purification (AP) and proximity biotin-dependent (BioID) purification within a single construct will be used. Subsequent high-throughput EvoSep One Liquid Chromatography coupled to ultra-fast TimsTOF Pro 2 Mass Spectrometry sample processing enables sensitive and robust analysis. These methods enable the capture of stable protein complexes and transient interactors associated with RTK-OFs. In our proof of concept study, we have identified four in-frame variants of FGFR3::TACC3 oncogenic fusions.FGFR3, part of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) RTK family, activates cellular proliferation and growth through FGF binding and receptor dimerization. In FGFR3-TACC3 OFs, diverse isoforms are observed, with prevalent rearrangements linking FGFR3 exon 17 to various TACC3 exons. TACC3 is vital for mitotic microtubule organization and stabilizes kinetochore fibers and the mitotic spindle through its conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain (TACC domain). TACC3 contributes to the fusion with varying sizes of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain which all constitutively activate the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase. In our studies, we show that FGFR3::TACC3 variants have a different localization to their wild-type counterparts. While FGFR3 and TACC3 are found in the cytoplasm all the OF variants strongly localize around the nucleus. Our identified high-confidence interactors represent a comprehensive FGFR3::TACC3 interaction network and reveal central pathways and key interactors related to microtubule assembly and possible deregulation of the cell cycle.<br \/>The resultant data from these advanced technologies enable the construction of comprehensive interaction networks, shedding light on critical signaling pathways and subnetworks relevant to RTK-OFs. Further in-depth analysis of 182 RTK-OFs may uncover actionable pathways and druggable interactors within these networks. Our multi-faceted research strategy holds significant promise for advancing targeted drug discovery, ultimately contributing to improved cancer treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,Gene fusion,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Nutrients in the PDAC microenvironment are commonly depleted, with the vital amino acid glutamine among the most deficient metabolites. To circumvent this deprivation, PDAC cells initiate KRAS dependent macropinocytosis, an actin-driven nutrient scavenging pathway. Macropinosomes fuse with lysosomes in a process mediated by the kinase PIKfyve. It allows cells to replenish the nutrients required for survival. As glutamine is essential for PDAC cell survival, therapeutic inhibition of macropinocytosis represents a novel strategy to suppress nutrient acquisition and drive cell death.<br \/>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric Serine\/Threonine phosphatase known to inhibit downstream targets of the KRAS signaling cascade and is implicated in macropinocytosis regulation. PP2A holoenzyme comprises of A, B and C subunits, where the regulatory B subunit provides substrate specificity to the enzyme. Using high molecular weight TMR-Dextran, we demonstrate that overexpression of PP2A-B56&#945; subunit or pharmacological activation by DT061 promotes macropinosome accumulation in cells. Macropinosome accumulation was caused by the inability of macropinosomes to fuse with lysosomes, leading to cell death. The cell death caused by DT061 was significantly rescued when treated with a Rac family inhibitor. To understand if B56&#945; regulates the process of macropinosome-lysosome fusion, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and established the interaction of B56&#945; with PIKfyve. Further, pharmacological PIKfyve inhibition with Apilimod phenocopies DT061 induced vesicle accumulation in cells, suggesting that B56&#945; likely inhibits PIKfyve to promote aberrant macropinocytosis.<br \/>Prevention of lysosomal fusion will impact nutrient uptake through macropinocytosis. Our metabolomics study confirmed the deprivation of glutamine with activation of PP2A-B56&#945;. This regulation can be therapeutically leveraged to metabolically stress cells with a combination of DT061 and glutamine transport inhibitor V-9302. Combination drug treatment was found to be synergistic in a panel of PDAC cells. Together, these findings indicate that activation of PP2A in late stage PDAC promotes aberrant macropinocytosis by preventing lysosomal fusion through PIKfyve regulation and establishes a novel role of PP2A-B56&#945; in nutrient scavenging and cell death. These pathways can be further exploited to identify potential combination therapeutics in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Targeted therapy,Cell death,Phosphorylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

ALPPL2 is currently being investigated as a novel therapeutic target due to its cancer-specific expression. However, our knowledge of ALPPL2 biological function in cancer is limited. Here we describe an interaction between ALPPL2 and MAPK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Materials and Methods: ALPPL2 mRNA expression in a panel of 27 pancreatic cell lines was determined by RNAseq. Protein expression and phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. ALPPL2 or ALPP were overexpressed in pancreas cell lines through a Lentiviral packaging system. MEK inhibitor (trametinib) activity was assessed in the same panel of cell lines using a 6-day cell proliferation assay on a Synentec Cellavista imaging system. MEK inhibitor resistant cell lines were developed by culturing cells in increasing concentrations of MEK162.<br \/>Results: We hypothesized that pancreatic cancer cells with high ALPPL2 expression may be less sensitive to MEK inhibition. Our study from a panel of 27 pancreatic cancer cell lines showed that there was no correlation between ALPPL2 expression and response to trametinib. Western blot showed that the level of phospho-ERK was reduced in PANC1 and HPAC cells at 6 hours after trametinib treatment. Signaling rebounded at 24 and 48 hours, though it remained below baseline. Surprisingly, ALPPL2 expression increased at 24 and 48 hours after trametinib treatment, however, the mRNA of ALPPL2 and ALPP was down-regulated in three pancreatic cancer cell lines conditioned to be MEK inhibitor resistant. To understand the role of ALPPL2 in the MAPK signaling pathway in response to MEK inhibition, ALPPL2 and ALPP were overexpressed in 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines: YAPC and PSN-1 whose ALPPL2 and ALPP were undetected by Western blot prior to transfection. Overexpression of ALPPL2 or ALPP in YAPC cells resulted in more ERK phosphorylation with no change in total ERK, it also resulted in increased total and phospho-S6, and decreased phospho-STAT3 with no change in total STAT3. The amount of total and phospho-ERK were not changed in PSN-1 with overexpression of ALPPL2 or ALPP, however, it did result in increased total and phospho-S6, decreased phospho-STAT3. Interestingly, the expression of ALPPL2 and ALPP in YAPC cells with ALPPL2 or ALPP overexpression was increased at 48 hours after trametinib treatment.<br \/>Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that ALPPL2 interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. The activated MAPK signaling pathway appears to control ALPPL2 expression. The MAPK signaling pathway may regulate ALPPL2 expression through transcription and protein metabolism. We have also shown that ALPPL2 expression can activate MAPK signaling pathway. Our findings that ALPPL2 expression can be increased after trametinib treatment provide further rationale for targeting ALPPL2 in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell signaling,MEK inhibitor,Kinases,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.

Identification of biomarkers predicting high risk of recurrence and discovery of novel targets for therapy are urgently needed<sup>1<\/sup>. The cell surface receptor PTK7 is a poorly described evolutionary conserved member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily that was first identified in human colon carcinoma and melanoma<sup>2-3<\/sup>. Accumulated data highlighted the implication of PTK7 in diverse cancer-related signaling pathways<sup>4-6 <\/sup>and, despite the lack of kinase activity, anti-PTK7 inhibitors are currently in development at preclinical and clinical stages<sup>7-9<\/sup>. The dual aim of this project is to increase the basic knowledge about PTK7 and to evaluate its role in CRC in order to propose in the future novel therapeutics directed against PTK7. With the aim to discover novel PTK7 associated pathways, we used a proximity biotinylation strategy coupled to mass spectrometry in CRC cells. Among the partners identified, we found that the pseudokinase PTK7 interacts with the active receptor tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 (EPHA2). Similarly to PTK7, EPHA2 expression correlates with poor prognosis in CRC<sup>10<\/sup>. In this work, we also demonstrate that PTK7 acts as a negative regulator of EPHA2 activation through the promotion of distinct oligomeric protein complexes and the modulation of EPHA2 phosphorylation. We also shed in light on the role of PTK7 in EPHA2 K63-linked ubiquitination and its subsequent endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation.<br \/>References<b> <\/b>1 Punt CJ <i>et al<\/i>, <i>Nat.

Recently, autocrine IL-6 has been reported to promote cancer development and progression in gastrointestinal cancer. However, it is still unknown how IL-6 level is regulated in gastrointestinal cancer cells. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are known to be one of the regulatory mechanisms of cytokine production, including IL-6, especially in immune cells. AT rich interaction domain 5a (Arid5a), one of the RBPs, has been reported to bind to <i>IL6<\/i> 3&#8217;UTR and regulates its stability and expression. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the role of Arid5a in gastrointestinal cancer, especially gastric and colon cancer.<br \/>Methods: Human gastric and colon cancer cell lines were used in this study. Arid5a knocked-down gastric and colon cancer cells were generated with lentiviral transduction of shRNAs targeting Arid5a and their phenotypes were investigated by several assays including MTT, apoptosis and sphere formation assays. Bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed using Arid5a knocked-down gastric and colon cancer cells.<br \/>Results: In both human gastric and colon cancer cell lines, Arid5a knockdown suppressed cancer cell proliferation and spheroid formation, and increased apoptosis. Unexpectedly, IL6 mRNA expression was not correlated with Arid5a expression level. We found that Arid5a knockdown suppresses the activation of YAP and STAT3 by western blot analysis. We identified several new Arid5a target genes by bulk RNA-seq analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: Arid5a plays an important role in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and stemness in human gastric and colon cancer cells, perhaps independently of IL-6. Arid5a regulates YAP and STAT3 pathways by unknown mechanisms. We are now investigating how Arid5a regulates YAP and STAT3 pathways by focusing new Arid5a target genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,YAP\/TAZ,STAT3,Interleukin-6,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

TXNIP has recently emerged as a potent tumor suppressor in various cancer models. In previous studies, we found TXNIP was activated by UNC0642, an inhibitor of histone methyltransferase, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. TXNIP activation was coupled with significant suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth. In contrast, TXNIP knockdown increased MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and in tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. TXNIP-reconstitution in TXNIP-deficient HCC1954 cells reduced cell proliferation and migration coupled with increased reactive oxygen species production. TXNIP-reconstitution also significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential and glycolysis in HCC1954 cells. To understand the mechanisms underlying TXNIP&#8217;s antitumor activity, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses to uncover TXNIP-interacting proteins. We identified calpastatin (CAST) as a novel TXNIP-interacting protein in breast cancer cells. CAST is an endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a family of calcium-activated cysteine proteases. Intriguingly, CAST association with TXNIP was readily detectable in TXNIP-low, but not in TXNIP-high breast cancer cells. The disassociation of CAST from TXNIP in TXNIP-high cells might allow CAST to inhibit calpain activity to augment TXNIP&#8217;s antitumor function. Through RNAseq analysis, we identified a positive correlation between TXNIP expression and IL-24 activation in various breast cancer cells, which were also confirmed by western blotting. IL-24 has emerged as an important cancer therapy target because of its role in promoting cancer-specific apoptosis. Our data also demonstrated that TXNIP upregulated the level of IL-24 and downregulated STAT-3. Moreover, TXNIP exerts multifaceted effects on BC development through the IL24-STAT3 signaling axis, deepening our understanding of its complex role in the disease. Taken together, these studies identified novel TNXIP-dependent pathways and their potential new mechanisms in breast cancer pathogenesis with significant clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Reactive oxygen species,STAT3 activation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

To develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for lung cancer, there are emerging needs for molecular biological research on the occurrence and progression. Among the targets, CIP2A has been studied for promoting various cancer types, but detailed underlying mechanisms are needed to be further investigated. In this study, it was verified that CIP2A is overexpressed in lung cancer tissues, particularly amongst those with a smoking history, compared to adjacent normal tissues. CIP2A knockdown in lung cancer cells efficiently reduced cell proliferation and migration capacity. Through the mass spectrometry analysis on A549 cells overexpressing CIP2A, RING1 was identified as a candidate for E3 ligase of CIP2A. The interaction of the two proteins and ubiquitin chain regulation by RING1 was verified by immunoprecipitation. RING1 knockdown enhanced proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells, and these effects result from the upregulation of CIP2A and its downstream molecules, c-Myc and cyclin B1. To further study a trigger for RING1 expression changes in lung tumorigenesis, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was applied for the following experiments. CSE treatment depleted RING1 mRNA, including protein expression. Decreased RING1 level led to upregulation of CIP2A and c-MYC. Collectively, these results reveal novel roles of the RING1 and CIP2A in lung cancer progression caused by smoking and propose a potential biomarker candidate for the therapeutic and diagnostic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-08 Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Ubiquitination,Smoking,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.-h.

The success of early treatments has resulted in a 98% 5-year survival rate for early-stage PC. However, resistance to androgen ablation can lead to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with a significant drop in the survival rate to ~30%. The metastatic cascade involves changes in adhesive, metabolic and signaling properties of PC cells, allowing them to survive, proliferate and thrive in their new microenvironment. Kindlin-2 (K2), a cytoskeletal adapter protein, is highly expressed in cancer, including PC cells and tumors, contributing to their tumorigenic properties. The present study focuses on three K2 functions relevant to PC metastasis: 1)Reduction in K2 levels, achieved through CRISPR\/Cas9, profoundly affected the tumorigenic properties of PC cell lines LNCaP (androgen dependent), DU145, and PC3 (both androgen independent), influencing colony formation, invasion, and adhesion to integrin ligands. While reduction in K2 was observed, K1 and K3 levels in these cell lines was not altered by K2KO. 2)The E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, known for its role in Parkinson&#8217;s disease, has emerged as a tumor suppressor inhibiting various cancer hallmarks. Our recently published studies showed that Parkin induces ubiquitination of specific lysines in K2, leading to the hypothesis that Parkin acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting K2 for degradation. Stable over-expression of Parkin inhibited adhesion to fibrinogen (Fg), while loss of function Parkin mutants failed to do so, supporting a role of Parkin in K2 turnover and its impact on mitochondrial dynamics. We are currently investigating the effect of K2-lysines mutants as well as loss of function Parkin mutants on the progression and metastasis of PC tumors in vivo.3)K2's established function is the regulation of integrin activation, affecting adhesion receptors' transition from low to high affinity\/avidity states. The K2-integrin axis is pivotal for understanding oncogenic responses, and its role in the prostate microenvironment in PC progression and metastasis is under exploration using our newly established K2-floxed mouse. The K2-floxed mice are currently being crossed with mice harboring prostate-epithelial specific cre under control of the probasin (Pbsn) promoter. These animal studies will shed light on K2's contribution to PC development and progression in vivo, providing insights into its role in the prostate microenvironment. To sum up, this study emphasizes the crucial role of K2 in the tumorigenic properties of PC cells and tumors. By incorporating CRISPR\/Cas9 and innovative mouse models, the study seeks to shed the lights on the mechanisms through which K2 contributes to PC development and progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Adhesion,Integrins,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

A well-established pathway whereby K2 regulates TNBC oncogenic behavior is through the regulation of integrin inside-out signaling by directly binding to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin &#946; subunit<b><i>.<\/i><\/b> Interestingly, our recent studies found K2 to play a major role in activating the TGF-&#946;-mediated regulation of the CSF1\/EGF signaling through macrophage polarization to the M2 tumorigenic state and their increased tumor infiltration, as well as inhibiting tumor infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes, therefore, driving tumor immune evasion. Here we present novel findings involving K2 in the stabilization of the &#946;1-Integrin:T&#946;RI complexes by establishing a physical bridge that links &#946;1-Integrin to T&#946;RI. Loss of K2 results in the degradation of this protein complex and therefore, the inhibition of the oncogenic pathways downstream of these two major regulators of several hallmarks of cancer.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> We applied a combination of in vitro assays; CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing, cell migration, 3D tumor-sphere, solid binding, co-immunoprecipitation, cell adhesion and spreading, as well as western blot and flow cytometry analyses with MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 TNBC cell lines. We also used preclinical in vivo mouse models of TNBC tumor progression and metastasis to support or investigations.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that the K2\/&#946;1-Integrin direct interaction is mediated through the C-terminal F3 domain of K2, while the K2\/T&#946;RI direct interaction is mediated through the F2 domain of K2. Disruption of this bridge, via CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knockout of K2, leads to &#946;1-Integrin and T&#946;RI degradation, and inhibition of the oncogenic pathways downstream of both &#946;1-Integrin and T&#946;RI, and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in levels comparable to loss of expression of either &#946;1-Integrin and T&#946;RI. Treatment of the K2-deficent cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 restored expression of both &#946;1-Integrin and T&#946;RI, confirming that K2 is required for the stabilization of the &#946;1-integrin\/T&#946;R1 complexes at the protein level. Rescue of K2 expression in the K2-KO cells restored their oncogenic activities both in vitro and in vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We identified K2 to play a novel and major in the stabilization of the &#946;1-integrin\/T&#946;R1 complexes and the regulation of their downstream oncogenic signaling. These studies have a significant translational impact as they may identify new therapeutically targeted pathways that are desperately needed for the treatment of TNBC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptors,Integrins,Signaling,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Poor predictability of patient outcomes has limited the development of current therapeutic treatments of GB mainly due to the development of drug resistance. Comparative over-expression of atypical protein kinase C-iota and zeta (aPKC-&#953;\/&#950;) in GB cells and tissue samples were previously reported. This study establishes the downstream effects of PKC-&#953;\/&#950; attenuation on key cellular signaling which governs apoptosis, pyroptosis, survival, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data suggested that aPKC knockdown of expression induces apoptosis and works as an antecedent of pyroptosis. Data also suggested that involvement of Akt1 and PDK1 in aPKC maturation process weakened due to aPKC attenuation. aPKC attenuation downregulated Ras\/Erk1 and canonical &#946;-catenin pathways which resulted in reduced transcriptional activities of Stat3, c-Myc, c-Jun and &#946;-catenin. In addition SNAIL1, SLUG, and PRRX1 were diminished that have been known to stimulate EMT. Proteins 14-3-3 and Smad2\/3 acted as molecular adaptors between these pathways. A PKC-&#953; specific inhibitor 5-amino-1-(2,3-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA-1S) and a PKC-&#950; specific inhibitor 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonic acid (&#950;-Stat) were used to conduct <i>in-vivo<\/i> experiments using mouse models. Intravenous and oral administration of ICA-1S resulted in the reduction of tumor growth by approximately 30% in athymic nude mice for U-87 xenografts. Taken together, these results suggest that not only do aPKCs play a central role in GB progression, invasiveness, and cell survival, but that effective therapeutics can be developed to specifically target oncogenic aPKCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C,Glioblastoma,AKT\/PKB activation,&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The high mortality of gastric cancer can be attributed to the fact that it is mostly diagnosed when the disease has progressed to the advanced stage. While the bacterium <i>Helicobacter pylori <\/i>is known to be the most common cause of gastric cancer, other notable risk factors also include high salt intake, age and diets lacking in fruits and vegetables. Demographic data have revealed that the regions of East Asia, Eastern Europe and South America are notable hotspots of this type of cancer. Endoscopic resection is considered as the major treatment procedure for early detected gastric cancer while those diagnosed in later stages are treated with surgeries such as D2 lymphadenectomy. Previously, the Atypical Protein Kinases C (aPKCs) - &#950; and &#953; - have been documented to play significant roles in elevated cell proliferation in various cancer types. Here, we employed two inhibitors, ICA-1S (5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide and &#950;-stat (8-hydroxy-1,3,6- naphthalenetrisulfonic acid), that specifically inhibit aPKC-&#953; and-&#950; respectively on a gastric cancer cell line (i.e., AGS) to observe their effects on cell proliferation. In separate trials, AGS cells were treated with ICA-1S and &#950;-stat for 72 hours (about 3 days). An assortment of drug concentrations for each of the inhibitors were tried and the analysis of the cell count demonstrated that the cell proliferation decreases were statistically significant for both drugs in all concentrations. In case of ICA-1S, the highest decrease in cell proliferation was observed at 20 &#181;M (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001), whereas in case of &#950;-stat, the highest decrease was observed at 10 &#181;M (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001). Our previous research have revealed that these aPKC inhibitors downregulate the aPKCs-&#953; and-&#950; and interfere with established cancer pathways to cause cell deaths. Based on that and the results from the preliminary data on this project, it can be hypothesized that these two aPKC inhibitors have the potential to lead to Gastric Cancer cell deaths, which could potentially open a new door for Gastric Cancer therapeutics. Henceforth, the Western Blot analysis of AGS cells treated with &#950;-stat have demonstrated the downregulation of the aPKC-&#950; protein. Likewise, a downregulation of the apoptosis-related markers, Survivin<i> <\/i>and Caspase-3, was also illustrated in &#950;-stat treated cells. Current, investigations include how these aPKC inhibitors, ICA-1S and &#950;-stat, play into some of the well-established gastric cancer pathways to lead to cell deaths with techniques such as Western Blot analysis, Immunoprecipitation Assays and Flow cytometry.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Anticancer therapy,Protein kinase C,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

It is not fully understood whether the two GNAQ mutants have similar effects on downstream signaling pathways. Due to lack of available specific GNAQ antibody, epitope tagging is a well-established tool for protein interaction studies using mass spectrometry. Several studies used an epitope tag inserted into an internal region or the c-terminus of GNAQ to study its function. However, the functional consequences of these modalities on effector engagement are not fully elucidated. Here, we engineered both GNAQ wild-type and GNAQ mutants (Q209L and Q209P) without epitope tag as well as three different commonly used tagging modalities. A 3xflag tag of 22 amino acids was inserted after residue 122 of GNAQ. A MYC\/DDK tag consisting of 18 amino acids was incorporated before the stop codon of GNAQ. An internal Glu-Glu epitope tag (EE tag) of 6 amino acids was introduced internally by mutating residues AYLPTQ(171-176) of GNAQ to EYMPTE. To assess the impact of the different modalities on the function of GNAQ mutants, we introduced them into 293FT cells and examined the known oncogenic signaling outputs downstream of GNAQ: MAPK, PKC and FAK signaling. We found that all three tags of both GNAQ<sup>Q209L<\/sup> and GNAQ<sup>Q209P<\/sup> activated MAPK signaling at similar levels as the corresponding untagged GNAQ mutants as evidenced by increases of pERK and pp90RSK level compared to GNAQ wild-type controls. By contrast, both GNAQ<sup>Q209L<\/sup> and GNAQ<sup>Q209P<\/sup> tagged with MYC\/DDK induced lower p-PKD (a readout of PKC) and p-FAK (a readout of FAK activation) compared to EE-tagged or untagged, suggesting that MYC\/DDK tag fused to the c-terminus of GNAQ affects specific effectors downstream of GNAQ. Furthermore, GNAQ<sup>Q209P<\/sup> with the 3xflag tag induced lower levels of p-PKD and p-FAK than 3xflag tagged GNAQ<sup>Q209L<\/sup> did, indicating that GNAQ<sup>Q209P <\/sup>may have a different three-dimensional conformation compared to GNAQ<sup>Q209L<\/sup> with different downstream effectors engagement. Moreover, the GNAQ\/11 inhibitor YM-254890 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, PKD, FAK in a concentration dependent manner in 293FT cells transfected with GNAQ mutants tagged with MYC\/DDK but had no effect on MAPK, PKC and FAK signaling in cells expressing EE-tagged GNAQ mutants. These data suggest that EE tag has no effect on the function of GNAQ , but interferes<br \/>with YM-254890 binding. Our findings highlight unappreciated consequences of epitope-tagging of the oncogene GNAQ that are relevant for studies on the interactome of mutant GNAQ and drug response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

We previously demonstrated that estrogen responsive finger protein (Efp)\/TRIM25 functions as a ubiquitin ligase that degrades cell cycle checkpoint 14-3-3 sigma and promotes cell growth of ER-positive breast cancer [Urano et al., Nature 417:871-875, 2002]. In TNBC cells, we further showed that Efp regulates cell cycle-related gene expression and promotes cell proliferation [Sato et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 624:81-88, 2022]. Efp also exerts a distinct function to activate cellular RNA sensors such as RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), which plays a role in the innate immunity [Gack et al., Nature 446:916-920, 2007]. Another immune-related gene zinc finger CCHC domain-containing protein 3 (ZCCHC3) was recently suggested as Efp interactor, although its pathological relevance in breast cancer remains elusive. We here aimed to clarify the role of ZCCHC3 in TNBC. Immunohistochemical analysis of TNBC tissues from over 100 Japanese patients showed that a positive ZCCHC3 immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly associated with shorter disease&#8208;free survival (DFS) and positively correlated with Efp IR. Notably, patients with both ZCCHC3 and Efp IR positivity showed much shorter DFS than those with ZCCHC3 positivity alone. Functional analysis of ZCCHC3 by siRNA silencing demonstrated that ZCCHC3 promotes the proliferation, migration, and cell cycle progression of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. We established long-term culturable TNBC patient-derived cells (TNBC-PDC) using spheroid culture technique and revealed that the spheroid growth was suppressed by ZCCHC3-specific siRNA treatment. Moreover, ZCCHC3-specific siRNA injection suppressed in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells inoculated in immunodeficient mice. RNA sequencing analysis of ZCCHC3-silenced TNBC cells showed that cell division-related pathway was enriched among downregulated genes, including non-structural maintenance of chromosomes condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH). NCAPH silencing inhibited the proliferation of TNBC-PDCs and MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, ZCCHC3 and Efp are potential poor prognostic factors and can be applied to alternative therapeutic options for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Prognostic factors,Cell signaling,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Despite recent advances, the precise etiology and molecular mechanisms underpinning fatal prostate cancer in humans remain inadequately understood. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate various aspects of RNA biology, and when their regulation is disrupted, they can lead to human diseases, including cancer. However, the comprehensive alterations in RBP-mRNA interactions in prostate cancer have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of RBPs and their interactions with polyadenylated mRNA in the castration-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 prostate cancer cell lines. Using an enhanced RNA interactome capture assay in combination with mass spectrometry, we discovered that LNCaP and C4-2 cells showed distinct RBP-mRNA interaction patterns in steady-state growth conditions and in response to androgen treatment. Additionally, we investigated the interplay between the oncogene Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and the RNA-binding protein nucleophosmin (NPM1). We identified NPM1 as a component of the YAP1 protein complex through mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Our proximity ligation assay demonstrated that androgen signaling could regulate the interaction between YAP1 and NPM1. Also, our GST-pulldown revealed that NPM1 binds to the proline-rich domain of YAP1 in LNCaP cells, while the WW\/SH3 domain of YAP1 mediates the interaction with NPM1 in C4-2 cells. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NPM1 activity reduced prostate cancer cell growth in culture by modulating cell cycle progression. Furthermore, our computational and immunological analysis of prostate tumor tissues indicated that the upregulation of NPM1 might be associated with the clinical advancement of human prostate cancer.

Notch signaling is a transmembrane receptor pathway with four receptor isoforms and five different ligands. Binding between a receptor and ligand triggers pathway activation and is linked to cellular differentiation, cell fate, proliferation, and viability. Both Notch1 and Notch3 signaling have been shown to be dysregulated in pNETs. Notch3 activation has been shown to repress Notch1 activity in other cancers. We hypothesize that activation of Notch3 can reduce Notch1-mediated proliferation in pNETs.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Genetic deletion of Notch1 (N1-KO) in a pNET cell line (BON) was achieved using CRISPR\/Cas9 to create a compound heterozygous knockout at exon 3. An inducible Notch1 overexpression cell line was generated by stably transfecting BON with a plasmid construct containing the Notch1 active form (N1ICD) under a Tet-On regulator. A constitutively active Notch3 cell line was generated by lentiviral transduction of BON with a plasmid overexpressing the Notch3 active form (N3ICD). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA transcript levels, and western blot was used to measure protein expression. Two-dimensional (2D) viability was measured by MTT assay, and three-dimensional (3D) proliferation was measured by spheroid size.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Genetic knockout of Notch1 (N1-KO) reduced the expression of Notch3 at both mRNA and protein levels. N1-KO had reduced proliferation compared to (WT) BON. Increased cell density (ligand availability) or treatment with valproic acid (known Notch1 inducer) led to increased N3ICD in WT BON but not in N1-KO. Overexpression of N1ICD was associated with increased expression of a known downstream target Hes1, as well as Notch3. In contrast, forced overexpression of N3ICD led to increased Notch1 expression, but not Hes1 when compared to a BON cell line transfected with an empty vector. Functionally, N1-KO and N3ICD overexpression cells both had reduced proliferation in both 2D and 3D cell culture.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The Notch1 and Notch3 receptors produce signaling cascades that regulate growth in pNET cells through distinct mechanisms. Reduction of Notch1 signaling suppresses growth, while the same effect can be achieved with Notch3 overexpression. Thus, specifically upregulating Notch3 may be a strategy to block Notch1-mediated proliferation in pNET cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Neuroendocrine tumors,Notch-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Recurrent RhoA mutations have been identified in several human cancers, particularly in leukemia\/lymphoma and gastric cancer. Intriguingly, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations of RhoA are present, suggesting that RhoA GTPase may have a more sophisticated role in cancer and requires more rigorous investigations. Here, we have focused on two of the gain-of-function RhoA mutations identified in Adult T cell Leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) at residue A161 (A161P and A161V) and aim to reveal the underlying mechanistic basis for their function by biochemical and structural analyses. We found that in contrast to conventional gain-of-function RhoA mutants such as RhoA<sup>G14V<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>Q63L<\/sup> which affect the GTP-hydrolysis activity, RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup>are both fast-cycling with drastically increased nucleotide dissociation and association rates, but only slightly reduced GTP-hydrolysis activity. We solved the crystal structures of GDP-bound RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup> and saw that while RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup> displays impaired solvent-mediated interactions to the bound nucleotide, RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup> has a more exposed nucleotide binding pocket compared to RhoA<sup>WT<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup>. Interestingly, RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup>can interact with effector targets in the GDP-bound states. Further <sup>1<\/sup>H-<sup>15<\/sup>N HSQC NMR study provides evidence of the active population in GDP-bound RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup>. Molecule dynamics (MD) simulations show that the dynamic properties of RhoA switch regions are affected differently by the two mutations. Thus, RhoA<sup>A161V<\/sup> and RhoA<sup>A161P<\/sup> are fast-cycling mutants with distinct mechanisms, and both likely endow their GDP-bound state towards an active conformation. These findings provide a better understanding of the oncogenic role of RhoA mutations in cancer and shine light on how changes in RhoA protein dynamic properties caused by mutations may affect its function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G proteins,Mutations,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, the dynamics of E-cadherin is complicated, the underlying mechanism in tumor nest growth and collective cell migration is still not clear. Rab5 is the endocytic vesicle protein for the membrane receptor internalization into early endosome. Therefore, this study is to investigate the role of Rab5 in E-cadherin turnover of spheroid formation in colon cancer cells. HT-29 colon cancer cells were used in this study. The cells with less anchorage ability were isolated for spheroid formation. The distribution of Rab5, E-cadherin and focal adhesion kinase were observed by immuno-confocal microscopy. The molecular expressions were analyzed by western blot. HT-29 cells showed well defined epithelial phenotype. In the result of immunostaining, Rab5 was distributed in the cytosol and the cell-cell contacts where it colocalized with E-cadherin. Rab5 was also observed in the cell leading edge, however, not much associated with focal adhesions. When HT-29 cell clusters were stimulated with epidermal growth factor, Rab5 was found abundant in the cell-cell contacts. In cell spheroid that derived from HT-29 cells, Rab5 and E-cadherin co-localization at cell-cell contacts was also increased. Furthermore, when cells were treated with Nocodazole, the tubulin inhibitor blocking tubulin-mediated endocytosis, Rab5 accumulated and colocalized with E-cadherin in the cell leading edge. The results of this study demonstrated Rab5 plays the novel role in E-cadherin turnover upon epidermal growth factor stimulation in the progress of spheroid formation and Rab5 may mediate E-cadherin endocytosis through the cell leading edge.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Rab5,Spheroids,E-cadherin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-C.

IGFBP-6 regulates insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) by sequestering it to inhibit receptor binding and extend its extracellular half-life. IGF2 binds to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor or insulin receptor A to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and survival. Progesterone is an ovarian steroid hormone which has complex roles in breast cancer through the actions of progesterone receptor A and B (PR-A and B). Progesterone antagonizes the actions of estradiol (E2), another steroid hormone which promotes proliferation and survival in breast cancer. T-47D cells treated with both P4 and E2 exhibit significantly reduced proliferation compared to treatment with E2 alone. To better understand the role of IGFBP-6 in progesterone signaling, T-47D cells which over-express IGFBP-6 were treated with P4, E2, or both. Overexpressing cells exhibited stronger antagonism compared to controls when co-treated with P4 and E2. RNA-interference was performed to knockdown IGFBP-6 induction in the presence of P4 and E2. Knockdown of IGFBP-6 in the presence of P4 and E2 decreases the antagonistic effects of P4. Expression of both PR-A and PR-B decreases by about 50% when IGFBP-6 is knocked down. These results indicate that IGFBP-6 increases PR expression in response to P4 stimulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Progesterone,Progesterone receptor,Cell proliferation,Steroid hormones,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Neurotransmitters are important players in maintaining physiological processes in CNS and abnormal levels of their expression is pathogenic, leading to different processes, including neoplasia. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the neurotransmitters that is found to play a pivotal role in several malignancies. NPY, acting via its cognate receptors Y1, Y2 and Y5 (Y1R, Y2R and Y5R), has been shown to stimulate cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasiveness and dissemination, as well as tumor vascularization in various malignancies including neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, colon, breast, prostate and liver cancers. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine if the NPY system is involved in glioma biology. Our immunohistochemistry staining of NPY, Y1R, Y2R, and Y5R in human GBM tissues revealed positive staining for NPY and Y2R in GBM cells. No expression of Y1R and Y5R was detected in GBM neoplastic population. To further elucidate the association between NPY and its receptors with GBM tumor stage and patients' survival, we used the available clinical data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) database to analyze the gene expression of the NPY system. Y2R expression was increased in high-grade gliomas, while mRNA levels of NPY, Y1R and Y5R inversely correlated with the degree of glioma malignancy. Moreover, high Y2R expression was associated with worse survival in GBM patients. Importantly, endothelial Y2R is also responsible for angiogenic effects of NPY, suggesting its role in GBM vascularization. Altogether, these data suggest the involvement of NPY\/Y2R axis in glioma progression toward more aggressive phenotype. Further functional studies are required to determine the role of the Y2R axis in this process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

The functional analysis of the variants demonstrated that the SxxSS motif played crucial roles in high tumorigenicity, resistance to hypoxia (PLoS ONE 2012), and EMT (Liver Int 2013). These findings suggest that expression levels and patterns of TCF-4 variants tightly regulate diverse phenotypes of cancer cells. Currently, we developed a novel RT-PCR system to quantitatively evaluate TCF-4 variant expressions by using the peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-directed PCR clamping method.<br \/>Aim: To assess mRNA expression levels of TCF-4 variants in hepato-gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and colon cancer tissues, focusing on TCF-4J and TCF-4K with the presence (K) or absence (J) of the SxxSS motif.<br \/>Methods: Thirteen cell lines used in this study were as follows: seven liver cancer; one fetus-derived immortalized hepatocyte; one gastric cancer; two pancreatic cancer; and two colon cancer cell lines. The liver cancer cell lines HAK-1A and HAK-1B are clonally sister cell lines. Sets of three forward primers and four reverse primers were used to generate templates for quantitative PCR (qPCR), and three fluorescence (FAM and Cy5)-tagged primers were applied to detect each variant. Thirty-nine resected human cancer and non-cancerous tissue pairs were used in the IRB-certified study (No. 19192).<br \/>Results: All TCF-4 variants except TCF-4M and TCF-4X were specifically and reproducibly detected and quantified. Cancer cells derived from the colon and stomach highly expressed the TCF-4 variants, showing the highest expression in TCF-4J, while cancer cells from the liver and pancreas expressed relatively lower levels. There was no remarkable difference in the expression profile of TCF-4 variants between HAK-1A and HAK-1B. In colon cancer tissues, TCF-4J was significantly more expressed than TCF-4K.<br \/>Conclusion: Although the variants had been identified from liver cancer cells, they were universally expressed in cells of other organs. TCF-4J, a variant responsible for aggressive cell phenotype, was prominently found in cancer cells of the digestive tract, where the canonical Wnt signal pathway is known to be constitutively active. A similar variant profile between two liver cancer cell lines with identical clonal origin suggests that the variant pattern in the cells reflects organ-specific traits rather than dynamic phenotypic changes during cancer cell dedifferentiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-01 Cell signaling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Splice variants,Phenotype,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.
