[{"Abstract":"The crosstalk between gut microbiome and anti-tumor immunity has recently gained attention in clinical settings. The administration of antibiotics during immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies has been correlated with poorer outcomes in cancer patients, suggesting that microbiome alterations affect overall responses to ICB. The establishment of microbiota-specific T cell clones with tumor cross-reactivity potential was proposed as one of the mechanisms linking the microbiome to anti-tumor responses. Vaccine-based strategies aimed at reactivating these dormant pools of T cells to help eliminate tumors have been proposed as an alternate approach, but the parameters required for successful responses remain poorly understood. Here, we performed in silico selection of bacterial peptides derived from healthy mice based on their mimicry of either tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or neoantigens expressed by murine melanoma cells and not healthy tissue. We show that in silico predicted peptide binding affinity to MHC I correlates with experimental MHC I binding, a key factor associated with strong immune responses. Moreover, we confirmed that a significant proportion of selected peptide candidates can provoke an immune reaction in a vaccination setting. From this group of peptides, we selected candidates which triggered cross-reactive immune responses against TAAs or neoantigens. Data from preliminary tumor challenge experiments with prophylactic peptide vaccination and ICB allowed us to define key parameters such as target gene expression levels which can predict the cross-reactive potential of bacterial peptides that mimic tumor antigens. These findings provide novel insights into the design of gut microbiome peptide-based tumor vaccines and pave the way for establishing combinatorial therapies with immunomodulatory drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Vaccines,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

In particular, Hyaluronic Acid, partially hydrophobized by chemical modification with cholesteryl groups, has a distinguished characteristic to form physically cross-linked NanoGel particles. HANG efficiently forms a stable complex with an antigenic polypeptide (HANG-Vaccine) through hydrophobic interactions. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of HANG-V against tumors resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adoptive TCR-T therapy.<br \/>Methods: C57BL\/6-derived B16F10 melanoma and BALB\/c-derived CMS5a sarcoma are both known to be resistant to ICIs and adoptive TCR-T therapy. The efficacy of HANG-V was tested by using each tumor-bearing mice treatment model. HANG-V was prepared by mixing gp100 or CMS5a neoantigen (Ag) with HANG, respectively.<br \/>Results: HANG-V was subcutaneously injected into B16F10-bearing C57BL\/6 on days 7, 11, and 15, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from Pmel-1 mice were intravenously administered on days 8 and 12. Surprisingly, complete regression of established B16F10 tumors with more than 100 mm<sup>2<\/sup> were observed. Vaccinated mice survived with changing hair color of mice into white, while non-vaccinated mice were all dead by day 25. Moreover, gp100-specific CTLs was observed abundantly in systemic including tumor site. Even two months after the treatment, transferred T cells with memory phenotype were persistently detected in peripheral bloods. Furthermore, booster vaccination elicited robust expansion of these memory T cells persisting for more than one year. In similar experimental settings, we treated CMS5a tumor-bearing mice by HANG-V combined with adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from DUC18 mice, whose T cells are specific for mutated ERK2 neoAg. All mice survived as well with complete reduction of established CMS5a tumors, rejected a rechallenge with CMS5a and induced an Ag-specific CTL responses on more than 2 years. Notably, by using neoantigen-knockout CMS5a, we obtained results suggesting that HANG-V with TCR-T therapy potently induced the so-called &#8220;antigen spreading&#8221;. Furthermore, induction of Ag-specific CTLs was associated with CD44 hyaluronic acid receptor which expressed in APCs crucial for cross-presentation to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: HANG-V strongly enhanced the efficacy of adoptive TCR-T cell therapy against ICI refractory tumors leading to total tumor suppression. Furthermore, HANG-V induced potent and persistent Ag-specific CTLs systemically through interaction with CD44 hyaluronic receptor, allowing long-term protection of tumor recurrence with memory CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Our studies may propose crucial insights for clinical application of HANG vaccine with adoptive T cell therapy in patient with ICI-resistant tumors with poor prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Cancer vaccine,Adoptive cell therapy,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Although ERV protein expression is typically silenced epigenetically in normal adult human tissues, previous studies have shown that some ERVSs, can be aberrantly expressed in multiple cancer types. This atypical expression of ERVs in tumors may represent a class of immunologically relevant tumor-associated antigens that can potentially be targeted clinically using therapeutic cancer vaccines. For the first time, this study evaluates the ERV envelope protein ERVMER34-1 as a potential target for a therapeutic cancer vaccine. We first assessed the expression of ERVMER34-1 in multiple tissues and found that ERVMER34-1 protein is absent in most healthy adult tissues and over expressed in multiple types of human carcinomas. ERVMER34-1 specific T-cells were detected in PBMCs of cancer patients but not healthy donors following an overnight stimulation. However, reactive T-cells are readily expanded from both healthy donor and cancer patient PBMCs following a 7-day in-vitro stimulation. Importantly, reactive CD8+ T cells selectively killed human carcinoma cells expressing the target antigen. Based on these findings, we rationally designed a ERVMER34-1 therapeutic cancer vaccine and assessed its immunogenicity and anti-tumor efficacy in established syngeneic murine tumors expressing the full-length ERVMER34-1 protein. Our rationally designed ERVMER34-1 cancer vaccine significantly mediated tumor regression and extended survival as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint blockade.<b> <\/b>Altogether, our work supports the clinical development of a therapeutic cancer vaccine targeting the retroviral envelope protein ERVMER34-1 as a potential first-in-class immunotherapeutic target for the therapy of several carcinoma types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Immunotherapy,Retrovirus,Tumor antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

This renders neoantigens viable targets for personalized cancer vaccines. However, the identification of immunogenic neoantigens remains suboptimal. Understanding how immune selective pressure-mediated tumor evolution and neoantigen editing contribute to emergence of immunogenic neoantigens may improve prediction accuracy. In this study, we aimed to model tumor evolution and heterogeneity under immune pressure using three preclinical models of lung cancer with common driver mutations, Kras G12D\/+ and p53 -\/-, namely KPA, KPC, and HKP1, subcutaneously implanted in immunocompetent C57BL\/6 (B6) and immune-deficient Rag1-\/- mice. Our data suggest that despite shared driver mutations identified by whole exome and RNA-seq, tumor growth in vivo varied between tumor models. KPA tumors were immunogenic, as they were controlled in B6 mice but rapidly progressed in Rag1-\/- mice, suggesting immunoediting of KPA-specific neoantigens. In contrast, HKP1 was non-immunogenic, with tumors progressing regardless of immune competency. KPC showed moderate tumor control in B6 mice, which was lost in Rag1-\/- mice. We then estimated the cancer cell fraction on every mutation based on phylogenetic reconstruction. Immunogenic KPA tumors had significantly lower mutation burden in B6 than in Rag1-\/- mice and the fraction of cell line mutations edited in vivo was significantly higher, suggesting active immunoediting in the former. Non-immunogenic HKP1 tumors did not show significant differences in mutation burden nor fraction of mutations edited between B6 and Rag1-\/- mice. The immunogenicity was reflected in the immune infiltrate levels within tumors, with KPA being highly infiltrated by activated CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to KPC. HKP1 tumors showed increased infiltration of suppressive regulatory T cells. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on lung tumors showed that clonal expansion is strongly associated with immunogenicity. KPA tumors showed significantly higher TCR clustering with less diversity compared to KPC and more than HKP1. Following a simple approach to study the immunogenicity of shared neoantigens to elicit cross-protective anti-tumor responses, mice were immunized with whole irradiated (IR) tumor cell lines and implanted with live tumor cells (matched and unmatched). While immunization with IR-KPA protected against corresponding tumor implant and moderately against KPC, it did not protect against HKP1, indicating lack of immunogenicity of mutations shared between KPA and HKP1. Further studies testing the anti-tumor responses and characteristics of neoantigens shared between these three related tumor cell lines will inform the conditions under which tumors may escape or regress and help improve neoantigen identifying algorithms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Indoleamine 2,3-dehydrogenase (IDO1) and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) both contribute to immunosuppression, leading to immune escape and cancer progression. In this context, vaccination to promote T-cell immunity against IDO1<sup>+<\/sup> and PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells is an attractive strategy that demonstrated encouraging clinical results in melanoma (Kjeldsen et al. Nat Med 2021). Our study aims to further evaluate the efficacy and mode of action of combined IDO1 and PD-L1 peptide vaccines.<br \/>Mice injected with tumor cells and treated with IDO1 or PD-L1 peptides were monitored for tumor growth. Vaccine activity was determined by IFN&#947; Elispot assay. Gene expression analysis was performed on tumors using Nanostring nCounter PanCancer IO360 Panel. IDO1 and PD-L1 expression were also examined via multiplex immunofluorescence in a human tumor tissue microarray (TMA) panel. Human IDO1 and PD-L1 specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell clones were isolated and expanded from melanoma patients treated with IDO1\/IO102 or PD-L1\/IO103 peptide vaccines in combination with aPD1 therapy.<br \/>Immunofluorescence analysis of murine tumor sections showed expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 by different cell populations. Vaccination against each target led to expansion of specific T cells in splenocytes and reduced tumor growth in MC38 and CT26 models. Combining IDO1 and PD-L1 treatments further enhanced the anti-tumor response. Gene expression analysis of tumors revealed distinct signatures following monotherapy and combination treatments. While PD-L1 vaccination predominantly enhanced the cytotoxic effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and concomitantly increased gene signatures associated with enhanced activation of T effector cells, IDO1 vaccine primarily exerted its effect via reduction in the immune suppression loop. TMA analysis of IDO1<sup>+<\/sup> and PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells in human tumors also revealed that they represent largely distinct cell populations. Lastly, IDO1 and PDL1-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell clones from melanoma patients treated with IO102-IO103 vaccine could selectively target cells differentially expressing IDO1 or PDL1.<br \/>Our data collectively show that cells expressing IDO1 and PD-L1 represent distinct populations in the TME thus targetable by the IDO1-PD-L1 vaccination approach. The vaccines targeting IDO1 and PD-L1 cooperatively reduce tumor outgrowth, and each contributes to the anti-tumor effect through distinct molecular programs regulating immunosuppression in the TME and T cell activation respectively. These data are supported by ex vivo functional assays using target specific T cells from vaccinated patients.

The development of more effective immunotherapies is hampered by limited knowledge of the appropriate target antigens, also considering the low burden of mutations generating neoantigens of these tumors. Alternative classes of MSS CRC antigens may provide actionable epitopes.<br \/>Methods: We have characterized the immunopeptidome of 2 MSS CRC cell lines derived from the primary tumor (SW480) and a metastatic lymph node (SW620) of the same patient. Given the low mutational burden of MSS, we focused on peptides belonging to alternative sources of HLA-A*02 epitopes, such as proteasomal cis-spliced peptides derived from cancer testis antigens and linear epitopes derived from Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which are frequently reactivated in CRC. Peptide immunogenicity was functionally validated based on their ability to expand HLA-A*02<sup>+<\/sup> donor T cells (&#62;3) specifically killing targets cells presenting the relevant peptides or HLA-matched CRC cell lines. <i>In vivo<\/i> epitope immunogenicity was verified by analyzing polyfunctional responses of human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells obtained from NSG-A2 mice humanized with A*02<sup>+<\/sup> donor PBMCs and immunized with epitope-loaded nano-emulsions selectively targeting human Clec9A<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells. Therapeutic exploitation of the novel epitopes was investigated by adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells in NSG-A2 mice injected with SW620 cells. Epitope-specific T cell responses were investigated in PBMCs from 10 MSS CRC patients and 7 donors.<br \/>Results: Among &#62;50,000 HLA-bound peptides identified by in depth immunopeptidomics analysis, 11 cis-spliced peptides and 5 HERV peptides were functionally validated as immunogenic. Epitope-specific T cells showed specific cytotoxic activity against SW480 and SW620 CRC cells. Globally, cis-spliced peptides were more immunogenic <i>in vitro <\/i>than HERV-derived peptides. The immunogenicity of both groups of peptides was confirmed <i>in vivo<\/i> in humanized mice. Adoptively transferred HERV or cis-spliced epitope specific T cells significantly inhibited the growth of SW620 cells <i>in vivo<\/i>, with cis-spliced epitope-specific T cells being more effective. Therapeutic efficacy of Clec9A-targeting vaccines exploiting these epitopes is currently under investigation. T cell responses specific for cis-spliced and HERV epitopes were detected in PBMCs from 3\/4 MSS CRC HLA-A*02<sup>+<\/sup> patients but in none of 4 HLA-A*02<sup>-<\/sup> MSS CRC patients or 7 healthy donors (4 HLA-A*02<sup>+<\/sup> and 3 HLA-A*02<sup>-<\/sup>).<br \/>Conclusions: We have identified and validated a new class of immunogenic HLA-A*02<b> <\/b>epitopes derived from alternative classes of MSS CRC antigens.

The hallmark of LS is microsatellite instability (MSI), resulting from a defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. MSI cases have hyper-elevated frameshift mutation rates including &#8220;shared&#8221; hotspot mutations recurrently across patients. Frameshift mutations can generate neopeptides that activate the immune system. These open the door for preventive vaccines. However, preventive vaccines work best with neopeptides that happen early during tumorigenesis.Here we present 83 newly sequenced adenomas and carcinomas from Lynch syndrome carriers and combine them with previously published 68 Lynch cases and 133 Sporadic cases, thus generating the largest currently available colorectal neoplasiaMSI cohort. We leveraged this large cohort to analyze the molecular landscape of adenomas vs carcinoma tumors and Lynch vs sporadic tumors. Employing our recently developed MSIDetect tool on our WGS samples, we identified microsatellite instability in 75% of adenomas, which is higher than previously reported. We found that about 30% of normal adjacent tissues showed MSI, suggesting early mismatch repair defects. This early MSI occurrence supports the potential effectiveness of preventive vaccines.We observed comparable levels of SNVs, microsatellite Indels, and single base signature activity among Lynch adenomas and carcinomas, as well as sporadic carcinomas while adjusting for variations in coverage across different datasets. Moreover, using RNA sequencing data and PCA analysis we found that adenoma and carcinoma cluster together. This large cohort enabled us to identify (as fast as we know for the first time) MS-indels that tend to have a second MS-indel in the same locus. The high similarities observed between Lynch and sporadic tumors allow for their combination in one vaccine.Using the combined MSI cohort we generated a set of about 300 neopeptides that emerged from frequent mutations (&#62;5% in our cohort) with a strong binding affinity for at least one HLA type. We evaluated that a set of about 60 neopeptides per person from that list is predicted likely to initiate an immune response in ~99.5% of the carriers.These findings hold promise for the development of a preventive vaccine capable of targeting early tumorigenic stages.

Lack of approved treatments to intercept disease progression has imposed challenges in the clinical management of patients with GGOs. Previous studies showed that GGO nodules have substantially lower rates of HLA deletions than invasive\/metastatic lung cancer, suggesting that GGO nodules constitute a critical window of vulnerability for immune interception. We therefore sought to identify the most immunogenic and cytotoxic neoantigens in patients with GGO nodules and to develop LNP-mRNA cancer vaccines to intercept the disease progression from pre-invasive to invasive adenocarcinoma. Whole exome and RNA sequencing of a large cohort (&#62;300) patients identified potential neoantigen candidates, with KRAS-G12C, KRAS-G12D and EGFR-L858R as the most frequently predicted shared neoantigens consistent with &#62;40% GGO patient population harboring either mutant KRAS or EGFR driver oncogenes. LNP-mRNA vaccines targeting KRAS-G12C and EGFR-L858R showed marked immunogenicity as determined by ELISPOT assays. Moreover, KRAS-G12C vaccination induced CD4+ T cell responses whereas EGFR-L858R vaccination triggered CD8+ T cell responses. Both these vaccines are being tested in GGO immunoprevention studies. Our data suggest the potential of KRAS and EGFR vaccines in the treatment of early disease, particularly in EGFR mutant patients who fail to respond to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Prevention,mRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

We have uncovered dysregulated protein citrullination by peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADI) as a feature of triple negative breast cancer inducing immunogenicity to citrullinated proteins. On the basis of these findings, we investigated a novel vaccine based on cancer-selective cit-ENO1 peptides that we identified from mass spectrometry analysis of the surfaceome and immunopeptidome in TNBC. We assessed the extent to which the vaccine elicited an immune response and delayed tumor growth and improved overall survival in a syngeneic mouse model of TNBC.<br \/>Experimental Design: We immunized female B6129SF1\/J mice with cit-ENO1 peptides or corresponding unmodified ENO1 (unm-ENO1) peptides as antigens, together with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C as an adjuvant, once a week, for three weeks. PBS or poly I:C alone were used as controls. One week post the last round of immunization, draining lymph nodes (LN) and immunized skin were harvested, and T cell phenotypes evaluated using flow cytometry.

CD8+ PD-1+ T-cells were also significantly elevated in immunized skin of cit-ENO1 vaccinated mice. Both cit-ENO1 and unm-ENO1 vaccine increased CD4+ PD-1+ T cells from the LNs and immunized skin.

Despite its significant medical relevance and the knowledge that human T cells recognize these mutations<sup>[1,2]<\/sup>, immunotherapies designed to promote responses against mutated p53 (mp53) have not had the hoped-for clinical impact<sup>[3]<\/sup>. The Amphiphile (AMP) platform improves the potency of vaccine immunotherapy by programming the delivery of vaccine components to the lymph nodes where efficient uptake by immune cells initiates tumor-targeted immune responses. AMP-modification of vaccine components (peptide antigens, molecular adjuvants) results in covalent conjugation to albumin-binding lipids. Upon injection, AMP-vaccines associate with tissue-resident albumin which efficiently distributes to draining lymph nodes. This approach was shown to promote activation of polyfunctional, cytotoxic T cells with promising safety and improved clinical outcomes in a Phase 1 trial of ELI-002, an mKRAS AMP therapeutic vaccine (AMPLIFY-201 NCT05726864). Application of this strategy to p53 mutations with ELI-008 offers the potential for improved immunotherapeutic activity in a setting of significant unmet need.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Following immunization of C57BL\/6J mice with AMP-modified or soluble comparator vaccines consisting of mp53 peptides and CpG adjuvant, analyses were performed 7 days after the third bi-weekly dose. To assess antigen-specific T cell responses, ELISpot (IFN&#947;, GzmB), multiplexed proteomic, and flowcytometric analysis of effector cytokines (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL-2) were performed following antigenic stimulation. Responses were determined in secondary lymphoid tissues and lung. Cytolytic capabilities of antigen-specific T cells were evaluated by monitoring specific killing of IV-transferred antigen-pulsed target cells.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> AMP-immunization generated robust immune responses yielding strong T cell activation against common p53 hot spot mutations (R248W, R248Q, R175H, G245S, R273H, Y220C, C135Y, R158H, H214R). Responses to AMP-vaccination were characterized by the generation of increased frequency of polyfunctional T cells (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL2) specific to mp53 epitopes. Induced T cells demonstrated significant levels of cytolytic activity including GzmB production and elimination of target cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Non-lymph targeted vaccines using soluble comparators were inactive.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> AMP-conjugation permits efficient delivery directly to the lymph nodes and thus improves the immunogenicity of peptide vaccination.

Nonetheless, therapies designed to promote immune responses against mutated BRAF (mBRAF) have led to limited clinical success<sup>[2]<\/sup>, despite evidence confirming T cell recognition of these mutations<sup>[3,4]<\/sup>. The Amphiphile (AMP) platform improves the potency of vaccine immunotherapy by programming the delivery of vaccine components to the lymph nodes where efficient uptake by resident immune cells initiates tumor-targeted immune responses. AMP-modification of vaccine components including peptide antigens and molecular adjuvants results in covalent conjugation to albumin-binding lipids. Upon injection, AMP-vaccines associate with tissue resident albumin which efficiently distributes to draining lymph nodes. This approach was shown to promote activation of polyfunctional, cytotoxic T cells with promising safety, and improved clinical outcomes in a Phase 1 trial of ELI-002, an mKRAS AMP therapeutic vaccine (AMPLIFY-201 NCT04853017). Application of this strategy to prevalent BRAF mutations with ELI-007 offers the potential for improved therapeutic activity in a setting of significant unmet need, as BRAF inhibitors benefit only a fraction of patients, with near universal progression.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Following multi-dose immunization of C57BL\/6J mice with AMP-modified or soluble comparator vaccines consisting of mBRAF V600E\/K peptides and CpG adjuvant, immunological readouts were performed 7 days after dosing. Antigen-specific T cell responses were assessed after <i>ex vivo<\/i> re-stimulation of cells with mBRAF overlapping peptides. Assays included analysis of antigen-specific T cell frequencies, multiplexed proteomics determining polyfunctionality, and effector function and cytotoxic potential evaluation. Responses were determined in secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen), as well as lung, to which many BRAF driven cancers metastasize.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> AMP-immunization generated robust <i>in vivo<\/i> immune responses yielding strong T cell activation against mBRAF epitopes. Non-lymph node targeted vaccination using soluble comparators were inactive with no response above mock treated mice. Responses to AMP-vaccination were characterized by the generation of significantly increased frequency of Th1-skewed, polyfunctional T cells (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL2) specific to mBRAF V600E and V600K. Induced T cells further exhibited mBRAF-specific cytotoxic function.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> AMP-conjugation enhances efficient delivery directly to the lymph nodes and thus improves the immunogenicity of peptide vaccination.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors often have impact in the 15% of CRC patients with microsatellite instability-high status CRCs but have limited utility in the remaining 85% of CRC patients. Given the presence of p53 mutations in CRC, we pursued a vaccine approach against tumor cells expressing murine CRC Trp53 codon 270 missense alleles (codon 273 mutation in human cancer) using a combination of R270H p53 peptide, wild type p53 recombinant protein and used a mucosal adjuvant (MA) to drive epithelial immune responses. The vaccine (p53\/MA) was studied in a CDX2-CreERT2 (tamoxifen-induced Cre-Lox) transgenic mouse CRC model where tumors arise in the cecum and proximal colon epithelium following combined Apc<sup>&#916;580<\/sup>, Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>, and Trp53<sup>R270H<\/sup> mutations (AKP model). The p53\/MA vaccine treatment was administered intranasally to the mice at defined time points after tamoxifen tumor induction. p53\/MA vaccinated animals had increased anti-p53 IgG (p&#60;0.01), IgG2a (p&#60;0.01), and IgG2b (p&#60;0.001) in sera compared to control mice. The treatment enhanced antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 cellular immune responses, as shown by increasing of IFN-&#612; (p&#60;0.05), IL-17a (p&#60;0.01) and IL-2 (p&#60;0.01) both in splenocytes and draining lymph nodes measured by Luminex assay. Vaccinated mice also showed significant more cells producing IFN-&#612; (p&#60;0.001) and IL-17a (p&#60;0.001) as analyzed by ELISpot. Importantly, the immunized animals had decreased tumor size\/volume (p&#60;0.001) and prolonged survival (p&#60;0.05) compared to control animals that received only saline or MA respectively. Tumors from vaccinated mice also showed more mononuclear cell infiltrates than tumors from the control animals. In conclusion, novel p53\/MA vaccinations can induce significant p53-specific immune responses and anti-tumor effects in the mouse AKP CRC model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Vaccines,p53 mutations,Peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However in castration resistant prostate cancer up to 50% of treatment resistance has been linked to AR amplification or expression of the constitutively active RNA splice variant, AR-V7. Although the use of immune checkpoint blockade has failed to demonstrate clinical success, immunotherapeutic interventions remain attractive as prostate cancer&#8217;s relatively slow progression provides time for anti-tumor immune responses to develop. Cancer specific vaccines have the potential to enable and enhance tumor specific immune responses by stimulating and directing T cell immunity to important oncologic targets. We hypothesized that a cancer vaccine designed to induce a T cell response against cells expressing high levels of AR would result in an anti-tumor effect and potentially prevent or delay the development of therapeutic resistance.<br \/>Methods: Adenoviral vaccines against AR (Ad-AR) or AR splice variant 7 (Ad-AR-V7) were used to evaluate the potential of AR targeting vaccination in mouse models. We evaluated AR and AR variant specific adaptive responses produced by our vaccines with na&#239;ve and tumor-bearing mice by ex vivo peptide restimulation. We challenged vaccinated mice with multiple syngeneic subcutaneous tumor models that we engineered to express AR-V7, including a PTEN<sup>-\/- <\/sup>p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> prostate tumor cell line. Finally we tested our vaccines in a therapeutic regimen, vaccinating mice after implanting our subcutaneous AR-V7 expressing models.<br \/>Results: Across multiple strains of mice, AR or AR-V7 targeting adenoviral vaccination induced robust adaptive immune responses against the N-terminal domain of AR. Vaccination with either Ad-AR or Ad-AR-V7 resulted in significant anti-tumor responses, providing a significant overall survival benefit and complete tumor rejection by the majority of mice vaccinated against AR or AR-V7. Similarly tumor bearing mice treated with Ad-AR or Ad-AR-V7 vaccination displayed tumor growth inhibition or complete tumor regression resulting in an overall survival benefit. Additionally, we found that vaccine responses were unaffected by the use of the approved antiandrogen drug enzalutamide, suggesting that vaccinations could be deployed in tandem with standard-of-care therapies.<br \/>Conclusions: Vaccination against AR and AR splice variants can induce AR specific adaptive immune responses capable of inhibiting the growth of AR-V7 expressing tumor models, illustrating the potential of AR and its splice variants as immunologic targets in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Vaccines,Androgen receptor,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Despite the availability of prophylactic HPV vaccines for almost two decades, vaccination rates among young females, who are at a heightened risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subsequent invasive cancer, remain suboptimal. The current standard of care for cervical cancer, involving invasive surgery and chemotherapy-based treatments, underscores the pressing need for safer and more effective therapeutics to enhance patient survival and quality of life.<br \/>In this context, while several HPV16-E6\/E7 targeted therapeutic vaccines are in development and clinical trials, their clinical efficacy has been limited due to inadequate antigen presentation and suboptimal immunogenicity. Addressing this, our team has developed a novel, highly immunogenic mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine, engineered to activate a robust T cell-mediated adaptive immune response and exhibit strong anti-tumor potential.<br \/>Our innovative approach includes the design of an HPV16-E6\/E7 mRNA vaccine (ABO2101) that incorporates a unique antigen-expressing cassette. This cassette features endolysosomal trafficking domains and antigen presenting cell (APC) activation stimulators, enhancing both Class I and Class II antigen presentation and APC maturation, thereby amplifying antigen-specific T cell responses.<br \/>In both murine and human-derived experimental models, ABO2101 has demonstrated a significantly more potent adaptive T cell response against HPV16 antigens compared to other HPV16 mRNA therapeutic vaccines.<br \/>In antitumor efficacy evaluations using TC-1 tumor-bearing mice, ABO2101 single-dose administration successfully eradicated both early-stage (50 mm&#179;) and advanced (500 mm&#179;) tumors. This was accompanied by a marked increase in HPV16-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in prophylactic and adjuvant therapy models, ABO2101 prevented tumor growth across various dosages, indicating its robust preventative capabilities.<br \/>Further, the combination of ABO2101 with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies, displayed a synergistic effect in both immune-oncology sensitive and resistant animal models, suggesting a potential for combinational clinical therapy.<br \/>In conclusion, our development of ABO2101, a mRNA-based HPV16-E6\/E7 therapeutic cancer vaccine inclusive of APC maturation signals, represents a groundbreaking advancement in HPV-associated cancer treatment, as supported by our compelling preclinical data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Human papillomavirus (HPV),mRNA,Cervical cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Liang Du<sup><\/sup>, Hongya Han<sup><\/sup>, Jingshu Ma<sup><\/sup>, Zhenxing Yang<sup><\/sup>, Jinjuan Mao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jijun Yuan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bo Ying<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Abogen Bioscience, Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a8c7ccd9-402a-4cb5-bbca-a37f8787067f","ControlNumber":"8784","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

T cell activation level, IFN-&#947;release degree and their cytolytic capability towards cancer cells was measured. CD73-derived peptides were mixed with CpG to treat 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and the changes in the TME were investigated by flow cytometry. The online website (www.camoip.net) was used to analyze the correlation between CD73 expression and patient survival in the TCGA Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) cohort.Results: 4T1 exhibited a strikingly elevated surface expression of CD73 compared to other mouse cancer cell lines. Three CD73-derived peptides (EP1, EP2, EP3) consisting of 8-10 amino acids were synthesized. <i>In vitro<\/i> stimulation experiments indicated that EP1 and EP3 significantly elicited T-cell responses in draining lymph nodes. After stimulation, the proportions of CD25<sup>+<\/sup>, CD69<sup>+<\/sup>, CD107a<sup>+,<\/sup> and CD137<sup>+<\/sup> cells markedly increased in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell populations. These cells also displayed enhanced cytotoxicity against 4T1 tumor cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments demonstrated that EP3 induced a pronounced anti-tumor response in an established 4T1 tumor model without evident toxicity. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of EP3 improves the TME by promoting antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T-cell responses, reducing M2 macrophages, and inducing neutrophil maturation. High tumor CD73 expression was also found to be associated with poor outcomes among BRCA patients, which further indicated clinical relevance.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we successfully identified an immunogenic vaccine targeting CD73. It expressed dual functionality by effectively triggering cytotoxic T-cell responses that directly killing CD73-highexpressing tumor cells and regulating the tumor microenvironment through eliminating immunosuppressive cells with elevated CD73 expression. These findings hold promise for a novel immune-modulating vaccine and suggest a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of breast cancer and other types of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Tumor microenvironment,Immunomodulation,Therapeutic Peptide Vaccine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

A novel frontier is personalized vaccines targeting neoantigens unique to tumor cells. Vaccines based on neoantigens have several advantages. First, neoantigens are exclusively expressed by tumor cells and can, therefore, elicit truly tumor-specific T cell responses, thereby preventing &#8216;off-target&#8217; damage to nonmalignant tissues. Second, neoantigens are de novo epitopes derived from somatic mutations, which presents the possibility to circumvent T cell central tolerance of self-epitopes and thus induce immune responses to tumors. One of the major challenges is the optimal neoantigen discovery\/selection. Our study combines in silico HLA binding models with the 'MHC-PepSeq' platform to enhance neoantigen prediction, creating a personalized neoantigen peptide vaccine. We aim to demonstrate its efficacy in a mouse CT26 colon cancer model.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Our method involved whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA to identify neoantigens expressed in CT26 tumors, generating a peptide library. The peptides were further filtered using an in-silico prediction algorithm and our proprietary peptide-MHC binding assay (PepSeq assay), to determine those exhibiting the highest binding affinity with mice HLAs. Vaccines were prepared by dissolving these peptides in sterile PBS. Mice (BALB\/C) were subcutaneously implanted with CT26 tumors, then immunized with the vaccine via IV injection in combination with a TLR7\/8 agonist. Mice received a second vaccine dose on Day 14, and some groups were treated with an anti-PD-1 agent. Tumors and spleens from the mice were collected, processed into single-cell suspensions, and analyzed by single-cell sequencing, TCR analysis, IHC, and flow cytometry assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and utilized in MHC tetramer assays.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrated significant tumor growth restrictions (TGI around 70%) and prolonged tumor-free survival in some mice. Our data showed the generation of neoantigen-specific T cells in vaccinated mice. Remarkably, vaccinated, tumor-free mice, when re-challenged with the same tumor cells, maintained their tumor-free status, suggesting the vaccine induced post-treatment immunological memory. Combining the vaccine with checkpoint inhibition resulted in better tumor growth restriction in mice (TGI around 93%).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Overall, our data suggests that our personalized neoantigen vaccine platform has the potential to evoke robust and durable immune responses and, when paired with suitable complementary therapies and immune adjuvants, may serve as an effective cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,cancer vaccines,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

We developed the Oncotope Platform that rapidly identifies multiple cancer-specific cell surface targets not expressed on normal cells (JCO 2022). In this study, we generated polyclonal antibodies to human Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC; Hs578T, ATCC). Following this, we used the Oncotope Platform to filter the anti-TNBC antibody-enriched serum, to yield cancer specific polyclonal antibodies. Using a Protein Microarray, we assessed the binding affinity of both the Total Anti-TNBC Serum (before filtration) and the Oncotope Filtered Anti-TNBC Serum towards approximately 25,000 human proteins. Our results identified antigens that exhibited significantly higher affinity binding to the Oncotope Filtered Anti-TNBC Serum than the Total Anti-TNBC Serum. One of these antigens ZIP7, a zinc transporter situated in the ER and Golgi, has been shown to activate cell proliferation related signaling pathways in TNBC. Our findings revealed the aberrant cell surface expression of ZIP7 on TNBC cells and its potential as a therapeutic target. Flow cytometry analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ZIP7 revealed substantial binding to TNBC cells, while no significant binding was observed with normal breast epithelial (NBE) cells from the same patient (Hs578BsT, ATCC). Additionally, cytotoxicity assays, employing the same antibodies and a secondary anti-rabbit ADC, showed the preferential killing of TNBC cells over NBE cells (Table 1). In summary, our study marks a breakthrough in identifying cancer-specific antigens with therapeutic potential. The Oncotope Platform, in combination with protein microarrays, enables rapid identification of unique cancer-specific antigens absent in normal cells. Specifically targeting ZIP7 on TNBC cell surfaces highlights its promise for precision cancer therapy.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{1BF46B42-623D-42BE-903C-0B6D446FA441}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cell Line<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Incubated with:<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">%Binding Flow Cytometry (1:400 Ab dilution)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">%Cytotoxicity (4ug\/ml Ab conc.)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TNBC (Hs578T)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total Anti-TNBC Serum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">96.65<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94.5 +\/- 2.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Oncotope Filtered Anti-TNBC Serum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">97.46<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">79.2 +\/- 2.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ZIP7 Polyclonal antibody ((Proteintech 11200-1-AP)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">46.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">73.2 +\/- 0.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Normal Breast Epithelial cells (Hs578Bst)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total Anti-TNBC Serum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">92.95<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">92.3 +\/- 3.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Oncotope Filtered Anti-TNBC Serum<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20.39<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.9 +\/- 4.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ZIP7 Polyclonal antibody ((Proteintech 11200-1-AP)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6.37<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.1 +\/- 1.6<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Target discovery,Antigen,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

To date, cancer vaccines mainly focused on tumor-associated antigens with survivin eliciting protective T-cell responses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Given the success of mRNA vaccines in medicine, we developed Galsomes, lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA and &#945;-galactosyl ceramide to activate both CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells, both potential anti-MM effectors.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Mouse 5T33MM cells were studied by PCR and flow cytometry (FCM) for expression of survivin and CD1d, respectively. Intravenous (IV) prime-boost Galsome vaccination was performed with a 7-day interval in C57BL6\/KalwRij mice that received an IV injection of 5<sup>x<\/sup>10<sup>6<\/sup> 5T33MM cells 3 days earlier. As a control, mice were injected with saline. After 2 weeks, MM burden was studied by serum electrophoresis and FCM, incl. expression of CD1d and PD-L1 on MM cells. Activation of iNKT cells and survivin-specific T cells was studied by measuring IFN-&#947; secretion in ELISA and dextramer staining. Immunopeptidomics was used to identify new vaccine candidates for which Galsome vaccination is ongoing.<br \/>Result: The 5T33MM cells showed expression of survivin and CD1d, making it a suitable model for Galsome vaccination. Two weeks following prime-boost vaccination, the serum M-protein was reduced, though not significantly. In contrast, MM cells were significantly reduced in bone marrow and spleen. Expression of CD1d and PD-L1 on MM cells was high but unchanged by Galsome vaccination. Activation of iNKT cells and survivin-specific T cells following prime vaccination was shown. However, following boost vaccination these cell populations reduced significantly compared to control. We repeated prime-boost vaccination in healthy mice, observing a similar outcome. This suggests that the negative effect of the boost Galsome vaccination was not related to immune dysfunctionality due to MM progression. So, we studied the impact of survivin mRNA in the vaccine, as survivin is also expressed in activated T cells, making them a potential target. We observed that iNKT cells and ovalbumin-specific T cells were more reduced when ovalbumin mRNA was paired with survivin mRNA in the Galsomes. To identify other vaccine candidates, we studied peptides eluted from MHC-I\/peptide complexes on 5T33MM cells. We selected 4 vaccine candidates including the MM idiotype based on immunogenicity, pathway classification and abundance. mRNA and Galsomes were prepared, and the efficacy of these Galsomes in 5T33MM mice is currently under evaluation.<br \/>Conclusion: These data show that Galsome vaccination has the potential to reduce MM cell levels. To reach higher efficacy, careful selection of the vaccine antigen is required. Moreover, combination with other immunotherapies might be needed to reach durable disease control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mRNA,Nanoparticle,Multiple myeloma,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

KRAS mutants offer the potential for the development of cancer-specific immunotherapy, as epitopes harbouring mutations are strong neoantigens to which the immune system generates cancer-specific anti-tumor effects. However, previous clinical trials of KRAS-targeted vaccines failed to generate satisfactory anti-cancer efficacy. Evidence suggested that CD4 T cell activity plays a critical role in augmenting the cytotoxic effect of CD8 T cells. Here, we design long peptides based on the MHC II hotspots on the entire KRAS protein that activate both CD4 and CD8 T cells to kill KRAS-driven cancer cells. Long peptides also cover a wider range of HLA alleles to increase their utility in a broader spectrum of patients. Our objective is to create a multi-peptide vaccine simultaneously targeting the mutant and wild-type (WT) regions of human KRAS protein.<br \/>Methods: By selecting MHC II hotspots via multiple epitope prediction algorithms, we designed and synthesized 8 long peptides with lengths between 25 to 30mers. One of them harboured a G12D mutation, while the others covered the WT regions of KRAS. In addition, the corresponding <i>k<\/i><i>eyhole limpet hemocyanin (<\/i>KLH) conjugated peptides were also generated. We first demonstrated their immunogenicity in mouse <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Different combinations of peptides adjuvanted with either CpG oligodeoxynucleotide + aluminum (CpG+alum) or complete\/incomplete Freud&#8217;s adjuvant (CFA\/IFA) were immunized into Balb\/c mice before determining the immune response by mouse interferon &#947; (mIFN&#947;) ELISPOT assay. Subsequently, an <i>in vivo<\/i> prophylactic anti-tumor study was conducted by immunizing this multi-peptide vaccine in Balb\/c mice and observing the growth inhibition of the CT26-derived tumors.<br \/>Results: T cell responses were observed in two peptide mixes with or without G12D mutation, suggesting that both mutant-harbouring peptide and WT peptides were immunogenic. We showed that KLH-conjugated peptides and CpG+alum elicited stronger immune responses than the naked peptides and CFA\/IFA respectively. Furthermore, peptide mapping showed that the G12D mutant-harbouring peptide and two other WT peptides may contribute to the overall T cell response in the Balb\/c mouse. In the prophylactic anti-tumor study (n = 10), immunization of KRAS naked peptide and KLH-conjugated peptide vaccines significantly inhibited tumor growth by 51.2% (****p &#60; 0.0001) and 44.7% (***p &#60; 0.001) respectively, compared to control. Subsequent mIFN&#947; ELISPOT assay showed that the tumor inhibitory effect was attributed to the activation of antigen-specific T cell response of the vaccines.<br \/>Conclusion: Our multi-peptide vaccines targeting both the mutant and WT regions of KRAS could generate KRAS-specific T cell responses and elicit significant anti-tumor effect in mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Peptides,Immunotherapy,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Mutations in the KRAS gene (i.e., codon 12 or 13) are frequently associated with the development and progression of cancer, particularly lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Recently, it has been captured that KRAS targeting cancer vaccine research and clinical trials have been conducted in certain tumor types and vaccine approaches are encouraged to move forward. It has been well known that the tumor-eradicating efficacy of cancer vaccines arises from Th1 epitope selection. While tumor growth may persist after immunization with non-selected epitopes (including full-length), immunization with a highly selected Th1-specific epitope vaccine can lead to tumor regression by suppressing the activation of immune inhibitory cells. The Th-Vac&#174; discovery platform uses a combination of in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo studies to precisely identify Th1-specific epitopes. It consists of two modules: module 1 (in-silico) and module 2 (in-vitro and efficacy evaluation). The aim is to identify MHC class II epitopes that are specific to antigens for CD4+ T cells, displaying the most favorable binding affinity across diverse alleles. Th1-specific epitope vaccines aim to boost and sustain T cell immunity against tumor antigens, overcoming the lack of a precise T cell response or pre-existing tolerance in the immunosuppressive TME. This study aimed to explore Th1-specific epitopes for KRAS vaccine to be potentially effective in numerous KRAS mutation-driven cancers.<br \/><b><i>Methods<\/i><\/b> Peptide sequence candidates that have highly potential of MHC class II binding affinity were comprehensively predicted via a module 1 (ASEP program). All of peptides selected in ASEP were synthesized as 15 mers. Each peptide was evaluated for immunogenicity using ELISpot and\/or FACS analysis in module 2 (2a for in vitro and 2b for in vivo immunologic evaluation) of the Th-Vac&#174; discovery platform. Specifically, in Module 2b, immunogenicity was evaluated using a 38-mer peptide formed by combining five overlapping peptides selected in 2a. These kinds of immunogenicity evaluations were conducted using type 1 and\/or type 2 cytokine(s) produced by CD4+ T cells.<br \/><b><i>Results<\/i><\/b> In ASEP prediction, twelve peptides were selected as potential candidates demonstrating a high affinity to MHC class II, which were in different lesions of common mutation of KRAS. In module 2 using ELISpot and FACS analysis, two epitopes (non-mutated sequences) were finally selected as Th1-specific epitopes based on the type 1 T cell response.<br \/><b><i>Conclusion<\/i><\/b> Unlike previous vaccines using mutant lesions, in this study, two non-mutated Th1-specific epitopes are under the in-vivo efficacy studies as mono and combining regimen(s) in certain tumor types. Additionally, the Th-Vac<sup>&#174; <\/sup>platform was fully validated in terms of the performance and its application would be expanded beyond a cancer vaccine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Vaccines,KRAS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.
