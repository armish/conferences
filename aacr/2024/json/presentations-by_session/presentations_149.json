The mitochondria form highly organized networks, in which their outer and inner membrane structures define their bioenergetic capacity. However, <i>in vivo<\/i> studies delineating the relationship between the structural organization of mitochondrial networks and their bioenergetic activity have been limited. Here we present an <i>in vivo<\/i> structural and functional profiling of mitochondrial networks and bioenergetic phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using an integrated platform comprised of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, respirometry and 3-dimensional scanning block-face electron microscopy (3D SBEM). Interestingly, the diverse bioenergetic phenotypes and metabolic dependencies we identified in NSCLC tumors align with distinct structural organization of mitochondrial networks present. Further, we discovered that mitochondrial networks are organized into distinct compartments within tumor cells. In tumors with high rates of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS<sup>HI<\/sup>) and fatty acid oxidation we identified peri-droplet mitochondrial networks wherein mitochondria contact and surround lipid droplets. In contrast, we discovered that in tumors with low rates of OXPHOS (OXPHOS<sup>LO<\/sup>), high glucose flux regulated i) peri-nuclear localization of mitochondria, ii) structural remodeling of cristae and iii) mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Our findings suggest that in NSCLC, mitochondrial networks are compartmentalized into distinct subpopulations that govern the bioenergetic capacity of tumors. Structure-and-function studies defining the relationship between mitochondrial architecture and metabolic dependencies may hold promise as strategies to profile metabolic liabilities unique to lung cancer subtypes. We anticipate that coupling PET imaging with 3D SBEM will have dynamic applications beyond that of lung cancer and enrich our understanding of how mitochondrial bioenergetics impact human disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-07 Imaging tumor metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Mitochondria,Imaging,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David B.
