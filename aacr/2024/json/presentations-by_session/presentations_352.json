[{"Abstract":"In this study, we describe both the individual and the cooperative mechanisms by which CD169<sup>+ <\/sup>macrophages (MP) and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells support an anti-tumor immune response against breast cancer tumors. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women of all ages each year, thus a deeper understanding of the molecular determinants that promote tumor development and suppress the anti-tumor immune response is still greatly needed. Here we use high dimensional flow cytometry, functional assays, and new mouse models to investigate the MP - T cell anti-tumor partnership. With our collaborators, we developed a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer by genetically engineering mammary stem cells to harbor three cancer driver mutations that are frequently associated in human patients: functional loss of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and mixed-lineage leukemia protein 3, and constitutive activation of the PI3 kinase. To characterize the immune cells in this tumor model, we developed a powerful 30-color high dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel to track and phenotype most known immune cell subsets. We found that CD169<sup>+<\/sup> MP rapidly infiltrated and outnumbered all other populations during tumor growth, suggesting that they play an important role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Surprisingly, although current literature describes breast cancer MP to be highly immunosuppressive, our phenotypic analysis showed only low expression of the pro-tumor MP markers TREM2 and CD206, but extremely high expression of the anti-tumor markers FOLR2 and CD64. To further investigate if these MP promoted or prevented tumor growth, we selectively depleted CD169<sup>+<\/sup> MP in tumor-bearing mice and observed significantly accelerated tumor growth compared to the non-depleted control group, suggesting that these MP promoted anti-tumor responses. MP depletion also affected tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, which produced lower effector functions (e.g., secretion of IFN&#947;, CCL3, TNF), indicating that MP may also boost anti-tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses. To further test if CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells control tumor growth, we depleted either CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>or CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in tumor-bearing mice and observed that only CD8<sup>+<\/sup> but not CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell depletion accelerated tumor growth compared to the control group. MP have been documented to provide type I IFN signals to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells via the triggering of the STING pathway. To explore this mechanism in our model, we created a CD169<sup>cre<\/sup>STING<sup>flox\/KO<\/sup> mouse in which MP lack functional STING. Tumors in these mice grew much faster compared to those in the control group, consistent with the hypothesis that STING sensing occurs in tumor MP and promotes anti-tumor effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses. Overall, our data provide evidence for an unexpected anti-tumor role for CD169<sup>+<\/sup> MP in breast tumors, presumably through enhancing anti-tumor effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,T cell,Breast cancer,Flow cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Our aim is to provide a relevant humanized mouse model as a precious tool to evaluate innovated treatments to cure AML.<br \/>Methods: Mice were humanized with CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to reconstitute a complete human immune system. Three AML cell lines, namely OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3 and MOLM-14, all expressing mCherry and luciferase, were intravenously engrafted at different doses in non-humanized and CD34-humanized mice. Tumor proliferation was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) thanks to luciferase expression on tumor cells. Their expression of mCherry was also exploited to determine the presence of tumor cells in blood and tissues using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: All AML cell lines engrafted in mice, but we observed different growth kinetics and homogeneity depending on the humanization of mice and the dose injected. Indeed, tumor grew more slowly and heterogeneously in humanized mice, which underlines the role of human immune cells reconstituted in mice. This was improved by increasing the number of tumor cells injected. Tumor cells were found in femurs, spleen, kidneys, ovary, lungs, and uterus depending on the cell line. Mice survival was also highly affected by the tumor cell line engrafted. We observed that MOLM14 was the most aggressive model, while OCI-AML3 reached a steady state and were tolerated by mice over a long period.<br \/>Conclusion: We established 3 different AML cell lines in a model of humanized mice which nicely recapitulates the growth of tumor cells in target organs. These 3 models behave differently in terms of growth kinetic, tolerability by mice, and organs infiltrated, which gives plenty of opportunities to evaluate novel therapies designed to cure AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Mouse models,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

We have previously demonstrated that a high density of CD103<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in human lung tumors is a biomarker of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. However, a large fraction of human tumors is only weakly infiltrated by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells, and the reason of this T<sub>RM<\/sub> desert is not explained. Therefore, defining the molecular signals that give rise and maintain T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the mechanisms that potentiate antitumor T<sub>RM<\/sub> functions are important challenges. Data obtained in pre-clinical mouse colorectal cancer and melanoma models demonstrate that knocking-out CD103 impairs antitumor T-cell immunity and response to ICB and therapeutic peptide vaccine. Moreover, immunization of melanoma-bearing mice with the cancer vaccine results in a dramatic decrease in the percentage of CD103<sup>+<\/sup> T<sub>RM<\/sub> cells among CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL). Algorithm analyses applied to spectral cytometry data of TIL support the conclusion that upon activation with the peptide vaccine a T<sub>RM<\/sub> subset gives rise to tumor-specific effector T cells.

Mass cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical staining were performed using peripheral blood, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and lymph node T cells. These studies were approved by the IRB of Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, and all patients gave written consent.<br \/>Results: Unlike classical Th1, which highly expresses <i>PRF1<\/i>, <i>GZMB<\/i>, <i>GNLY<\/i>, and <i>NKG7<\/i>, Th7R expressed <i>LT&#946;<\/i>, <i>CXCR6<\/i>, <i>CTLA-4<\/i>, <i>CD28<\/i>, and <i>CXCL13<\/i>. Analysis of HEV index (MECA79<sup>+<\/sup> \/CD31<sup>+<\/sup> vessels) by MECA79 and CD31 staining of tumor tissues showed that Th7R in peripheral blood correlated with tumor tissue HEV index, suggesting that LT&#946; and CXCL13 expressed by Th7R are involved in HEV formation.Th1 mainly expressed PD-1 and did not express CTLA-4, whereas Th7R expressed both PD-1 and CTLA-4. When pre-treatment peripheral Th7R quartile was used to analyze OS after Ipilimumab + Nivolumab treatment, both the top 25% and intermediate 50% patients showed favorable prognosis, but the lower 25% had significantly poor OS. In contrast, only the top 25% Th7R patients but not the intermediate 50% and lower 25% patients who were treated with Pembrolizumab had favorable OS. Thus, it is likely that the Th7R intermediate 50% patients required anti-CTLA-4 therapy to achieve antitumor immune responses. These results may be useful for stratification of patients requiring anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy as well as for predicting the therapeutic response of Ipilimumab + Nivolumab.<br \/>Conclusion: Th7R exhibits LT&#946; and CXCL13 expression, which is absent in classical Th1, and may help maintain sustained T-cell immunity through HEV\/TLS formation. Th7R may be a biomarker to select the patients who benefit from anti-CTLA-4 treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Th1-like CD4,PD-1,CTLA-4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

However, the clinical efficacy of anti-PD therapy in DLBCL remains obscure. The marginal response to anti-PD therapy in DLBCL indicates that different mechanisms of immune evasion other than the PD-1&#173;\/&#173;PD-L1 pathway may be present. To investigate the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD therapy in DLBCL, we assessed gene expression in patients with DLBCL in public database. Accordingly, we found indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a key enzyme responsible for tryptophan catabolism, is highly expressed in DLBCL. IDO1 expression is upregulated by IFN-gamma produced by T cells in tumor microenvironments (TMEs) of various cancer types. Upregulated IDO1 leads to the production of kynurenine, which creates an immunosuppressive TMEs. However, it remains unknown whether IDO1 induces immune evasion in DLBCL and if so, which subsets of IDO1 expressing cells are responsible for immune evasion in DLBCL. To address these questions, we first determined the intrinsic role of IDO1 in lymphoma cells. We knocked down IDO1 expression (IDO1 KD) in a human DLBCL RC-K8 cell line using short hairpin RNA. We observed decreased cell proliferation in IDO KD lymphoma cells compared with control cells. We also found increased susceptibility to apoptosis in IDO1 KD RC-K8 cells compared with IDO1 WT control, when these were co-cultured with THP-1-derived macrophages or activated Jurkat T lymphocytes. These data suggest that lymphoma IDO1 has an intrinsic role of lymphoma progression and makes lymphoma sensitive to cytotoxic immune cells. To validate the anti-tumor effect of IDO1 deficiency in immune cells, we assessed EL4 lymphoma growth and immune TME of lymphoma in syngeneic wild type (WT) and <i>Ido1<\/i> knock-out (KO) mice. The growth of EL4 lymphoma tumor was significantly suppressed in <i>Ido1<\/i> KO mice compared to WT mice (<i>Ido1<\/i> KO: 621.9mm<sup>3<\/sup> vs WT: 1228mm<sup>3<\/sup>, N=22, P&#60;0.001). Immune TME assessment revealed a decreased frequency of regulatory T cells, yet, the increased proportions of B cells, MHC II+ antigen-presenting cells, monocytes, and NK cells in <i>Ido1<\/i> KO tumors compared with WT control. In summary, IDO1 is highly expressed in DLBCL. IDO1 up-regulation may drive lymphoma progression both intrinsically and extrinsically (immune evasion). This data suggests that IDO1 overexpression may be one of the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD therapy. We will extend our studies to determine a combination effect of IDO1 inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD therapy in DLBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Tumor microenvironment,IDO1,Immune evasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Despite evidence for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration and cytolytic activity within immunotherapy-responsive tumors, partial responses and acquired resistance are common, indicating additional barriers for complete tumor elimination. We report a survival program engaged within residual cancer cells exposed to weeks of activated CTLs. Contrary to immune-evasion mechanisms, we observe a residual antigenic cancer cell subpopulation which activates CTLs, survives within IFN&#947;-high environments, and withstands CTL-induced apoptosis. This cancer survival program, termed immune-induced persistence, is reversibly-driven (non-genetic) and prevents the complete CTL-mediated elimination of cancer cell populations by supporting the survival of quiescent cancer &#8216;persister&#8217; cells against activated CTL attack. Persister cells display sublethal caspase activity and caspase-dependent DNA damage, consistent with CTL-induced genomic instability, and depend on the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins for survival. Notably, immune-induced persistence presents a markedly distinct survival program than drug-induced persistence, including distinctive apoptotic profiles, stress response pathways, and vulnerabilities. Thus, cancer cell populations can transiently adopt non-redundant survival programs in response to various cytotoxic environments. Features of immune-induced persistence are observed within CTL-treated human cancer cell lines, immune-treated human tumor slice cultures, and intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity programs. Under continued CTL exposure, persistent cancer populations give rise to genetically distinct cancer clones, including stably resistant immune escape variants, modeling acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapies. We propose sublethal interactions between effector immune cells and cancer persister cells as a critical and targetable variable at the interface between activated immunity and cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Resistance,Apoptosis,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

ATLL has the worst overall survival among peripheral T cell lymphomas and remains a fatal disease despite efforts to improve outcomes over the last 35 years. First-line combination chemotherapy rarely achieves a durable response and two immune-modulating treatments (&#945;-CCR4 and &#945;-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies) failed in clinical trials. These findings highlight an urgent need to improve our understanding of the functional state of host immunity in ATLL patients. A host immune response against HTLV1 is pivotal in preventing ATLL development. Malignant ATLL cells can escape immune surveillance by preventing antigen presentation and engaging immune checkpoints. The prospect of an ATLL clone inducing systemic suppression was suggested in the literature but has not been directly examined. Furthermore, HTLV1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role during viral latency, yet it remains unknown if they play a clinically relevant role during ATLL treatment.<br \/>Methodology: In this work, we hypothesized that malignant ATLL cells will exhibit a suppressive immune phenotype and that effective therapeutic interventions will augment anti-ATLL CTLs to promote durable remission. We implemented an immune profiling approach to analyze PBMC samples from ATLL patients. Specifically, we developed a powerful 30-marker spectral flow panel to discriminate malignant ATLL cells from non-transformed lymphocytes (T, B, and NK cells) and monitor the expression of key transcription factors and markers associated with proliferation, cytolysis, and exhaustion. We analyzed diagnostic samples from the Montefiore-Einstein ATLL Biobank and samples collected during a phase 2 clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy of a promising Belinostat\/Zidovudine\/Interferon-&#945; combination therapy against ATLL (NCT02737046).<br \/>Results: Our findings reveal that malignant ATLL cells exhibit an immune phenotype associated with robust immunosuppression and yet distinct from other suppressive immune cells (i.e., regulatory T cells). Additionally, we discovered that ATLL patient samples contained a unique population of phenotypically exhausted CD8+ T cells, the proportion of which was drastically reduced in patients under remission. Remarkably, a decrease in this exhausted subset correlated with the expansion of highly cytolytic CD8+ CTLs.<br \/>Conclusion: Altogether, our findings suggest that ATLL cells may drive CD8+ CTLs into exhaustion to achieve immune evasion and that a robust anti-ATLL CTL response actively contributes to a remission state.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T cell,Leukemias,Immune response,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Since CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells express activating NK receptors (NKRs) and NKR ligands are commonly expressed by cancer cells but not healthy tissues, we evaluated the crosstalk between NKRs and TCR during recognition of cancer cells by DC-primed TAA-specific CTLs.<br \/>Methods: Associations between DNAM-1, NKG2D, CTL markers, and patients&#8217; survival was analyzed using TCGA. <i>In vitro<\/i> sensitization was used to induce human TAA-specific CTLs by TAA-loaded DCs. The roles of DNAM-1 and NKG2D in CTL recognition and killing were tested using IFN-&#947; ELISpot, conjugate formation, degranulation, and cytotoxicity assays. The mechanisms and molecular effects of NKR-mediated costimulation were analyzed using IsoPlexis, calcium flux, western blot, and RNA sequencing. Double-transduction of T cells with TCR and NKR constructs or pre-treatment of cancer cells by chemotherapy was used to manipulate the levels of NKRs on T cells or their ligands on cancer cells.<br \/>Results: TCGA analysis revealed that DNAM-1 and NKG2D are strongly associated with intratumoral CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells rather than NK cells, being critical for the long-term survival of melanoma patients. Human DC-primed CTLs significantly upregulated DNAM-1 and NKG2D compared to na&#239;ve CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, but retained strict dependence on TCR in cancer cell recognition. Unexpectedly, blockade of DNAM-1 and NKG2D prevented the TCR-mediated CTL recognition and killing of cancer cells expressing low-TAA levels, but were redundant in the recognition of high-TAA-expressing cancer cells. DNAM-1, and to a lesser extent NKG2D, lowered TCR activation threshold and enhanced proximal TCR signaling and CTL polyfunctionality. NKR overexpression in TCR-transgenic T cells or chemotherapy-driven elevation of NKR ligands on cancer cells allowed effective recognition and killing of weakly immunogenic cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Reduced TCR activation threshold in the presence of NKR costimulation enables CTL activation by low levels of cognate MHC I-peptide complexes on cancer cells. Our data helps explain the ability of non-mutated &#8220;self&#8221; antigens to mediate tumor rejection in the absence of autoimmunity, and provides new tools to enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,TCR signaling,Costimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Thus HPK1 is an attractive immuno-oncology target in many tumor types. Here, we report ISM9182A as a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of HPK1.ISM9182A demonstrated nanomolar enzymatic potency against HPK1 with &#62;100-fold selectivity against other MAP4K family kinases. ISM9182A inhibited the phosphorylation of SLP-76 at Ser376 dose-dependently with an IC50 of 30nM in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, ISM9182A enhanced IL-2 and IFN&#947; secretion upon CD3\/CD28 co-stimulation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting T cell proliferation. Treatment of human pan T cells with ISM9182A also significantly reversed PGE2-mediated immunosuppression of human pan T cell activation and further boosted IL-2 and IFN&#947; secretion compared to CD3\/CD28 co-stimulation. In monocyte-derived DCs stimulated with TNF-&#945;\/IL-1&#946;\/PGE-2, ISM9182A significantly upregulated CD80, CD86, and CD83 expression, demonstrating its potency to promote DC maturation. ISM9182A showed no obvious toxicity towards human T cell, B cells, and monocytes without CD3\/CD28 co-stimulation. <i>In vivo<\/i> PK data revealed favorable ADME properties and good oral bioavailability of ISM9182A across different species. In a CT-26 murine syngeneic mouse model, oral administration of ISM9182A exhibited potent antitumor effects with p-SLP76 inhibition in both murine spleen and tumor, without body weight loss.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs) are key determinants of anti-tumor immunity by secretion of cytotoxic granules, such as granzymes and perforin, and effector cytokines, such as TNFa and IFNg. A deep understanding of how CD8+ TILs eliminate cancer cells will help identify resistance mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we demonstrate that TILs eliminated matched melanoma cells in a time and dose-dependent manner but in a class I HLA-independent fashion. Specifically, blocking class I HLA-TCR interaction either by the deletion of B2M (resulting in loss of class I HLA surface expression) or TCR genes did not alter the activity of these TILs. We further confirmed that TIL-mediated killing is contact-dependent. After excluding the potential roles of CD1d and MR1-restrictive T cells, gamma&nbsp;delta T cells, and NKG2D in TIL-mediated killing, a whole-genome CRISPR\/Cas9 screen was performed in cancer cells. We identified that genes involved in JAK-STAT and cell-extrinsic apoptosis pathways are necessary for TIL-mediated killing. Together, these findings demonstrate that expanded CD8 TILs from melanoma patients are capable of eliminating melanoma cells via a novel, class I MHC-independent mechanism by coactivation of both JAK-STAT and cell-extrinsic apoptosis pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Resistance,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

We aimed to understand this cancer resistance mechanism linked to AD and exploit it for broader cancer therapies. A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neuronal mitochondria, inhibiting mitophagy, abrogating the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, and contributing to AD pathology. In addition to neurons, mitophagy plays an important role in T-cells, where excessive ceramide-dependent mitophagy in aging T-cells inhibits their energy metabolism and limits their anti-tumor functions. Thus, attenuation of ceramide-dependent mitophagy plays a favorable role in enhancing aging T-cell anti-tumor function. Given that APP is also processed in T-cells, we hypothesized that APP accumulates aberrantly in aging Alzheimer&#8217;s T-cells, inhibiting mitophagy and enhancing T-cell anti-tumor activity. Employing techniques of lipidomics, metabolomics, imaging, molecular biology, and genetic models, we show that AD T-cells from a mouse model and human patients are protected against aging-associated ceramide-dependent mitophagy, which enhanced their secretion of inflammatory anti-tumor cytokines. The excessive localization of APP to the T-cell mitochondria, where it inhibits the accumulation of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) and C14\/C16-ceramides, attenuated the levels of mitophagy and protected the Alzheimer&#8217;s T-cells from metabolic defects observed in aging, namely protecting against the exhaustion of fumarate pools. Both in vitro and in vivo re-supplementation of fumarate to aging WT mouse T-cells effectively rescued their viability, cytokine production, and tumor killing capacity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and in adoptive T-cell transfers to mice with melanoma, functionally mimicking the AD phenotype. The fumarate supplementation also led to a decrease in ceramide-dependent mitophagy in the WT aging T-cells, indicating an interplay between ceramide-dependent mitophagy and fumarate metabolism which contributes to the protection of the anti-tumor function in aging AD T-cells. Moreover, we show that Alzheimer&#8217;s mice that express APP in the brain and T-cells, but not AD mice that express APP only in the brain, are protected against the growth of both carcinogen-induced and allografted tumors. Finally, transfer of mitochondria from AD T-cells to aging WT T-cells improved their metabolic fitness and anti-cancer functions. In summary, we show that AD-associated APP improves anti-tumor immunity of aging T-cells by inhibiting ceramide-mediated lethal mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial fumarate metabolism. These data provide a novel mechanism to explain reduced cancer incidences in AD patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Mitochondria,T cell,Ceramide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

A high frequency of TR+ CD8 T cells were found in the liver in mice with intrahepatic tumors. Despite ~70% of CD8 T cells being tumor reactive in intrahepatic tumors, liver tumor growth kinetics were faster than subcutaneous tumors. Higher proportion of the TR+ CD8 T cells were found to be exhausted in the liver tumor by flow cytometry. Functional depletion of the CD8 T cells caused a fivefold higher tumor growth in the subcutaneous model but in contrast had no effect on intrahepatic tumors. In conclusion, despite the high frequency of &#8220;killer&#8221; tumor reactive T cells in the liver, the growth kinetics of the liver tumors, flow cytometry as well as functional studies demonstrate the impairment of TR+ CD8 T cells in the liver. We aim to dissect the mechanisms mediating intrahepatic TR CD8+ T cell exhaustion in primary liver tumors as well as metastatic models. Additionally, we aim to determine significant costimulatory molecules specific to intrahepatic exhaustion which could lead to better therapeutic models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor antigen,Liver cancer,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, there have been limited studies on the independent role that progesterone and its receptor, the progesterone receptor (PR), play in the development of breast cancer. Studies in the Hagan lab have shown that progesterone signaling promotes mammary tumor growth and changes the immune landscape of the mammary gland towards immunosuppression. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are immune cells known to promote immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The data from our lab shows that among hormone receptor positive breast cancers, higher levels of PR expression correlates to higher levels of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. To determine if progesterone signaling increases the number of Tregs in the tumor-bearing mammary gland, we used a syngeneic orthotopic murine tumor model, E0771 cells, engineered to express mouse PR or control empty vector. Mice were treated with progesterone or placebo for 7 days before implantation of the modified E0771 cells. The results of this study show that progesterone promoted tumor growth, and flow cytometry analysis at tumor endpoint showed that PR-positive tumors treated with progesterone harbored more Tregs than mice treated with placebo. Additionally, initial studies using flow cytometry and RNA-seq indicate increased Treg activity following progesterone treatment in PR+ tumor-bearing mice. As progesterone treatment promoted tumor growth and Treg recruitment in progesterone receptor-positive tumors, these data imply that progesterone treatment may promote the release of secreted factors impacting the immune cells in the mammary microenvironment. To determine if progesterone treatment results in cytokine or chemokine changes that may affect Treg recruitment, cytokine arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed using cell culture supernatant from murine mammary tumor cells expressing progesterone receptor (E0771-PR) treated with progesterone (0-72 hours). E0771-PR cells treated with progesterone showed higher levels of cytokines and chemokines that have been linked to Treg recruitment and differentiation, such as MCSF. Our findings demonstrate that progesterone signaling promotes an immune suppressed microenvironment in the mammary gland through an increase in Tregs. This evidence provides rationale to investigate the use of anti-progestins as a mechanism to overcome the immune-cold tumor microenvironment seen in progesterone receptor positive breast tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Breast cancer,Progesterone,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

However, only a subset of patients benefits from ICB therapy due to various immunosuppressive mechanisms. The development of personalized predictive models for the anti-tumor immune response is essential to broaden the indication of ICB therapy. Here, we suggest a novel model platform using a co-culture system with patient tumor-derived organoids and matched immune cells to predict the immune response of individual patients. We successfully established fifty-nine cases of patient-derived breast cancer organoids with matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (subtype: Luminal A, 18.6%; Luminal B, 28.8%; Triple-negative breast cancer, 35.6%; HER2-positive, 17.0%). Three rapidly proliferating organoids (one Luminal B and two TNBC organoids) were selected to develop an immune-organoid co-culture (IOC) system. To mimic the anti-tumor immune response, cytotoxic immune cells were expanded from PBMCs by modified cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell expansion protocol utilizing IL-2\/IL-15. The CIK cells were co-cultured with patient-derived tumor organoids for killing assay to enable the prediction of ICB responsiveness <i>in vitro<\/i>. The CIK cells were expanded in the IOC system by stimulation of PBMC with IL-2\/IL-15 in the presence of matched tumor organoids for 11 to 14 days. The CIK cells exhibited tumor organoid-specific killing (measured by Caspase-3, 15.22% &#177; 8.58, mean &#177; SEM) on organoid co-culture and showed induction of CD107a and CD137 expression in CD8+ T cells and NK cells with the PD-1 blocking antibody. The CIK-mediated tumor organoid deaths and immune cell activation were reduced by HLA class I blocking antibody (W6\/32) treatment, confirming HLA-TCR mediated immune response and killing of tumor organoids in the IOC system (-14.85% in organoid-specific lysis and -7.46% in CD107a expression). In the live cell imaging of the IOC system, the interaction between T cells and tumor organoid cells and subsequent induction of Caspase 3 was noted. Our IOC system could directly measure the immunogenic tumor organoid killing by immune cells on ICB treatment in individual breast cancer patients. Moreover, the analysis of immune receptor profiles may reveal immune modulating mechanisms in each patient. We expect the IOC system to serve as a useful platform for personalized immunotherapy and exploration of combinatory therapy to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of ICB in breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Immune-Organoid,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.-H.

To decode tumor-infiltrating B cells, we generated the B cell blueprint encompassing single-cell transcriptome, BCR repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data across 20 cancer types (483 samples, 266 patients). Strikingly, B cells harbored extraordinary heterogeneity and composed of 15 subsets, which were grouped into two independent developmental paths (extra-follicular [EF] versus germinal-center [GC]) exhibiting organ preference. Of note, colon adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are the two representative types of cancer enriched for GC and EF pathways, respectively. We affirm that EF-dominant cancers correlate with dysregulated immune responses and worse clinical outcomes. We then identify the dynamic metabolic-epigenetic-signaling networks in fine-tuning tumor-infiltrating B cell differentiation and managing the balance between the EF and GC pathways. Atypical memory (AtM) B cells, the primary progenitors of EF-derived ASCs, exhibit an exhausted and bystander phenotype and develop independently of the GC pathway. We find that the AtM B cells reside in the center of immature TLSs and spatially relocate to the periphery during TLS maturation. Finally, we mechanistically link these findings to specific transcription factors and epigenomic regulations. We demonstrate that the glutamine-derived metabolite &#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;KG) could increase the expression of AtM B cell associated transcription factors Tbet and BATF and promote their differentiation, accompanied by the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Consequently, AtM B cells acquire an immunoregulatory function that dampens anti-tumor T cell responses and fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Pan-cancer,Metabolism-epigenetics crosstalk,Extra-follicular response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The advances in vaccines against HBV and HCV have led to a decrease in the number of virus-related cases; however, the obesity epidemic has contributed to a drastic increase in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) related HCC cases (e.g., obesity and type 2 diabetes induced HCC). Considering this trend, we aim to understand how lifestyle choices, like food composition, in combination with alcohol consumption at a &#8220;social drinking level&#8221; impacts host metabolism, and subsequently the development of MASH-induced HCC. We hypothesize that the impact of dietary composition on dysbiosis and immune cells, particularly adaptive immune cell metabolic status, will drive the phenotype. We have developed a MASH-induced HCC murine model, with long-term dietary intervention including seven different customized diets: normal chow (NC), ketogenic, solid high fat diet (sHFD), or isocaloric liquid Lieber DeCarli Diets (LDC): high fat\/low carb (HF), high fat\/low carb with ethanol (HF-EtOH), low fat\/high carb (LF), and low fat\/high carb with ethanol (LF-EtOH). Mice began special diet in late adolescences and disease progression was monitored over the course of a year, where mice developed HCC. Our model allowed for a comprehensive understanding of MASH-induced HCC where disease initiation could be studied beyond known contributors like obesity or body mass index (BMI). The animal model was analyzed comprehensively with high-parameter flow cytometry (FC), 16S sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, scRNA\/ATAC-seq, and WGS. Long-term diet intervention led to macronutrient specific microbiota dysregulation, alterations in systemic metabolism and suppression of adaptive immune response, consequently impacting the progression of HCC. Customized dietary interventions showed a specific phenotype regarding HCC development and progression with distinct mutational genotype and particular response to immunotherapy. T and B cell subpopulation deficiency had a significant impact on MASH-induced HCC development in a macronutrient composition dependent manner. In summary, each dietary intervention showed a distinct pattern and effect on dysbiosis, systemic metabolic reprograming, cellular transcriptomic and epigenetic alteration, and particularly immune cell effector function. Additionally, some compositions supported the immuno-escape mechanism of malignant cells through regulation of their MHC machinery. Collectively, these accumulated data construct an atlas for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to lifestyle-induced HCC providing the knowledge needed to advance effective strategies for treatment and prevention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Diet,Immuno-oncology,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"N.

High frequencies of infiltrating tumor-specific T cells have been linked to improved patient outcomes, which highlights the importance of uncovering how therapeutics can enhance their function. To explore this functionality in a preclinical setting it is critical to have physiologically relevant models. Here, we demonstrate that common issues, such as low precursor frequencies and restricted HLA-types can be overcome via access to HLA-typed samples and use of expansion platforms which attain high numbers of antigen-specific T cells. Furthermore, we show how these systems enable vaccine immunogenicity screening and assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Healthy blood donations were screened for HLA type and antigen-specific T cells were expanded by either co-culture with peptide-pulsed dendritic cells or polyclonal stimulation following multimer enrichment and FACS sorting. Following expansion, the large number of antigen-specific T cells generated enabled the T cells to be assessed via phenotyping, cytokine secretion, or functional killing assays in a 2D or 3D tumor setting. Tumor targets with either 1) endogenous antigen expression, 2) antigen introduced via lentiviral overexpression or 3) peptide loading of MHC class I were utilized. Validated readouts for measuring antigen-specific killing included flow cytometry and time-lapse imaging (IncuCyte), alongside quantification of antigen-specific IFN&#611; responses by ELISpot. These pre-clinical platforms represent a suite of physiologically relevant T cell assays which can be used to perform candidate selection in tumor associated antigen\/neoantigen vaccine drug development programs, pharmacological inhibition of checkpoint pathways, or co-stimulatory agonist discovery. In combinatorial approaches with radio- or chemotherapy, the development of novel immunotherapies offers hope to many patients with treatment-resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Vaccines,Immunotherapy,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

However, these assays are more complicated to run and require expensive reagents and limited sequencing throughput when compared to bulk immune receptor profiling methods.<br \/>Here, we describe a low-throughput, single-cell immune profiling strategy using sorted cells in 96-well plates. The plate is pre-aliquoted with either T-cell receptor (TCR) &#593;\/&#946; or TCR &#947;\/&#948; primers along with 30 crucial T-cell markers. We perform multiplex RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the CDR3 regions. The resulting data provides the abundant clonotype counts along with the chain pairing information for these &#593;\/&#946; and &#947;\/&#948; chains, together with the T-cell subtype information using gene-expression profiles. By analyzing the TCR gene rearrangement at the single-cell level, researchers can better understand T cell development, proliferation, and clonality, which are crucial for studying diseases such as cancer, immunodeficiency, and autoimmunity. Furthermore, single-cell TCR sequencing when combined with RNA sequencing datasets, facilitates the identification of &#947;&#948; T cells. This method provides a standardized tool for identifying potential &#947;&#948; T cell-based cancer immunotherapies. The technology's cost-effectiveness and ability to analyze clonotypes and immunophenotypes of cells in a single assay make it a valuable tool for unraveling the immune dynamics in various diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immune response,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This study aimed to understand how CT and RT change the local immune microenvironment of the tumor and the regional immune response in draining lymph nodes. Evaluations were performed on lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) with a special focus on tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and lymph follicles.<br \/>A cohort of 21 untreated LUSC (naiveLUSC) and 21 matched neoadjuvantly treated LUSC (neoLUSC) was compiled. Digitized H&#38;E whole slide images of the tumor and of two representative probes of a proximal and distal lymph node were assessed. A pathologist blinded to the groups assigned tumors to one of three immunophenotypes (inflamed, excluded, desert) by visual analysis. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in the tumor area and lymph follicles in the regional lymph nodes were counted and characterized according to their maturation status (with\/without germinal center). RNAseq analyses were performed for a subset of tumors.<br \/>NeoLUSC tended to more frequently have a desert immune phenotype (6\/21 versus 1\/21, p=0.0931). The mean number of TLS was significantly reduced in neoLUSC compared to naiveLUSC (4 versus 9, p=0.0179). Additionally, neoLUSC had a significantly lower likelihood for the presence of mature TLS with germinal centers (3\/21 versus 9\/21, p=0.0327). While the mean number of lymph follicles in regional lymph nodes was comparable between neoLUSC and naiveLUSC, neoLUSC had a significantly reduced number of mature lymph follicles (20% versus 41% of lymph follicles, p=0.0376) in distant lymph nodes and showed a similar, but less pronounced trend in proximal lymph nodes. In general, the amount of TLS correlated with the amount of lymph follicles in naiveLUSC patients (p=0.0154), but not in neoLUSC patients. Across the complete cohort, long-term survivors (&#62;2 years) tended to have higher numbers of lymph follicles in lymph nodes than short term survivors (1.6 versus 1.1 lymph follicles\/mm2, p=0.0805). RNAseq analysis revealed a significant upregulation of inflammatory gene sets and downregulation of cell cycle associated gene sets in neoLUSC as compared to naiveLUSC.<br \/>This study demonstrates that CT and RT are potent, but multimodal influencers of the local tumor immune microenvironment as well as the regional immune response of the draining lymph nodes. While gene expression results underline the inflammation promoting effect of CT and RT, histological evaluations suggest that CT and RT negatively affect the adaptive anti-tumor immune response by reducing the development and maturation of TLS and lymph follicles in the lymph nodes. Next steps include an artificial intelligence based cell characterization and spatial evaluation of the tumor immune microenvironment to further unveil functional changes induced by CT and RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Lymph nodes,Immunomodulation,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

B cell-activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine belonging to the TNF ligand family that activates B cells and is linked to autoimmunity. Our preliminary research has identified BAFF as a target for enhancing antitumor immunity through enhancing presentation of tumor neoantigens and inducing tertiary lymphoid structures which can orchestrate tumor-specific T cell immune responses and correlate with improved clinical response. Since broad activation of B cell response could be detrimental and possibly induce autoimmune side effects, identification of specific B cell receptors that coordinate anti-tumor immunity is prudent. BAFF has three known receptors (BAFF-R, TACI and BCMA), and the effects of these specific BAFF ligand-receptor interactions on antitumor immunity are not known. Here we first generated BAFF-overexpressing cell lines using genomic editing [KPC-BAFF (pancreas), B16F10-BAFF (melanoma), and PancO2-BAFF (pancreas)] and examined their tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent host. Secondly, we investigated the effects of BAFF-overexpression on tumor response when individual receptors are knocked out using BAFF-R-KO, TACI-KO and BCMA-KO mice. Our results show significantly hindered tumor growth when the BAFF expressing stable cell lines are introduced to immunocompetent host, compared to parental cell lines. Tumor response experiments in receptor knockout mice is currently in progress. Successful identification of the BAFF receptor candidate that drives anti-tumor response is an exciting prospect for clinical translation. Development of agonists for the specific receptor may allow selective modulation of this particular B cell function in context of cancer therapy without perturbation of broad systemic humoral immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immuno-oncology,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, the exact effector molecules that are regulated by PD-1 signals in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have not been completely defined. Lack of this knowledge is a crucial problem in addressing how to overcome the low clinical response rate to ICI therapy. When exploring why certain patients not responding to ICI therapy, we found non-responders did not have an elevated NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells as responders to ICI therapy. The difference in NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells between non-responders and responders to anti-PD-1 therapy prompted us to investigate the potential role of PD-1 signaling in regulating NKG7 expression. To that end, we generated a CD8+ T cell-specific <i>Pdcd1<\/i> conditional knockout mice (CD8 E8ICre-<i>Pdcd1<\/i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>, also known as CD8-PD-1 cKO) where <i>Pdcd1<\/i> is deleted after thymic selection of single positive CD8+ T cells. We observed a delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival in CD8-PD-1 cKO mice compared to control mice after B16-OVA melanoma tumor challenge. On Day 12, when the CD8-PD-1 cKO mice demonstrated their ability to control tumor growth, we conducted single cell RNA sequencing on isolated tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells, revealing a significant increase of <i>Nkg7<\/i> expression in effector CD8+ T cells in the <i>Pdcd1<\/i> deficient CD8+ T cells compared to the control wild type T cells. <i>Pdcd1<\/i>-deficient effector CD8+ T cells also had increased expression of genes linked to NFAT\/Calcineurin signaling pathway including <i>Nfatc1<\/i>, <i>S100a4<\/i>, <i>Tbet<\/i> and <i>Tox, <\/i>suggesting <i>Nkg7<\/i> could be regulated by <i>Pdcd1<\/i> via the NFAT pathway. To determine the impact of increased NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells, we used OVA protein as a surrogate tumor antigen in vaccination. We found a complete B16-OVA tumor rejection in CD8-PD-1 cKO mice compared to control mice when tumor cells were injected on day 7 after vaccination with OVA protein and poly (I:C) (as an adjuvant), but only a partial rejection on day 21. The CD8-PD-1 cKO mice that were tumor-free for 30-40 days rejected 2<sup>nd <\/sup>tumor challenge with B16-OVA tumors. This long-term protection is tumor antigen (OVA) specific because these mice did not reject B16F10 tumor cells that do not express OVA antigen. We also found effector memory CD8+ T cells with high cytotoxicity increased in the spleen of CD8-PD-1 cKO mice after OVA antigen immunization compared to control. In conclusion, we found NKG7 is one of the effector molecules in <i>cytotoxic <\/i>CD8+ T cells, which can be regulated by PD-1 signals through NFAT signaling. Targeting the PD-1-NFAT pathway may be a new option to overcome low responses of T cells to ICI therapy in treatment of refractory cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,PD-1,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Many RCC patients have obesity at diagnosis and treatment initiation, and our lab has found that this significantly impairs immunotherapy outcomes. Both preclinical and clinical reports, from our lab and others, have demonstrated that obesity reduces the efficacy of CD8+ T cell-dependent immunotherapy by increasing pro-tumorigenic IL-1&#946;. Combining anti-PD-1 based therapy with anti-IL-1&#946; triggers the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and improves the efficacy of anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy. However, the mechanistic links between obesity and increased IL-1&#946; production remains unknown. Our objective is to identify mechanisms promoting IL-1 &#946;-driven immunosuppression within renal tumors of obese mice. In our <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, we utilized a BALB\/c mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and lean controls in combination with the Renca-Luc RCC cell line. Using flow cytometry and western blot, we respectively assessed leukocyte populations producing IL-1&#946; and tumor energetics. Flow cytometry revealed that intra-tumoral IL-1&#946; is produced primarily by tumor associated macrophages (TAMS). Immunoblotting demonstrated that increased IL-1&#946; production is linked to altered mitochondrial function and ATP production. These early findings support the hypothesis that obesity driven IL-1&#946; expression is mediated by tumor-associated macrophages and that mitochondrial dysfunction drives immune suppression. Understanding these molecular and immune-related mechanisms may pave the way for novel strategies to reduce immunosuppression in obese RCC patients, thus improving immunotherapeutic efficacy and overall clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,T cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interleukin-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

A cornerstone treatment for this subtype of BC is endocrine inhibition therapy (EIT), in which estrogen and ER are suppressed using antagonists to suppress tumor growth. However, patients eventually obtain resistance to EIT. Metastatic HR&#8314;BC is the deadliest form of BC, with no cure. Current therapies currently only utilize the ER-axis, with no PR-targeted therapies. Little is known about the role of PR in these BCs, but we have found evidence for an immunosuppressive role for PR in HR&#8314;BC. Yet, it is unclear how PR mediates immunosuppression and if this axis can be therapeutically targeted. We hypothesized that PR confers local immunosuppression through the stimulation of immunosuppressive transcriptional activity and that we can immunologically target this axis using a PR vaccine.<br \/><b>Experimental methods:<\/b> To assess the immune impact of PR, we expressed the isoforms of PR (A, B and A+B) in mouse mammary cancer cells and assessed their capacity to elicit PR signaling. We assessed the impact of PR expression on T cell activity in targeting PR&#8314; mammary tumors that express GFP, along with using GFP-specific JEDI CD8&#8314; T cells. We explored the ability of PR to protect against GFP xenoantigen immune responses by engrafting PR&#8314; mammary cells into immune competent and deficient mice. Lastly, we engineered 1<sup>st<\/sup> generation adenoviral vectors encoding mouse and human PR and utilized two antiprogestins (Mifepristone and Onapristone) in vivo. Using our vectors, we vaccinated BALB\/c in the footpad and assessed PR-specific immunity using IFN&#947; ELISPOT.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Using PR signaling reporters, we found canonical PR signaling activity in the absence of progesterone (P4) by PR-A and in the presence of P4 by PR-B, but the most profound activation of PR signaling was seen through combined expression of PR-A and B. While expression of these genes did not confer striking cytotoxic T cell resistance in vitro, combination of PR-A+PR-B in 67NR cells permitted successful tumor engraftment in immune competent mice, despite xenoantigen expression. GFP expression did not alter tumor growth in immunodeficient mice, suggesting a key role in modulating local anti-tumor immunity. The use of either Mifepristone or Onapristone significantly suppressed tumor engraftment in immune competent mice in vivo. We found that an Ad-PR vaccine could elicit T cell responses against human PR-specific epitopes, a potential step towards immune targeting these BCs.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We found that murine PR-A and PR-B can confer robust P4 signaling that is linked to an immunosuppressive phenotype in vivo. We developed a PR vaccine that elicited PR-specific T cell responses in vivo.

Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in our country and is known to increase the risk for many cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, which is among the ten most common cancers in both men and women. Our lab has shown that obesity leads to worse outcomes in advanced renal cancer patients treated with immunotherapy as compared to lean patients, but the cause for this difference is unknown. To investigate this further, we utilized a murine model with diet-induced obese mice and lean mice that were challenged with orthotopic renal tumors. The tumors grew out over three weeks and were harvested for flow cytometry staining. We stained for markers associated with immune function to better characterize what might be causing patients with obesity to be less responsive to immunotherapy. Our preliminary findings show that DIO mice had a greater tumor burden than lean controls over time. We also found that there compositional differences in multiple subsets of T cells in DIO versus lean mice. In the future, we will expand our murine studies to evaluate the phenotype and function of both tumor cells and immune cells. Additionally, we will continue these studies in human samples to further examine associations between obesity and immunotherapy outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Obesity,Immune cells,Renal cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Features of the PDAC tumor microenvironment that contribute to treatment resistance, including the influence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) on immune and tumor cells, remain poorly understood. Antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) express MHC-II and activate CD4 T cells in genetically engineered PDAC mouse models, but are rarely found in human PDAC. In a human PDAC atlas consisting of six published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, we identified 370 apCAFs out of 8736 total CAFs, the majority of which were from one dataset. Understanding apCAF regulation can reveal how to promote their differentiation and enhance T cell activating capacity in PDAC.<br \/>Methods: Two KPC clones that differ in sensitivity to ICIs, sKPC (sensitive) and rKPC (resistant), derived from the autochthonous KPC murine model of PDAC, were implanted orthotopically into the pancreas or subcutaneously into the flank of syngeneic C57BL\/6 mice. Tumors were harvested at 14-28 days post implantation for quantification of T cells, dendritic cells, and CAFs. To evaluate function, apCAFs were sorted and CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated from tumors. Na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were also isolated from OT-II mice. apCAFs and CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> cells were pulsed with OVA and co-cultured with OT-II CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, or co-cultured with sKPC tumor infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the presence of endogenous peptides.<br \/>Results: Total CAFs are equivalent between tumors, but apCAFs are significantly more abundant in sKPC tumors. Furthermore, the apCAF to dendritic cell ratio within these tumors ranged from 5:1 to 50:1. CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells sorted from sKPC tumors and pulsed with OVA peptide robustly activate na&#239;ve OT-II CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, as expected from professional APCs; sorted apCAFs also activate na&#239;ve OT-II CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, although to a lesser degree. When apCAFs or CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells are cultured with tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, however, they upregulate CD4 activation markers to a similar extent.<br \/>Conclusions: apCAFs are more abundant in tumors derived from ICI-sensitive KPC clones and greatly outnumber dendritic cells. Functionally, apCAFs from sKPC tumors stimulate tumor-derived CD4 T cells to the same degree as CD11c<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells, implicating a role in activation of the immune response in ICI-sensitive tumors. Although a small proportion of the tumor microenvironment, the apCAF subset may be enhanced in number and function by CAF-targeted modulators to affect the antitumor response; transcriptomics analyses are currently underway to identify regulators of apCAFs. Such a strategy could provide a solution to the currently unmet need for new and more effective treatments for PDAC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Antigen presentation,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Studying mouse immune cell heterogeneity can be achieved by simultaneous mRNA and surface protein profiling. However, when coupled with full-length TCR and BCR analysis, this integrated approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of immune responses and cellular function in healthy and diseased conditions. In this study, we used the MC38 colon carcinoma model to study T and B cell heterogeneity and clonotype diversity. We stained single-cell suspensions prepared from bone marrow, thymus, spleen and tumor tissues with 20 AbSeq (CITE-Seq) antibody oligos and sample-multiplexing tags. We then loaded 50,000 isolated T and B cells into two lanes of an 8-lane microwell cartridge for single-cell capture by a single-cell analysis system. To aid in the simultaneous analysis of clonality and gene expression, we carried out library preparation using a full-length TCR\/BCR multiomic assay and a mouse immune response panel. The combination of mRNA and protein expression confirmed the elevated expression of exhaustion and activation markers in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). We identified high-frequency clonotypes within TILs and tracked their frequency across other tissues. Tumor-burdened mice splenic T cells showed shared TCR combinations with TILs, which were absent in healthy tissue. The results show the ability to successfully profile T and B cell receptors using a full-length TCR\/BCR multiomic assay in a mouse tumor model and the use of transcriptome, protein and TCR\/BCR clonal information to investigate immune cell characteristics across multiple samples.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

However, sudden exposure to xenobiotic genes (e.g. GFP, luciferase (luc), or rtTA3) triggers inadvertent immune responses that can significantly suppress foreign gene expression or result in complete rejection of transplanted cells. Although germline expression of foreign genes somewhat addresses these challenges, native fluorescence and bioluminescence abrogates their utility as cellular reporters and spatiotemporally restricted expression can lead to suboptimal xenoantigen tolerance. Even in endogenous cancer models, we find that the means of tissue-directed expression of the same foreign gene yield significant differences in overall tolerance. Thus, the degree of tolerance to foreign genes strongly impacts the utility of different genetic modification and can strongly influence experimental outcomes and interpretations. To overcome these unwanted immune responses and enable reliable cell tracking\/gene regulation, we developed a novel mouse model that selectively expresses antigen-intact but non-functional forms of GFP, luc, and rtTA3. These \"NoGlow\" mice possess no detectable background fluorescence or luminescence and mount limited adaptive immune responses against transgenic xenoantigens even after vaccination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NoGlow mice allow tracking and tetracycline inducible gene regulation of triple-transgenic cells expressing GFP\/luc\/rtTA3, in contrast to transgene-negative immune competent mice which completely eliminate these cells. Notably, this model enables de novo metastasis from orthotopically implanted, triple-transgenic tumor cells, despite high xenoantigen expression. Finally, we observed model and sex-based differences in immune tolerance to the encoded xenoantigens after activation by different tissue-specific CREs, illustrating the obstacles of tolerizing animals to foreign genes and validating the utility of NoGlow mice to dissect the mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. Altogether, the NoGlow model provides a critical resource for in vivo studies across multiple disciplines, including oncology, developmental biology, infectious disease, autoimmunity, and transplantation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Animal models,Metastasis,Tolerance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly aggressive and patients often relapse due to chemotherapy resistance. In the recent years, chemotherapy has been combined with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for SCLC treatment, leading to improved responses in some patients, but also leaving a high number of non-responders to address. Paradoxically, SCLC has one of the highest tumor mutational burden, including remarkably abundant frameshifts (FS) which could create highly immunogenic neoantigens (NeoAg). However, FS-harbouring transcripts are often degraded via Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD). We therefore aimed to inhibit the NMD pathway to increase the immunogenicity of SCLC.<br \/>Our lab has so far profiled the mutational landscape of more than 400 SCLC patients and generated over 100 patient-derived xenotransplant models. We analyzed genome and transcriptome sequencing data of multiple tumors to interrogate the NMD target repertoire in SCLC. We determined tumor-specific mutations and predicted NeoAg based on the HLA-I-binding ability of mutant peptides. Upon NMD inhibiton, we validated the expression and presentation of NeoAg via transcriptomics, proteomics and HLA-I-immunopeptidomics. NMD-sensitive mutated transcripts included a wide range of somatic alterations beyond FS-mutations, suggesting an overall increase of potential tumor-specific NeoAg. We furthermore evaluated immunogenicity after NMD perturbation employing <i>in vitro<\/i> co-cultures as well as immunocompetent <i>in vivo <\/i>mouse models. Inhibition of NMD in tumor cells resulted in an HLA-I-dependent enhancement of T cell-mediated tumor killing <i>in vitro<\/i>, and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments showed reduced tumor growth accompanied by increased immune infiltration upon controlled induction of NMD inhibition.<br \/>Altogether, NMD inhibition in SCLC led to an upregulation of NeoAg expression in tumor cells accompanied by enhanced T cell responses <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our strategy provides a novel approach for the treatment of low immunogenic tumors which could be combined with ICI to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Neoantigens,Cancer immunotherapy,Post-transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

PD-L1 expression is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is currently the most widely used selective biomarker for response to pembrolizumab anti-PD-1 therapy. Antigen stability on cut tissue sections, also referred to as cut section stability (CSS), and its impact on IHC results is of interest when determining PD-L1 positive or negative status for clinical trials and diagnostic purposes. Since the stability of cut sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue relies on retention of PD-L1 antigenicity following tissue sectioning, the aim of these studies was to measure CSS across multiple tumor indications using combined positive score (CPS). The impact of aged cut sections was evaluated for PD-L1 expression based on pathologist CPS scores of blinded and randomized stained sections. To assess CSS, fresh unstained 4&#181;m cut tissue sections were stored in the dark at 2-8 &#176;C. Staining was performed according to the instructions for use at predefined timepoints. Studies included neoplastic specimens from biliary tract adenocarcinoma (BTAC), cervical cancer (CC), colorectal (CRC) and gastric (GC) carcinoma, esophageal cancer (EC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), nasopharyngeal (NPC), ovarian (OC), renal cell (RCC), and triple negative breast (TNBC) carcinoma. Data for each indication and timepoint were used to evaluate average drift in CPS scores over time, starting with scores from a set of respective slides stained at timepoint zero, prior to aging of unstained cut slides. CSS for each specimen within each indication was based on the intersection point of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the regression line on CPS drift with allowable drift limits. Overall CSS for each indication was defined based on the specimen that exhibited the shortest shelf-life. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate average CPS drift over time and define the CSS per indication. This analysis identified the following CSS (in days) for each tumor type when stored at 2-8 &#176;C: 105 (CC), 113 (OC), 115 (BTAC), 135 (EC), 163 (GC), 180 (RCC), 197 (HNSCC), 231 (TNBC), 240 (NPC), and 300 (CRC). The minimal shelf life for unstained cut sections stored at 2-8 &#176;C across the 10 indications in these studies was 105 days, indicating a possible minimum threshold for indications tested when sectioned specimens are stored at 2-8 &#176;C. These data provide high confidence in determining PD-L1 expression on properly stored aged cut sections. Commercial claims may be shorter based on region, as specified in the local instructions for use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Immunohistochemistry,Diagnostic marker,Antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Through single-nucleus RNA-seq and whole-transcriptome digital spatial profiling of patient tumors, we previously reported marked heterogeneity in the immune composition of PDAC. Here, we developed a novel multi-omics workflow integrating single cell spatial proteomics (96-plex, Akoya Phenocycler&#174;-Fusion) and transcriptomics (990-plex, Nanostring CosMx) in primary patient PDAC tumors to systematically study spatial relationships and functional states of malignant, stromal, and immune cells. Consecutive sections from four independent tumors enabled whole slide proteomic assessment of &#62;3.5M cells, and transcriptomic assessment of &#62;200K cells. Strikingly, we observed an abundance of immune cell aggregates in all tissue sections, up to 57 within a 1 cm2 tumor section. Aggregates were diverse in composition with representation of myeloid cells, CD8+ T cells, and stromal cells, including fibroblasts and nerves. B\/T lymphoid aggregates were well vascularized with co-localized CD31+CD34+ endothelial cells and appeared at various phases of maturation towards putative tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) containing CD38+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD21+ follicular DCs. These tissues were enriched for interferon stimulated genes in T cells and type 1 interferon response signatures in malignant cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) forming inflammatory multicellular hubs that have been associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade. Surprisingly, B cells, in addition to macrophages and CD8+ T cells, were major producers of interferon gamma (B cells: 13.7%, macrophages: 36.6%, CD8+ T cells: 12.1% of IFNG+ cells). Finally, to gain insight into the necessary factors for TLS formation in PDAC, we quantified the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules associated with TLS initiation. Activated dendritic cells expressed CCL19 and CCL21, endothelial cells expressed CCL21, and in concert with inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), CXCL12. Malignant cells expressed CXCL13 and CCL20 and displayed high levels of cell adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, and ICAM2. Together, our data suggests that the functions of lymphoid tissue organizer cells can be substituted by endothelial cells, dendritic cells, iCAFs, and, surprisingly, malignant cells. Our spatial immunophenotyping study of pancreatic cancer thus highlights the marked immune heterogeneity of the disease and suggests a central role for malignant and stromal cells in mediating diverse mechanisms of immune evasion and engagement. Functional studies will be conducted to investigate these mechanisms of tumor-immune crosstalk and identify novel immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities for this deadly disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Spatial biology,Tertiary lymphoid structures,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.
