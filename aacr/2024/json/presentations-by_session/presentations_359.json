[{"Abstract":"Checkpoint blockade therapies have transformed the landscape of cancer care. Durable clinical responses have been observed in a subset of patients. However, many patients do not respond, and understanding the mechanisms that determine tumor resistant to checkpoint blockade drugs could potentially benefit more patients. Ferroptosis is a relatively newly described form of regulated cell death distinct from apoptosis and necroptosis. Recently, T cell-promoted tumor ferroptosis was shown to be an anti-tumor mechanism and targeting this pathway could be a potential therapeutic approach. To identify genes critical to immunotherapy resistance, B16.SIY cells were transduced with a genome-scale gRNA lentivirus to generate loss of function mutants. <i>In vitro<\/i>-primed CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells isolated from 2C\/Rag2<sup>-\/- <\/sup>TCR transgenic mice specific for the SIY antigen were co-cultured with transduced B16.SIY tumor cells. Resistant mutants were identified by deep sequencing of survival clones. The gene encoding Decr2, a peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, was identified. Decr2 mutants were relatively resistant to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell killing <i>in vitro<\/i>. Consistent with this resistance to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell killing, Decr2 knock-down tumors showed minimal response to anti-PD-L1 therapy <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumor microenvironment analysis in Decr2 knockdown B16.SIY tumors showed failed antigen specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells&#8217; expansion and less IFN-&#947; production after anti-PD-L1 treatment. Knock-down of Decr2 resulted in diminished ferroptosis, triggered either by pharmacologic inducers or antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that Decr2 knockdown resulted in diminished induction of polyunsaturated ether phospholipids (PUFA-ePLs), which is due to reduced polyunsaturated ether phospholipids synthesis rate . Analysis of melanoma tumors from human patients revealed that up-regulation of Decr2 was associated with anti-PD-1 efficacy. Our results proved Decr2 knock down suppressed tumor ferroptosis and confer tumors resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy by reducing the polyunsaturated ether phospholipids (PUFA-ePLs) synthesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Decr2,ferroptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The immunological phenotypes in the TME of EGFR-mutated lung cancer were characterized as non-inflamed, for which immunotherapy is largely ineffective. To orchestrate host immunity against lung tumors, we proposed that PKC&#948;, a gatekeeper of immune homeostasis with kinase activity, is responsible for the un-inflamed phenotype in EGFR-mutated lung tumors. It promotes tumor progression by stimulating extracellular matrix (ECM) and PD-L1 expression which leads to immune exclusion and assists cancer cell escape from T cell surveillance. Ablation of PKC&#948; enhances the intratumoral penetration of T cells and suppresses the growth of tumors. Furthermore, blocking PKC&#948; significantly sensitizes the tumor to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy (&#945;PD-1) in vitro and in vivo models. These findings revealed that PKC&#948; is a critical switch to induce inflamed tumors and consequently enhances the efficacy of ICB therapy in EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

SOX9, a transcription factor crucial for tissue development and homeostasis, has been linked to the advancement of tumor growth. However, its specific role as a driver in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is not well-defined. Additionally, the impact of SOX9 on the tumor microenvironment has not been previously explored. We here identify SOX9 transcription factor to play a critical role in defining tumor immune microenvironment and driving disease progression. We employed CRISPR\/Cas9 and Cre-LoxP gene knockout methods within the <i>Kras<\/i> G12D-induced mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Our objective was to investigate the mechanisms through which SOX9 contributes to the development and advancement of lung adenocarcinoma. To substantiate our findings, we conducted immune profiling, gene expression analyses, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry assessments in the <i>Kras<\/i> G12D-driven murine LUAD. These results were subsequently validated by examining bulk and single-cell gene expression profiles, as well as immunohistochemistry, in human lung adenocarcinoma. Our studies indicated that SOX9 played a very important role by enhancing lung tumor development, burden, and progression, leading to lower overall survival. SOX9. SOX9 consistently facilitated the growth of organoids in vitro. However, the promotion of tumor growth by SOX9 was notably reduced in immunocompromised mice compared to syngeneic mice. SOX9 demonstrated a suppressive effect on immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting the functionality of tumor-associated CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. CD8+ T cells in the SOX9 overexpressing tumors showed upregulation of exhaustion markers. SOX9-mediated tumor growth advantage could not be observed in the CD8 knockout mice model, suggesting a CD8+ T cell-dependent role. In addition, SOX9 significantly upregulated collagen-related gene expression, leading to a substantial increase in collagen fibers possibly affecting the migration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. Together, our studies indicate that SOX9 plays a very critical role in modulating tumor microenvironment by controlling immune cell infiltration and CD8+ T cell exhaustion driving <i>K<\/i><i>ras<\/i> G12D- driven lung tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Tumor immunity,Lung adenocarcinoma,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Dinoop Ravindran Menon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hua Zhong<sup>2<\/sup>, Shridar Ganesan<sup>2<\/sup>, Hatim Sabaawy<sup>1<\/sup>, Sharon Pine<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division Of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO,<sup>2<\/sup>Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd7cf0da-f9c1-474d-8cae-18380f68a584","ControlNumber":"3495","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

In the context of the tumor microenvironment (TME), however, cancer cells can manipulate these pathways to camouflage themselves from an immune attack. Blocking these checkpoints has thus emerged as a key immunotherapeutic tactic. Nonetheless, the success rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been mixed, even for patients who test positive for relevant diagnostic biomarkers. Patient stratification currently depends on immunohistochemical staining for checkpoint proteins like PD-L1, but these tests do not provide adequate stratification. A more comprehensive stratification, one that includes immune profiling of the TME plus an evaluation of immune checkpoint interactions, might provide better patient stratification and ICI responsiveness. Here we describe mIF that is augmented with a PD-1 and PD-L1 protein-protein interaction assay.<br \/>Human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were subjected to standard histological processing and then incubated with primary antibodies against PD1 and PD-L1. Sections were then treated with oligonucleotide-modified secondary probes suitable for <i>in situ<\/i> Proximity Ligation Assay (isPLA), enabling the detection of PD1 and PD-L1 interactions. The PLA protocol utilized a fluorescent probe complementary to amplified nucleic acid to enhance the visibility of the protein interactions. The sample was then mounted in a closed microfluidic chamber and imaged on the CellScape&#8482; platform for Precise Spatial Multiplexing. After imaging of the isPLA signal, the CellScape cyclic multiplex mIF staining approach was used to iteratively stain immune and structural markers on the tissue sample utilizing the VistaPlex&#8482; Spatial Immune Profiling Assay Kit.<br \/>This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that high-plex mIF can be augmented with an isPLA on human FFPE samples. The combined application of both methods allows visualization of PD1\/PD-L1 protein-protein interactions and integrates this interaction within the spatial context of the surrounding cell populations. This approach allows for a more comprehensive insight into the interplay of different immune cell and non-immune cell populations during checkpoint activation processes in normal and neoplastic tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor microenvironment,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Therefore, MDSCs are potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in cancer. However, the definitive cell surface markers for defining MDSC and the subset that correlates with cancer progression are not clear. In our previous studies, there was no difference in the amount of total granulocyte MDSCs (G-MDSCs) between early and advanced gastric cancer. We inferred that there is a novel subset of G-MDSCs involved in cancer progression rather than the previous marker-based classification. The purpose of this study is to analyze MDSCs in gastric cancer patients at different stages of progression and to identify subsets of G-MDSCs that are involved in cancer progression. As a result, we identified a subset of novel G-MDSCs that correlate with cancer progression by expressing LAG-3. LAG-3 is a molecule that is expressed in Tregs and causes strong immunosuppression, suggesting that it is involved in the immunosuppressive potential of MDSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immune checkpoint,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Currently, there are no effective biomarkers to select patients who could benefit the most from ICIs or to predict response outcomes. Increasing evidence indicates that oncogenic pathway activation is associated with the generation of an unfavorable tumor microenvironment, with consequent immunotherapy resistance. Therefore, an understanding of the immune evasive mechanism of HCC is urgently needed.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing the antigen-expressing c-Myc<sup>OE<\/sup>\/Tp53<sup>KO<\/sup> HCC mouse model, a critical oncogenic signaling pathway in immune evasion was identified by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomics. Potential downstream pathways were investigated by scRNA-seq, immune profiling, western blot, and multiplexed immunofluorescence staining. We also examined the therapeutic potential of targeting wild-type Kras using the Kras inhibitor MRTX0902 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in HCC.<br \/>Results: We identified a significant upregulation of wild-type Kras in immune-escaped tumors, with concurrent activation of its ligand-driven EGFR and its downstream MEK\/ERK signaling. Likewise, endogenous Kras overexpression in this model resulted in increased tumor burden with reduced survival time in mice, implicating the regulatory role of Kras signaling in immune evasion. Clinically, wild-type Kras showed elevated expression in HCC at both the mRNA and protein levels, and was associated with tumor recurrence and poorer patient survival. Through scRNA-seq analysis, we demonstrated that Kras hindered dendritic cell recruitment, leading to compromised Cd8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activity via the suppression of interferon-mediated Cxcl9. Wild-type Kras activation further impaired HCC recognition by T cells via the downregulation of MHC-I expression. Notably, the combination therapy of MRTX0902, trametinib, and anti-PD-1 effectively enhanced intratumoral Cd8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration and demonstrated a favorable response in survival outcomes.<br \/>Conclusion: This study showed that wild-type Kras, via the activation of its downstream MEK\/ERK signaling, acts as a crucial immune evasive mechanism in HCC and contributes to resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. It also provided new insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting wild-type Kras to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, providing a foundation for further exploration and potential clinical applications in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"K-ras,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interferons,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The RNA-binding protein HuR is known to play a critical role in the oncogenesis of PDAC by regulating key mRNA transcripts. Our lab has shown that tumor-intrinsic HuR is overexpressed in PDAC and regulates the tumor microenvironment composition, altering multiple tumor cytokines to release. Thus, we hypothesized that HuR plays a role in immune evasion of PDAC. We disrupted the locus encoding HuR (<i>Elavl1<\/i>) using CRISPR Cas9 in Kras-p53 mutant-driven (KPC) murine PDAC to assess its function in tumor immune evasion. Here, we report that HuR, a known pro-survival factor for PDAC, has a role in tumor immune evasion by suppressing T cell infiltration and T cell activation. Specifically, HuR-knockout (KO) KPC tumors grew slower compared to KPC wildtype (WT) tumors in an orthotopically implanted model (p-value &#60; 0.0001), even though human PDAC cell lines with HuR-WT and HuR-KO grew at the same rate in NRG mice (in an immune-compromised environment). Accordingly, HuR-KO tumors had more T cell infiltration and activated T cells compared to HuR-WT tumors (p-value = 0.0047). Importantly, T cell depletion (both CD4+ and CD8+) partially rescued the size of HuR-KO tumors. Next, we rescued the expression of HuR in the HuR-KO cell line, and the re-expression partially rescued the tumor size in vivo. This observation validates a HuR-mediated dependent mechanism. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that HuR suppresses T cell activation and prevents T cells from infiltrating into the PDAC microenvironment, leading to PDAC immune evasion. Ongoing experiments will transduce KPC cell lines with ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, which will selectively activate CD8+ OT-I T cells through their transgenic TCR, to measure the ability of KPC HuR-WT or HuR-KO OVA cells in directly activating CD8+ OT-I T cells. We will also investigate HuR's impact on immune cells' cytokine release and how that will impact the cytotoxicity of T cells. These findings support the ongoing concept that HuR plays an important pro-survival role in PDAC in vivo, and targeting strategies against HuR being developed (e.g., siHuR nano-therapies and small molecule inhibitors) could potentially enhance PDAC sensitivity to immune-based anti-cancer therapies, such as checkpoint blockade and T cell transfer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Pancreatic cancer,RNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The tumor microenvironment consists of an abundance of immunosuppressive immune cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to local and systemic immunosuppression in PDAC. Tumor cells can influence the tumor microenvironment and, with that, the present immune cells through the secretion of cytokines or chemokines or the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are a media of communication among the tumor cells themselves, but also with other cells of the body, with the goal to promote tumor expansion and metastasis and decrease any anti-tumor-directed forces of the immune system. Our lab has shown that those EVs play a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis in PDAC. We have found MUC1 to be an important marker for tumor-derived EVs (tdEVs), associated with their activity and influence on cell proliferation and tumor growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Determining which immune cell populations are most targeted and impacted by tdEVs is essential to improving our understanding of the role of EVs in PDAC.<br \/><b><u> <\/u><\/b> <b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> TdEVs were isolated from murine pancreatic cancer cell lines through differential ultracentrifugation. EVs were then labeled with a membrane dye, which allows tracking of the EVs in the mouse. We designed an <i>in vivo<\/i> study to investigate the effects that tdEVs have on different immune cell populations, as well as tumor growth and metastasis. This study has two distinct phases: a 3-week &#8220;Pre-Education Phase&#8221;, with injection of either MUC1<sup>+<\/sup> or MUC1KO EVs, is followed by orthotopic implantation of tumor cells in the pancreas.<br \/><b><u>Data:<\/u><\/b> We hypothesized that tdEVs impact effector immune cells in PDAC, leading to phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional changes that result in a decreased anti-tumor immune response. The highest uptake of EVs was found in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, most immune cells preferably take up MUC1<sup>+<\/sup> as compared to MUC1KO EVs. After three weeks of EV education, RNA sequencing of the liver showed differential gene expression in a variety of genes related to processes associated with B cells. Treatment with MUC1<sup>+<\/sup> EVs downregulated B cell-related processes in the liver, B cell differentiation, proliferation and activity are reduced. Several genes coding for immunoglobulin parts were affected as well. Immune cell profiling of the blood and spleen showed that MUC1<sup>+<\/sup> EVs reduce NK and macrophage numbers in the spleen as compared to MUC1KO EV treatment after three weeks. Additionally, EV-treatment increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell numbers in the blood but decreased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the spleen.<br \/><b><u> <\/u><\/b> <b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b> We have shown that tdEVs induce phenotypic and transcriptional changes in immune cell populations and alter immune cell frequencies <i>in vivo<\/i>.

Quantitative proteomics and immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate how major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) substrates were recognized by SPSB1-containing ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation; Flow cytometry and T cell cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate MHC-I level and killing of tumor cells by antigen-stimulated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.<br \/>Results: 3&#8242;UTR globally shortens during prostate cancer progression to castration-resistance. Through blocking the proximal PASs, 3&#8242;UTRCES efficiently and specifically reverses the 3&#8242;UTR shortening of novel APA-linked, clinically-relevant prostate cancer oncogenic mRNAs, such as <i>SPSB1<\/i>, leading to reduced <i>SPSB1 <\/i>mRNA translation and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Intratumoral injection of TT3 LLN encapsulating 3&#8242;UTRCES RNA molecules effectively and safely inhibits prostate tumor growth in engrafted and transgenic mouse models. Notably, downregulation of SPSB1 protein by 3&#8242;UTRCES disrupts the interactions of SPSB1-containing ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to compromised ubiquitination-mediated MHC-I degradation and increased stability and abundance of MHC-I protein. Consistently, 3&#8242;UTRCES enhances MHC-I-regulated antigen presentation and thereby augments CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which suggest the potentials of 3&#8242;UTRCES to sensitize prostate cancer to immune checkpoint therapies. Importantly, 3&#8242;UTR shortening of <i>SPSB1<\/i> mRNA is significantly associated with decreased MHC-I expression, reduced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration and activation in castration resistant prostate cancer patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results establish the concept of &#8220;3&#8242;UTR targeted therapy&#8221; for treatment of prostate cancer with broad applications to other cancers and other 3&#8242;UTR-related diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Post-transcriptional regulation,Novel anticancer agents,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Multiomics analysis of tumor samples upon IRE1&#945; deletion in cancer cells showed significantly potentiated interferon (IFN) response and activation of immune system related pathways in the TME. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that the abundance of immunosuppressive cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and T regulatory cells were markedly reduced in the IRE1&#945; deficient tumors. Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the annotated cell types in the TME demonstrated that expression signatures associated with IFN responses were significantly enriched in TAMs, cancer cells, and dendritic cells. In addition, a novel scRNA-seq derived TAM gene signature is strongly associated with poor PCa survival. Furthermore, IRE1&#945; inhibition by the small molecule MKC8866 (ORIN1001) that is in clinical trials significantly enhanced anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy in mice.

In addition to chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective for TNBC with <i>BRCA<\/i>-mutated and PD-L1-positive cases. However, overall survival of TNBC remains unfavorable. To explore new targeted therapy in TNBC, we reported previously that SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1), IL-13 and several genes were predicted as interactive targets of miRNA in TNBC from the microarray expression analysis (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) of small RNA extracted from 11 breast cancer specimens (AACR2020, #1709). Thus, we investigated SOCS1-related immune-response under co-culture of TNBC and monocyte cell lines with or without paclitaxel exposure.<br \/>Materials and Methods: MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, RAW264.7 cell lines were used with co-culture system (Falcon&#174; Cell Culture Inserts, Corning, NY, USA). SOCS1-expression vector and siSOCS1 were transfected into TNBC cell lines with polyethylenimine (PEI Max; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). RAW264.7 was activated with lipopolysaccaride (5ug\/ml) and IFN&#947; (10ng\/ml) for 2 days before co-culture. Relative cell viability of TNBC cell lines with vehicle control (DMSO) or paclitaxel exposure was measured with WST-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8; Dojindo, Japan) using TC20 Automated cell counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Japan) after 2 days&#8217; co-culture of TNBC and RAW264.7 cells under several conditions of SOCS1 overexpression and \/or RAW264.7 activation.<br \/>Results: First, paclitaxel inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 in a dose-dependent manner (at 1nM~100nM). Second, at paclitaxel exposure of 10 nM and 50 nM, relative cell viability of MDA-MB-468 decreased with co-culture of activated RAW264.7. The tendency was enhanced with SOCS1 overexpression in breast cancer cell lines. Similar results were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells.<br \/>Discussions: SOCS1 is well known as a negative regulator of JAK-STAT pathway. SOCS1 is also related to suppression of T cell activation and modulation of M1 macrophage. At AACR2020, we reported that SOCS1 gene amplification in cancer tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was relatively lower in 6 cases with pathologically partial or complete response than in 11 cases with no pathological response. In vitro, paclitaxel-toxicity in TNBC cells was augmented by activated monocyte (M1 macrophage) and more sensitized with SOCS1 overexpression in TNBC cells. These results suggest that proinflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophage influence cell viability of TNBC.<br \/>Conclusion: SOCS1 is a promising molecular target to modulate immune-response in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Shigeru Imoto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tomohiro Chiba<sup>2<\/sup>, Hirohito Seki<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoshiharu Ishizaka<sup>1<\/sup>, Ai Tsuchiya<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomoko Kitaoka<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Breast Surgery, Kyorin University Hospital, Mitaka city, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Cytology, The Cancer Institute Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"935a8115-1f5e-4dcb-9f8a-9419b976daa7","ControlNumber":"1579","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

As such, successful anti-estrogen\/ER-based therapies have been very successful in the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Despite this success, over 1\/3 of patients will eventually progress on current ER\/estrogen-targeted therapies, underscoring the need for new targeted therapies in HR+ breast cancer. Unlike ER, the role of PR in breast cancer progression has received far less attention. In a previous study, we found that a mouse mammary tumor cell line E0771, modified to express the mouse progesterone receptor (mPR) and the OVA peptide, demonstrated decreased T cell-mediated cell death when treated with progesterone compared to the control group. Progesterone-mediated protection from T-cell death was only observed in mPR+ cell lines. Flow analysis of the E0771-Ova-mPR cells also revealed a decrease in MHC Class I presentation in progesterone-treated cells compared to a vehicle control. To further explore the role of the machinery required for antigen processing and presentation of MHC Class I molecules, we conducted additional experiments using the E0771 cell line. Our results showed that treatment with progesterone led to a reduction in RNA levels of all the machinery required for antigen processing and presentation (APP). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that activation of the progesterone receptor by progesterone may decrease MHC Class I expression by regulating APP. Our results showed that treatment with progesterone resulted in a reduction in RNA levels of Tap1, Tap2, Tapbp, Nlrc5, B2m, and Psmb8, which are essential for APP. We therefore propose that activation of the progesterone receptor by progesterone may decrease MHC Class I expression by directly modulating the APP pathway. The findings of this study may have significant implications for our understanding of how breast cancer cells evade T-cell mediated cytotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunomodulation,Hormone receptors,Hormone-related cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Julio Tinoco<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lauryn Werner<sup>1<\/sup>, Eilidh Chowanec<sup>1<\/sup>, Harmony Saunders<sup>1<\/sup>, Sun Xiaopeng<sup>2<\/sup>, Jay Gertz<sup>3<\/sup>, Justin Balko<sup>4<\/sup>, Zachary C.

In tumors, macrophages can be polarized towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as M1, or towards an anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting phenotype, referred to as M2. M2 macrophages promote tumor growth by secreting cytokines that increase tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and dampen the immune response from other immune cells such as T cells and dendritic cells. The balance between M1 and M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is critical in determining the outcome of cancer progression and response to therapy. By understanding the pathways that lead to macrophage polarization, we can develop therapeutics that inhibit this process and support an anti-tumor macrophage response. Co-culture is a powerful model to study interactions between different cell types. We created co-cultures with macrophages and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells to understand how these cell-cell interactions can lead to altered cell phenotype. Several studies have looked at the interaction of two populations using a transwell system where one cell population is placed in a well with a permeable membrane and the other population is placed below, allowing for the exchange of soluble factors. However, this does not account for an important mode of cell-cell interaction, which is physical contact. Therefore, we tested how macrophages derived from primary monocytes polarized in the context of conditioned media (supernatant), cell lysate, and direct co-culture. We used U87-MG as a model GBM cell line. We assayed the M2 phenotype by using flow cytometry with CD163 as a marker. Our findings show that direct co-culture is crucial for promoting macrophage M2 polarization. Using our in vitro model for tumor-induced macrophage polarization, we conducted phosphoproteomic analysis to characterize signals associated with this phenotypic change. To study how co-culture induced differential signaling in tumor populations and macrophages, we devised a method to fix cells to preserve cell signaling, followed by separation using flow cytometry and LC-MS\/MS analysis of individual cell populations. We created co-cultures of U87-MG tumor cells and macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells, a monocyte cell line. We then tested whether our method could reliably separate the different populations, whether we could detect altered signals due to co-culture, and showcase how separating cell populations yields information that could not be gathered from bulk analysis of co-cultures. Our data shows that the analysis was highly reproducible and that the signaling from cells separated from co-culture was highly similar to signaling in cells that were grown individually. However, some phosphorylation residues were uniquely upregulated in the co-culture condition, pointing to signaling that may occur in response to tumor interaction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Proteomics,Signaling pathways,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Our study reveals that ATR, a molecule primarily recognized for its role in maintaining the genome, plays a crucial role in ECM stiffness-induced immune evasion and metastasis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) through DNA repair independent manner. In response to ECM stiffness, ATR activates SUN2, a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. This activation enhances the interaction of SUN2 with outer nuclear membrane proteins KASH1 and KASH2. The interaction between SUN2 and KASH1\/2 facilitates the nuclear localization of &#946;-catenin, which in turn promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduces the expression of E-cadherin. E-cadherin is essential for attracting CD103+ immune cells that perform anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, inhibiting ATR reduces EMT in tumor cells, leading to an increase in CD103+ dendritic cell infiltration while decreasing neutrophil and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) infiltration. Further, we found that ATR levels are inversely correlated with immunotherapy response rates in patients. The alteration in immune cell composition sensitizes tumors to immunotherapy, thereby suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. In conclusion, the role of ATR in remodeling the immune environment could be crucial for optimizing the clinical use of ATR inhibitors. This makes ATR a promising target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance. We suggest early or prolonged treatment with an ATR inhibitor to potentially reduce metastasis rates and improve the prognosis of TNBC patients. Furthermore, we suggest using ATR levels as a marker to predict response rates and prognosis in TNBC patients. For patients with higher ATR expression levels, combination treatment with ATR inhibitors and immunotherapy may yield better outcomes. Enhanced anti-tumor immunity could increase the chances for patients to eliminate cancer cells and help end breast cancer. Finally, our research suggests the combined treatment of ATR inhibition and immunotherapy for patients without necessarily applying DNA damage stimulation. This approach could potentially reduce toxicity while still benefiting patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,ATR,Cytoskeleton,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

BAP1 mutations have also been found to be associated with T-cell infiltration in peritoneal mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. Because BAP1 mutations are known to be associated with aggressive disease and poor survival, we hypothesize that these mutations lead to a more immunosuppressive microenvironment. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics, we confirmed that BAP1 mutant tumors are immune hot with a high fraction of Treg, exhausted CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. At the same time, these tumors have a lower proportion of endothelial cells and pericytes. Evident of pro-tumor microenvironment we have found BAP1 mutations to be associated with the upregulation of SPP1, CD163, and MARCO immunosuppressive genes in tumor-associated macrophages. Here we propose a mechanism by which BAP1-mutant cancer cells induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment: through activation of the complement system and TGF-&#946; signaling to attract macrophages. Taken together, our results suggest that BAP1 mutations contribute to poor ccRCC outcomes not only through cell-intrinsic effects, but also by promoting infiltration of Tregs and tumor-associated macrophages and polarizing infiltrated macrophages towards immunosuppressive phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Kidney cancer,TGF-&#946;,Regulatory T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

However, only a minority of patients achieve the long-term, durable response to ICB, and the response rates in most advanced tumors is limited to 10%-25%. The unsatisfactory overall response to ICB and the great variation in response among individuals highlight the necessity for developing predictive biomarkers and overcoming ICB resistance. A potential mode of resistance is tumor-mediated immunosuppression leading to inhibition of T cell-mediated infiltration and immunity. Here, combining single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analysis with liquid biopsy of tumor patients, we showed that S100 calcium binding protein A1 (S100A1) was closely related to ICB response, and that detecting plasma S100A1 level could help predicting the response to ICB, implying that tumor-intrinsic S100A1 may contribute to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to ICB. Importantly, endogenous <i>S100a1<\/i> knockdown (<i>S100a1<\/i><sup>KD<\/sup>) promoted anti-tumor immunity, conferred tumor regression, and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in multiple syngeneic murine models. By characterizing the immune landscape of <i>S100a1<\/i><sup>KD<\/sup> syngeneic murine tumor models and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical samples, we demonstrated a negative relationship between tumor-intrinsic S100A1 expression and infiltration of M1-like macrophage and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Single cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, together with functional studies, have revealed that ablation of tumor-intrinsic S100A1 exerts profound impacts on the M1-like polarization of macrophages and cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Moreover, the conditioned medium from <i>S100a1<\/i><sup>KD<\/sup> tumor cells promoted M1 polarization of both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Raw264.7 cells, which in turn reinvigorated tumor-specific T cell immunity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Of note, as a secreted protein, introducing recombinant S100A1 into the medium from <i>S100a1<\/i><sup>KD<\/sup> tumor cells could not reverse the effects on T cells and macrophages, suggesting that these effects were independent of extracelluar S100A1 secretion and that S100A1 may act as an intracellular signaling molecule. Mechanistically, S100A1 affects deubiquitination of NF-&#954;B through interacting with the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains of ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), leading to upregulated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression. Collectively, these data identified the S100A1\/USP7\/p65\/GM-CSF inhibitory axis as a critical immune suppressor on M1-like macrophage polarization and T cell immunity for the promotion of tumor progression and resistance to ICB. Our findings demonstrated the potential of plasma S100A1 expression in predicting the response to ICB, and provide a rationale for combining GM-CSF and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in tumors with high S100A1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,S100A1,Immune checkpoint blockade,Macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

While current immune checkpoint inhibitors are able to elicit anti-cancer CD8+ T cell responses in some patients, a majority of patients are still nonresponsive, and have minimal levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. This effect is potentially due to still-unrecognized cancer-driven mechanisms of immunosuppression. To identify candidate genes with roles in CD8+ T cell exclusion, we used a T cell gene signature (Tsig) to quantify CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumors profiled by RNA-seq. Partial Spearman correlation adjusted for tumor purity was performed for all annotated genes (N=20501) in the TCGA CRC RNA-seq data set (N=373) to identify genes most inversely correlated with Tsig. A locus at chromosome 20q was identified as the region of the genome most inversely correlated with Tsig - both by copy number analysis and by RNA expression. Interestingly, this region is the most copy number-amplified region in CRC tumors, and the genes at this locus are among the most highly expressed genes in CRC tumors. Within this region, the amplified and overexpressed gene Protein O-Fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) had the strongest inverse correlation to Tsig. POFUT1 function is essential to canonical NOTCH signaling, and CRC-expressed NOTCH is implicated in increased CRC secretion of immunosuppressive factors IL-6, TGF-&#946; and VEGF, and reduced CD8+ T cell secretion of IFN-&#947; and IL-2. POFUT1 overexpressing (OE) CT26 and MC38 cell lines were generated, and confirmed by Western Blot to have elevated levels of both cleaved NOTCH1 (NICD1), and NOTCH pathway transcriptional target, HES1. Murine CD8+ T cells were stimulated <i>in vitro <\/i>with CD3\/CD28 microbeads and IL-2 in conditioned medium (CM) from vector or POFUT1-OE lines. CD8+ T cells cultured in CM from POFUT1-OE lines had significantly lower levels of activation markers (CD45 (p=0.0022), CD8 (p=0.0095), CD25 (p=0.0069, CD69 (p=0.0099)), reduced proliferation (CFSE, p=0.1281), and generated less ATP (Cell-Titer Glo, p=0.0003) than CD8+ T cells cultured in vector CM. In pan-cancer correlational analyses, POFUT1 is in the top 5% of genes most inversely correlated with Tsig in 12\/24 solid tumor types annotated in TCGA (SKCM, THCA, COAD, READ, LUSC, CESC, KIRC, STAD, HNSC, KIRP, LIHC, UCEC p&#60;0.0001). POFUT1 is robustly negatively correlated with T cell infiltration in many cancer types. We observed a positive association in CRC between POFUT1 and NOTCH signaling, and observed that POFUT1 expression reduced CD8+ T cell activity, potentially through upregulation of extracellular factors (in progress). Our findings fit a model where POFUT1 amplification in CRC promotes CD8+ T cell dysfunction as a mechanism of immune escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Colorectal cancer,Immunosuppression,Notch-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Calvin  J.

Genomic instability, characteristic of OS, can stimulate the cGAS-STING pathway and activate the innate immune system. Tumor-intrinsic STING pathway silencing mechanisms can link genomic instability to immune evasion in OS. We hypothesize that dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway suppresses an innate immune response to genomic instability and plays a key role in tumor progression through establishing an immunosuppressive TME in OS. Using a novel panel of 11 OS patient-derived cell lines, we have identified two groups in terms of capacity for tumor-intrinsic STING activation, and we aim to unravel the mechanism of STING repression in a subset of OS tumors. To investigate the effects of tumor-intrinsic STING activation on macrophage polarization we employed tumor conditioned media (TCM) assays with murine-derived macrophages and tumor lines treated with cGAS-STING agonism. Tumor-intrinsic STING activation resulted in a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in a manner dependent on tumor STING. Lastly, we performed bulk RNA seq of OS PDX cell lines treated with STING agonist, defining for the first time the OS-specific STING activation signature. We then evaluated primary patient samples for evidence of this signature by single sample GSEA and performed survival analysis after stratifying samples as high or low for this signature, which demonstrated a significant protective effect of the STING activation signature on progression-free and overall survival. We have defined two subtypes of OS in terms of responsiveness to STING activation and demonstrated that STING activation has a protective effect in the human disease, which is the foundation of current efforts to identify targetable mechanism to reverse STING unresponsiveness and activate immune surveillance in this cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Innate immunity,Interferons,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

High-throughput gene knockout and gene inhibition screens have been instrumental in identifying key drivers of such mechanisms, yet often uncovering gene activity that is essential but not sufficient for response. Here we set out to leverage gene activation as an orthogonal approach to identify novel regulators of the cancer-immune interface. First, we performed CRISPR activation screens in melanoma cells co-cultured with antigen-specific primary CD8+ T cells. Our findings revealed a collection of novel genes that substantially sensitize melanoma cells to targeted T cell-driven elimination when activated, including DNA damage and unfolded protein response genes (e.g., ETS1, TSPYL2), Wnt ligands (e.g., WNT3A, WNT1), and others that are deleterious only in combination with targeting T cells. Among the resistance genes we found regulators of insulin signaling (e.g., HGF, TCF7L2) and numerous glycoproteins (e.g., PDPN, CD44). Second, we validated top novel hits in 2D and in 3D spheroid models, using optical readouts to investigate their impact on cancer cell elimination and cancer-T-cell spatial dynamics. Third, we performed a Perturb-seq screen to stratify dozens of hits into functional groups based on the transcriptional readouts in the cancer cells. Lastly, we developed an in situ Perturb-Seq method, where we combine high-plex spatial transcriptomic readouts at subcellular resolution with in situ detection of genetically modified cells, and applied it to track the impact of the (de)sensitizing perturbations not only on the cancer cells themselves, but also on T cell recruitment and suppression. Taken together, our study provides a catalog of immune evasion mechanisms and an array of novel targets, demonstrating that synthetic gene activation can diminish immune evasion and open novel avenues for development of agonist-based and RNA-based interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,CRISPRa Screening,Cytotoxic T cell,Spatial Transcriptomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The author investigated the role of KAI1 COOH-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN) in mediating this immunosuppression, focusing on its effect on cytokine secretion and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) profiles in the TME.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Using cytokine array and Luminex multiplex assays, the author evaluated cytokine secretion in KITENIN-modulated GL261 cells.

Conventional T-cell-based immunotherapies are ineffective against PDAC liver metastases due to the intricate hepatic tumor microenvironment (TME) that hinders effective immune responses. Thus, it is vital to promote the influx of cytotoxic lymphocytes and prime antitumor immunity. PDAC cells exhibit plasticity and intrinsic cellular heterogeneity, leading to varying immune cell infiltrates and immune responses. Concurrently, early metastases to the liver create an immunosuppressive environment. Our study employs multiple PDAC models, originating from a congenic array of distinct PDAC cell clone tumors with varying degrees of T cell infiltration to delineate the signaling pathways that lead to immunosuppression in the pancreas and liver.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The compendium of congenic PDAC murine cell clones mirrors immune heterogeneity observed in tumors, spanning from low to high T cell infiltration. To overcome a scarcity of tumor-specific neoepitopes in PDAC, we engineered PDAC cell clones expressing chicken ovalbumin (OVA) for antigen-specific T and B cell responses. By subcutaneous and intraportal vein injection of PDAC cell clones into mice, we induce primary pancreatic and metastatic liver tumors to explore immune phenotypes and assess anti-tumor adaptive immune responses, including myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In vivo engraftment of PDAC clones showed varied CD4+\/CD8+ T cells and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells, accentuated with immunogenic OVA antigen expression. While all OVA+ PDAC lines elicited antigen-specific immune responses, only &#8216;TIL high&#8217; tumors were eradicated, while &#8216;TIL low&#8217; clones persisted in vivo. Additionally, &#8216;TIL low&#8217; clones formed liver metastases upon intraportal injection, despite OVA expression. RNAseq unveiled differential expression in IL-1 family cytokines and receptors, chemokine-like factor gene superfamily, parathyroid hormone relevant function and metabolism. Current investigations include altering these pathways to re-program the tumor microenvironment and induce local immune suppression.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Using diverse PDAC models, we created tumors with immune heterogeneity and altered transcriptional profiles. We identified validated differentially expressed immune altering cytokines, such as CXCL1 and CSF3, and potential novel IL-1 family genes and parathyroid signaling genes. The altered TME conferred protection against tumor antigen-specific immunity in certain clones, both in subcutaneous and liver metastasis models.

Thereby, GAB2 amplifies the signaling output of the SHP2\/Ras\/ERK, PI3K\/AKT and STAT5 pathways, leading to survival, proliferation and migration. Beside these physiological functions, GAB2 is often overexpressed or hyperphosphorylated in different types of cancer, in particular melanoma, breast cancer and various leukemia entities. Previous studies demonstrated that mice with constitutive <i>Gab2<\/i> deficiency are protected against breast cancer, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia driven by HER2, BCR::ABL1 and FLT3-ITD, respectively. While these studies support a critical role in tumor initiation, nothing is known about the relevance of GAB2 for tumor maintenance and progression. To this end, we have developed two novel conditional loss- and gain-of-function mouse models to further analyze the role of GAB2 in cancer.<br \/>In the first model, the transgenic GAB2 mouse, GAB2 is expressed under the control of the TET-O promotor, allowing the tetracycline dependent expression in tissues expressing a tetracycline trans activator (tTA). We have already started by crossing in the SCLtTA mouse, in which tTA is expressed under the control of the murine stem cell leukemia 3&#8217; enhancer. Here we show that the expression of transgenic GAB2 is tightly regulated by tetracycline and restricted to hematopoietic cells. This system is now perfectly suited to analyze the role of GAB2 in hematologic malignancies. By expressing tTA under different promotors, we propose that GAB2 overexpression can be directed to other organs or cell types. Combining this mouse line with cancer mouse models will allow to study the role of GAB2 in different cancer entities.<br \/>With the second mouse model, the conditional <i>Gab2<\/i> KO mouse, it is possible to study the therapeutic potential of GAB2 impairment <i>in vivo<\/i>. In this mouse, exon three of the <i>Gab2<\/i> gene is flanked by LoxP sites. This allows for its CRE recombinase mediated deletion, leading to GAB2 deficiency. The combination of this mouse model with inducible and tissue specific CRE strains will allow to analyze the role of GAB2 in various cancer mouse models. To demonstrate the efficient conditional deletion of exon 3, we first crossed in the tamoxifen inducible ROSA26 CreERT2 mouse line. So far, we were able to show the functionality of this system <i>in vitro<\/i> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from the conditional <i>Gab2<\/i> KO mouse. In a next step we will verify the results <i>in vivo<\/i> and will cross this mouse line with a mouse model for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) to investigate the therapeutic potential of GAB2 in CML.<br \/>In summary, we are convinced that these two novel mouse models will help to identify GAB2 as a potential target or biomarker in various cancer entities. In particular, the conditional approach will allow to alter GAB2 expression in already established tumors, thus mimicking pharmacological targeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Cancer,GAB2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In the context of cancer, understanding the repertoire of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) presented by MHC molecules (or HLA molecules in human) is crucial for deciphering how the immune system recognizes and responds to malignant cells. The identification of neoantigens, unique to individual tumors due to somatic mutations, has become a focal point in immunopeptidomic studies. One significant hurdle in systematic immunopeptidomics analysis is the high input material requirement. Here, we present a semi-automated workflow to robustly identify and quantify immunopeptides from reduced amounts of clinical tissue biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. At the core of immunopeptidomics is the enrichment of HLA-associated peptides, followed by identification using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. We optimized the native lysis and a sequential immunoprecipitation workflow for both class I and class II immunopeptides while ensuring scalability and reproducibility. Leveraging the magnetic properties of the beads, 1,000 samples can be processed within a week by a single operator. For both tissue and PBMC samples, we performed a systematic ramping experiment starting with as little as 2.5mg tissue or 5 million PBMCs. In all experiments, The established sample preparation offers high reproducibility and identifications of good quality: 1) Class-I immunopeptides: &#62;60% of the peptides identified are 9-mers, &#62;80% predicted strong binders, and the expected amino acids are enriched at the anchor positions; 2) Class-II immunopeptides, &#62;50% of the peptides identified are 14-to-16-mers, and &#62;50% are predicted strong binders. Furthermore, the pipeline is highly sensitive as we could still identify over 2,800 class-I immunopeptides when processing 2.5 mg fresh frozen tissue and 2,000 - 3,000 class-I immunopeptides when starting from 5 million PBMCs. Furthermore, the developed immunopeptidomics workflow was deployed to profile a cohort of 12 cancerous and matched healthy lung tissue samples. Their Class-I immunopeptidomes clearly displayed a pattern where matched tissues from each subject cluster together, further underlining the fact that the intricate immune-tumor interface is highly personalized. Overall, we established a robust pipeline for for class-I and II immunopeptidome profiling from clinically relevant sample types. Taking advantage of the nature of mass spectrometry-based methods, customized targeted assays can be developed without the need for affinity reagent, allowing specific and absolute quantification of any immunopeptide of interest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HLA class I,Mass spectrometry,HLA class II,Immunopeptidomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

However, the the ability for myeloid clonal pathogenic variants (MCPV) to elicit an antigen-driven host antileukemia immune response is not well characterized. A better understanding on how cellular immunity selectively discriminates leukemia-related &#8220;neopeptides&#8221; could uncover mechanisms supporting tumor genome evolution.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 122 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were included and 111 had available protein coding sequences. A neopeptide library was created using protein FASTA coding extracted for individual myeloid clonal mutations via National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Patient class 1 HLA typing was obtained through Tempus, and Genomic Testing Cooperative laboratories. Prediction of number and strength of AML neopeptide bindings to MHC class I molecules were obtained via NetMHCPan-1. Analysis was performed with K-means algorithm assigning age at diagnosis, detected MCPV, number of neopeptides binding (as continuous variable), overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) as variables. Unsupervised data input allowed 3 cluster partitions for differential survivals allowing HLA class 1 peptide binding aggregation with potential roles in leukemogenesis and patient outcome. Descriptive statistics were performed with SAS.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Sixty-six different MCPV were detected. Of 111 patients, 70 (63%) with available MCPV produced at least 1 MHC I neopeptide binding. Frequently observed variants were <i>P53<\/i><i> <\/i>(13%)<i>, FLT3 <\/i>(9.2%)<i>, WT1 <\/i>(7%)<i>, DNMT3A <\/i>(6.5%)<i>, RAS <\/i>(5%)<i>, ASXL1 <\/i>(4.3%)<i>, RUNX1 <\/i>(4.2%)<i>, NPM1 <\/i>(4.2%)<i> <\/i>and<i> IDH1\/2 <\/i>(2.6%). Cluster 2 demonstrated a lack of favorable and higher proportion of adverse ELN 2022 subgroups. Cluster 3 exhibited a higher of <i>P53<\/i> [<i>p<\/i>=0.03] and MDS-related mutations. OS was 79, 239, and 1551 days for cluster 2,1 and 3, respectively [<i>p<\/i>=0.0001]. EFS was 134, 363 and 451 days for cluster 2,1 and 3, respectively [<i>p<\/i>=0.0001]. Interestingly, Cluster 2 and 3 assembled the highest probability for peptide binding [1 v 2 v 3 = 1.76% v 36.6% v 62%, <i>p<\/i>=0.01]. Lastly, albeit in low frequencies, higher diversity of DNA repairing enzymes was seen in cluster 2.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b><b> <\/b> Different MCPV arising in AML genome are variably immunogenic and leukemia-related neopeptide binding&#8217;s ability is differentially expressed in our 3 clusters. Frequent neopeptide bindings in clusters 2 and 3 may reflect higher AML immunogenicity resulting in genomic instability. It is possible that less &#8220;edited&#8221; genomes in cluster 1 preserve higher chemosensitivity resulting in better OS, while highly edited genomes in cluster 2 and 3 are less chemo-sensitive and circumvent host immunosurveillance. Further expansion of cluster 2 is necessary to better understand the role of DNA repairing enzymes in younger patients&#8217; outcomes, especially when genomic instability is observed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,HLA class I,Immuno-oncology,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

However, not all cases with motif neoepitopes exhibit favorable ICB outcomes.<br \/>Methods: As proof-of-concept, participants from our published NSCLC ICB cohort with available pre-treatment archival tissue were selected based on HLA supertype B44, predicted motif neoepitopes, and best response of progressive disease (PD) vs partial\/complete response (PR\/CR). Whole exome sequencing, HLA typing and neoepitope prediction were previously performed (Cummings 2020). GeoMx slides were prepared, hybridized with RNA probes and stained with antibodies to cytokeratin (CK), nuclear material and CD45 per manufacture instructions (Geiss 2008). Antibody to CD8 (Novus) was optimized at 1:50 dilution. Twelve regions of interest (ROI) were selected per sample including the following compartments: CK+CD8+, CK+CD8-, CK-CD8+ and CK-CD8- (negative control). Each ROI included ~150 nuclei selected using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Novaseq 6000 (50bpx2) demultiplexed using Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.19.1.403. Raw reads were normalized and compared using paired student&#8217;s T-tests with Tukey&#8217;s correction via R v4.1. Neoepitope (non\/motif) comparisons used matched numbers per sample selected by highest expression.<br \/>Results: Seven participants (3 PD, 3 PR, 1 CR) were included, each exhibiting 1-7 motif neoepitopes without HLA loss of heterozygosity. 84 ROI included 24 CK+CD8+, 24 CK+CD8-, 24 CK-CD8+ and 12 CK-CD8- with at least one ROI per category per participant. PD samples had fewer CD8+ ROI (12 vs 36) and lower CXCL9 (p=0.011) and CD274 (p=0.014). HLA-A\/B\/C expression followed a gradient with highest expression in CK+CD8+ ROI with limited detection in CK-CD8- ROI. Among HLA, HLA-B had highest median expression (A: 226, B: 650, C: 202; p&#60;0.001). In CK+ ROI, motif neoepitope expression was detectable for all participants but not statistically different from non-motif expression (p=0.23). HLA-A\/B\/C all exhibited lower expression in PD CK+ ROI (p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: HLA expression may modify prediction of clinically meaningful neoepitopes and response to ICB.

STK11 mutations in NSCLC are associated with higher levels of ULK1\/2-mediated macroautophagy, resulting in localization of MHC-I to autophagosomes and lysosomes leading to its degradation and decreased antigen presentation. Knockdown of ULK1\/2 can restore surface MHC-I in highly autophagic cell lines. Here, we show that inhibition of ULK1\/2 decreases macroautophagy, resulting in increased antigen processing and presentation (APP) and MHC-I levels in cancer cells, supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of ULK1\/2 will restore antigen presentation in NSCLC STK11mut tumors.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>: TCGA datasets were analyzed to determine transcriptional differences in autophagy and APP between STK11 WT and mutant NSCLC tumors. CRISPR was used to stably knockout STK11 in multiple human NSCLC cell lines to generate isogenic pairs. mRNA and protein levels of APP machinery in NSCLC cell lines were assessed using qPCR, western blots, and flow cytometry. CRISPR was additionally used to knockout ULK1 and ULK2 in human STK11 mutant A549 cells. ULK1\/2 tool compounds were synthesized based on existing patent literature. Effects of the combination of ULK1\/2 inhibition with low levels of IFN&#947; on surface MHC-I levels were evaluated in several NSCLC cell lines by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>: NSCLC tumors with loss of function mutations or deletion of STK11 display increased transcription of genes in the ULK complex and reduced transcription of genes necessary for APP. STK11mut and KO NSCLC cell lines also display lower levels of APP at the mRNA and protein levels. Double knockout of ULK1 and ULK2 in A549 cells is not cytotoxic and results in decreased autophagy as well as increased immunoproteasome components and cell surface MHC-I. ULK inhibition reduces autophagy and restores APP at the protein level, but not at the transcriptional level, in all NSCLC cell lines evaluated. Combination of very low concentrations of IFN&#947; with ULK inhibition demonstrates additive increases in MHC-I greater than either single-agent treatment alone.<br \/><b>CONCLUSIONS<\/b>: STK11mut\/del is associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC and leads to increased ULK-induced autophagy and decreased APP. ULK inhibition increases APP and surface MHC-I levels in STK11mut cell lines. In the presence of low concentrations of IFN&#947;, ULK1\/2 inhibition restores APP in NSCLC STK11mut cell lines to the levels seen in NSCLC STK11 WT cell lines. The data presented here provides a rationale for targeting ULK1\/2 to amplify immune recognition in immunologically cold tumors with high autophagy to increase responses to immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,STK11,Antigen presentation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
