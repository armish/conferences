Although ELANE attenuates tumor growth and induces anti-tumor immunity following intratumoral delivery (Cui et al., Cell, 2021), systemic delivery is stymied by the presence of serine protease inhibitors in blood (eg. alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) which rapidly inhibit its enzymatic activity essential for its anti-cancer function. To overcome this challenge, we developed N17465, an enzyme that resists serine protease inhibitors in blood, and tested its effects on tumor growth, both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.&#8239;<br \/>Methods.&#8239; Enzymatic properties:&#8239;N17465 enzymatic activity was quantified in the +\/- of A1AT or plasma in vitro, and in blood following intravenous (I.V) injection into tumor-bearing mice. Enzyme activity assays included a fluorogenic substrate AAPV-AMC and the C-terminal domain of CD95 (amino acids212-335).&#8239; Anti-cancer properties:&#8239;For in vitro studies, cells were treated with N17465 and viability was quantified by calcein-AM and immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers. Cancer\/non-cancer cells included human\/murine cell lines and primary cells from ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients. For in vivo studies, N17465 was injected I.V and effects on tumor growth, immunology and survival were assessed as monotherapy or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA4) in pre-clinical models.&#8239;<br \/>Results.&#8239; N17465 maintained enzymatic activity following incubation with A1AT or mouse\/human plasma in vitro, and following I.V injection into CT26 tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Importantly, protecting N17465 from serine protease inhibitors did not interfere with its ability to cleave CD95 (therapeutic target) or selectively kill cancer cells in vitro. Indeed, N17465 induced ICD markers, killed a wide range of murine\/human cancer cells and also well tolerated by non-cancer cells. Systemically delivered N17465 produced durable tumor regression in a murine CT26 colon cancer model resulting in ~50% tumor-free mice, induced a favorable immune profile, and synergized with anti-CTLA4. N17465 also exhibited efficacy across a range of xenograft models spanning human colon, prostate, and lung cancer, as well as OvCa patient-derived CDX models.&#8239;<br \/>Conclusions.&#8239; Altogether, our data demonstrate that N17465 selectively kills cancer cells, produces durable responses in mice, induces favorable immunology and synergies with checkpoint inhibitors in pre-clinical models. Its ability to maintain enzymatic activity in blood following systemic delivery, selectively kill a wide range of cancer cells, and stimulate anti-tumor immunity warrants further investigation of this unique therapeutic modality across a wide range of solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Cancer cell,Ovarian cancer,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

It is highly expressed in various human epithelial cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. DS-3939a is a TA-MUC1 targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) structurally composed of a humanized anti-TA-MUC1 antibody, an enzymatically cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) with a high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). In this study, the pharmacological activity of DS-3939a was evaluated using preclinical in vitro and in vivo models.<br \/>Methods: TA-MUC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Binding specificity of DS-3939a was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Induction of DNA damage and apoptosis to cancer cells by DS-3939a treatment were detected by Simple Western System. In vitro cell growth inhibitory and in vivo antitumor activities of DS-3939a were evaluated using various cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/>Results: Many specimens across multiple cancer types showed positive staining for TA-MUC1, with a particularly high positive rate observed in bladder, lung, and breast cancers. DS-3939a specifically bound to aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 peptides by recognizing both the glycan and backbone peptide moiety of MUC1. In vitro, DS-3939a inhibited the growth of TA-MUC1-positive cancer cells but not of TA-MUC1-negative cancer cells. Neither a parental anti-TA-MUC1 antibody nor isotype control ADC inhibited the growth of these cells. In addition, treatment with DS-3939a and DXd alone induced DNA damage and apoptosis in cancer cells. These results demonstrate that DS-3939a exhibits TA-MUC1-dependent cell growth inhibition through DXd-mediated cytotoxic effect. Moreover, DS-3939a exhibited significant antitumor effects in the several TA-MUC1-positive cancer cell line-derived xenograft models and various PDX models. DS-3939a also induced strong tumor regression even after treatment of other cytotoxic ADCs in several xenograft models.<br \/>Conclusion: Based on these preclinical results, DS-3939a could provide valuable therapy with potential benefits for patients with TA-MUC1-expressing tumors. A first-in-human phase 1\/2 study in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently in progress (NCT05875168).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,MUC1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Small molecule TKIs and amivantamab have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer with relevant actionable genomic alterations (AGA), and monoclonal antibodies offer treatment options for EGFR-expressing head and neck and colorectal cancers without AGA. Yet high unmet need in these tumors still exists. We sought to develop an EGFR and cMET dual-targeting ADC using our proprietary technology platform with carefully chosen design features for the many tumors expressing EGFR and cMET with or without AGA. PRO1286 is comprised of a monovalent bispecific human IgG1 (dubbed as &#8220;Bsab&#8221;) with fine-tuned affinity on EGFR and cMET, and the proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-based linker-drug, sesutecan. Sesutecan previously demonstrated promising characteristics in preclinical studies with multiple targets and conferred an encouraging benefit:risk profile in the clinic with a FR&#945;-directed ADC (rinatabart sesutecan). PRO1286 at DAR8 displays high hydrophilicity and excellent stability and developability in vitro. PRO1286 binds selectively and specifically to each target with a low nanomolar EC<sub>50<\/sub> in the CHO-K1 cells overexpressing each target. PRO1286 exhibited efficient internalization (~50-80% internalized in 4 hrs) and strong cytotoxicity (sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>) against a broad panel of tumor cell lines with higher potency than the parent mAbs. PRO1286 produced marked and dose dependent anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models encompassing a wide range of target expression levels, tumor types (head and neck, lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal), and genomic landscape (with or without AGA in EGFR or cMET; with diverse additional co-mutations). Sustained tumor growth inhibition or complete remission was observed in several xenograft models after treatment with a single dose (2 mg\/kg) of PRO1286. PRO1286 was more efficacious than benchmarking molecules in the mouse studies. In an exploratory toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, PRO1286 was well tolerated at 30 mg\/kg with the main toxicity being payload-driven and residing in bone marrow. PRO1286 exhibited a stable PK profile that was similar to that of the Bsab in rats and favorable PK characteristics in monkeys. In summary, PRO1286 demonstrated promising physiochemical properties, PK\/PD, antitumor activity, and tolerability in preclinical studies. It may carry an expanded therapeutic index compared to other EGFR- and\/or cMET-directed ADCs. It may also differentiate from existing EGFR- and\/or cMET-targeting agents on broad coverage of EGFR and cMET-expressing tumors with or without the respective AGAs. Effort is under way to advance a DAR optimized molecule to the clinic for the treatment of many EGFR- or cMET-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),c-Met,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

Although significant progress has been made in cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy in recent years, the long-term prognosis of patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is still poor. Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy is the first-line standard of care (SOC) for HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. Two ADC drugs targeting HER2, DS-8201 and RC-48, have also been approved for the treatment of gastric cancer. However, their limited clinical benefits and occurrence of adverse events still present a significant challenge. Therefore, minimizing the off-target toxicity and collateral damage while achieving significant chemotherapy efficacy has become the focus of gastric cancer treatment. DX126-262 is a novel HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), generated by conjugating a Tubulysin B analogue to a recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody through a linker containing branched hydrophilic polyethylene glycol, using thiol-maleimide chemistry to achieve drug antibody ratio (DAR) of 3.8. Previous studies have confirmed that DX126-262 monotherapy showed excellent efficacy in HER2-positive gastric cancer NCI-N87 cells in vitro and in vivo. And the efficacy has also been demonstrated in clinical trials (now in phase II, CTR20211871). Based on above results, we intended to further explore whether combination therapy of DX126-262 with Cisplatin and 5-FU can improve the anti-tumor efficacy compared with SOC (Herceptin plus Cisplatin and 5-FU) or DS-8201 monotherapy. The triple-drug combination therapy demonstrated much better therapeutic efficacy than single drug (DX126-262, Cisplatin, 5-FU, Herceptin, or DS-8201) or double-drug combination (Cisplatin plus 5-FU) or SOC (Herceptin plus Cisplatin and 5-FU) on human gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, triple-drug combination therapy did not exhibit superimposed toxicity, judging by the body weight of mice and hemal biochemistry assays. These results suggested that DX126-262 plus Cisplatin and 5-FU might be a promising strategy for treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer in clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Drug delivery,Gastric cancer,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"X.

To overcome these limitations and the mechanism of resistance to EV, IPH45, a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor ADC targeting Nectin-4 with an improved therapeutic index, was developed.<br \/>Methods: <i>In vitro<\/i> studies were performed to investigate internalization, tumor cell killing and bystander effect, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies were performed on cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) of triple negative breast cancer, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of urothelial carcinoma and syngeneic tumor models expressing human Nectin-4. IPH45 efficacy was compared to EV. Toxicology studies to determine the dose range were conducted in rat and non-human primates (NHP).<br \/>Results: IPH45 consists of a humanized IgG1 targeting a unique epitope in human Nectin-4, non-overlapping with EV, a cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor with a high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). <i>In vitro<\/i>, IPH45 is internalized upon binding to its target and induces direct killing of Nectin-4<sup> <\/sup>expressing tumor cells as well as bystander killing of Nectin-4 non-expressing tumor cells in mixed culture. IPH45 mediates ADCC and complement-mediated killing. IPH45 demonstrates activity in CDX and PDX models with similar effective dose as EV. Moreover, IPH45 shows anti-tumor efficacy i<i>n vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in primary and secondary EV resistant models. In dose-range finding toxicology studies in rats and NHP, IPH45, unlike EV, does not elicit skin toxicity. IPH45 remains well tolerated up to the highest dose tested, suggesting a potentially larger therapeutic index than MMAE-based ADCs. Pharmacokinetic analyses in mice, rats, and NHP show minimal release of free toxin in the serum and half-life compatible with Q2W or less frequent dosing schedules in clinic.<br \/>Conclusion: IPH45 is a topoisomerase I ADC targeting Nectin-4 with the potential for larger therapeutic index than EV, improved safety and dosing regimen, and ability to overcome primary and secondary resistance to EV or other Nectin-4 ADC in development. IPH45 is progressing to the clinic where the translatability of this unique profile into improved patient outcomes will be assessed across indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Nectin-4,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Romain Remark<sup><\/sup>, Cécile Bonnafous<sup><\/sup>, Laura Chiossone<sup><\/sup>, Caroline Soulas<sup><\/sup>, Cyril Perrier<sup><\/sup>, Guillaume Habif<sup><\/sup>, Sivan Bokobza<sup><\/sup>, Aurélie Maguer<sup><\/sup>, Rachel Courtois<sup><\/sup>, Julie Lopez<sup><\/sup>, Grégory Fenaux<sup><\/sup>, Olivier Benac<sup><\/sup>, Barbara Carrette<sup><\/sup>, Robin Letay-Drouet<sup><\/sup>, Raja Bonifay<sup><\/sup>, Séverine Augier<sup><\/sup>, Léa Simon<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Rossi<sup><\/sup>, Ariane Morel<sup><\/sup>, Agnès Represa<sup><\/sup>, <b>Nicola Beltraminelli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yannis Morel<sup><\/sup>, Carine Paturel<sup><\/sup>, Eric Vivier<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Innate Pharma, Marseille, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e43bcd53-b7b0-44f9-9ea9-fb42c1191aca","ControlNumber":"4549","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

We previously identified a unique cancer-associated isoform of the protein, termed caPCNA, which allows for structure-based drug discovery studies to develop inhibitors for selective therapeutic targeting of cancer cells. Distinct strategies have been used to develop caPCNA targeting agents, which includes peptide and small molecule-based compounds, although the success in developing therapeutically tractable compounds has been limited so far. Here, we present the crystal structures and corresponding biochemical characterizations of our novel small molecule-based caPCNA inhibitors, which bind into the PIP-box binding pocket of PCNA. Our lead compound selectively kills cancer cells, and it appears to induce replication stress, apoptosis and increase cancer cell sensitivity to genotoxic agents, while these effects are not observed in non-malignant cell controls. This caPCNA inhibitor is orally administrable, metabolic stable and it suppresses tumor growth as a monotherapy or as a combination treatment and is now an investigational new drug in Phase 1 clinical trials. PCNA plays a critical role enabling the replication fork to proceed from transcription replication conflict sites, by temporarily dislodging RNA polymerase II. Thus, structure-based drug discovery against caPCNA may open a novel therapeutic avenue for the development of selective chemotherapeutics, through targeting a cancer cell&#8217;s vulnerability to unresolved transcription replication conflicts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Therapeutic target,Small molecule inhibitor,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

One such recently described mechanism involves the transcriptional hyperactivation of genes associated with interferon (IFN) signaling, JAK\/STAT, and antigen processing\/presentation pathways. Aberrant IFN regulation in the setting of AR suggests that tumor cell intrinsic mechanisms have conferred a growth advantage despite the presence of immune-mediated pressure unleashed by PD-1\/L1 antibody blockade. Analysis of transcripts progressively upregulated during acquisition of AR <i>in vivo<\/i> and transcripts upregulated by IFN exposure of isolated AR cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 as a candidate mediator of the AR phenotype. A specific pocket on the PRY\/SPRY domain of TRIM7 has been shown to bind viral peptides, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation as a mechanism to mitigate viral propagation. Here we describe the evaluation of small molecule inhibitors (SMI) designed to the TRIM7 PRY\/SPRY viral-pocket domain, where binding specificity was confirmed using mass spec analysis. These SMI competitively inhibited TRIM7 mediated stabilization of RACO-1, resulting in decreased cancer cell proliferation which was associated with altered c-Jun\/AP-1 transcription. TRIM7 SMI also disrupted STING and MAVS ubiquitination and restored IFN responsiveness and sensitivity to PD-1 inhibitor treatment. Finally, given the position of TRIM7 downstream of growth factor receptor and kras signaling, combination of TRIM7 inhibitors with kras, braf, and\/or MEK inhibitors was shown to additively suppress proliferation of tumor cells with kras mutations. These results provide evidence that upregulation of TRIM7 mediates both a pro-proliferative and IFN resistant phenotype in the setting of CPI-AR, and that inhibition of TRIM7 with small molecule inhibitors may prevent or reverse AR to PD-1\/L1 blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Ubiquitination,Small molecule inhibitor,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.-A.
