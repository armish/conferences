[{"Abstract":"In cancer treatment, overcoming drug resistance remains a formidable challenge. The oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 is widely recognized for its crucial role in promoting drug resistance to various chemotherapeutic and target therapies. Its involvement is attributed to pivotal pathways, encompassing cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Despite its prominent role in tumor drug resistance, achieving modulation of FoxM1 using small molecule therapeutics has proven elusive. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, is known to induce a significant upregulation of FoxM1. In this study, we demonstrate that our novel compound A3 leads to a robust dose-dependent reduction of FoxM1 driven by 5-FU in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. Notably, exposure of 5-FU-treated HT-29 cells to A3 was shown to promote apoptosis via pro-apoptotic factors, including PUMA. The mechanism of action was further elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of cell signaling molecules. This study presents an innovative approach using small molecule modulators to control FoxM1 levels, providing profound insights for potential therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Drug resistance,Small molecule drugs,FOXM1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The ETS family is composed of 28 members, all of which share an ETS DNA-binding domain. Chromosomal rearrangements that lead to the overexpression of specific ETS promote oncogenic transformation and tumor development. More than half of prostate tumors are driven by aberrant expression of an ETS protein. Our lab has demonstrated that oncogenic ETS form essential interactions with a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein, EWS, to promote prostate tumorigenesis. A similar mechanism exists in Ewing sarcoma (ES). ES tumors are driven by the expression EWS\/ETS fusion proteins. This project focuses on the similarities and differences between oncogenic ETS in prostate cancer and EWS\/ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma.<br \/>We compared biological functions of the most common oncogenic ETS in prostate cancer, ERG, and the most common fusion in ES, EWS\/FLI1. Both ERG and EWS\/FLI1 promoted migration and clonogenic survival in normal prostate epithelial cell lines, RWPE1 and PNT2. These data suggest that the EWS-ERG complex and EWS\/FLI1 fusion protein can function similarly in prostate cells. Knockdown of endogenous EWS\/FLI1 in the ES cell line, A673, reduced anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar. Rescue with exogenous EWS\/FLI1 or EWS\/ERG restored colony formation relative to control. Wildtype ERG was unable to rescue colony formation in A673. This suggests that ERG and EWS\/FLI1 function differently in A673 cells. Pulldown assays from A673 lysates reveal that ERG interacts with EZH2 and FOXO1. Our lab has established that ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor through the formation of an ERG-EZH2-PRC2 complex. Others demonstrate that FOXO1 represses ERG activity by reducing its recruitment to the target sites. Both the N-terminal truncation of ERG and phosphorylation of ERG at S96 disrupted these interactions and rescued anchorage independent growth in A673 ES cells. These data suggest that EWS\/ETS fusions avoid transcriptional repression in Ewing tumors due to loss of the N-terminus of the ETS protein. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Ewing sarcoma,Transcription factor - ETS,EZH2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

The development and progression of GC is a complicated multistage process subjected to dynamic changes in gene regulation. Investigating the effects of these changes is therefore critical for improving our knowledge about GC initiation and progression. Kr&#252;ppel-like factors (KLFs) are evolutionarily conserved zinc finger-containing transcription factors with altered expressions and diverse regulatory functions in GC. We previously reported that there is loss of KLF4 in GC. Here we report that KLF4 is a crucial regulator of KLF5 expression and vice versa and together they regulate GC cell behavior.<br \/>Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and pan cancer data of differential expressions of KLFs in GC was analyzed. TCGA RNAseq and clinical data for the differential expression status of KLF genes in normal and cancerous tissues and the clinicopathological association was accessed from the UALCAN web portal. The expressions of KLF4 and KLF5 in human normal stomach and GC and orthotopic xenografts were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). KLF4, KLF5 cross regulation was evaluated by gene manipulation of each gene individually and checking the expression of the other factor in GC cells. The effect of KLFs on GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by Ki67 staining of tissues, PrestoBlue cell viability assay, scratch wound and transwell cell invasion assays.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: Our results indicated that not only KLF4 and KLF5 have contrasting expressions and effects in GC but also these two factors cross regulate each other. While lower expressions of KLF4 was found in human GC and orthotopic xenografts, increased expression of KLF5 was found in both human GC tissue and orthotopic xenografts. KLF4 silencing and CRISPR \/Cas9 knockdown in human GC cells resulted in increased expression of KLF5 which was associated with increased GC cell proliferation and invasiveness. Interestingly, KLF5 knockdown by CRISPR \/ Cas9 in human GC cells on the other hand resulted in increased expression of KLF4, which was associated with decreased GC cell growth. Our data therefore suggests that the differential expressions of KLF4 and KLF5 might serve as valuable prognostic markers in GC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Transcription factor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

ETS play essential roles in developmental processes, such as stem cell maintenance, blood vessel formation, and cellular fate. While absent in the normal prostate, four members of the ETS family become expressed in prostate tumors: ETV1, ETV4, ETV5 and ERG. Our lab has previously classified these proteins as oncogenic ETS for their ability to promote cellular migration in normal prostate epithelial RWPE1 cells. Transcription factors may need to interact with additional proteins to serve oncogenic roles. My research explores the interactions between 1) ETV1 and EWS, as well as 2) ERG and p53. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Our lab has established that ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 form essential interactions with EWS, a transcriptional coactivator that promotes ETS activity. In prostate tumors, chromosomal rearrangements result in the N-terminal truncations of ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5. I hypothesize that the EWS interaction domain is retained and that these truncated ETVs will remain oncogenic. Pulldown assays using purified full-length and truncated ETV1 suggests EWS interacts with both N-terminal and C-terminal portions ETV1. I am attempting to express truncated ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 in RWPE1 cells. Upon stable expression, I will evaluate their interactions with EWS and their ability to promote migration in vitro. To identify putative proteins that bridge EWS to ETV1, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry will be used. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Mutations in p53, a tumor suppressor protein, promote oncogenesis and occur in nearly half of all cancer cases. We hypothesize that mutant p53 interacts with ETS to promote its recruitment to new genomic sites. Previous studies demonstrate that mutant p53 binds ETS2 at a higher affinity than wildtype p53 and we have expanded this list of interacting ETS to include ERG. We seek to explore whether ERG and mutant p53 cooperate to promote oncogenic phenotypes. I successfully cloned wildtype p53, mutant p53 (R248W) and double-mutant p53 (R248W, T81A) into a retroviral backbone. I then transduced RWPE1-Vector and RWPE1-ERG expressing cells to express these constructs. Although additional replicates are needed, it appears that mutant p53 promotes colony formation in both cell types relative to wildtype p53. I plan to validate these observations and generate an appropriate negative control cell line before extending into a mouse model. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Through the continuation of this work, I will provide critical insight into the molecular mechanisms by which a subset of ETS factors achieve oncogenic function.

A subset of CRPC shows neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) features, which are associated with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic strategies. NEPC is characterized by oncogenic driver activation and epigenetic changes, partly controlled by transcription factors like BRN2 and SOX2. AR has been shown to suppress BRN2 transcription, which is required for NEPC, and BRN2-dependent regulation of the NEPC marker SOX2 (Bishop et al., 2017). Dordaviprone (ONC201\/TIC10) is a first-in-class small molecule that antagonizes DRD2, induces tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and activates the integrated stress response (ISR). Neuroendocrine tumors express significant DRD2 levels, suggesting ONC201 as a potential therapeutic strategy in NEPC or when drivers for disease progression are overexpressed (OE). PCa cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and 22RV1 are ONC201 sensitive, with IC50=2.87 &#956;M, 3.18 &#956;M, 1.31 &#956;M, and 1.16 &#956;M, respectively (Ding et al., 2023). To characterize the association of BRN2\/SOX2 dysregulation with ONC201 sensitivity, we transiently OE BRN2\/SOX2 in PCa. We hypothesized that markers of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), activation of the ISR, TRAIL, and ClpP and dopamine receptor expression contribute to NEPC cell death and sensitivity to ONC201. We performed CellTiter-Glo experiments to assess viability after 96 hours &#177; BRN2 OE. DU145 cells with BRN2 OE increased their sensitivity to ONC201 (IC50=2.75 &#181;M) compared to empty vector (IC50=3.03 &#181;M). Colony formation assays were conducted in PCa and analyzed 7 days after ONC201 treatment to show ONC201 effect on PCa cell lines. DU145 was treated at 0.5, 1, and 2 &#181;M of ONC201. There were 95 &#177; 3.22 colonies for the control group, 83 &#177; 5.22 colonies with 0.5 &#181;M, 74 &#177; 3.64 colonies with 1 &#181;M, and 8 &#177; 2.03 colonies with 2 &#181;M ONC201. DU145 showed a significant reduction in colony-forming ability when treated with 1 and 2 uM ONC201 compared to the control, with P values of &#60;0.05 and &#60;0.0001, respectively. We OE BRN2 and observed changes in NED markers and ISR pathway. In PC3, FoxO1 and ATF4 levels increased. In DU145, FoxO1, ENO2, PGP9.5, CgA, and ATF4 levels decreased. We reveal that DU145 OE at 48 hours does not result in greater expression of NEPC markers. BRN2 OE significantly increased PCa cell sensitivity to ONC201 and was evident without an increase in common phenotypical markers used for NEPC assessment (FoxO1, ENO2, PGP9.5, CgA). Expression change was not shown when PCa had an integral AR pathway. Ongoing efforts are observing ONC201 treatment effects on NED markers and the TRAIL pathway due to BRN2 OE and showing increased sensitivity of PCa to ONC201 with BRN2 OE.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Differentiation,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

This study highlights an unexpected, sex-biased role of the oncogene <i>Yap1<\/i> in SHH medulloblastoma (MB). We discovered that <i>Yap1<\/i> deletion in <i>SmoM2<\/i>-driven SHH MB significantly prolongs survival in male but not female mice. Using an integrated multi-omics approach, we show that YAP1 promotes cancer stem cell maintenance through concurrent transcriptional activation of stemness genes, such as <i>Sox2,<\/i> and repression of differentiation genes such as <i>NeuroD1<\/i> and <i>Zic1<\/i>\/2. Interestingly, while <i>Yap1<\/i> is essential for maintaining cancer stem cells in both sexes, it plays a more critical role in immune evasion in males. Specifically, YAP1 regulates the expression of an immune checkpoint molecule <i>Cd276<\/i> to suppress T cell function.

PPAR&#948; is upregulated in human GAC tissues, and its expression level is positively associated with human GAC grades and stages. However, the potential for targeting this tumorigenic effect of PPAR&#948;, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the impact of PPAR&#948; genetic deletion\/loss of function in VGPCs on <i>Helicobacter felis<\/i> (<i>H. felis<\/i>)-induced GAC carcinogenesis by orally exposing the mice carrying wild-type (WT) PPAR&#948; or genetically deleted PPAR&#948; in VGPCs to <i>H. felis <\/i>infection. We also examined the effect of PPAR&#948; inhibition by its specific antagonist, GSK3787, on PPAR&#948;-induced GAC carcinogenesis in mice. Furthermore, we conducted RNA-seq for transcriptomic profiling analysis and validated the results through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on the gastric tissues of those mice and the mice with WT PPAR&#948; or PPAR&#948; overexpression in VGPCs at ages 10, 25 and 55 weeks. We found that 1) PPAR&#948; genetic deletion in VGPCs significantly inhibited <i>H. felis-<\/i>induced gastric chronic inflammation and GAC carcinogenesis; GSK3787 significantly suppressed PPAR&#948;-induced GAC carcinogenesis in mice; 2) PPAR&#948; overexpression in VGPCs significantly enhanced while PPAR&#948; genetic deletion in VGPCs significantly inhibited ZBP1-induced necroptosis and the related inflammatory signaling pathways such as interferon-gamma signaling, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, and IL2-STAT5 signaling evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data, which were further validated by qRT-PCR; and 3) PPAR&#948; overexpression in VGPCs markedly increased the expression of CCL20 in gastric epithelial cells of the mice before (age 10 weeks) and after GAC initiation and progression (age 25 weeks-early stage GAC and age 55 weeks-late stage GAC), and gastric infiltrations of CCR6<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CCR6<sup>+<\/sup> tumor-associated macrophages, thereby creating a gastric tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. In contrast, PPAR&#948; genetic deletion in VGPCs or the administration of GSK3787 diet significantly reversed this PPAR&#948;-induced immune suppression in mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight the pivotal role of PPAR&#948; in VGPCs as a key host factor in GAC carcinogenesis, especially in individuals exposed to chronic <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection that could lead to an upregulation of PPAR&#948; expression. This suggests that targeting PPAR&#948; signaling could be a novel therapeutic approach for GAC prevention and therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,PPAR&#948;,necroptosis and inflammation ,tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Major challenges to improve patient outcomes are to overcome therapy resistance and to individually tailor therapy. Uncovering the molecular drivers of OC, especially in the most common subgroup high-grade serous (HGS), will help develop novel therapeutic strategies to meet these challenges.<br \/>Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we observed that a locus in 3q26.2, near the <i>EVI1 <\/i>oncogene, was the most significantly amplified region in HGS OC, occurring in more than 80% of those tumors. We validated these findings in an OC dataset from the Hartwig Medical Foundation and in OC cell lines from the DepMap database. Furthermore, HGS OC had the highest mean copy number of the 3q26.2 locus co-occurring with high mean <i>EVI1 <\/i>expression among all tumor entities in the pan-cancer TCGA dataset. These <i>EVI1<\/i> expression levels are significantly higher than in normal fallopian tube, from which HGS OC most likely arises. <i>EVI1<\/i> overexpression promotes leukemogenesis in 3q26-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as a result of chromosomal translocations that enable hijacking of hyperactive enhancers. Here, we hypothesize that <i>EVI1 <\/i>also plays a crucial role in OC development, but that its aberrant expression in this disease is driven by the amplification of yet undiscovered regulatory elements near <i>EVI1<\/i>.<br \/>We showed that EVI1-positive OC cell lines, of which the majority are HGS, are EVI1-dependent and harbor a ~200 kb amplified region near <i>EVI1<\/i>. This region interacts with the <i>EVI1<\/i> promoter (4C-Seq), is characterized by open chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and shows high levels of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac ChIP-Seq), suggesting the presence of an active enhancer. Furthermore, based upon H3K27ac signal, we identified within this region a super-enhancer of approximately 65 kb. In OC cell lines without detectable <i>EVI1<\/i> levels or cell lines from other cancer subtypes, such as breast and colon cancer, this location had no active enhancer and did not loop to the <i>EVI1<\/i> promoter.<br \/>Altogether, these data point to the generation of a hyperactive super-enhancer driving <i>EVI1<\/i> overexpression in OC. These findings emphasize the importance of epigenetic control in the regulation of <i>EVI1 <\/i>expression, as previously shown in 3q26-rearranged AML. Since OC tumor cell lines are strongly dependent on EVI1, interference with this super-enhancer, leading to loss of <i>EVI1<\/i> expression, could be exploited to inhibit tumor growth. For this purpose, we generated GFP-tagged <i>EVI1<\/i> cell line models (e.g. SKOV3), which will be used to discover small molecules to target the activity of this super-enhancer. In conclusion, we discovered a new mechanism of enhancer-mediated overexpression of the <i>EVI1<\/i> oncogene as a molecular driver in ovarian cancer, with possible implications for therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,EVI1,Epigenetics,Oncogenic enhancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Leonie Smeenk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sabrina Kruse<sup>2<\/sup>, Roger Mulet-Lazaro<sup>1<\/sup>, Ingrid Boere<sup>3<\/sup>, John Martens<sup>3<\/sup>, Stefan Gröschel<sup>4<\/sup>, Claudia Scholl<sup>5<\/sup>, Stefan Fröhling<sup>2<\/sup>, Ruud Delwel<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute and Oncode Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands,<sup>4<\/sup>Oncology Center Worms, Worms, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Applied Functional Genomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f02522e-a9ba-4014-be91-9a2e8b61dbc7","ControlNumber":"1142","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Instead, non-mutational mechanisms such as the deregulation of transcriptional or epigenetic programs typically promote the malignant progression and metastasis of melanoma. We have previously identified the small MAF transcription factor MAFG as a critical target of the melanoma suppressor miRNA miR-29, prompting an in-depth evaluation of the role of MAFG in melanoma. MAFG expression is elevated in melanoma compared to melanocytes and increases with tumor stage. Ectopic expression of MAFG in human melanocytes and melanoma cells enhances proliferation in vitro and promotes melanoma growth in vivo. Moreover, MAFG overexpression in Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>; Pten<sup>FL\/+<\/sup> mice accelerated melanomagenesis, significantly shortening overall survival. Despite being a critical NRF2 dimerization partner, NRF2 was dispensable for the effects of MAFG. Moreover, MAFG overexpression in melanoma cells had no effect on the activity of NRF2 transcriptional reporters, nor did it induce transcriptional programs associated with NRF2. RNA sequencing and pathway analysis revealed MAFG-mediated effects on melanoma-associated processes such hypoxia, the PI3K\/AKT pathway, and pigmentation. Indeed, MAFG induced HIF1a under normoxic conditions, enhanced AKT phosphorylation, and downregulated MITF and its target genes in the pigmentation pathway in melanoma cells. Interestingly, MAFG also potently enhanced AXL expression, suggesting that MAFG may promote melanoma, at least in part, by affecting the MITF\/AXL balance that is associated with melanoma phenotype switching. We next analyzed whether MAFG is required for melanoma. Interestingly, silencing MAFG in human melanoma cells robustly inhibited growth in vitro. Moreover, the CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knockout of MAFG in an aggressive Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>; Pten<sup>FL\/FL<\/sup> model potently prevented melanoma formation. Given the mild phenotype of MAFG whole-body knockout mice, our results suggest targeting of MAFG or its downstream pathways as a viable therapeutic approach in melanoma. In conclusion, our study establishes MAFG as a potent driver of melanoma development and nominates it as a therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Transcription factor,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"O.

The downstream transcription factor YAP within this pathway has been implicated in diverse oncogenic processes. YAP activation contributes to drug resistance, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes in many solid tumors. Conversely, YAP exhibits growth-suppressive effects in neuroendocrine (NE) solid cancers, a paradox that remains poorly understood. Analysis of RNAseq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) revealed a distinct classification of tumors into YAP1-expressing (YAP<sup>on<\/sup>) and non-expressing (YAP<sup>off<\/sup>) subgroups, with hematopoietic malignancies and NE solid tumors featured prominently in the latter. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, high-grade, NE carcinoma of the skin with two distinct etiologies. Virus-positive MCC contains integrated Merkel cell polyomavirus that expresses the viral T antigens and virus-negative MCC caused by sunlight exposure and extensive UV damage. Bulk RNAseq performed with more than 60 MCC tumors revealed that YAP expression displayed an inverse correlation with an NE gene expression signature. To gain insight into why YAP expression is so low in MCC, we generated MCC cell lines with inducible expression of YAP. Expression of YAP led to growth arrest and cell death. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify genes that when lost enable MCC cells to tolerate YAP expression. Functional enrichment analysis of the positively selected genes uncovered a variety of signaling pathways. Intriguingly, the CRISPR screen revealed a positive enrichment of non-canonical BAF complex members, including BRD9 and SMARCD1. To validate this finding, we treated MKL-1 cells with a BRD9 inhibitor, observing a substantial reduction in YAP toxicity. These findings open avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for high grade NE cancers, addressing a critical gap in our understanding of YAP biology in the context of MCC and beyond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Merkel cell carcinoma,YAP1,Hippo pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

In terms of genomic copy number alterations, concurrent amplification of MYC and loss of tumor suppressor PTEN is the strongest predictor of prostate cancer specific mortality. We have previously shown, in a novel mouse model, that combined MYC overexpression and Pten loss results in the development of precursor lesions (PIN) that lead to aggressive metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma, yet overexpression of MYC alone or Pten loss alone result only in precursor lesion development. Here, we performed genome wide transcriptome analysis using bulk RNA seq to obtain clues regarding the synergy between MYC overexpression and Pten loss. Prostates harboring PIN lesion were dissected from mice engineered to have MYC activation alone, Pten loss alone, and the combination thereof (BMPC mice), as well as invasive primary adenocarcinomas and metastatic lesions from BMPC mice. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) analysis separated the lesions into highly distinct groups. Genes contributing the most to the first principal component were related to inflammation and cell proliferation\/cell cycle progression by functional annotation. The proliferation-related genes were increased somewhat by MYC overexpression alone, were not increased Pten loss, and were more consistently increased by combined MYC overexpression and Pten loss in BMPC. Strikingly, mice with combined MYC overexpression and Pten loss showed approximately 2-4 fold higher Ki67 proliferation index than mice with MYC activation alone. PIN lesions driven by MYC overexpression or PTEN loss alone were characterized by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Among the pathways with the highest negative enrichment scores in PIN samples with PTEN loss were those that generally describe ribosome biogenesis and translation. PIN lesions with Pten loss showed lower hybridization signals for the 45S rRNA, which was increased by MYC alone and somewhat more in BMPC PIN lesions. Our results demonstrate that combined activation of MYC and Pten loss drive increased cell proliferation beyond that seen with either gene alteration alone. These findings suggest that a key part of the molecular mechanisms by which MYC and PTEN alterations may synergize to drive aggressive prostate cancer is related to increased tumor cell proliferation. Surprisingly, we uncovered the novel finding that Pten loss, in the absence of MYC overexpression, is associated with decreased expression of genes coding for proteins that mediate translation, as well as decreased 45S pre-rRNA. Since ribosome biogenesis is a key driver of cell proliferation, it is likely that loss of both copies of PTEN alone, in the absence of MYC overexpression, would be selected against in early lesions in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-02 Gene expression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,PTEN,Synergism,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Germline, mono-allelic, missense mutations in RUNX1 cause large deletions or truncations that are mostly loss-of-function mutations. They cause familial platelet disorder (RUNX1-FPD), which evolves into myeloid malignancy (FPD-MM), e.g., MDS or AML. Although curative in some patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation from matched, un-related donors carries the risk of GVHD and relapse in FPD-MM. Thus, there is a need for novel therapies to revert FPD-MM back to FPD. LINCS1000-CMap analysis, of the RUNX1 knockdown RNA-Seq signature revealed homoharringtonine (HHT or omacetaxine) and the anthelmintic fenbendazole (analog of mebendazole (MB)) as the top expression mimickers. In our current studies, we demonstrate that treatment with HHT or MB induced significantly greater loss of viability in seven patient-derived samples of FPD-MM vs RUNX1-FPD. Analyses conducted on BMA cells harvested longitudinally from the same patient at the RUNX1-FPD versus FPD-MM stage demonstrated greater chromatin accessibility in FPD-MM cells along with increased mRNA expressions of MYB, MECOM and BCL2. Following HHT treatment, scRNA-Seq analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in the HSC population, but concomitant increase in the macrophage population in FPD-MM. This was associated with positive enrichment of apoptosis signaling and TP53 targets gene-sets, while negatively enriching those of c-Myc targets. CyTOF analysis demonstrated that HHT treatment reduced c-Myc, EVI1, MCL1, BFL1 and CDK6 expression in phenotypically characterized FPD-MM stem-progenitor cells. Utilizing an FPD-MM sample harboring Runx1 K194N, also detected in other pedigree members with FPD or FPD-MM, we established the first ever cell line (GMR-AML1) expressing germline mtRUNX1. GMR-AML1 cells exhibited high surface expression of CD117 (c-KIT), CD123 (IL-3R) and CD33. GMR-AML1 cells in which Runx1 was knocked-out by CRISPR-gRNA were outcompeted in vitro and in vivo, by cells that retained Runx1. Treatment with HHT or MB induced loss of viability in GMR-AML1 cells (LD50: 40 or 330 nM, respectively). HHT also caused concordant decline in ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq peaks in ribosomal genes involved in protein translation. Treatment with MB inhibited cell cycle and protein translation. CyTOF analysis revealed that MB treatment also depleted CDK6, RUNX1, c-Myc and EVI1 in phenotypically defined FPD-MM stem cells. Finally, in the GMR-AML1 cell xenograft, treatment with omacetaxine or MB significantly reduced AML burden and improved overall survival of NSG mice. These preclinical findings highlight the molecular features associated with progression of RUNX1-FPD to FPD-MM and highlight HHT or MB as effective against cellular models of FPD-MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,RUNX1,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

PPAR&#945; ligands modulate the switch between co-activator and co-repressor transcription complexes at PPAR&#945;-controlled target genes. In addition, PPAR&#945; has been shown to transrepress NF-&#954;B signaling and inhibit angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) expresses high levels of PPAR-&#945; and is a highly angiogenic cancer. Current frontline treatments for RCC include chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, and immunotherapy but are limited by the immune suppressive state of the tumor microenvironment. TPST-1120 is a novel PPAR&#945; antagonist for the treatment of cancer patients that binds in the ligand binding domain, positioning the AF-2 activation helix in an inactive conformation. The inactive conformation has a lower affinity for co-activator motifs and reduces activation of PPAR&#945; regulated genes. In a CHO-based reporter cell line, TPST-1120 potently competed against the PPAR&#945;-specific agonist GW7647 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 36 nM at 20 nM GW7647) and an endogenous PPAR&#945; agonist oleoylethanolamide (OEA; IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 15 nM at 30 &#181;M OEA). Furthermore, in an enzyme fragment complementation assay, we demonstrated that TPST-1120 inhibited agonist-induced binding of PPAR&#945; to MED1 by destabilizing the co-activator complex thereby stabilizing the inactive conformation of PPAR-&#945;. In a murine model of renal cell adenocarcinoma (RENCA), TPST-1120 treatment for 12 days (30 mg\/kg qd) reduced tumor growth by 52% as a monotherapy (p&#60;0.0001). Consistent with these findings, TPST-1120 inhibited tumor angiogenesis and proliferation as quantified by Ki67 levels. Combination treatment with current frontline therapeutics resulted in synergistic tumor inhibition of 74% with anti-PD1 (200 ug Q3D for 12 days) and 81% with cabozantinib (15 mg\/kg QD for 15 days) (p&#60;.0001). Flow cytometry-based analysis of tumors demonstrated increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in the TME as well as decreases in M2 and elevations in M1 macrophages. Importantly, we demonstrate that TPST-1120 can reverse an immunosuppressive class of immune cells to promote anti-tumor immunity and anti-angiogenesis in kidney cancer in the absence of overt toxicity. These data support advancement of TPST-1120 into RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,Inhibitors,Renal cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Using two human PCa tissue microarray cohorts, we first demonstrated that nuclear ER&#945; expression was heterogeneous between patients, being only detected in half of tumors. Positive nuclear ER&#945; levels were correlated with disease recurrence, progression to metastatic PCa, and patient survival. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models of the normal prostate and PCa, bulk and single cell RNA-seq analyses revealed that estrogens partially mimic the androgen transcriptional response and induce specific biological pathways linked to cellular proliferation and metabolism. Bioenergetic flux assays and metabolomics confirmed regulation of cancer metabolism by estrogens, supporting proliferation. Using cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids, selective estrogen receptor modulators, a pure anti-estrogen, and genetic approaches impaired cancer cell proliferation and growth in an ER&#945;-dependent manner. Overall, our study revealed that, when expressed, ER&#945; functionally reprograms PCa metabolism, is associated with disease progression, and could be targeted for therapeutic purposes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Estrogen,Metabolism,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The main effectors of the Hippo pathway are the TEAD transcription factors which function by interacting with other co-effector proteins to modulate transcriptional outputs. Notably YAP and TAZ interact with TEAD to mediate oncogenic transcriptional programs, and blocking interaction of TEAD with YAP and TAZ is a sought-after mechanism for small molecule TEAD inhibitors. However, the interaction network of TEAD extends well beyond YAP and TAZ to a variety of additional cofactors, including chromatin remodelers, epigenetic factors, and other transcriptional regulators. Thus, the impact of inhibiting TEAD could extend to unanticipated protein interactions and cellular functions. The purpose of this study is to investigate, define, and interrogate TEAD interaction networks, providing foundational knowledge for interrogating TEAD biological functions and pharmacological effects. We are employing mass spectrometry-based technologies combined with chemical and genetic tools and biochemistry to interrogate TEAD protein interaction networks. We have performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry for TEAD and have identified dozens of significant interacting proteins. TEAD interactions include expected proteins, such as known Hippo pathway members, as well as unexpected protein interactions, such as DNA damage response proteins. Cellular assays probing these DNA damage protein interactions implicate TEAD as a crucial factor for efficient DNA repair mechanisms and maintaining genomic stability. These results raise questions towards a combinatorial effect for TEAD inhibitors and DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Altogether, these ongoing proteomic studies are providing insights into TEAD interaction networks, leading to a deeper understanding of TEAD biology, and providing foundational knowledge that can inform the development of TEAD inhibitors as effective cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,Mass spectrometry,Transcriptional regulation,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This disease is classified by the presence of endometrial-like cells growing in and around the female reproductive system. Instead of lining the uterus, these ectopic cells shed off and cluster together forming lesions that attach to different surfaces of the female reproductive system. In particular, endometriosis cells interact with and form lesions within the mesothelial cells that line the peritoneum. There is currently no cure, and many of the therapies aiming to help with pain management come with unfavorable tradeoffs. Our research on ovarian cancer led us to investigate potential overlapping characteristics with endometriosis. Growing ovarian cancer cells in 3D causes spheroids to form which mimic the physical features of tumors and are also able to better represent cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. Analysis of the endometriosis cell lines 12Z and hEM3 demonstrated that they could also form spheroids. As both ovarian cancer cells and endometriosis cells interact with mesothelial cells, we wanted to determine if endometriosis spheroids were able to clear the mesothelial layer comparable to ovarian cancer spheroids. Evaluation of 12Z and hEM3 cell lines demonstrated that endometriosis spheroids were able to undergo mesothelial clearance. While the exact cause of endometriosis is not known, different proteins have been identified as important factors in the progression of endometriosis. The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis resistance, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In endometriosis cell lines, STAT3 is constitutively active, which makes it a promising potential therapeutic target. To verify that STAT3 is important in endometriosis, siRNA was used to reduce the expression of STAT3 in two endometriosis cell lines, 12Z and hEM3. Both cell lines showed a decrease in cell viability. In addition, reducing the expression of STAT3 in the endometriosis cells appeared to decrease mesothelial clearance ability. Our lab previously identified statins as potential STAT3 inhibitors by using the Broad Institute&#8217;s CLUE tool. After statin treatment, 12Z and hEM3 spheroids showed a decrease in cell viability and clearance ability. Taken together, these data suggest that STAT3 plays a key role in endometriosis and that the repurposing of statins may provide a benefit to patients with endometriosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelium,STAT3,Statins,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The goal of this project is to investigate whether &#8710;Np63&#945; expression is sufficient to increase pancreatic cancer cell growth, metastasis and chemoresistance and whether these cells can outcompete &#8710;Np63&#945; non-expressers in mixed tumors. Non-&#8710;Np63&#945; expressing human PDAC cell lines AsPC1 and HPAFII were stably transduced to express either &#8710;Np63&#945; or mCherry (control). For both AsPC1 and HPAFII, &#8710;Np63&#945;-expressing and control cells had similar proliferation rates and susceptibility to chemotherapy agents oxaliplatin and SN38 when grown in culture. When control or &#8710;Np63&#945;-expressing AsPC1 cells were implanted orthotopically into the pancreas of athymic nude mice, there was no significant difference in primary tumor mass and pathological analysis of lungs and livers did not reveal any significant difference in metastatic burden. Bulk RNA sequencing of primary tumors confirmed that tumors in mice inoculated with AsPC1-&#8710;Np63&#945; had significantly upregulated expression of genes associated with the basal subtype. Collectively, these data suggest that while &#8710;Np63&#945; drives the basal program in PDAC, its expression is insufficient to cause resistance to these chemotherapies or a growth or metastatic advantage in an immunodeficient setting. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which &#8710;Np63&#945; contributes to more aggressive PDAC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,p63,Chemoresistance,Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

AP-1 complexes have been identified as novel therapeutic targets in cancer due to their role in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Dimerization of components of the AP-1 complex via leucine zipper domain interactions is required for DNA binding and subsequent transcriptional activity. We designed a peptide (Jun antagonizing peptide, JunAP) targeting the basic leucine zipper motif of AP-1 to antagonize AP-1 complex formation and prevent associated activity. Fluorescence polarization and DNA ELISA assays demonstrate target binding and selectivity of JunAP towards AP-1 family members, co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that JunAP blocks protein-protein interactions between cJun and its key binding partners, and reporter assays confirm inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activity in vitro. Pathway analysis of RNA sequencing data confirmed by qPCR analysis shows that JunAP disrupts key pathways required for cell survival and migration. Corresponding functional in vitro assays reveal that JunAP exhibits an inhibitory effect on invasion in<i> <\/i>Boyden chamber assays and demonstrates potent cytotoxicity in Jun-dependent cells. Further, in a BT549 triple negative breast cancer subcutaneous xenograft model, administration of JunAP results in tumor regression, demonstrating the anti-cancer potential of targeting the AP-1 complex. In summary, these data support JunAP as a potent peptide antagonist of the AP-1 transcription factor family that warrants further development as a potential therapeutic option for AP-1 driven tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-07 Protein-protein interactions in transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Protein-protein interactions,Oncogene,AP-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses have identified two distinct PDAC subtypes: classical and basal. The critical difference between these subtypes lies in the expression of endodermal lineage specifiers, with the classical subtype expressing FOXA1, FOXA2 (FOXA1\/2), and HNF4&#9082;, critical for pancreatic cell-fate determination, while the basal subtype downregulates these genes, leading to the loss of endodermal identity. We reason that the transcription factors (TF), FOXA1\/2 and HNF4&#945;, that play critical roles in pancreatic development, are not only biomarkers of the classical subtype but are essential regulators of PDAC subtype differentiation state. Despite their relevance in other cancers, their specific functions in PDAC remain largely unexplored. We aim to define the functional roles of FOXA1\/2 and HNF4&#9082; in the classical PDAC subtype, exploring their regulation of growth and cellular identity. Previous published work in our lab has shown that exogenous HNF4&#9082; restrains growth in a panel of human and murine PDAC cell lines. Furthermore, we have shown that HNF4&#9082; regulates the classical subtype program of PDAC. While FOXA1\/2 and HNF4&#9082; cooperatively enact gene expression changes in normal tissue, the extent to which cooperative interactions between these TFs are required to activate the classical gene expression program of PDAC remains unknown. Overall, we will test the central hypothesis that FOXA1\/2 and HNF4&#9082; are critical regulators of the transcriptional network governing the cellular identity of classical PDAC. To test this hypothesis, we will be reconstituting and modulating the expression of these factors in human and murine PDAC cell and organoid lines. We will assess gene expression changes through RNA-seq and genomic localization of these TFs through ChIP-seq. We have conducted bulk RNA sequencing on <i>Foxa1\/2<\/i>-positive and negative organoids to transcriptionally identify differences brought on by <i>Foxa1\/2 <\/i>deletion and found over 2,200 differentially expressed genes. <i>Foxa1\/2<\/i> deletion led to a significant decline in the classical PDAC signature based on gene ontology. Furthermore, we show that HNF4&#945; can inhibit organoid growth in the absence of FOXA1\/2. We discovered that HNF4&#9082; targets, such as <i>Lgals4,<\/i> expression levels are unaltered at the RNA level independent of FOXA1\/2. By assessing the roles of FOXA1\/2 and HNF4&#945; in PDAC, we aim to determine the transcriptional network governed by these factors in the classical subtype of PDAC","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Differentiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Walter  A.

In this study, we studied the role of Pten in EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>-induced lung cancer <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, loss of Pten increased bronchial cell hyperplasia but decreased alveolar cell hyperplasia in EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>*Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup>-induced lung cancer. Syatematic analysis of gene expression by RNA-seq showed that a number of genes related to ciliogenesis were upregulated in EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>*Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup>-induced lung cancer and subsequently showed that bronchial ciliated cells were hyperplastic. Several critical ciliogenesis-related genes, such as mucin5a, DNAI2 and DNAI3, were found to be regulated by NR2F1. Next, NR2F1 was found to be inhibited by overexpression of Pten, indicating that Pten negatively regulates NR2F1, thereby inhibiting the expression of ciliogenesis-related genes and leading to the inhibition of bronchial cell hyperplasia during EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>-induced lung cancer progression. In addition, we also found that Pten decreased Akt phosphorylation in A549, Kras mutant, and H1299 cells but increased Akt phosphorylation in PC9, EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>, and H1299<sup>L858R<\/sup> cells, suggesting that Pten may function as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in lung cancers with Kras mutation and EGFR mutation, respectively. PTEN acts as a double-edged sword that differentially regulates EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>-induced lung cancer progression in different genomic backgrounds.

Unfortunately, many patients who initially respond to these treatments develop resistance and progress. Several mechanisms of resistance are being studied. We have focused on the roles of a reprogrammed AR cistrome from a canonical to a non-canonical cistrome in resistant disease. The premise of this study is based on previous studies by others and studies in our lab that suggest enrichment in non-canonical AR activity and adaptation to enzalutamide in advanced PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. We aim to develop an ecosystem map of canonical and non-canonical AR activity to understand the drivers of therapeutic resistance and their vulnerabilities. We hypothesize that through combined transcriptomic\/chromatin accessibility profiling at single-cell resolution and proteomics studies, we can holistically capture non-canonical AR activity. To provide invaluable information, as PCa is highly heterogeneous and not all cancer cells may be contributing to the resistance pathway that is of interest, we use castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) and enzalutamide-resistant CRPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and patient tissue samples as our disease models on our multi-omic assay platform to capture and study dynamic interplays and novel players driving a non-canonical AR cistrome and treatment resistance. Our preliminary data revealed potential transcriptional factor (TF) candidates that may modulate non-canonical AR cistrome. We verified the enrichment of these TF in PDX models of treatment-resistant PCa at the gene and protein level. Integration of our ongoing global proteomic studies will provide a holistic view of the contributions of the TF to the AR non-canonical switch.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-08 Regulation of transcription factor function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Enzalutamide,Prostate cancer,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Transcriptomic studies have classified PDAC into a classical or basal-like subtype. The classical subtype has a better prognosis, response to chemotherapy, and express higher levels of endodermal lineage specifiers compared to the basal-like subtype. However, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of the key subtype-specific regulators. Functional analysis of transcription factors associated with each subtype are needed to elucidate their roles in regulation of PDAC subtypes and to identify therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities. Previous work in our lab demonstrated that HNF4&#945; is a key regulator of the classical subtype. Using genetically engineered mouse models, our lab showed that loss of HNF4&#945; leads to an increase in tumor burden, a shift from glandular to poorly differentiated histology, and a decrease in the classical subtype score. However, while murine PDAC only express one set of HNF4&#945; isoforms, human PDAC express both sets of HNF4&#945; isoforms, suggesting murine PDAC may not fully recapitulate human disease. There are 2 subsets of HNF4&#945; isoforms driven by expression from 2 distinct promoters, P1 and P2. P1 and P2 isoforms are differentially expressed within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and play dichotomous roles in GI malignancies. In HNF4&#945;-positive human PDAC, P2 isoforms are always expressed but there is variable expression of P1 isoforms. Based on the differential role of HNF4&#945; isoforms in both normal tissue and cancer, we hypothesize that P1 isoforms will restrain tumor growth and promote greater classical\/GI differentiation compared to P2 isoforms. We utilized CRISPRi to selectively inhibit transcription at the P1 or P2 promoter in HNF4&#945;-positive, human cell lines expressing both isoforms. To test for sufficiency, we exogenously expressed P1 or P2 isoforms in HNF4&#945;-negative, human cell lines. We then performed Incucyte, CRISPRi competition, and anchorage-independent growth assays. We performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on both exogenous and endogenous HNF4&#945; isoforms. Functional assays revealed that HNF4&#945; isoforms regulated growth in a context dependent manner. Exogenous P1 isoforms significantly inhibited growth while loss of endogenous P1 isoforms was dispensable for growth. Exogenous P2 isoforms inhibited growth to a lesser degree while loss of endogenous P2 isoforms led to a significant reduction in growth. Despite ChIP-seq analysis revealing very similar binding profiles, RNAseq analysis revealed that P1 isoforms are significantly more transcriptionally active than P2 isoforms and are stronger inducers of GI differentiation. Taken together, our data demonstrates that P2 isoforms are more compatible with growth in PDAC compared to P1 isoforms, which promote a more differentiated cell state. Mechanistically, this may be due to the increased transcriptional activity of P1 isoforms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-09 Transcriptional control of cell differentiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,DNA binding,Gene expression,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Pengshu Fang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Acramul Kabir<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabriela Fort<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric  L.

We previously demonstrated that copper chelation has efficacy in mouse models of neuroblastoma and glioma. Multiomics analyses in neuronal cancers suggested that RNA-binding proteins were deregulated by copper chelator treatment. We found that the &#8220;RNA Binding&#8221; gene set was the most significantly ranked molecular function list using differentially expressed RNAs after copper chelation treatment (GO:0003723, p-value 1.02e&#8722;32). We subsequently found that the copper chelator drug decreased global protein synthesis, MYC\/MYCN expression, as well as the amount a key methylated (m6A) RNA-binding protein called YTHDF2 in glioma cells, by RNA-seq (-log2FC 0.3, p-value 0.005) and western blot. This downregulation was also clear in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines. Interestingly, copper chelation also shifted YTHDF2 protein location into the nucleus. YTHDF2 knock-out (DepMAP Chronos dependency score, -0.32) and knock-down studies (siRNA pool, 38% decrease in cell confluence) in neuroblastoma cell lines and others, indicated that YTHDF2 depletion is selective against neuronal cancer cell growth. YTHDF2 was found to be a MYCN transcriptional target. Moreover, as YTHDF2 protein also binds MYCN transcripts (the principal oncogene in neuroblastoma), and copper signaling mRNAs, it appears that copper signaling, YTHDF2 and MYCs operates in an oncogenic-axis. Ongoing studies are investigating novel YTHDF2 inhibitors and their neuronal cancer efficacy. Our work represents a significant breakthrough in drugging oncogenic post-transcriptional processes either directly, or indirectly via depleting copper.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-05 Posttranscriptional and translational control,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,Neuroblastoma,Glioblastoma,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

In 5% of T-ALL cases an insertion of a consensus GT dinucleotide is observed upstream of the <i>TAL1<\/i> gene, termed the &#8220;Mutation of TAL1 enhancer&#8221; (MuTE), driving <i>TAL1<\/i> overexpression. Using an <i>in vitro<\/i> reconstitution DNA pull-down assay combined with quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified nine candidate proteins that preferentially bound to the MuTE sequence compared to the WT sequence. Among the candidates, we demonstrate by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry that the RNA methyltransferase TARBP1 and the zinc finger proteins ZBTB2, ZBTB25 and ZNF639 formed a complex that we term TARZN. Interestingly, the TARZN complex also bound to <i>de novo<\/i> super enhancer sites upstream of the <i>LMO1<\/i> and <i>LMO2<\/i> genes in T-ALL cells, indicating a putative common mechanism between these different non-coding driver mutations. Furthermore, knock-down of all TARZN members resulted in lower TAL1 protein expression in MuTE-positive but not in MuTE-negative T-ALL cells. Overall, these data suggest that the TARZN complex cooperatively promotes oncogenic expression in T-ALL.<br \/><i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB07-04 Oncogenic transcription factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Transcriptional regulation,Zinc finger proteins,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.
