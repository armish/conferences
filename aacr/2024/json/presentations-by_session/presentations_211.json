[{"Abstract":"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, with over 2.2 million new cases in 2020 and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Most lung cancer (80-85%) is non-small cell (NSCLC), comprising mostly adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, while roughly 10-15% of lung cancer is small cell lung cancer (SCLC), also termed neuroendocrine lung cancer. Subtype identification is critical for determining treatment, and with limited samples, it is critical to get the most data possible from each tissue section. NSCLC subtypes can be treated with chemotherapy or targeted drugs, whereas SCLC tends to respond best to a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. While there have been many improvements in the detection and treatment of lung carcinoma, the immuno-histochemical (IHC) confirmation of subtype remains a prolonged and often iterative process. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new IHC approach which uses antibodies labeled with novel photocleavable mass-tags combined with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. The approach, termed MALDI-IHC, provides fast (1 hr\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> imaging time) and highly multiplexed IHC (100+-plex) without the need for iterative cycling procedures. Here, we present a 20+-plex panel for the determination of subtype in lung cancer. An antibody panel comprised of established clinical biomarkers was developed to differentiate between the lung carcinoma subtypes and provide potentially prognostic information. This included markers for adenocarcinoma (TTF-1, Napsin A), squamous cell carcinoma (p40, CK5), and small cell lung cancer (CD56, Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin), as well as general carcinoma markers for t cells, b cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts These markers were first validated individually by immunofluorescence and then compared to MALDI-IHC on annotated tissues. Here we present an overview of the antibody validation for the 20+-plex lung carcinoma panel. Biomarker presence and peak signal intensity for the various subtypes was then determined using pathologist classified tissues for normal lung, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer. We report application of the MALDI-IHC approach to the simultaneous determination of lung carcinoma subtypes on a 99-core human lung tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of normal, normal adjacent, cancer adjacent, and cancerous tissues. Moreover, because MALDI-IHC is a non-destructive process, it can be followed by conventional H&#38;E staining on the same tissue section for accurate co-registration of traditional pathology annotations with the highly multiplexed MALDI-IHC results. In the future, even larger, 100+-plex antibody panels can be used for precision medicine on a wide range of cancers, in order to determine the molecular subtypes and guide treatment paths.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MALDI-TOF,Imaging,Immunohistochemistry,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

In the US, around 20,380 individuals were diagnosed with AML in 2023. Despite standard therapies, relapse and resistance persist. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) has been recognized an actionable therapeutic target in AML. The potent inhibitor, AZD4573, induces durable apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth. Our study reveals that combining AZD4573 with standard-of-care (SoC) treatments deepens cell death responses in multiple AML cell models. We also used proteomics tools to understand the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability and resistance in SoC and CDK9 combinations.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> In the drug combination study, three SoC agents (cytarabine, decitabine, and venetoclax) were evaluated in combination using a 6x6 dose-response matrix in four AML cell models (MOLM13, MOLM16, MV411, and OCI-AML2). The HSA synergy score and Emax drug activity were used to assess the benefits of the drug combinations. In the proteomics evaluation study, MOLM13 cells treated for 7 days under different conditions - (1) vehicle control; (2) cytarabine alone; (3) decitabine alone; (4) venetoclax alone; (5) AZD4573 alone; (6) AZD4573+cytarabine; (7) AZD4573+decitabine; (8) AZD4573+venetoclax - were collected for proteomics analysis using LC-MS\/MS. Differential expression and missing pattern analyses were used to identify dysregulated proteins. Functional enrichment analysis was employed to identify dysregulated biological processes and pathways in response to different treatments.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our drug combination screens demonstrated the efficacy of AZD4573 in combination with cytarabine, decitabine, and venetoclax in 3 of 4 AML cell models. In our proteomic analysis, we took two approaches. First, we compared the proteomes of AML cells treated with SoC agents, identifying shared downregulated pathways such as serine biosynthesis, notably pointing to the rate-limiting enzyme PHGDH as a potential therapeutic target in AML. Cytarabine and decitabine induced an inflammatory response, while venetoclax increased the expression of cell division regulators like Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Interestingly, targeting AURKB with AZD2811 has been shown to overcome venetoclax resistance in AML. Second, we compared proteome changes induced by various AZD4573 combinations. We identified IRF2BP2 as a shared vulnerable protein across the three AZD4573 combinations. POUF2F2 expression was significantly induced by cytarabine but suppressed when combined with AZD4573. Given that POUF2F2 activates the PDK1-Akt pathway, our findings suggest that AZD4573-induced POUF2F2 downregulation suppresses the PDK1-AKT pathway, inhibiting tumor progression.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our proteomics analysis identifies vulnerable and resistant pathways and proteins, shedding light on the mechanism of action and revealing potential new targets for AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,CDK inhibitor,Acute myeloid leukemia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

To alleviate this deficit, we executed a proteomic discovery study seeking PSA reflex signatures using the Proteograph&#8482; Product Suite, a multi-nanoparticle-based deep plasma\/serum proteomics workflow (Seer, Inc.), with timsTOF Pro mass spectrometry (Bruker) to interrogate over 900 serum specimens from patients that underwent prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA and\/or abnormal digital rectal exam.<br \/>Methods: Our study followed rigorous design principles including uniform collection, randomization and blinding of specimens, all of which were processed with the Proteograph Product Suite. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses leveraged the Bruker timsTOF Pro MS platform utilizing 30-minute reversed-phase chromatography and a label-free dia-PASEF (data independent acquisition - parallel accumulation serial fragmentation) data acquisition method. Peptides deriving from a chosen subset of specimens designed to maximize peptide diversity were pooled, fractionated and analyzed using DDA (data-dependent acquisition)-PASEF to build a spectral reference library.<br \/>Results: The DIA-NN algorithm was employed through the cloud-based Proteograph Analysis Suite (PAS) to search LC-MS data. Leveraging our study-specific spectral library proteomic depth achieved was approximately 3600 protein groups identified (median) per patient serum specimen and more than 4400 in at least 25% of samples across the study. Customized machine learning workflows and the SeerML pipeline were used to identify and assess diagnostic power of new proteomic signatures.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the remarkable proteomic depth achievable in a scaled patient serum specimen discovery study using a combination of Proteograph and timsTOF platforms. This significant effort revealed serum proteomic signatures with increased diagnostic performance over that provided by PSA blood measurement and traditional patient-associated metadata alone, providing a foundation for future clinical tests aimed to reduce the current high frequency of unnecessary prostate biopsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Proteomics,Biomarkers,Serum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark Flory<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew Chang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessie May Cartier<sup>1<\/sup>, Jane Lange<sup>1<\/sup>, Travis Moore<sup>1<\/sup>, James McGann<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Kopp<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Liss<sup>3<\/sup>, Robin Leach<sup>4<\/sup>, Brenna Albracht<sup>4<\/sup>, James Dai<sup>5<\/sup>, Michael Krawitzky<sup>6<\/sup>, Eltaher Elgierari<sup>7<\/sup>, Jessica Chu<sup>7<\/sup>, Paul Pease<sup>7<\/sup>, Max Mahoney<sup>7<\/sup>, Shadi Ferdosi<sup>7<\/sup>, Ryan Benz<sup>7<\/sup>, Khatereh Motamedchaboki<sup>7<\/sup>, Asim Siddiqui<sup>7<\/sup>, Mahdi Zamanighomi<sup>7<\/sup>, Amir Alavi<sup>7<\/sup>, Harendra Guturu<sup>7<\/sup>, Daniel Hornburg<sup>7<\/sup>, Serafim Batzoglou<sup>7<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR,<sup>2<\/sup>Urology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR,<sup>3<\/sup>Urology, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Cell Systems and Anatomy, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Biostatistics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA,<sup>6<\/sup>Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA,<sup>7<\/sup>Seer, Inc., Redwood City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"83dde352-4dfe-4020-a1bb-219949087f84","ControlNumber":"3472","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Triple negative cancers (TNBC), which account for 15~20% of BCs, are one of the most aggressive and heterogeneous forms of BCs, characterized by the loss of ER, PR, and low HER2 expression. This heterogeneity and plasticity are partly due to the adaptable nature of their metabolism, a dynamic phenotype which is commonly observed in many aggressive forms of cancer. One of the key metabolic pathways that can confer this aggressive proliferative characteristic is the tryptophan catabolism pathway. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid required for the proper function of all mammalian cells, with IDO1 being a key enzyme that converts tryptophan to kynurenine, marking the start of the catabolism pathway. IDO1 expression is observed to be elevated in various types of cancer including BCs and has been associated with immune suppression\/evasion via resource competition and tumor progression by supplying resources required for proliferation. Despite this, tryptophan catabolism is one of the lesser studied and understood pathways in cancer metabolism, especially in the context of TNBCs.<br \/>Methods: Previous analysis had shown the tryptophan catabolism pathway is downregulated in certain subsets of TNBCs. To understand the effective function of the pathway with regards to proliferation, we targeted the upper-most step of the catabolism pathway by inhibiting IDO1 with epacadostat and indoximod in different types of TNBC cell-lines and observed for changes in their growth rates via proliferation assays. We also performed parallel stable-isotope tracer-based flux analysis with [U-13C11]-Tryptophan and [U-13C3]-Serine with mass spectrometry to characterize flux changes with the goal of discovering potentially lethal metabolic pathways.<br \/>Results: We observed higher proliferative sensitivity to IDO1 inhibition in TNBC cell-lines with a genetic dysfunction in the <i>de novo<\/i> serine synthesis pathway. To understand these differences at the metabolic level, we quantified the differential contributions of tryptophan and serine to nucleotide and NAD<sup>+<\/sup> synthesis and the TCA cycle with the parallel tracer experiments. Comparison of the lines with dysfunctional <i>de novo<\/i> serine synthesis to those with normal or amplified flux towards the pathway showed a higher interdependence with the kynurenine pathway in the dysfunctional group. These results indicate a differential potential for targeting the kynurenine pathway in relation with the serine synthesis pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: Targeting the IDO1 enzyme in the kynurenine pathway shows significant correlations between the <i>de novo<\/i> serine pathway and the tryptophan catabolism pathway in TNBCs that may lead to metabolic targets conferring potential therapeutic benefits.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metabolism,Systems biology,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Plasma and serum are accessible sample types, however, the high dynamic range of proteins creates analytical challenges for the sensitive detection of potential biomarkers. In this work, we compare two proteomic approaches for large-scale cancer biomarker discovery: the Olink Proximity Extension Assay and the Seer Proteograph Product Suite. Olink Explore 3072 is an immunoassay that gains specificity by using dual antibody recognition to measure approx. 3,000 proteins in each sample. Antibody pairs are tagged with oligonucleotides, which hybridize and are amplified before measurement by next generation sequencing. Seer Proteograph is an enrichment strategy that uses a proprietary mix of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with affinity for certain amino acids and functional groups in native state proteins. The resulting peptides are measured using untargeted mass spectrometry to identify proteins at the peptide level, paving the way for the identification of proteoforms and peptide variants. Aliquots of human plasma from 78 samples representing a range of cancer indications were obtained through the Discovery Life Sciences biobank and used for analysis by both the Olink and Proteograph workflows. Olink analysis achieved Pearson correlation scores of greater than or equal to 0.8 when correlating each of seven process controls to each other for all approx. 3000 proteins. On average, greater than or equal to 75% of the proteins were detected across all panels in all sample groups except for Normal and Benign groups (64% and 74% respectively). After stringent FDR filtering to ensure only high-quality data was analyzed, the Seer Proteograph workflow quantified 4,323 proteins across all 78 samples. Pearson correlation scores of greater than or equal to 0.96 were achieved when comparing digestion controls, process controls, and sample cleanup controls. Both platforms achieved detection of proteins across the dynamic range of plasma, including low abundance proteins. The Olink Explore 3072 and Seer Proteograph platforms were found to be complementary, with approx. 15% overlap in measured proteins. Cancer biomarker discovery at the proteomic level is bolstered by recent advances in analytical capabilities, as revealed by the Olink Explore and Seer Proteograph platforms. Importantly, complementary implementation of these two workflows will enable comprehensive biomarker analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Biomarkers,Mass spectrometry,Immunoassay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

No markers or models now is satisfactory enough to be adopted widely by the medical community. Here, we analyzed the proteomics of paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) biopsy samples from 230 CC patients (stages II-III) with up to 10 years of survival by using pressure cycling technology (PCT) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry. Using machine learning, we established a novel and practical protein-based clinical classification system for CC prognosis which was further verified in an independent validation cohort. Using the nine protein-based clinical model, we improved the area under the curve (AUC) value to 0.926 in the training cohort and 0.872 in the validation cohort. Our promising model will be a potential approach to prognostication to aid in rational follow-up schedule-making and risk-adaptive individualized therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-02 Proteomics and biomarker discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Proteomics,Prognosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The AZD4573 First-in-Human (FIH) study revealed variable alanine transaminase (ALT) and\/or bilirubin elevation and a clear correlation to dose or PK exposure could not be defined. While concurrent ALT elevation &#8805;3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin elevation &#8805;2x ULN (potential Hy&#8217;s law) is a biochemical finding indicating potential drug-induced liver injury, quantitative modeling disconnected ALT and bilirubin elevation demonstrating that the observations were not Hy&#8217;s Law cases. Furthermore, we implemented a targeted metabolomics workflow to investigate the ALT and bilirubin elevation mechanism and identify predictive biomarkers to better understand and\/or predict any hepatic stress liabilities associated with AZD4573 clinical development. We implemented an established metabolomics methodology to 359 samples from 15 patients yielding 47,000 total data points. Data was separated into 98 different dosing intervals from the 15 patients to identify the ALT and bilirubin-associated metabolic changes conserved across all patients while incorporating metabolic differences in individual patents with ALT and bilirubin elevation in only a fraction of multiple doses. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares modeling identified several metabolites and pathways altered as a function of maximum ALT or bilirubin levels. Post-dose conjugated bile acids were elevated when ALT and bilirubin were elevated. Pre-dose creatine levels were decreased when ALT and bilirubin elevation occurred, and pre-dose glutamate levels were elevated when ALT elevation occurred. Pre-dose decreased total carnitines and kynurenine pathway activation were observed when ALT and bilirubin elevation occurred, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. Elevated bile acids are an established characteristic of cholestasis and suggest cholestasis as a probable mechanism for AZD4573-induced reversible liver stress. Interestingly, decreased creatine, glutamate elevation, decreased total carnitine, and kynurenine pathway activation are all associated with some form of liver stress or disfunction which may explain the irregular ALT and bilirubin elevations observed in patients receiving AZD4573; while ALT itself is a biomarker of liver damage, these pre-dose biochemical changes may illuminate potential preceding liver stress. Dosing patients already experiencing higher liver stress levels may be more susceptible to drug-induced ALT and bilirubin elevation, and patients with increasing in-study liver stress may only present at later doses. This work demonstrates metabolomics utility to elucidate possible mechanisms of liver toxicity as well as to identify potential predictive biomarkers for further investigation to explore individual patient risk in clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mass spectrometry,Toxicity,Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We previously demonstrated the synergistic antitumor interaction of the antiepileptic with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity valproic acid (VPA), and the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin (SIM). This combination sensitizes mCRPC cells to docetaxel treatment and revert docetaxel-resistance, both in vitro and in vivo models, by targeting cancer stem cells compartment via mevalonate pathway\/YAP axis modulation.<br \/>Methods: Proteomic and metabolomic\/lipidomic analysis on tumor samples were performed by LC-MS\/MS-based shotgun proteomics and by 1H-NMR approach, respectively. Progenesis QI for proteomics v. 4.2 was used as label-free quantification platform. Functional annotation analysis were performed by using the DAVID v6.8 (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery); g:Profiler WikiPathways databases; Reactome version 66; Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Loading plot were performed by Metabo Analyst v5.0 tool.<br \/>Results: Tumor samples derived from 22Rv1 mCRPC cells xenografted mice, treated or not with VPA\/SIM combination were characterized by a combined proteomic and metabolomic\/lipidomic approach. In deep bioinformatics analysis confirmed a specific impact of VPA\/SIM on Hippo pathway, with a clear down regulation of YAP and its targets (CTGF, CycD1 ANKH1) in treated <i>vs <\/i>untreated tumors, functionally related with modulation of cancer-related extracellular matrix remodelling and metabolic reprogramming. Treatment also downregulated TEAD transcription factor mediating YAP-induced expression, along with the upregulation of 14-3-3, responsible for YAP cytoplasmic retention and degradation, paralleled by the up-regulation of YAP up-stream negative regulators such as LATS1 and AMPK. VPA\/SIM also modulated intermediates of TCA, urea cycles and glycolysis and decreased cholesterol and fatty acids.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, this study provides further insights into the molecular mechanism of the VPA\/SIM antitumor effect suggesting the potential of repurposing these two generic and safe drugs in combination with standard antitumor therapies also in other tumors besides mCRCP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,drug-repurposing,Valproic Acid,Simvastatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

In 2011, the FDA approved a novel therapy for recurrent GBM known as Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). TTFields use alternating intermediate-frequency (200 kHz) and low-intensity (1-3 V\/cm) electric fields to interfere with tumor cells, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of TTFields therapy at the systems biology level using quantitative proteomics technology. We analyzed U87 cells before and after TTFields treatment using quantitative proteomics and identified a total of 7679 proteins. Among them, 804 proteins were significantly upregulated after TTFields treatment, and 1141 proteins were significantly downregulated. Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed that upregulated proteins were mainly associated with cell proliferation, cell cycle, and transcription, possibly representing compensatory responses to the TTFields treatment. Further analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the tumor proliferation key protein PARP1, which was validated by protein immunoblotting experiments. Based on this analysis, we hypothesized that combining TTFields with Olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) might enhance the sensitivity of TTFields. Subsequently, we performed cell proliferation experiments to evaluate the concomitant application strategy, and the results demonstrated that Olaparib in combination with TTFields treatment significantly reduced the survival rate of U87 cells compared to single-drug treatment. In conclusion, using quantitative proteomics, this study revealed the biological processes underlying the inhibitory effects of TTFields on GBM proliferation. Under TTFields intervention, the expression of PARP1 was upregulated, and the use of a PARP1 inhibitor in combination significantly increased the sensitivity of TTFields. Therefore, this study not only elucidated the molecular mechanisms of TTFields therapy for GBM treatment at the systems biology level, but also provided support for further enhancing the efficacy of TTFields.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-03 Proteomics and signaling networks,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Proteomics,PARP inhibitors,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

Although the direct mechanism of cisplatin is largely well-defined, it is challenging to comprehensively assess its systemic effects. Cellular responses to perturbations are intricate processes involving modifications to protein complexes across diverse cellular compartments. Therefore, substantial research endeavors have been directed towards unraveling protein organization in cells. We recently built a multiscale integrated cell map, MuSIC, that combines fluorescence-stained images and interactions derived from affinity purification mass spectrometry to allow comprehensive characterization of cellular structure and functional networks of 5,254 proteins of the human bone osteosarcoma epithelial line (U2-OS). To exploit the biology of U2OS, we integrated dynamics into this map to determine the proteome reorganization upon cisplatin exposure. Thus, we developed a data-driven approach integrating high throughput size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) data with large-scale cell maps built from static-state information to systematically map at all scales the remodeling of cell architecture in drug-treated cells. Here, we acquired drug-perturbed protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from the SEC-MS data by treating U2-OS with cisplatin. Integrating the differential interactions identified from SEC-MS PPIs with the scaffold large-scale hierarchy (MuSIC) allows retention of the upper cellular organization to systematically map drug impact on protein complexes in the cell. This pipeline serves as an explorative method to identify the drug-responsive organelles, alterations of hierarchical structures, and translocation of proteins. Apart from the well known alterations of DNA damage repair complexes, we also recapitulate remodeling in metabolism pathways, splicing, cAMP-dependent kinase activity, and histone modification. We identify 26 novel protein assemblies containing members that are previously associated with cisplatin biology. This pipeline exploits the potential of a well-established network by integrating the high throughput data modality, allowing for the screening of a range of chemical agents and stimuli to generate differential networks.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,Chemotherapy response,Drug-discovery screen,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

The primary factor contributing to the substantial differences observed across cancers stems from unique combinations of genetic mutations. Epigenetic alterations further contribute to differential gene expression and splicing, thereby enhancing transcriptomic diversity. The protein products originating from the cancer transcriptome constitute the specific intracellular and extracellular environment, consequently exerting supplementary effects on epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes. The complex interplay and mutual influence between genetic aberrations, transcriptomes, and proteomes significantly contribute to shaping the extensive spectrum of molecular characteristics observed in cancer. With label-free mass spectrometry, RNA-sequencing, and low-pass whole genome sequencing, the quantification of the proteome, transcriptome, and genetic abbreviation of the cancer can be evaluated. With the mouse hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDVI) models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), different subtypes of HCC derived from different genetic abbreviations can be generated. With the proteome, transcriptome, and genetic abbreviation data of the better-defined HCC from HDVI models and HCC patients, the patient-derived HCC can be classified according to the origin of the genetic abbreviation used in the generation of the HDVI-derived HCC. Furthermore, the proteome of patient-derived plasma will be analyzed, and the signature change unique to HCC classified by different origins of genetic abbreviation will provide an abstract of the proteome, transcriptome, and genetic abbreviation of the HCC tissue. The transcriptomics and proteomics data of HDVI mice produced from five distinct sets of genetic abbreviations have been measured. The proteome and transcriptome of tissue, as well as the proteome of plasma, from a small cohort of HCC patients were studied and classified using this resource to illuminate the fundamental landscape of HCC. The final results will be presented and discussed at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH02-01 Biological mass spectrometry and systems biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Proteomic analysis,Transcriptional regulation,Plasma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.
