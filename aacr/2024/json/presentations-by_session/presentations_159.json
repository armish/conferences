Unlike their alpha-beta T cell counterparts, &#947;&#948;T cells can recognize and respond to a wide range of antigens without the need for antigen presentation by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, allowing them to act swiftly in recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells. Clinical translation of &#947;&#948;T cell-based therapies, however, has faced significant challenges. Despite the safety profile of &#947;&#948;T cell infusions being well-established in cancer patients, the clinical outcomes have often been underwhelming (1). These results have raised questions about the efficacy of &#947;&#948;T cells in cancer treatment and the mechanisms through which they can be effectively harnessed. Despite these challenges, there have been encouraging developments that suggest the potential for &#947;&#948;T cell therapies. One notable advancement is the discovery of &#947;&#948;T cells carrying Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) in long-term cancer survivors (2). These cells persist many years after treatment, indicating their long-lasting immune memory and surveillance capabilities. Another significant observation is the role of &#947;&#948;T cells as effective agents in immunotherapy that lack MHC class I molecules. This suggests that &#947;&#948;T cells can overcome the limitations of traditional immunotherapies that rely on MHC-mediated antigen presentation (3). Additionally, the successful use of engineered &#945;&#946;T cells expressing a high-affinity &#947;&#948;T Cell Receptor (TEG) in achieving complete remission in acute myeloid leukemia highlights the potential of redirecting T cell specificity to enhance anti-tumor responses (4). . The exploration of Butyrophilin (BTN) and BTN-like (BTNL) molecules is a frontier in the understanding and enhancement of &#947;&#948;T cell therapies. BTN and BTNL molecules are implicated in the regulation of &#947;&#948;T cell responses through their interactions with &#947;&#948;T Cell Receptors (TCRs), particularly influencing the recognition of antigens and the subsequent immune response. Recent research focusing on BTN2 and BTN3 has aimed to delineate their roles in the activation and function of &#947;&#948;T cells, especially through &#947;9&#948;2TCRs (5). This research is crucial for unraveling the complexities of &#947;&#948;T cell antigen recognition and for developing strategies to enhance their therapeutic potential. Moreover, the diversity of the &#945;&#946;T cells, which are central to the TEG concept, presents another layer of complexity and opportunity in the design of T cell-based therapies. By engineering T cells to express specific, high-affinity &#947;&#948;TCRs, it is possible to harness the unique antigen-recognition capabilities of &#947;&#948;T cells while leveraging the proliferative and functional advantages of &#945;&#946;T cells. However detailed studies revealed a huge diversity in cell individual cell behavior (6). Finally, the role of costimulation in augmenting the activity of TEGs represents a promising area of investigation. Costimulatory signals are crucial for the full activation and sustained response of T cells. Enhancing costimulation in the context of TEGs could amplify their therapeutic efficacy, leading to improved outcomes in preclinical cancer treatment models by shaping the transcriptomic heterogeneity (7). In summary, while the clinical translation of &#947;&#948;T cell-based therapies has encountered challenges, recent discoveries and ongoing research offer hope for their future success. By understanding and manipulating the interactions between &#947;&#948;TCRs and BTN\/BTNL molecules, diversifying TCR repertoires, and optimizing costimulatory signals, there is potential to unlock the full therapeutic promise of &#947;&#948;T cells in cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>1.
