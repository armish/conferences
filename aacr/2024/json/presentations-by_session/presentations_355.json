[{"Abstract":"Tobacco-use is associated with an increased risk of developing aggressive breast cancer, however the cause remains unclear. While there is a dose-dependent decrease of patients&#8217; overall survival due to tobacco-use, the risk persists even after cessation. Here we show that chronic treatment with of breast cancer cells with low-dose nicotine significantly increases tumorsphere formation, self-renewal and tumor growth, while the acute treatment has little effect. Interestingly, these outcomes were noted even weeks after nicotine treatment was stopped. Mechanistically, this was attributed to &#945;7 nAChR, previously described as an essential regulator of inflammation. In fact, &#945;7 nAChR knock-out prevented activation of the STING antiviral pathway by reducing the nicotine-induced mRNA expression of STING, CCL5, CXCL10 and STAT3. Overall, these findings highlight long-term impact of nicotine on cancer progression through &#945;7 nAChR\/STING pathway. This may inform new biomarkers for diagnosis and potential new treatment strategies to combat tobacco-related breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

HPK-1 functions as a negative regulator of T-cell and B-cell receptor activation by triggering proteasomal degradation and disrupting signalosome complexes downstream of TCR and BCR. HPK1 inhibition is a novel IO strategy that could combine with existing chemotherapies and immunotherapies.<br \/>Methods: Curadev used a pharmacophore based approach to discover novel small molecule HPK-1 inhibitors using in vitro enzymatic and phenotypic cellular screens using primary cells. CRD1601, the clinical candidate was selected based on its ability to enhance human T-cell proliferation through the induction of IL2 and IFN&#947;. Syngeneic tumor models were used to assess anti-tumor activity of selected compounds as a monotherapy or combination therapy.<br \/>Results: CRD1601 is a potent HPK1 inhibitor with a single digit nanomolar IC50 value in enzymatic assay and potent cellular activity in the SLP76 assay. A single dose of CRD1601 in mice treated with an anti-CD3 antibody caused systemic enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL2, IFN gamma and reduced pSLP76 levels in the spleen. Further, CRD1601 reversed the immunosuppressive effect of PGE2 and NECA. CRD1601 demonstrated significant single agent activity in murine tumor models while also synergizing with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Inhibition of HPK-1 is a promising therapeutic modality that could augment the effects of existing anti-cancer treatments including immunotherapy. CRD1601 is a potent and selective HPK-1 inhibitor with favorable drug like properties that has been selected from a rich portfolio of active compounds and shows promising in vivo activity in tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

An epithelial cell population in adult human prostates was recently identified as sharing a similar transcriptomic profile and morphology to lung club cells.

However, we recently reported that cells expressing club cell markers (<i>CP,<\/i> <i>LTF<\/i>, <i>MMP7<\/i>, <i>PIGR, SCGB1A1<\/i>)<i> <\/i>are present in the peripheral zone of radical prostatectomy specimens. Here, expression of club cell markers was restricted to luminal epithelial cells in an inflammation-associated lesion termed proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). We also demonstrated that these club-like cells within PIA express the same markers as intermediate cells, a proposed prostate cancer progenitor cell.<i> <\/i>We now aim to identify exogenous factors that drive the club cell phenotype <i>in vitro<\/i>. Our ultimate goal is to understand how club cell gene expression affects the oncogenic and metastatic potential of prostate epithelial cells.<br \/>Methods: We characterized the expression of club cell genes in prostate cell lines (LNCaP, PREC, and PREC-AR-Myc) following exposure to inflammatory stimuli (TNF&#945;, hydrogen peroxide, uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli<\/i>) <i>in vitro<\/i>.

Our research unveils CIN as a stress during tumor initiation, uniquely tolerated by activated breast cancer stem cells (aCSCs). Elevated CIN, specific to tumors from aCSCs, contrasts with baseline levels akin to non-stem cell types. This transient increase in CIN, observed in low burden aCSC tumors, diminishes in established disease, suggesting a dynamic induction during initiation. Consist wit this we have observed increase in CIN tolerance in stem-like vs basal-like cells suggesting heterogeneity in response. CIN triggers a specific response, activating proinflammatory cancer autonomous immune signaling. We identified several CIN-induced proinflammatory stem cell-specific genes from our overlap studies. Knockdown assays targeting RSAD2 and PLAU showed a significant decrease in tumorsphere properties, emphasizing their functional relevance for cancer progression. AXL did not show any effect on tumorsphere but was important to tolerate CIN induced due to reversine. Mechanistically, AXL expression was induced by c-Jun stress signaling activation in aCSCs. These antiviral CIN-induced proinflammatory markers, emerge as a vital player in breast cancer progression.

Accumulating evidence showed that PDAC can be originated from acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). In this process, pancreatic acini harboring oncogenic Kras mutations are transdifferentiated to a duct-like phenotype that further progresses to become pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions, giving rise to PDAC. Although ADM formation is commonly observed in Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> transgenic mouse models of PDAC, the exact mechanisms of how oncogenic Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> modulates this process remain unclear. Here, we unveil a new downstream target of oncogenic Kras, cytokine CCL9 during ADM formation. Either exogenously treating primary pancreatic acini with recombinant CCL9 or ectopically expressing CCL9 in primary pancreatic acini resulted in ADM formation in a 3D organoid culture system. Furthermore, knockdown of CCL9 in Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-expressed acini reduced Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-induced ADM. Higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected in the Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-expressed pancreatic acini, and knockdown of CCL9 in these acini decreased ROS levels. Overexpression of CCL9 in primary pancreatic acini elevated cellular ROS of pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, depletion of ROS in 3D organoid culture of CCL9-expressed acini reduced CCL9-induced ADM formation. In transgenic mice of p48<sup>cre<\/sup>:Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>, blockade of CCL9 through its specific neutralizing antibody attenuated ADM formation as well as PanIN structures.

In recent years, females have begun to shoulder a greater burden of lung cancer diagnoses, specifically within the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) subtype; conversely, mortality is worsened for males. However, other sex-dependent effects in lung cancer are harder to predict. For example, hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women has been shown to predict better survival in some cohorts while auguring worse outcomes in others. Similar controversy exists regarding menopausal status, gender affirming care, and castration\/oophorectomy status. However, there is consensus that these differential effects relate to a patient&#8217;s sex hormone composition. Estrogen, a sex hormone abounding in females, boasts well-described pro-tumor signaling in breast cancer. Unfortunately, its role in lung cancer remains elusive. Estrogen is reported to exert inflammatory properties in the lung environment, to drive immune function, and to induce proliferation of lung cancer cells. This functional antagonism has led to questions about how these compartment-specific effects are balanced. In the lung, estrogen signaling occurs mainly via estrogen receptor beta (ER&#946;), a nuclear hormone receptor highly expressed in lung tissue and lung tumors. ER&#946; is understudied relative to its sibling ER&#945;, a well-known oncogene in breast cancer. While it is tempting to analogize ER&#945; oncogene function to ER&#946;, the literature lacks consensus on the role of ER&#946; in lung cancer, with some authors classifying it as an oncogene and others as a tumor suppressor. In LUAD, Kras mutations encompass a quarter of driver mutations, and interaction of Kras with ER&#946; is understudied. Here, we tested the effects of genetic ablation of ER&#946; in a murine model of Kras mutant LUAD (KM-LUAD) termed CCSP<sup>Cre<\/sup>\/LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> (CC-LR). Esr2 floxed mice were crossed with CC-LR mice to create a lung epithelial-specific conditional knockout of ER&#946; (LR\/Esr2<sup>&#916;\/&#916;<\/sup>). LR\/Esr2<sup>&#916;\/&#916;<\/sup> mice show significant decrease in tumor burden and total lung immune infiltration, indicating reduced tumor development and tumor-promoting inflammation. Of note, this effect manifests regardless of sex. RNA and protein-level analysis further suggest that ER&#946; deletion alters the balance of inflammatory transcription factors, resulting in skewing from STAT3- to NF-&#954;B-driven inflammation and a net anti-tumor response. These data suggest that ER&#946; offers a promising early target in nascent KM-LUAD tumors with therapeutic intervention possible regardless of sex-specific effects.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major upstream pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by malignant or microenvironmental cells that supports pancreatic inflammation, tumorigenesis, invasiveness, and tumor heterogeneity. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that the expression of DUOX2, one of seven NADPH oxidase (NOX) family members, is significantly enhanced by a wide variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that DUOX2-related ROS production may contribute to the development of an oxidative, pro-angiogenic microenvironment in PDAC. In the current studies, we have shown that DUOX2 is upregulated and expressed along with its maturation factor, DUOXA2, in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines following exposure to both IL-1&#945; and IL-1&#223;, two major agonists of IL-1 signaling. Administration of the anti-inflammatory antibody anakinra (an IL-1R1 antagonist) either in conjunction with or after prolonged treatment with IL-1 <i>in vitro <\/i>ablated induction of DUOX2\/DUOXA2 and of IL-8 (CXCL8), a chemokine essential for neutrophil recruitment and a potent promoter of angiogenesis. Increased expression of other NOX family members following IL-1 exposure was not observed. Using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated DUOX2 knockout models, we report that DUOX2 is the major contributor to IL-1-mediated ROS production in PDAC cells. In a panel of PDAC lines, siRNA knockdown of proximal IL-1 signaling nodes, such as MYD88, significantly decreased expression of DUOX2\/DUOXA2 and of CXCL8. However, knockdown of IRAK1 or IRAK4, two critical signaling kinases downstream of MYD88, as well as known downstream mediators of IL-1-related transcription (such as NF-&#954;B, STAT1, MEK\/ERK), did not affect IL-1-induced DUOX2\/DUOXA2 upregulation, suggesting that alternative pathways of IL-1 signaling might be involved in the enhancement of DUOX2 expression by the cytokine. Because IL-1 signaling is known to affect various acetylation\/methylation events in epithelial cells, we evaluated the effect of administering the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor A-485 with IL-1; we found that A-485 significantly diminished cytokine-induced DUOX2\/DUOXA2 upregulation; however, CXCL8 induction was unchanged. These studies suggest that epigenetic modulation of PDAC cells by IL-1 could contribute to DUOX2-induced ROS production and ROS-related inflammatory stress in the PDAC microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Inflammation,Reactive oxygen species,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>David J.

Chemokines secreted during inflammation are crucial at directing immune cell infiltration during cancer development. We screened patient dataset from different etiologies including HBV, HCV, alcohol and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and identified CXCL5 as the only chemokine consistently upregulated in HCC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of patient liver tumor tissues further showed the production of CXCL5 by tumor surrounding non parenchymal cells. Using a mouse model (Pte<sup> loxP\/loxP<\/sup>; Alb-Cre<sup>+<\/sup>, <i>Pten<\/i> null) which recapitulates human liver disease progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to NASH to liver cancer, we found that CXCL5 was expression was gradually increased during disease progression. Further analysis using IHC and flow cytometry analysis showed that CXCL5 is predominantly expressed by Kupffer cells in <i>Pten<\/i> null livers bearing tumors. Furthermore, we found that LPS stimulated the expression and secretion of CXCL5 in Kupffer cells, but not other macrophages including peritoneal macrophage and macrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells. We hypothesized that the Kupffer cell-secreted CXCL5 in response to LPS promotes tumor progression by promoting HCC cell proliferation and regulating HCC associated immune cell infiltration. To investigate whether CXCL5 increases tumor cell proliferation, we treated wild type and <i>Pten<\/i> null hepatocytes with various concentrations of CXCL5. Our results showed that CXCL5 increased hepatocytes viability in a dose dependent manner. BrdU incorporation assay further confirmed that CXCL5 treatments induces HCC cell proliferation through its receptor CXCR2. We further demonstrated that CXCR2 knockdown led to reduced xenograft tumor growth using HepG2 cells. Additionally, we injected <i>Pten<\/i> null mice with CXCR2 inhibitor to block CXCL5 signal and observed partial response. We analyzed the immune cell profile of the responder mice vs. non-responder mice and showed that tumor inhibition is correlated with T cell infiltration. To test whether Kupffer cells regulate T cells through CXCL5, we isolated primary Kupffer cells from murine livers. We performed transwell migration assay using immune cells from murine spleens. Our results indicate that LPS stimulation in Kupffer cells reduced the ratio of migrated CD4+ T cells, while blocking CXCL5 using a CXCL5 antibody significantly increased CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recruitment to the LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells and moderately decreased neutrophil recruitment. Consistently, we found that recombinant CXCL5 protein reduces CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell migration independent of neutrophils. In summary, our study suggests that Kupffer cell secreted CXCL5 reduces liver CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recruitment and increases liver cancer cell proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Macrophages,Chemokines,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

In contrast to their primary host-defensive role, NETs have been recently reported to promote cancer progression. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of NETs in ovarian cancer progression.<br \/>Method: The clinical data of ovarian cancer patients who underwent primary surgery at Osaka University Medical Hospital were retrospectively reviewed (n=340). The relationship between neutrophilia, peritoneal dissemination and prognosis were analyzed. Prior to initial treatment, peripheral blood was obtained from newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients and examined for CBC and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentration by ELISA. To evaluate NETs formation capacity, isolated neutrophils were stimulated with G-CSF and incubated in vitro to monitor NETs formation. The ascites was collected at the initial surgery and assessed for G-CSF concentration and for neutrophils population using flow cytometry. The omental tissues were pathologically examined for NETs using H&#38;E-staining and immunostaining with anti-Citrullinated Histon3 (CitH3) antibody. To test NETs induction capacity, we treated human peripheral blood neutrophils with the conditioned media from 20 ovarian cancer cell lines and the serum from ovarian cancer patients. Then human ovarian cancer OVCAR8 cells were co-cultured with NETs to evaluate the effect of NETs on cancer cell adhesion.<br \/>Results: Neutrophilia (neutrophils&#62;7000\/&#181;l) was found in 39 patients (39\/340,11.5%). Patients with neutrophilia were associated with advanced disease accompanied by peritoneal dissemination and compromised survival compared to patients without neutrophilia (5-year PFS 40.0 vs 59.9 %, p 0.0027). In these patients, serum G-CSF was upregulated. Neutrophils from ovarian cancer patients formed NETs significantly earlier than those from benign tumor patients. Ovarian cancer patients with neutrophilia showed elevated G-CSF concentration and increased neutrophils proportion in their ascites. Omental tissues from patients with neutrophilia showed NETs foci close to the disseminated lesions. G-CSF strongly induced neutrophils to form NETs in vitro, which was observed in some conditioned media from ovarian cancer cell lines and serum from ovarian cancer patients as well. The adhesion of ovarian cancer cell was increased by co-incubation with NETs.<br \/>Conclusion: Neutrophilia is associated with peritoneal dissemination and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. One of the underlying mechanism of neutrophilia is upregulated G-CSF, which stimulate neutrophils to form NETs. NETs may have a causative effect on ovarian cancer dissemination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Peritoneal metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

However, the specific impact of inflammasome-produced cytokines from tumor cells on disease progression remains uncertain. In this study, we show that the expression levels of inflammasome-related genes (NLRP1 and NLRP3), combined with levels of the intestine-specific homeobox (ISX), significantly correlate with factors like lesion count, disease stage, and lymph vascular invasion. Tumor cells enhance the secretion of key cytokines such as IL-1&#946; and IL-18, exacerbating disease progression via the ISX-TWIST1 complex. In terms of mechanism, transcriptomic analysis and molecular evidence reveal that ISX interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain of TWIST1 through its homeobox domain. This interaction forms a transcriptional complex that activates inflammasomes by directly binding to the conserved sequence \"-GGDWYR-\" in promoter regions of several NF-&#954;B and inflammasome-related genes (NFKBs, RELs, NLRP1, NLRP3, NEK7, AIM2, and ASC). Elevated levels of IL-18, induced by active inflammasomes, lead to the shift of M0 macrophages into the M2-like phenotype within the hepatic microenvironment. In mice with liver-specific ISX mutations, inflammasome-related genes and activities were eliminated, stopping disease progression in an acute hepatic disease model. These findings underscore the critical role of the ISX-TWIST1 complex in liver disease and tumor progression on both mechanistic and clinical levels. They also offer new insights for potential preventive and therapeutic targets in liver disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Liver cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.-T.

Less common PCDs include primary and secondary extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP), which occur in soft tissues. EMPs are typically solitary and infrequent, often localized in the upper aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts, lung, and lymph nodes among other organs, and can convert to Multiple Myeloma. Secondary extramedullary plasmacytomas are often noted in advanced disease following multiple rounds of therapy and are commonly associated with poor prognosis. Studies aimed at gaining a better understanding of soft tissue EMPs, whether solitary plasmacytomas with undiagnosed multiple myeloma or in the context of recurrent or metastatic EMP disease, are limited. In this study, we employ a comprehensive approach using multiple modalities, including dissociated CITE-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed spatial immuno-fluorescence imaging to interrogate the tumor and immune landscape in EMP disease. Importantly, the use of the same biomarker antibodies across these modalities provides a cross-data-framework for a deep contextual understanding of the immune and tumor cell organization and cell-to-cell signaling in EMP. Ultimately, this study provides new insights into patient-to-patient and tumor location variability, tumor and immune cell microenvironment heterogeneity, and possible future therapeutic strategies for EMP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Immune cells,Multiomics,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

ST316 is a clinical stage cell-penetrating peptide antagonist of the interaction of &#946;-catenin with its co-activator BCL9, selectively impairing a subset of Wnt target genes and demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity against Wnt-driven tumors in vivo. ST316 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1-2 study (NCT05848739) enrolling patients with selected advanced solid tumors likely to harbor abnormalities of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. Here we explore the potential of ST316 to activate the TIME and provide data to support combination treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT therapies. Macrophages derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were activated by LPS and IFN&#947; (M1) or IL-4 (M2) in the presence of ST316 or control and were immunophenotyped by expression of CD80 and CD163 to assess M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively. ST316 induced marked repolarization of hPBMC-derived M2 macrophages to the M1 identity in vitro, as shown by increased CD80 and decreased CD163 staining. Increasing concentration of ST316 in co-cultures of M2 cells with CD8+ T cells induced up to a three-fold increase in IFN-&#947; expressing cells relative to controls. Additionally, ST316 exposure increased CD155\/PVR expression on 4T1 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells, but not MV411 TNBC that are not Wnt-dependent. When combined with anti-TIGIT treatment, ST316 led to increased T cell activation in an ex vivo assay where 4T1 cells were co-incubated with syngeneic splenic CD8+ cells and frequency of IFN-&#947; producing cells was assessed. In in vivo experiments, Balb\/C mice bearing syngeneic 4T1 TNBC orthotopic tumors were treated with vehicle, ST316, anti-PD-1 or combination. Sub-pharmacologic ST316 enhanced anti-PD-1 suppression of 4T1 tumor growth and induced a substantial decrease of the M2 marker CD209 (DC-SIGN) in the Tumor Associated Macrophage (TAMs). These data support two novel mechanisms of action for the &#946;-catenin antagonist peptide ST316. First, ST316 exposure results in macrophage repolarization towards an immune-active M1 program, both in vitro and in vivo, and increases T-cell activation in co-culture assays. Second, ST316 induced CD155\/PVR upregulation and T-cell activation in the presence of anti-TIGIT antibody. Collectively these results suggest a novel immune-modulatory role for ST316 in the TIME and provide rational for combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,ST316,Beta-catenin,TIGIT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, challenges such as immunogenicity stemming from non-human or unnatural sequences and limitations in preclinical animal study systems still impede the rapid development of antibody drugs.<br \/>To overcome these hurdles, GemPharmatech has created a novel antibody gene humanized model, the NeoMab mouse, to develop fully human antibodies. The NeoMab model was established via large genomic fragment knock-in technology, retaining native mouse constant region encoding genes and regulatory elements, while incorporating human variable gene repertoires into the endogenous loci. Developed in the BALB\/c background, the NeoMab mouse carries fully functional MHC molecules, potentially enhancing antigen presentation. These mice sustain a competent immune system with a B cell development and maturation pattern, immune cell profile, and serum immunoglobulin levels comparable to those of BALB\/c mice.<br \/>NeoMab mice exhibit a robust humoral immune response, with a rapid increase in antigen-specific serum titers upon immunization using different antigens, such as recombined protein, plasmids, and overexpressing cell lines. Utilizing human V(D)J genes to encode immunoglobulins at a human-like frequency and diversity, antibodies derived from NeoMab mice demonstrate affinity and functional activity comparable to, or even surpassing, FDA-approved drugs.<br \/>In conclusion, the NeoMab mouse model in the BALB\/c background has been rigorously validated to elicit a robust response to specific antigen immunization, producing antibodies with high affinity, diversity, and functional activity. GemPharmatech's extensive drug-target gene humanized mouse library (comprising over 800 targets) and diverse disease models in oncology and other fields facilitate a seamless connection between in vitro antibody screening and in vivo animal studies. The integration of NeoMab, target humanization animals, and disease models enables GemPharmatech to provide an integrated solution, reducing time and costs while elevating the quality of antibody discovery in the field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Antibody drugs,NeoMab,Humanized mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In previous studies we have demonstrated that either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), subsets of PBMCs like T and NK cells or CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can be used to establish a HIS model. With the development of next-generation NOG mice, lineage-specific differentiation of immune cell sub-populations of interest can be supported. Transplantation of cell line-derived (CDX) or patient-derived (PDX) tumor xenografts on HIS mice provides a full model for human tumors for the investigation of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), as well as novel cell therapies and immune cell engagers.<br \/>Methods: HSC-humanized mice were generated by i.v. transplantation of CD34+ stem cells to immunodeficient mice. For humanization, NOG mice and next-generation NOG strains were used: NOG, NOG-EXL, hIL-2 NOG, hIL-6 NOG and FcResolv&#8482; NOG mice were compared to each other for lineage-specific differentiation using single donors or a mixed HSC donor pool. Engraftment of immune cells was monitored by FACS analysis of blood every four weeks. In humanized NOG mice, CDX and PDX from different entities were s.c. transplanted and used to evaluate CPI.<br \/>Results: Humanized hIL-2 NOG mice showed significantly decreased survival after HSC transplantation in comparison to the other mouse strains and had to be sacrificed within the first 6-8 weeks after HSC transplantation. In the other mouse strains, transplanted HSCs engrafted and differentiated mainly into B and T cells. NOG-EXL mice displayed the highest engraftment, with up to 80% of human cells in the blood, including a higher portion of myeloid cells. In humanized hIL-6 NOG mice a higher portion of monocytes could be determined. FcResolv&#8482; NOG mice lack murine Fc gamma receptors in order to reduce confounding interactions between residual murine immune cells and antibody-based therapies, and they engraft and differentiate human HSCs similarly to the parent NOG strain. In humanized NOG mice, selected CDX and PDX tumors successfully engrafted without significant differences in tumor growth compared to non-humanized mice. CPI treatments induced tumor growth delay in selected models.<br \/>Conclusions: Next-generation NOG mouse strains are characterized by a lineage-specific differentiation of immune cells depending on integrated human cytokines. Furthermore, we established a human tumor-immune-cell model for NOG mice using different entities of CDX or PDX in combination with CPI. Our human tumor-immune cell models allow preclinical translational studies on tumor immune biology as well as evaluation of new therapies, drug combinations and biomarker identification and validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Immuno-oncology,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Additionally, variations in immune responses exist between mouse strains in <i>Leishmania spp.<\/i> and Melanoma models, but these studies in the context of liver diseases including Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) have not been carried out. With the effort to state if these variations exist within the liver, we performed comprehensive spectral flow cytometry analysis on the liver and spleens of three female mouse strains commonly used in cancer research (BALB\/c, C57BL\/6, and FVBN). NAFLD was induced by providing mice with a methionine choline deficient diet. To promote HCC, a single genotype (myc\/p53<i><sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>) was induced by administering transposon-based vectors to overexpress Myc-Luc and CRISPR\/Cas-9 vectors to knock down p53 via hydrodynamic tail-vein injection. To confirm vector integration and monitor tumor growth (luciferase activity), in vivo imaging was performed at different time points. As a result, we confirm throughout this study that differences exist within immune cell populations of the liver and spleen at baseline. Moreover, we depict differences in the shift of immune cell populations across mouse strains in the pathologic states included. In NAFLD, there is an increase of dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, NK cells, ILC1s, T regulatory cells (Tregs), T<sub>H<\/sub>1, and T<sub>H<\/sub>2, and a decrease of CD4+ T cells, B cells, &#947;&#948;-T cells, and NKT cells in the liver across all mouse strains, when compared to controls. However, the population of neutrophils in BALB\/c decreases, and the population of CD8+ T cells increases in C57BL\/6 mice, which differs from the patterns of change seen in the other mouse strains. Moreover, in spleens, NAFLD promotes an increase of T<sub>H<\/sub>1 and NK cells, and a decrease of T<sub>H<\/sub>2 and NKT Cells across the mouse strains included in the study, whereas the patterns of change differ between mouse strains among the remaining immune cell types. When evaluating liver immune cell population shifts on our HCC model, BALB\/c mice showed a decrease in macrophages and ILC1s, C57BL\/6 mice showed a decrease in &#947;&#948;-T cells, prominent shifts across Neutrophils, T<sub>H<\/sub>1, and NKT cells, and null changes in T<sub>H<\/sub>2 and CD4+ T cell shifts, and FVBN mice had a less prominent decrease of B cells, which differed from the shifts observed in the mouse strains used for comparison. Immune cell populations in the spleens of our HCC mouse model also presented with differences across the mouse strains studied. In conclusion, we highlight that key differences in immune profiles exist across commonly used mouse strains for cancer research in the presence of liver pathology including HCC, suggesting that mouse strains could be possible confounders in the study of immune oncology of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Flow cytometry,Liver cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Francisco  J.

HIS mice require a human donor source of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to provide the human immune cell system. However, variance across donors complicates study design and hypothesis testing. To determine if parameters critical to drug discovery are consistent across batches of HIS mice from the same donor, we evaluated two independent cohorts of human tumor xenograft-bearing mice made using a common set of five different CD34+ cell donors. Our study included evaluation of tumor growth kinetics, human immune reconstitution and phenotype, and the pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody directed against a human target expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>HIS NOG-EXL (huNOG-EXL) mice were created using CD34+ cells from five donors in two independent cohorts (~12 weeks apart). Baseline immune reconstitution in blood was assessed at 10 weeks post engraftment.

Body weight, clinical observations, endogenous hIgG levels, and tumor growth were measured. For efficacy, tumors grew to ~100 mm<sup>3<\/sup> and mice were dosed intraperitoneally every five days (6 doses total).

Donors that had poor health outcomes (body condition scores [BCS] &#60;3) showed less consistency than those that experienced good (BCS=3) outcomes. The health trajectory, peripheral human immune cell engraftment, and PK profiles were similar across experiments for a given donor. Total human immune cell infiltration in tumors was similar across experiments, but there were notable shifts in immune cell composition. Whereas mice in the first cohort showed a dominant TAM phenotype within the tumor (~&#62;50% of all hCD45+ cells), mice across donors in the second cohort had reduced TAMs and corresponding increases in several T cell subsets. Efficacy was consistent in donors with good health outcomes (Donors 1 and 4) and was inconsistent in those with poor outcomes (Donors 3 and 5).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study demonstrates that a return-to-donor approach can provide information that is reproducible across cohorts to help build a donor profile.

Most antibody-based therapeutics have an IgG backbone and thus engage Fc gamma receptors. Traditional HIS mice retain murine immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages which can interact with human IgG-based therapeutics and confound preclinical results. To determine whether knockout of murine Fc gamma receptors (Fc&#947;Rs) in a super-immunodeficient mouse model would alter anti-PD1 efficacy compared to the parent strain, we studied tumor growth kinetics, human reconstitution, and tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) in each strain engrafted with HCC827 lung adenocarcinoma tumor cells treated with pembrolizumab or vehicle. Methods: HIS NOG (huNOG) or HIS Fc&#947;R knockout NOG mice (FcResolv&#8482; huNOG) were created using identical protocols with CD34+ cells from three human donors shared across both strains. Baseline reconstitution was evaluated in na&#239;ve animals via flow cytometry. HCC827 cells were inoculated in remaining animals. Animals were randomized on day 7 post-tumor implantation into 12 groups. Body weight, clinical observations, and tumor growth were measured. Mice received treatment from D7, dosed twice weekly for four weeks, and were then euthanized for FACS analysis, collecting blood, spleen, and tumor samples. Results: For a given donor, no significant differences were seen between strains in human immune reconstitution and kinetics. Pembrolizumab treatment showed significant tumor growth inhibition in one donor in FcResolv huNOG, but not in donor-matched huNOG mice. Evaluation of human TILs in pembrolizumab-treated animals showed significant differences between the strains across all donors, with FcResolv huNOG mice showing increased CD8+ T cells and decreased tumor-associated macrophages compared to vehicle-treated mice, and no significant differences in huNOG. Evaluation of murine TILs revealed differences in murine macrophage populations, regardless of treatment, with Ly6C<sup>lo<\/sup> dominant in FcResolv huNOG and Ly6C<sup>hi <\/sup>dominant in huNOG. In the presence of pembrolizumab, the murine myeloid and granulocyte population within the spleen is significantly decreased in FcResolv huNOG mice whereas no change was seen in huNOG. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates when treated with anti-PD1, FcResolv huNOG mice show expected pharmacodynamic changes and donor-dependent efficacy whereas, despite identical donors and creation protocols, pembrolizumab-treated huNOG mice showed neither. These differences are due to the presence or absence of murine Fc&#947;Rs and their impact on antibody IgG-based therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Transgenic mouse models,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Targeting this pathway is an attractive therapeutic strategy for certain inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. Here, we generated a novel humanized IL5\/IL5RA model (B-hIL5\/hIL5RA) to examine the utility of human IL-5\/IL5R-targeting therapeutic candidates. Specifically, the entire murine <i>Il5 <\/i>coding region was replaced by the corresponding human <i>IL5 <\/i>sequence, and the human <i>IL5RA <\/i>sequence coding the extracellular domain was inserted to replace the corresponding murine sequence. Successful generation of the model was confirmed by expression of human IL-5 by ELISA and IL5RA by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the proportion of eosinophils in the blood of B-hIL5\/hIL5RA mice increased after stimulation with human IL5 recombinant protein, indicating that the humanized IL5RA protein is functional. Next, the ability of the humanized mice to establish asthma-like disease was tested using ovalbumin: following a 14 day sensitization period, mice were challenged with nebulized OVA daily from day 21 until the endpoint; treatment with mepolizumab or benralizumab analog was performed. Flow cytometric analysis of the bronchioalveolar fluid indicates that treatment with mepolizumab or benralizumab analog significantly lowered the number of eosinophils when compared to the isotype control in homozygous B-hIL5\/hIL5RA mice. Blood counts and quantification of lung H&#38;E sections also confirm that the treatments lowered the number of eosinophils in circulation and lung tissue, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that B-hIL5\/hIL5RA mice are a suitable preclinical model to test novel modulators of human IL-5\/IL-5RA signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Animal models,Cytokines,Inflammation,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Enhanced activity of therapeutic IgG can be achieved by the modulation of Fc binding to Fc&#947; receptors (Fc&#947;R), which will consequently modulate the Fc-effector functions triggered upon crosslinking of target and effector cells by these antibodies. Assessment of therapeutic antibodies pharmacodynamic (PD) in preclinical models is challenging, as the Fc&#947;R are different from mice to human, as well as their expression pattern. FcRn is involved in the recycling and transport of IgG and is a key determinant of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IgG. We report here a novel mouse model expressing human Fc&#947;R with a human-like expression pattern, in which human Fc&#947;RI, Fc&#947;RIIA, Fc&#947;RIIB, Fc&#947;RIIIA, Fc&#947;RIIIB are expressed and replace their mouse orthologs. The model was intercrossed with the hSA\/hFcRn mouse model (Viuff <i>et al<\/i>., 2016), which has shown to improve translatability of PK assessment of therapeutics with extended half-life via FcRn recycling and\/or HSA binding. Investigation of Fc&#947;RI, Fc&#947;RIIA, Fc&#947;RIIB, Fc&#947;RIIIA, Fc&#947;RIIIB expression on DC, monocytes, granulocytes, NK, T and B cells shows that expression pattern in hFc&#947;R mice is consistent with their expression on human PBMC, with a few exceptions. These receptors are functional, as a human IgG1 targeting mouse CD20 induces approximately 50% of B-cell depletion in blood and liver, after a single iv administration in hFc&#947;R mice. This depletion is Fc-mediated, as it is abrogated when hFc&#947;R mice are treated with an anti-mouse CD20 human IgG1 with a Fc-null mutation. Assessment of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) <i>ex vivo<\/i> to investigate Fc&#947;R functionality in NK cells shows that Rituximab, an anti-human CD20 chimeric IgG1 with regular Fc, induces higher ADCC efficacy in NK cells from hFc&#947;R than in NK cells from WT mice. Obinutuzumab, an anti-human CD20 featuring an optimized Fc portion to enhance binding to Fc&#947;RIII, shows higher tumor cell lysis than Rituximab in NK cells from hFc&#947;R mice, suggesting this model enables ranking of antibodies. Moreover, assessment of activity of Fc-engineered anti-influenza IgG antibodies also shows that anti-Flu antibody with enhanced Fc binding outperforms the WT antibody, improves protective activity, and demonstrates effector function in influenza challenge model, following prophylactic treatment. Conversely, hFc&#947;R mice treated with an Fc-null version of the anti-Flu antibody shows reduced protective activity and survival compared with the WT antibody. Therefore, the model reported here is a novel tool for testing efficacy of Fc-engineered therapeutic antibodies. We are currently investigating the PK profile of therapeutic antibodies in the hFc&#947;R\/hSA\/hFcRn model. This novel tool is being improved to enable tolerability to human IgG1, biodistribution to the central nervous system, and flexibility of test of therapeutics through expression of human immune checkpoints.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Mouse models,Fc receptor,Pharmacodynamics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Use of antibiotics during cancer therapy can lead to dysbiosis, which may affect treatment outcomes. Here, we examine the effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on cancer progression in mice with <i>Pten<\/i>-null castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). After five or eight weeks, orchiectomized conditional <i>Pten<\/i>-null knockout (KO) mice aged 50 and 90 weeks were given two biweekly cycles of a broad-spectrum antibody cocktail (BSAbx), respectively. The effects of BSAbx on tumor burden were compared, and molecular and immunological responses were analyzed by quantitative IHC (qIHC) and qRt-PCR at week four after antibiotic treatment. BSAbx treatment resulted in tumor burdens of 1.2 and 2.4-fold higher than in control mice in mice aged 50 and 90 weeks, respectively. qIHC analysis of KI67 showed increased proliferation in stromal and cancer cells. Additionally, androgen receptor (AR) protein and gene expression levels of <i>Ar<\/i> and <i>Ar<\/i> target genes (<i>Fkbp5<\/i>, <i>Tmprss2<\/i>, and <i>Timp4<\/i>) were elevated in tumors of BSAbx-treated mice. Restoring gut microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from KO mice CRPC after BSAbx restored AR transcriptional activity to basal levels and lessened tumor growth. FMT from non-castrated KO with castration-na&#239;ve prostate cancer or heathy wildtype mice further reduced AR Transcriptional activity. Moreover, altering the gut microbiota of CRPC mice with FMT from heathy mice resulted in a tendency for lower tumor burden, 21% reduction versus control mice. Immunologically, BSAbx treatment resulted in decreased CD11b+\/GR1+ cells in tumors and were associated with decreased interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), dendritic cell functions and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity gene signatures.

Research indicates that patients with UC are more susceptible to prostate cancer (PCa) and individuals with PCa may also be at a higher risk for developing CRC. However, these relationships are not well defined. Here, we explored these relationships using preclinical mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis (DSS-UC) and in young and aged healthy wild-type mice and conditional transgenic mice harboring <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient (KO) or <i>Pten\/Trp53-deficient<\/i> (DKO) PCa. After a 25-week follow-up, DSS-induced UC caused more severe colitis in prostate tumor-bearing DKO compared to healthy WT mice. None of the DSS WT mice developed tumors, whereas 75% (3\/4 mice) of DSS DKO mice did, including two out of four mice that developed multiple tumors. Overall, DKO mice with prostate tumors had increased levels of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>\/Gr1<sup>+<\/sup> in peripheral blood, prostate, and colon compared with WT mice. Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses revealed that DKO mice with prostate tumors had a significantly higher 2.8-fold increase in the levels of Gr1+ cells in the colon compared to heathy WT mice. Overall, DSS-induced colitis further increased Gr1+ cells in the colon of WT and DKO mice by 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively. Gr1+ cells comprised 3.0%, 4.7%, and 10.1% of cells in normal colon from control WT mice and inactive and active regions of the colon in DSS-exposed WT mice, respectively. In DKO mice, Gr1+ cells comprised 7.0%, 19.2%, and 23.6% of cells in normal colon from control mice and inactive and active regions of the colon in DSS-exposed mice, respectively. CD68+, which corresponds to M1 polarized macrophages comprised 0.9%, 1.8%, and 20.6% of cells in normal colon from control WT mice and inactive and active regions of the colon in DSS-exposed WT mice, respectively, However, in DKO mice CD68+ cells comprised 3.0%, 2.8% and 1.6% of cells in normal colon from control mice and inactive and active regions of the colon in DSS-exposed mice, respectively. Our study suggests that Gr1 cells that were abundant in PCa-bearing mice were also present in colons and could have contributed to CRC. Moreover, CD68+ macrophages in the colons of healthy mice may have decreased tumor promoting effects of DSS. This study provides preclinical evidence showing that systemic inflammation in the presence of an existing malignancy increases the risk of a second malignancy, in this case linking PCa to colitis-induced-CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Colon cancer,Inflammatory bowel disease,Carcinogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yurie Kura<sup><\/sup>, <b>Marco A.

Harnessing this intrinsic process for cancer immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic strategy; thus, developing preclinical models to evaluate the efficacy of novel peptide vaccines <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>ex vivo <\/i>is critical. Previously, we developed a humanized MHC I mouse model (B-HLA-A2.1 mice), in which we successfully demonstrated efficacy of peptide vaccines as assessed by splenocyte IFN-&#947; production measured via ELISpot. Here, we provide evidence that B-HLA-A2.1 mice can also mount immune responses to NY-ESO-1 and WT1-Db126 peptides using the same assay. Additionally, immunization with WT1-Db126 at 7, 14, and 21 days prior to tumor inoculation with WT1-expressing MC38 colon cancer cells significantly reduced tumor volume. Additionally, we have generated two new humanized HLA models: B-HLA-A11.1 mice and B-HLA-A24.2 mice. Flow cytometric data demonstrate successful expression of the human HLAs on the cell surface of splenocytes isolated from both strains. Compared to wild-type C57BL\/6 mice, analysis of leukocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations in the humanized mice indicates that the CD4\/CD8 ratio is altered in favor of CD4+ T cells in both strains, similar to what was observed in B-HLA-A2.1 humanized mice. Despite these observed alterations, B-HLA-A24.2 mice were able to mount an immune response to peptide SART2 93-101, which was measured by splenocyte IFN-&#947; production. In summary, our data indicate that humanized HLA-A mice provide a powerful preclinical model for <i>in vivo\/ex vivo <\/i>evaluation of novel peptide vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HLA class I,Animal models,Vaccines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Zhenlan Niu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuan Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhiyuan Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingcong Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Veronika Chromikova<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Hui Xu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9674efb7-5b33-4075-8494-f481fee8382d","ControlNumber":"4895","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

In mice, the Fcgr4 receptor is primarily responsible for triggering ADCC, while the FCGR3A receptor (CD16A) mediates this function in human NK cells, which are an attractive target cell type for cancer immunotherapy. Given these differences, we sought to generate humanized CD16A preclinical models to evaluate the efficacy of antibodies in triggering human CD16A-mediated ADCC <i>in vivo<\/i>. Previously, we established humanized CD16A mice on immunocompetent backgrounds for evaluating efficacy of novel antibodies in preventing growth of syngeneic tumor models. Here, we introduce a novel humanized CD16A mouse on the CB-17-SCID background, in order to inoculate human tumor cells for therapeutic efficacy testing. We confirmed expression of CD16A in human NK cells and monocytes\/macrophages, but not granulocytes in the model; expression of murine Fcgr4 was no longer detectable, indicating successful generation of the model. Assessment of leukocyte populations in the humanized model indicated no significant alterations in the percentages of NK cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages in the spleen or blood of the humanized mice compared with wild-type CB-17 SCID mice. Subsequently, the ability of these mice to grow human tumor cells was evaluated: B-hHep3B-Luc, HC116, K-562, and NCI-N87 tumors were all successfully established. Finally, efficacy of an anti-human CLDN18.2 antibody was evaluated against B-hCLDN18.2 BxPC-3 tumors in the humanized mice, which showed modest anti-tumor efficacy at 30 mg\/kg when compared to isotype control-treated mice. In summary, humanized B-hCD16A mice (CB-17-SCID) provide a suitable model for evaluating the ability of antibody candidates to induce ADCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ADCC,Animal models,Preclinical testing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Xiao Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenlan Niu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruili Lv<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingcong Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Mari Kuraguchi<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Qingqing Xu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3eace738-481f-48a9-86c7-6801b845a024","ControlNumber":"4996","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.
