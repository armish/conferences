[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers; however, factors attributing to increased risk of second primary cancer in breast cancer survivors are under-studied. We evaluated the association of metabolic syndrome conditions with second primary cancer of any organ in breast cancer survivors.<br \/>Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 37,222 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008-2020 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated healthcare system. We extracted data on cancer-related variables, sociodemographic and clinical variables from KPSC&#8217;s cancer registry and electronic health records. Among the metabolic conditions, we identified diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia using ICD-10 diagnosis codes at or 1-year prior to breast cancer diagnosis; obesity was based on body mass index (BMI&#8805;30kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>). We included metabolic syndrome as a categorical variable: 0, 1-2, and 3+ metabolic conditions. We followed patients electronically from breast cancer diagnosis until patients developed second primary cancer of any organ, died, disenrolled from the health plan, or reached study&#8217;s end (12\/31\/2021), whichever occurred first. Proportional hazards regression was used to report association [HR (95%CI)] between metabolic conditions and any second primary cancer.<br \/>Results: During a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.17 (2.75-8.58) years, 1701 (4.6%) patients developed any second primary cancer. More than half (53.1%) of the breast cancer survivors had 1-2 metabolic conditions at baseline; 19.4% had 3+ metabolic conditions, and the rest 27.5% did not have any metabolic condition. Hypertension was the most common metabolic condition (45.5%), followed by obesity (38.9%), dyslipidemia (36.5%), and diabetes (19.0%). Survivors with 0 and 1-2 metabolic conditions were 35% and 19% less likely to develop any second primary cancer than survivors with 3+ metabolic conditions, respectively [crude HR (95%CI): 0.65 (0.57-0.75) and 0.81 (0.72-0.91), respectively]. Reduced risk in survivors with 1-2 metabolic conditions persisted adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, breast cancer diagnosis year, breast tumor SEER summary stage, breast tumor estrogen-progesterone status, smoking status, and breast tumor treatment [adjusted HR (95%CI): 0.87 (0.77-0.99)].<br \/>Conclusion: Risk of second primary cancer of any organ was elevated in breast cancer survivors with three or more metabolic conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Survivors,Metabolic syndrome,Second primary cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Thus, it is imperative to identify strategies that can reduce the risk of the disease. Several contraceptive methods have been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, including combined oral contraceptives, injectable progestins, and tubal ligation. However, the use of these contraceptive methods has been decreasing in the U.S., with a growing preference for intrauterine devices (IUDs) for pregnancy prevention. Previous case-control studies on the association between IUD use and ovarian cancer risk have found inconsistent results. Notably, previous studies had small sample sizes and did not restrict to invasive epithelial tumors. The current analysis assessed the association between IUD use and risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer in a large population-based case-control study.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This analysis used data from 1,713 people diagnosed with primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (cases) and 2,348 cancer-free people (controls) participating in a case-control study conducted in Los Angeles, CA from 1992-2010. The study consisted of four waves of recruitment with similar enrollment and data collection methods. Logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between IUD use and risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. All models were adjusted for age, race\/ethnicity, education, first-degree family history of ovarian cancer, endometriosis, body mass index, duration of combined oral contraceptive use, parity, duration of breastfeeding, tubal ligation, and study wave. Heterogeneity across the study waves and the ovarian cancer histotypes was evaluated using standard meta-analysis techniques.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> There was no statistically significant association between IUD use and risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio=1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.28). This result was consistent across the study waves and the ovarian cancer histotypes (p-values for heterogeneity&#62;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> IUD use was not associated with the risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Analysis by IUD type (i.e., hormone-releasing vs copper IUDs) was not possible in this study as these data were not collected. Future research should examine whether the type of IUD (i.e. copper versus hormone-releasing) may have different effects on risk of ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Intrauterine devices,Cancer risk,Population-based study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Minh Tung Phung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuting Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Alice  W.

Using data from the American Cancer Society&#8217;s Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3), we investigated the association of body weight across the life course and risk of CRC.<br \/>From 2006-13, over 300,000 participants (ages 30-65) enrolled in the CPS-3 cohort and provided a baseline waist circumference (WC) measure, self-reported baseline weight and height, weight at age 18, and weight at each decade of adulthood (20s to current age). Body shape phenotype (apple, pear, other) was self-reported in 2015. Excess body mass index (BMI)-years was calculated by subtracting a reference BMI of 25 from the reported BMI for each decade of life and aggregating excess BMI for the reported years of life. Through 2018, 424 incident cases of colorectal cancer were reported, of which 94 were younger than 50 years. Associations of BMI measures and WC with incident CRC were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression and stratified by sex and body shape.<br \/>After exclusions (n=248,804), 78% of participants were women, 85% were non-Hispanic white, 69% were never smokers, and 8% had a family history of CRC. The mean baseline age was 47.8 (women) and 48.5 (men) years. The mean baseline BMI, WC, and age 18 BMI were 27.6 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, 91.9 cm, and 21.7 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, respectively, among women and 28.3 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, 103.8 cm, and 23.1 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, respectively, among men. Baseline BMI was associated with 8% higher CRC risk (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.18) per 5 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> increase. However, apple body shape was associated with higher CRC risk (hazard ratio (HR) per 5 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> BMI = 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.38). WC was associated with higher CRC risk (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15) per 10 cm increase, and the association was higher for apple body shape (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28). BMI at age 18 was associated with 17% higher CRC risk (95% CI 1.03-1.32) per 5 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> increase, and the association was higher for apple body shape (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.12-1.65). Associations for non-apple body shapes were not statistically significant across all exposures. For early-onset CRC, associations with baseline BMI, WC, and age 18 BMI were suggestive of higher risk but not statistically significant. Participants in the highest category of excess BMI-years (women &#8805;35, men &#8805;81) relative to those in the lowest had 56% higher risk of overall CRC (95% CI 1.19-2.05), but the association with early-onset CRC was not statistically significant (HR 1.92, 95% CI 0.90-4.07).<br \/>These findings suggest that while obesity is associated with higher CRC risk, excess weight gain around the waist and at younger ages may be of importance. Studies are needed to confirm these findings and further investigate the potential role of early-life obesity in the development of early-onset CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Epidemiology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Bladder cancer is a leading tumor of urinary tract with annually 570,000+ new cases and 200,000+ deaths worldwide. In the United States, the current incidence rate of bladder cancer is 15.8 per 100,000 population with more than 82,000 new cases and more than 16,000 deaths each year. Although smoking is established as a major risk factor for bladder cancer development, accounting for 30-50% cases, the role of other modifiable risk factors, including dietary in bladder cancer remains unclear. Low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is a dietary pattern to restrict carbohydrate and to favor protein and\/or fat intakes that has recently been well-accepted for weight loss. While its short-term effect to support the weight loss has been popular, its long-term effect on chronic diseases, including cancer, needs to be elucidated. In the current analysis, we sought to determine the association between LCD scores and bladder cancer risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS), an ongoing prospective cohort study consisting of more than 63,000 Chinese Singaporeans, 45- 74 years of age at baseline enrollment period 1995-1998.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>.

Animal-based LCD score was significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer. The HRs and respective 95% CIs of bladder cancer for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, compared with the lowest quartile, were 1.09 (0.76-1.56), 1.17 (0.81-1.70), and 1.53 (1.09-2.17) (<i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.01). The positive association was only present in men, ever smokers, never drinkers and individuals without history of type 2 diabetes (All <i>P&#8217;s<sub>heterogeneity<\/sub><\/i>&#62;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. In a prospective cohort study of more than 63,000 Chinese Singaporeans, we found that animal-based LCD score, representing a diet with lower carbohydrate and higher animal fat and protein, was significantly associated with increased risk of bladder cancer. Dietary modification is therefore suggested as an effective strategy for primary prevention of bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Risk factors,Bladder cancer,Incidence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, the association between plant-based diet and survival in metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown.<br \/>Methods: Using an NCI-sponsored systemic therapy trial conducted from 2005 to 2015 (CALGB\/SWOG 80405), we included 1,279 patients who completed validated food frequency questionnaires at the initiation of treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. To emphasize different impact of healthful plant foods, less healthful plant foods, and animal foods, we used 18 food groups to calculate three plant-based indexes (ranges: 18-90 points): overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was progression-free survival. We estimated the associations of three indexes (quintiles) with survival using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.<br \/>Results: Of 1,279 patients (median follow-up: 6.1 years), mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 58.8 (11.7) years, 57.4% were men, 85.6% were White, and 1,096 deaths and 1,201 events of progression occurred. The mean (SD) points of three indexes were 51.2 (6.3) for PDI, 51.1 (6.7) for hPDI, and 51.2 (8.1) for uPDI. Compared to the lowest quintile (Q1), the highest quintile (Q5) of PDI was significantly associated with better overall survival (HR: 0.80 [0.65-0.99]) and progression-free survival (HR: 0.80 [0.65-0.98]). Similar findings were observed for hPDI, but uPDI was not significantly associated with worse survival.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that plant-based diet is associated with better survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and plant-based dietary interventions should be considered for future trials in metastatic colorectal cancer.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{E0D734B0-95F0-476C-9366-75F98F81AD6D}\"><caption>Table.

In 2009, National Cancer Center Korea reported that 3.0% and 0.5% of total cancer incidence were attributable to alcohol consumption in men and women, respectively. Herein, we estimated population attributable fraction (PAF) of cancer incidence due to alcohol consumption as of 2020.<br \/>Methods: We organized the Consensus Committee to establish strategy and methodology of PAF estimation. Based on the consensus, cancer sites for PAF estimation were selected according to the IARC List of classification with sufficient evidence in human. PAF was calculated by using Levin&#8217;s formula which incorporates exposure prevalence and relative risk (RR). Exposure prevalence was obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in 2005, assuming that latent period between exposure to alcohol consumption and diagnosis of cancer would be 15 years. Alcohol consumption was defined as non-drinking (&#60;0.1g\/day), light (0.1~30g\/day), moderate (30~60g\/day), and heavy (60~588g\/day) drinking according to the definition by World Health Organization. We estimated RRs from the cohort data established by Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, National Health Examination data provided by National Health Insurance Services, Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II, and KNHANES, while each cohort was linked with Korea Cancer Registry. RRs were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted by age group and smoking status. RRs were then meta-analyzed to yield pooled RR by using random-effects model.<br \/>Results: A total of 4.1% and 1.2% of all cancer incidence were attributable to alcohol consumption in men and women. By cancer sites, 67.1% of esophageal cancer, 23.8% of oral cavity\/pharyngeal cancer, 15.1% of laryngeal cancer, 12.0% of colorectal cancer, and 7.9% of liver cancer were attributable to alcohol consumption in men. In women, 54.1% of liver cancer, 10.3% of colorectal cancer, 7.8% of oral cavity\/pharyngeal cancer, and 3.6% of breast cancer were due to alcohol consumption.<br \/>Conclusion: PAF of cancer incidence due to alcohol consumption has increased in 2020 compared to PAF in 2009. As alcohol consumption is an important cause of oral cavity\/pharyngeal, esophageal, and laryngeal cancer in men, and liver and breast cancer in women, prevention measures are required to reduce alcohol consumption for cancer prevention in Korea.

This study aimed to use more sophisticated machine learning techniques to classify MM into disease clusters and to investigate their association with incident colorectal (CRC), breast (BC), lung (LC) and prostate (PrC) cancer diagnoses.<br \/>Methods: Participants in UK Biobank with a hospital (HES) record and no prevalent cancer were included in the study. Self-reported (SR), HES and primary-care (GP) recorded diseases were converted to phecodes. Sex-stratified latent class analyses (LCA) was used to identify disease clusters in the SR data. Associations between clusters and selected cancer diagnoses was undertaken using Cox proportional hazards modelling, adjusting for age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, year and region of recruitment, body mass index, smoking history, alcohol consumption and menopausal hormone therapy use (women only). The analyses were validated using HES and GP data.<br \/>Results: The analysis included 158,951 women and 127,406 men. Just over 30% (49,061) of women and 37% (48,110) of men had MM (&#8805;2 diseases) at recruitment. LCA identified 10 disease clusters in women, the most common of which was related to respiratory disease, largely comprising asthma (9344; 19.1%). Nine disease clusters were identified in men, the most common of which was related to heart disease (9358; 19.5%), and largely comprising ischemic heart disease and hypertension. No association between disease cluster and incident CRC or BC was identified. In women, LC risk was associated with several disease clusters: respiratory (Hazard Ratio 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.28 - 1.91) p&#60;0.001), arthritis\/gut (1.46 (1.15 - 1.85) p=0.002), hyperlipidemia (1.51 (1.19 - 1.92) p=0.001, cardiac (1.74 (1.40 - 2.17) p&#60;0.001) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (1.56 (1.16 - 2.09) p=0.003). In men, LC was associated with disease clusters of hyperlipidemia\/ hypertension (1.23 (1.02 - 1.48) p=0.03), cardiac (1.40 (1.18 - 1.66) p&#60;0.001), T2DM (1.26 (1.02 - 1.56) p=0.03), respiratory (2.74 (2.21 - 3.39) p&#60;0.001) and cardiometabolic\/arthritis (1.81 (1.08 - 3.03) p=0.02). T2DM (0.80 (0.68 - 0.87) p&#60;0.001) was associated with an inverse risk of PrC. Cluster distribution was similar in HES and GP data, with the association between the cardiac and the arthritis clusters replicated for LC in women, and the respiratory cluster for LC and T2DM cluster for PrC in men.<br \/>Conclusion: Clusters of MM were identified in a large cancer-free population, which were replicated using different sources of healthcare data. Several disease clusters were associated with incident LC and, to a lesser extent, PrC. Further work to understand the potential causal nature of these associations is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Comorbidity,Cancer risk,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Evidence is inconsistent for prostate cancer and research in diverse populations is limited.<br \/>Methods: In the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), we conducted a prospective cohort analysis to investigate the association of four diet quality indices (DQIs; AHEI-2010, aMED, HEI-2015, DASH; a higher score indicates healthier diet), three plant-based diet indices (PDI, hPDI, uPDI), two inflammatory (DII, EDIP), and two insulinemic dietary indices (EDIH, EDIR) (a higher score indicates more pro-inflammatory or pro-insulinemic diet) with incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) in 79,930 men from five racial\/ethnic groups (White, African American, Japanese American, Latino, and Native Hawaiian). All dietary scores were constructed from a baseline quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Outcomes examined included total PCa, high-grade PCa (Gleason score &#62; 7), advanced PCa (regional or distant), aggressive PCa (high-grade or advanced), and lethal PCa (distant or death due to PCa). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in the dietary score were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models, overall and by race\/ethnicity. Associations were considered nominally significant at P &#60; 0.05.<br \/>Results: During a mean follow-up of 18.9 years, a total of 9,759 incident PCa cases were identified, including 2,503 high-grade, 1,706 advanced, 3,430 aggressive, and 1,426 lethal PCa cases. None of the dietary scores was significantly associated with total PCa. We found a significant association between DII and advanced PCa (HR=1.08, 95% CI=1.01-1.15) overall and the association appeared to be the strongest in African Americans (HR=1.17, 95% CI=1.00-1.36) and Native Hawaiians (HR=1.29, 95% CI=0.98-1.68). We also observed weak associations of the four DQIs with advanced PCa (HR of 0.95-0.96, P of 0.07-0.10) in the overall population, among which a higher DASH score was significantly associated with a 15% (95% CI = 0.75-0.96) lower risk of advanced PCa in African Americans. In addition, we observed that several inflammatory (EDIP) and insulinemic (EDIH, EDIR) dietary scores were associated with lower incidence of advanced, aggressive, or lethal PCa (HR=0.89-0.95, P of 0.03-0.05), which requires further investigation.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that diets with high proinflammatory potential may increase risk of advanced PCa while following a healthy dietary pattern may reduce the risk of advanced PCa. Further studies are needed to better understand the inconsistent results across studies on diet and PCa risk and whether our findings can be replicated in other populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Multi-ethnic Cohort ,Dietary patterns,Aggressive prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate associations between reproductive and lifestyle factors and incident ovarian cancer risk among Mexican women.<br \/>Methods: The Mexican Teachers&#8242; Cohort (ESMaestras) is a large, prospective, population-based cohort of women (n=115,306) living in a culturally, geographically, and economically diverse 12-state area in Mexico. Reproductive and lifestyle factors were collected on baseline questionnaires administered between 2006-2008, with additional questionnaires collected from the cohort in 2011, and 2014. During follow-up, 187 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified, including 101 via self-report on 2011 and 2014 questionnaires, as well as an additional 85 through linkage with mortality databases, and 3 via other administrative- and cancer registry-based linkages (2 of 3 were also identified via the mortality database linkage). Of the self-reported incident cases, 5 have been validated via mortality databases and 4 via linkage with an administrative database; validation of the remaining self-reported cases is ongoing. Primary analyses examined associations between established ovarian cancer risk factors and incident ovarian cancer. Age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.<br \/>Results: Women in the Mexican Teachers&#8242; Cohort that used hormonal contraceptives (HC), were parous, or had a tubal ligation experienced reduced ovarian cancer risks during follow-up (ever HC use vs. never HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.51-0.95], parous vs. nulliparous 0.48 [0.35-0.68], ever tubal ligation vs. never 0.87 [0.59-1.28]). Ovarian cancer risk was elevated among women with a positive family history of breast cancer (1.34 [0.76-2.36]). Women with a history of endometriosis were at increased ovarian cancer risk (3.43 [1.41-8.34]). Taller adult height (&#62;159 cm vs &#60;150 cm) was not associated with ovarian cancer risk among women in this cohort. Risk estimates were consistent and, in some instances, more pronounced (i.e., HC use and tubal ligation) when limited to incident ovarian cancer cases confirmed via linkage with mortality databases (n=90).<br \/>Conclusions: Ovarian cancer risk factors identified in the Mexican Teachers&#8242; Cohort were generally consistent with associations reported in predominantly non-Hispanic white populations.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), marked by clonal expansions of mutated hematopoietic progenitors with mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) or clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), has been associated with the risk of serval cancers and may shed light the interplay between these factors and early preneoplastic hematopoietic expansion.Leveraging genotyping array and whole-exome sequencing data of leukocyte-derived DNA from 485,028 participants without hematologic malignancies in the UK Biobank (UKBB), we performed genome-wide characterization of two common forms of CH&#8212;mCAs and CHIP. To assess associations between social deprivation, self-reported modifiable risk factors, and CH risk, we employed multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, smoking history, and genetic ancestry.We identified 11,826 (2.4%) individuals with autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations (auto mCAs), 15,499 (3.2%) with loss of the X chromosome (mLOX), 43,044 (8.8%) with loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) and 22,508 (4.6%) with CHIP. Individuals with any CH subtype were on average older than CH-free individuals (p &#60; 9.11&#215;10<sup>-52<\/sup>). Multivariable models identified a significant negative association between mLOY and social deprivation in England (1 SD change in score: OR = 0.968 [0.956-0.980], p = 4.88&#215;10<sup>-7<\/sup>), suggesting modifiable risk factors could influence risk of mLOY. We observed a positive association with ever smoking and CH, which decreased with increased years since smoking cessation. Current smokers were at higher risk for auto mCAs (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.23, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):[1.16-1.31], P-value (p) = 2.63&#215;10<sup>-11<\/sup>), mLOY (OR = 2.25, 95%CI: [2.17-2.33], p &#60; 9.11&#215;10<sup>-52<\/sup>), and CHIP (OR = 1.40, , 95%CI: [1.34-1.47] p &#60; 9.11&#215;10<sup>-52<\/sup>); and former smokers also exhibited significant associations for mLOY (OR = 1.16, 95%CI: [1.13-1.19], p = 2.97&#215;10<sup>-32<\/sup>) and CHIP (OR = 1.11, 95%CI: [1.08-1.15], p = 2.75&#215;10<sup>-13<\/sup>). Alcohol consumption was associated with a significant increase in the risk of mLOX in heavy drinkers (&#62;2-3 drinks\/day) compared to non-drinkers (OR = 1.16, 95%CI: [1.09-1.24], p = 1.21&#215;10<sup>-5<\/sup>). Moderate and high PA levels (categorized as level 2 and 3 based on total activity), were positively associated with increased mLOY frequency (moderate: OR = 1.05, 95%CI: [1.02-1.08], p = 8.6&#215;10<sup>-2<\/sup>, high: OR = 1.06, 95%CI: [1.03-1.08], p = 1.6&#215;10<sup>-3<\/sup>). We observed no evidence for an association between sleep patterns and CH.Our investigation in a large cohort identified associations between CH and social deprivation, smoking, alcohol consumption and PA.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi) are indicated for the treatment of several cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cutaneous melanoma (CM). Improved outcomes was observed with ICI in preclinical studies. We aimed to determine the association of obesity with progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) among patients with NSCLC and CM treated with ICI or EGFRi.<br \/>Methods: This was a retrospective study utilizing 2011-2019 SEER-Medicare data of Medicare Parts A and B enrolled patients &#8805;66 years diagnosed with NSCLC or CM who received ICI or EGFRi (NSCLC only) within 1-year post-diagnosis. Patients were followed from treatment commencement until death, loss to follow-up, or end of study. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were used to achieve study objectives.<br \/>Results: Among 2393 NSCLC patients receiving ICI, obese patients (N=281, 11.7%) were younger (73.4&#177;5.2 yrs vs 74.4&#177;5.9 yrs, p&#60;0.01) with higher CCI scores (2 (IQR=1-4) vs 1 (IQR=0-2), p&#60;0.0001) compared to non-obese patients (N=2,311, 89.2%). Time to progression(TTP) was 41% faster among obese patients (392 days (95% CI=330-468) vs 493 days (95% CI=464-525), p&#60;0.01; HR=1.41 (1.13-1.76), p&#60;0.01) with no significant difference in time to death (TTD) (443 days (404-488) vs 491 days (462-524), p=0.35). Among 880 CM patients, those with obesity (N=91, 10.3%)) were significantly younger (74.7&#177;6.1 yrs vs 76.3&#177;7.3 yrs, p=0.02) with higher CCI scores (2 (IQR=0-4) vs 0 (IQR=0-2), p&#60;0.0001). TTP was 343 days (320-400). TTD was 1,409 days (1,107-2,136) with no association between obesity status and PFS or OS. Among 2,524 NSCLC patients receiving EGFRi, obese patients (126, 5.0%) were younger (73.7&#177;6.1 yrs) vs 75.6&#177;6.5 yrs, p&#60;0.01), had higher CCI scores (2 (IQR=1-3) vs 0 (IQR=0-1), p&#60;0.0001), and longer time to treatment (3 mths (IQR=1-7) vs 2 mths (IQR=1-6), p=0.02). A higher proportion were White (76.2% vs 61.3%, p&#60;0.001). Risk of progression was 48% higher among obese patients (664 dys (496-778) vs 1,231 dys (1,127-1,379), p&#60;0.0001; HR=1.48, 95% CI=1.11-1.97, p&#60;0.01) with no significant difference in TTD (559 dys (440-763) vs 673 dys (639-707), p=0.35).<br \/>Conclusion: Obesity with associated with PFS but not OS among patients with NSCLC with no association observed among patients with CM. Given that the link between obesity and NSCLC risk remains controversial, the observed association with PFS may be linked to the absence of the paradoxical effect of improve outcomes that may be seen with cancers caused by obesity such as CM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Diet,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Total fiber intake and different sources (cereal, fruits, vegetables) were assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires. Overall and lethal prostate cancer (metastatic disease\/prostate cancer death) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<br \/><b>Results <\/b>During 26 years of follow-up, we recorded 1,494 overall and 174 lethal prostate cancer events in the high genetic risk group. As expected, no associations were observed fiber intake with risk of overall prostate cancer. For lethal prostate cancer, the results varied according to the source of fiber. Higher cereal fiber intake was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (per 3 g\/d higher intake: 0.81 [0.68, 0.97], <i>P-trend<\/i>=0.02). We further observed a higher disease risk among men with higher fruit fiber intake (per 3g\/d higher intake: 1.18 [1.02, 1.36], <i>P-trend<\/i>=0.03). The associations remained similar when mutually adjusted for each fiber type. No associations were observed for total or vegetable fiber intake.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>In this analysis of men at high prostate cancer genetic risk, we observed that higher cereal fiber intake was associated with lower lethal prostate cancer risk, whereas higher fruit fiber intake showed an opposite trend. Further studies in different populations and investigations into the underlying mechanisms are needed.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

Tattooing can result in short- and long-term inflammatory and immune responses. At least 38 cases of melanoma have been reported in tattoos. The incidence of melanoma in Utah is the highest in the U.S., and potentially modifiable risk factors are of public health interest. In this study, we evaluated associations between tattooing and melanoma risk.<br \/>Methods: We utilized a population-based case-control study of 514 incident <i>in situ<\/i> (284 men and 230 women) and 534 invasive (285 men and 249 women) melanoma cases diagnosed in Utah between 2020-2021. Controls (n=5,240) were selected from respondents to the Utah Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey and frequency matched to cases in a 5:1 ratio on sex, age, race, and ethnicity. We fit logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating ever tattooing with <i>in situ<\/i> and invasive melanoma risk, adjusting for age, education level, race, and ethnicity, separately for women and men. We then fit logistic models stratified by education level (&#60; four-year college degree\/four-year college degree or more) and models stratified by age (&#60; 50 years\/50+ years), separately for women and men.<br \/>Results: Among men, the prevalence of tattooing was 7% for both <i>in situ<\/i> and invasive cases, and 11% for controls. Among women, tattooing prevalence was 20% for <i>in situ<\/i> cases, 15% for invasive cases, and 18% for controls. Ever tattooing was associated with decreased invasive melanoma risk among men (OR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.37-1.02]), particularly among those who had less than a four-year college degree (0.52 [0.28-0.99]), and among ages 50+ (0.36 [0.16-0.84]). Among men, the OR for ever tattooing and <i>in situ<\/i> melanoma was in the same direction as invasive melanoma, but the estimate was statistically imprecise (0.73 [0.45-1.19]). Among women, we did not observe an association between ever tattooing and invasive melanoma (0.83 [0.56-1.20]), while the association between ever tattooing and <i>in situ<\/i> melanoma was statistically imprecise (1.25 [0.87-1.80]). However, ever tattooing was associated with a nearly two-fold increased risk of <i>in situ<\/i> melanoma among women with a four-year college degree (1.98 [1.21-3.26]), but not for those without a college degree (0.89 [0.52-1.50]).<br \/>Conclusion: These findings do not suggest that there is an association between tattooing and melanoma. Associations between tattooing and health-seeking behaviors, which may vary by sex and other demographic factors, may influence associations with melanoma diagnosis, particularly for <i>in situ<\/i> melanoma. This study is the first step in investigating whether reported cases of melanoma arising in tattoos are coincidental or whether tattoos may be associated with an increased risk of melanoma. <b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Epidemiology,Environmental exposure,Case-control study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

We prospectively examined the potential benefits of adhering to established healthy dietary patterns on overall and cause-specific mortality among men living with prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: We studied men with incident prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1986-2022. Five dietary indices-Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), anti-insulinemic, and anti-inflammatory diet scores-were derived from validated food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years. Post-diagnosis scores were cumulatively averaged, and time-varying changes in scores from pre- to post-diagnosis were calculated. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs, 95% CI) for associations between adherence to dietary patterns with overall and cause-specific survival adjusting for demographics, dietary and lifestyle factors.<br \/>Results: Among 6,086 prostate cancer patients with 71,783 person-years of follow-up, 3,406 deaths occurred: 578 from prostate cancer, 918 from cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 1910 from other causes. When comparing extreme quintiles of post-diagnosis diet scores, a healthy diet was associated with lower overall mortality for AHEI (0.76, 0.66-0.88) and the Mediterranean diet (0.84, 0.73-0.97). Moreover, comparing extreme quintiles of score change, patients who increased their adherence to these diets after diagnosis had better overall survival with HRs (95% CI) that ranged from 0.79 (0.70-0.89) for AHEI to 0.89 (0.79- &#60;1.00) for the anti-inflammatory diet. No significant associations were observed for DASH. Regarding cause-specific survival, increased adherence to anti-insulinemic diet was associated with better CVD-specific survival (0.78, 0.61-0.99). No significant associations were found between these diet scores and prostate cancer survival. Stronger associations of post-diagnosis diet scores with overall survival were seen in men diagnosed before age 70, those classified as obese at diagnosis (BMI&#8805;30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), consuming less alcohol (&#60;7.8 g\/d), and with lower grade (Gleason Score &#8804;7) or stage (T1\/T2) tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, adhering to a healthy dietary pattern after cancer diagnosis, such as the AHEI and Mediterranean Diet, was associated with better overall survival.

Many studies have shown that alcohol consumption is a modifiable risk factor for breast, esophageal, colorectal, and other cancers, and that individuals deficient in metabolizing acetaldehyde are at higher risk for alcohol-associated cancers. A genetic variant in<i> aldehyde dehydrogenase 2<\/i> (<i>ALDH2<\/i>, G&#62;A, rs671), the main enzyme responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, results in decreased efficiency of ALDH2, or ALDH2 deficiency. This is the most common single genetic variation in humans worldwide, mostly found in some East Asian populations<b>.<\/b> While having one or both deficient alleles can lead to adverse physical effects when drinking, including facial flushing, nausea, and palpitations, studies done in Asian countries have shown that many affected individuals still consume alcohol, increasing their risk for some cancers. We sought to explore the scope and design of potential intervention in the U.S. by examining alcohol consumption behavior in individuals with and without ALDH2 deficiency within the All of Us Research Program, a current large, diverse, national U.S. cohort. Relationships between self-reported alcohol consumption and sociodemographic factors were examined among 380,845 participants. Genomic data was available for 296,254 of them. Overall, 72.7% of the cohort reported drinking alcohol in the past year, with the majority drinking moderately (&#8804;1 drink\/day for women and &#8804;2 drinks\/day for men). Among those who drank, 42.7% reported at least one binge drinking episode (&#8805;6 drinks on one occasion). Among our genomic cohort who identified as Asian individuals, 23.6% had at least one deficient <i>ALDH2<\/i> allele compared to &#60;4% in all other groups. 63.7% of individuals with one deficient <i>ALDH2<\/i> allele and 25.4% with two deficient <i>ALDH2 <\/i>alleles reported drinking in the past year. 29.9% of individuals with ALDH2 deficiency reported binge drinking in the past year. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex, younger age, higher education level, higher household income, and being born in the U.S. were associated with alcohol consumption among both individuals with and without ALDH2 deficiency. Our study shows that ALDH2 deficiency is fairly common among Asian Americans and that many affected individuals still drink alcohol. With the growing population of Asian Americans in the U.S. (currently &#62;7% of the total U.S. population, projected to be ~38 million individuals by 2050), our findings suggest a significant opportunity for precision cancer prevention for a substantial portion of the population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Alcohol,Genetic polymorphism,Prevention,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Modifiable risk factors including diet have been linked to a wide range of malignancies. We estimated the global cancer population-attributable fraction (PAF) to established and suspected dietary cancer risk factors according to the Human Development Index (HDI).Diet-cancer associations were selected from WCRF, GBD and IARC report. Dietary factors of animal origin include red meat, processed meat, fish and dairy products; cancers include nasopharynx, esophageal, stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, breast cancer. Gender-specific PAF were calculated based on 1) the total and gender-specific 2022 country-specific population from World Bank; 2) the country-specific average daily dietary factors intake (g\/day) for 2000-2005 from the Global Dietary Database; 3) relative risks from the meta-analyses and WCRF reports; 4) country-specific 2020 cancer incidence from WHO. Estimates were also stratified by Human Development Index (HDI).Table 1 provides the results. The PAF for red meat and processed meat was higher in high HDI countries, while that for low dairy product intake was higher in low HDI countries. According to results, changes in selected dietary factors can prevent cancer-related incidence, particularly depending on where development status of countries and access to the source of their intake.

However, the potential impact of vaping on lung cancer risk remains largely unexplored. We, therefore, examined the association of vaping and cigarette smoking with lung cancer risk in a case-control study conducted at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Medical records examined from the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute revealed 4,975 cases with newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed lung cancer during 2013-2021. These cases were compared to 27,294 controls without cancer that were group-matched on a 5:1 ratio to cases by age, gender, race and year of ascertainment. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between vaping, smoking and lung cancer.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The lung cancer cases in this study were 55% male, 88% white, with mean age at diagnosis of 62 years. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for individuals who reported vaping and smoking was OR=21.1 (95% CI=17.1, 26.1) versus OR=6.3 (95% CI=5.8, 6.8) for smoking only. Estimates for gender and histologic cell type of lung cancer, e.g., pulmonary adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, were consistently over threefold higher for vaping and smoking compared to smoking only (p&#60;0.001), and the vaping effect persisted even after adjustment for comorbidities, COPD and cardiovascular disease.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Adjusted estimates of odds ratios (OR) revealed over threefold higher risk of lung cancer among individuals who had vaped and smoked compared to individuals who only smoked. Our results suggest that the addition of vaping to smoking greatly accelerates the risk of developing lung cancer.

Prior studies investigated the effects of dietary interventions on the fecal microbiome but few assessed colorectal tissue microbiome endpoints. We investigated the effects of a high-fiber, high-fruit and -vegetable, low-fat dietary intervention on the rectal tissue microbiome in<b> <\/b>the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT).<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>PPT is a 4-year randomized clinical trial, with specific goals including consuming: 1) &#8805; 18g of fiber per 1,000 kcal\/day; 2) &#8805; 3.5 servings of fruits and vegetables per 1,000 kcal\/day; and 3) &#60;20% of kcal\/day from fat. We extracted DNA from rectal biopsies using the AutoGen Animal Tissue DNA Extraction Kit and sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the bacteria in biopsies collected at baseline and the end of years 1 and 4 (N=233 in intervention arm and N=222 in control arm). We estimated effects of the intervention on rarefied alpha diversity and <i>a priori<\/i>-selected presence and relative abundance (presented as percentages summing to 100) of 10 bacteria most strongly historically associated with CRC presence using repeated-measures linear mixed-effects models. We also explored intervention effects on presence\/abundance of all bacteria (with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) and stratified the analysis among intervention arm participants who adhered to 75% of the dietary goals (super compliers) over the 4 years (N=48) and comparable participants in the control arm (N=64).<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> The intervention did not statistically significantly modify rectal tissue alpha diversity. Compared to the control arm, relative abundance of <i>a priori<\/i>-selected <i>Porphyromonas<\/i> (absolute difference-in-difference (DiD) at T1 vs. T0 = -0.24 and T4 vs. T0 = -0.12; <i>P<\/i>=0.004) and <i>Prevotella<\/i> (absolute DiD at T1 vs. T0 = -0.40 and at T4 vs. T0 = -0.32; <i>P<\/i>=0.01) were more strongly decreased in the intervention arm.

Among super compliers and comparable control arm participants, the findings were similarly weak.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b><i> <\/i>Overall, our findings did not strongly support that a high-fiber, -fruit, and -vegetable, and low-fat diet intervention influences rectal tissue microbiome diversity nor the abundance of most bacteria, except for two oral-originating bacteria that were previously associated with CRC presence. It is possible that dietary exposures over longer periods of time (than 4 years) may more strongly influence the tissue microbiome.

According to International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), tobacco smoking is the Group I carcinogen, and the National Cancer Center Korea reported in 2009 that 20.9% and 2.3% of total cancer incidence were attributable to tobacco smoking in men and women, respectively. As of 2020, we estimated population attributable fraction (PAF) of cancer incidence due to tobacco smoking.<br \/>Methods: We organized the Consensus Committee to develop strategy and methodology for PAF estimation. From the consensus, cancer sites for PAF estimation were selected based on the IARC list of classification with sufficient evidence in human. PAF was calculated by using Levin&#8217;s formula which includes exposure prevalence and relative risk (RR). Exposure prevalence was collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in 2005, assuming that latent period from risk exposure to cancer development was 15 years. Tobacco smoking was defined as a categorical variable including non-smokers, past smokers, and current smokers. Pooled RRs were estimated from meta-analysis of RRs obtained from Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, National Health Examination data provided by National Health Insurance Services, Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II, and KNHANES, each of which was linked with Korea Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate RRs, while adjusted by age groups and alcohol consumption.<br \/>Results: For men, 17.4% of all cancer cases were attributed to smoking, compared to 1.7% for women. Specifically, in men, 57.9% of lung cancer, 36.4% of bladder cancer, 31.9% of esophageal cancer, 39.1% of laryngeal cancer , 25.4% of oral cavity\/pharyngeal cancer, 19.7% of liver cancer, and 19.5% of stomach cancer were attributed to tobacco smoking. In women, 51.7% of laryngeal cancer, 15.0% of esophageal cancer, 11.6% of lung cancer, 6.0% of bladder cancer, 5.1% of oral cavity\/pharyngeal cancer, 5.0% of cervix cancer, and 4.6% of liver cancer were due to smoking.<br \/>Conclusion: Tobacco smoking is an important cause of esophageal, laryngeal, and lung cancer in men, and esophageal and laryngeal cancer in women, and comprises a substantial proportion of PAF in cancer incidence. Thus, intervention measures are needed to reduce smoking prevalence for cancer prevention in Korea.

It is unknown whether IUDs offer protection against epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), similar to OCs, or may increase risk. Therefore, we examined the association between IUD use and EOC risk.<br \/>Methods: Information on contraception use was obtained through questionnaires from 11 studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium and African-American Cancer Epidemiology Study. Study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional multivariable logistic regression, and heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran <i>Q <\/i>and <i>I<sup>2<\/sup><\/i> statistics. There was no evidence of heterogeneity, thus data were pooled. We assessed potential effect modification by decade of birth, race, parity, and personal history of endometriosis by reporting stratum-specific estimates and tested for multiplicative interaction by comparing models with and without interaction terms via likelihood ratio test. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate histotype-specific associations.<br \/>Results: Results were pooled for 11,033 EOC cases and 13,358 controls. There were 2,656 (19.9%) IUD users (mostly non-hormonal) and 8,923 (66.8%) OC users among controls compared to 1,933 (17.5%) IUD users and 6,318 (57.3%) OC users among cases. IUD use was associated with lower risk of endometrioid (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.86) and clear cell (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48-0.80), but not high-grade serous subtypes (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.98-1.14), with significant heterogeneity by histotype (p=0.0006). Among studies that collected data on IUD type, we observed a non-significant inverse association between hormonal IUD use and EOC (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51-1.03); however, only 51 cases reported hormonal IUD use. Among those who used both IUD and OCs, there was no association with the order of contraception use and EOC. There were no major differences in the associations of age at first use, duration of use, or time since last use and EOC risk. Among parous women, IUD use before first pregnancy was associated with a non-significant reduced odds of EOC (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.04). We also observed a statistically significant interaction between IUD use and endometriosis with reduced odds of EOC associated with IUD use among women with endometriosis (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98) but not those without endometriosis (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90-1.03, <i>p<\/i>-interaction=0.05).<br \/>Discussion: IUD use was associated with lower clear cell and endometrioid EOC risk and may be most protective among women with endometriosis. Future research should include cohorts of women with a higher prevalence of hormonal IUD use to determine the impact of changing contraceptive trends on ovarian cancer burden and identifying preventive strategies for women at high risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Epidemiology,Case-control study,Pooled analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jennifer  M.

Whether the insulinemic potential of the diet contributes to breast cancer prognosis has not been examined previously. Here, we focused on a food-based empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), an index previously designed as most predictive of fasting plasma C-peptide. We aimed to investigate whether EDIH (at different time settings) is associated with overall and breast cancer-specific mortality.<br \/>Methods: For 9,640 women with stage I-III breast cancer from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), we calculated the cumulative average EDIH, using repeated measures of post-diagnostic diet from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). We also considered the pre-diagnostic EDIH score (using the last FFQ reported before diagnosis), the first postdiagnostic EDIH score, as well as a simple updated EDIH score. Information on diet and other factors was repeatedly measured in validated questionnaires every two to four years. Deaths were ascertained by report from family members or by searching the National Death Index. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.<br \/>Results: Participants were followed up for a median of 12 years after breast cancer diagnosis. We documented 1,120 deaths due to breast cancer and 2,762 all-cause deaths. Women with higher post-diagnostic EDIH had a 40% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR for quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 [HR<sub>Q5vs.Q1<\/sub>], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.22, 1.61; P-trend&#60;0.0001). EDIH was also associated with a 19% increased risk of breast cancer mortality, although the confidence interval included the null (HR<sub>Q5vs.Q1<\/sub>, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.95, 1.48; P-trend=0.17). Findings for overall mortality were similar for EDIH measured at other timings\/settings: last pre-diagnosis dietary assessment (HR<sub>Q5vs.Q1<\/sub>,1.21; 95% CI, 1.06, 1.39; P-trend&#60;0.0001) and first post-diagnosis dietary assessment (HR<sub>Q5vs.Q1<\/sub>,1.23; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.40; P-trend&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusions: In this large prospective study of breast cancer survivors, higher hyperinsulinemic dietary scores (reflecting higher dietary insulinemic potential) were associated with worse survival outcomes following diagnosis. Thus, dietary recommendations emphasizing the importance of avoiding high insulinemic dietary patterns (i.e., processed meat and red meat) and prioritizing low insulinemic dietary patterns (i.e., coffee, whole fruit and green-leafy vegetables) as components of a healthy diet may improve overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Breast cancer,Survival,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

This study evaluated healthy lifestyle and dietary patterns in relation to PCa survival in a multiethnic population.<br \/>Methods: We prospectively followed 2,603 men with non-metastatic PCa in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) for a median duration of 10.9 years (497 African American, 754 Japanese American, 577 Latino, 129 Native Hawaiian, and 646 White men) starting in 1993. We documented 1,321 deaths, including 196 from PCa. Lifestyle pattern was assessed after diagnosis by a previously reported PCa Behavior Score, which includes BMI, physical activity, and smoking, and a modified version including diet (based on the sum of saturated fat, whole milk, alcohol, and processed meat intake). We also evaluated six indices of inflammatory and insulinemic potential of diet and lifestyle patterns (E-DII, EDIP, EDIH, ELIH, EDIR, and ELIR); and three indices of plant-based diets: an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful PDI (hPDI), and an unhealthful PDI (uPDI). We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the relationship between each index with PCa-specific and all-cause mortality. We adjusted for education, race\/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, physical activity (if not part of the score), family history of PCa, and first course of treatment.<br \/>Results: Across the five racial\/ethnic groups, Japanese American men exhibited healthier lifestyle and dietary patterns post-diagnosis, while African American and Native Hawaiian men tended to have less healthy behaviors. The PCa Behavior Score was statistically significantly associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR per point=0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80), and a similar trend persisted when incorporating diet into the score. The PDI was statistically significantly inversely associated with all-cause mortality (HR per SD=0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97), while the uPDI showed a positive association (HR=1.10, 95% CI 1.12-1.18). None of the lifestyle or dietary patterns were associated with PCa mortality (p-values&#62;0.05). No clear trends were observed for inflammatory and insulinemic dietary patterns after PCa diagnosis with all-cause or PCa-specific mortality.<br \/>Conclusion: Adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet was associated with longer overall survival among men with PCa. We did not find these practices to be associated with a lower risk of PCa-specific mortality among men diagnosed with non-metastatic disease. However, 85% of the observed deaths during follow-up were due to other causes; this underscores the importance of counseling all men, including those with non-metastatic prostate cancer on health behaviors to manage comorbidities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Diet,Smoking,Obesity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Often, rural people are prescribed with expensive dietary supplements during chemotherapy by urban for profit medical centers, increasing disparity, as per a study conducted by KaviKrishna Telemedicine Care (KTC) (1). We seek to reduce cancer disparity by using locally available diet\/nutrition of Sualkuchi-Hajo cultural complex, including the whey protein prepared by indigenous healers practicing Vedic Jiva Upakara Cikitsha Tantra (Vejiupacita) (2,3). However, the efficacy of the indigenous Vejiupacita Whey protein is not clearly known. Here we have performed pre-clinical and clinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Vejiupacita Chena Pani (VCP) whey protein in reducing cancer chemotherapy induced bone marrow stem cell niche toxicity.<br \/>Methods: Using a previously described pre-clinical model of cisplatin and busalphan induced BM stem cell niche toxicities (4), the cytoprotective activity of VCP Whey protein was evaluated. Commercially available whey proteins Ensure plus, and Immunocal were used for comparisons. Next, the indigenous cancer patients (n=55) of KaviKrishna Telemedicine Care taking the whey protein (20 gm twice daily for three months of chemo and or radiation) were monitored for hemoglobin, total blood count as well as Glasgow prognostic score (ratio of serum albumin and CRP) and ECOG performance score. Third, using a Vejiupacita based Sahasa-ojash scale of well being (3) patient's quality of life was evaluated.<br \/>Results: In the pre-clinical model of cisplatin-induced BM toxicity in black 6 mice (n=10 in each group), the VCP whey protein exerted cytoprotection of BM stem cells similar to Immunocal but 2-fold higher protection compared to Ensure plus. Serum glutathione and squalene level was significantly increased only in the VCP whey protein group. The hypoxic niche of CD271+ MSCs showed enhanced stem cell niche protection. Notably, VCP and Immunocal whey protein treatment increased the hypoxic BM stem cell niche defense against cisplatin-induced toxicity. Next, 34\/55 patients taking the VCP whey protein (20 gm\/twice daily for three months) showed increased hemoglobin level, increased total blood count, and increased weight gain. The Sahasa-ojash scale showed significant improvement in quality of life compared to the period when they did not take whey proteins in a manner similar to Glasgow prognostic score, and ECOG performance score.<br \/>Conclusion: The Vejiupcita based whey protein concentrate therapy exerts cytoprotection against chemotherapy induced toxicity.<br \/>References:1.

There are approximately 3.7 million Arab-Americans living in the U.S., with large concentration in Michigan (MI). For example, Dearborn, MI has the largest percentage of Arab-Americans (40% of people having Arab ancestry). Smoking, alcohol, and human papillomavirus (HPV) are the main causes of HNC. Common symptoms of HNC are lump in the neck\/mouth, nonhealing ulcers, dysphagia or odynophagia, and change in voice. Currently, there is a scarcity of research on knowledge of HNC risk factors and symptoms among Arab-Americans. We examined knowledge of risk factors and symptoms of HNC among Arab-Americans residing in MI.<br \/>Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of adult Arab-Americans (&#8805;18 years) conducted between March and July 2023. Survey questions were adapted from the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and offered in English and Arabic depending on respondent preference. Awareness of the symptoms of HNCs were assessed using 14 questions while risk factors were assessed using 10 questions. The questions were in the form of &#8220;Do you know that the following can be symptoms\/risk factors of HNC?&#8221; Respondents selected &#8220;yes,&#8221; &#8220;no,&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t know\/not sure&#8221; for each answer choice.<br \/>Results: Of the 295 Arab-Americans survey respondents, the mean age &#177; SD was 37.9 &#177; 14.6, and most were female (60.7%), had at least a college degree (57.6%), private health insurance (56.7%), and usual place of receiving care (70.7%). Majority had no history of cigarette use (81.7%) or alcohol use (91.6%). Regarding HNC symptoms knowledge, only 40-50% knew about most common HNC symptoms: nonhealing ulcers (41%), dysphagia or odynophagia (51.4%), and voice changes (48.6%); while 60.6% knew about swelling or lump in neck\/throat. About half of respondents knew of persistent mass or lesion on the tongue (53.3%) and bleeding in the mouth or throat (50.3%) as symptoms of HNC. About a third knew these as HNC symptoms: teeth loosening (31.7%), ill-fitting dentures (25.9%), otalgia (37.8%), and nasal obstruction\/congestion (34.9%). For HNC risk factors knowledge, tobacco smoking, chewing, and second-hand smoking were the most common recognized risk factors, identified by 78.9%, 72.8% and 66.8%, respectively. However, less than half knew HPV (40.6%) and Epstein-Barr virus (35.4%) as risk factors.<br \/>Conclusion: While there is higher knowledge about tobacco as a risk factor for HNC, knowledge about HPV as a risk factor is very low. Similarly, knowledge about HNC symptoms is suboptimal in the Arab-American community, which could result in late-stage presentation and thus lower survival. Educational programs designed for this community are needed to help close this gap and improve HNC related health outcomes among culturally and ethnically distinct Arab-Americans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Risk factors & Symptoms,Knowledge,Arab American,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
