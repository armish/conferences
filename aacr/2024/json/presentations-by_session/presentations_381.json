[{"Abstract":"In the past decade, single cell gene expression technologies have transformed basic and translational research and are more frequently found in the toolbox of immunologists alongside the standard bulk B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing and transcriptome profiling assays. While conventional bulk BCR assays capture the frequency of single chains, single-cell immune profiling reveals the frequency of <i>paired<\/i> heavy and light chains along with the cells transcriptional profile.<br \/>Here we present the results of a single-blind benchmarking experiment conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that compares the performance of standard bulk DNA and RNA BCR repertoire sequencing assays, with the 10x Genomics Single Cell Immune Profiling solution. The FDA selected nine unambiguously monoclonal BCR-expressing cell lines to generate a reference mixture that was shared with each study participant, without revealing the input proportions. This reference cell line mixture was also diluted to 10% and 1% with B-cells sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to further test the limits of clonotype detection.<br \/>For each experiment, we targeted ~10,000 cells and in aggregate generated a paired gene expression and V(D)J dataset from ~100,000 cells. BCR clonotypes were detected in 78% of the captured cells across all samples profiled. Each of the 9 top unique clonotypes observed in our dataset corresponded to a cell line in the reference mixture, allowing us to decode the mixing percentages of each BCR-expression cell line. In addition, we were able to identify rare cell line clonotypes to as low as 0.01% in the dilution experiments. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of the single cell data also resolved the transcriptional profile of each cell line into its own cluster thus enabling independent verification of clonotype proportions.<br \/>In summary, we have generated a resource for the immunology community to evaluate and compare data generated with different repertoire sequencing technologies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Single cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Nevertheless, the majority of current single-cell sequencing methods depend on fresh or fresh-frozen samples to generate high-quality transcriptome data due to the limited reverse transcription (RT) yields in FFPE samples. Consequently, single-cell level transcriptomic studies of FFPE samples have been a longstanding challenge. Here, we present Fixative-eXchange (FX)-seq, a highly scalable snRNA-seq method for heavily paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed and\/or FFPE samples. We successfully analyzed a total of nearly 320k nuclei from various samples, including PFA-fixed tissue, FFPE blocks, FFPE and hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E)-stained sections from mouse brain and human clinical cancer specimens. In a human gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) FFPE sample, we observed rare transcriptomic transitions toward increased epigenetic modifications affected by acquired resistance in response to prolonged imatinib treatment. Furthermore, in an archived human colorectal cancer (CRC) FFPE sample, spatially-contextualized FX-seq with pathologist annotation distinguishes tumor cells from epithelial progenitors along with identification of the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We then proceeded to investigate transcriptional programs associated with drug resistance and lack of response in immunotherapy observed in CRC patients. With a hypothesis-driven curation, we compared transcription profiles at the single-nucleus level observed in MSS and MSI-H CRC patients from archived FFPE blocks and found distinctive transcriptional profiles from each group. Overall, FX-seq holds promise for clinical research, precision medicine, biomarker discovery, and molecular diagnosis using archived clinical FFPE specimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,FFPE,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-E.

Their detection is important for understanding tumor biology and guiding personalized treatment strategies. With the evolution of economical sequencing technologies, hypothesis-free gene fusion detection in cancer genomics is becoming more accessible. This study demonstrates the use of the cost-effective Ultima Genomics UG100 platform for a comprehensive analysis of gene fusions, uniquely integrating Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS). This integration capitalizes on the strengths of both methods: WGS, which enables a broad analysis of structural variations including extragenic events, and WTS for more functional characterization of expressed gene fusions and abnormal isoforms, offering a synergistic approach that enhances the detection and characterization of genomic rearrangements.<br \/>Methods: Five cancer cell lines (K562, THP-1, NCI-H660, Kasumi-1, MV4-11) with 29 previously detected gene fusions were sequenced, using both WTS and WGS, in addition to a standard fusion reference sample (Seraseq Fusion RNA Mix, with 16 RNA fusions). The libraries were sequenced on a UG100 sequencer using single ended reads of length ~250bp and analyzed with publicly available software: STAR-Fusion, combined with FusionInspector were used to detect RNA fusions; Manta and GridSS were used to detect DNA structural variations, including translocations.<br \/>Results: 93% of the documented fusion events were detected in DNA and in RNA, in addition to the 16 evaluated just in RNA (100% detected). Sequence data from both WTS and WGS on the UG100 platform successfully identified a spectrum of gene fusions in both DNA and RNA, thereby confirming the platform's detection capabilities in both types of assays. The structural variation events detected in the WGS were comprised mainly of translocations, but also deletions and duplications.<br \/>Conclusions: The Ultima Genomics UG100 sequencer has proven to be a cost-effective and efficient tool for the genome-wide discovery and validation of gene fusions, which can be impactful in clinical oncology settings. This study underscores the potential of using an integrated WTS and WGS approach on a single platform to advance our understanding of the genomic complexity of cancer, paving the way for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Fusion genes,Whole genome sequencing,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Although droplet-based methods are commonly used for such studies owing to their high throughput, they still miss important insights due to their lack of full-length transcript coverage. While full-length methods are available, to date, they have not been able to meet the throughput demands of many researchers. Moreover, both droplet and full-length scRNA-seq methods do not currently provide adequate readouts for non-coding genes, thereby limiting investigation of gene regulatory networks to protein coding genes. To close these gaps, we have developed a new high-throughput full-length scRNA-seq workflow that comprehensively profiles both protein-coding and non-coding genes in up to 60,000 cells within two days.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i> <\/b>Our new high-throughput workflow uses two rounds of combinatorial indexing, starting with a 96-well plate format for the first barcoding step followed by an automated second barcoding step in a 5,184-nanowell chip using an automated nanodispensing system. Initial testing demonstrated that our method could handle up to 60,000 cells without generating significant levels of doublets due to barcode collisions. To further illustrate the capacity of the new scRNA-seq approach, we profiled a total of approximately 11,000 isogenic A549 cells that either express WT TP53 or are TP53 null. In addition, both isogenic cell lines were treated with epigenetic therapy or mock treatment. Libraries were generated and sequenced using an Illumina&#174; NextSeq&#174;2000 sequencer.

Understanding this heterogeneity is therefore vital to improving both prognosis and treatment. Next-generation sequencing is a valuable tool for analyzing the genetic makeup of tumors. However, bulk sequencing methods lack the sensitivity to fully resolve tumor heterogeneity. While single cell methods provide a powerful approach to dissect such heterogeneity, to date, these methods have been limited in their throughput. To address this bottleneck, we have developed a fully automated workflow for generating scDNA-seq libraries based on PicoPLEX&#174; whole genome amplification (WGA) technology. This high-throughput method, which has been optimized on our ICELL8&#174; cx Single-Cell System, enables the generation of WGA libraries for &#62;1,000 single cells within one day.<br \/>Methods: We first sought to demonstrate the ability of this new high-throughput method to generate WGA libraries of comparable quality to the standard PicoPLEX workflow in terms of genome coverage, GC bias, and other typical quality metrics. We additionally assessed copy number variant (CNV) detection sensitivity using two cell lines with well-characterized small segmental CNVs: GM22601 (~25Mb deletion on chromosome 4) and GM05067 (~45Mb gain on chromosome 9). We also analyzed a lymphoblastoid line (K562) that carries a range of chromosomal aneuploidies. A total of 1,288 single-cell WGA libraries were generated and sequenced to a depth of 250K paired-end reads per cell. Data analysis was done using the Ginkgo CNV pipeline with an average bin size of 500 kb. As a final proof of principal, we also generated single cell data using tumor and adjacent normal tissue from two clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples.<br \/>Results: Libraries generated using our high-throughput workflow had a high mapping rate, with 94.1% of the reads being uniquely mapped. Additionally, the libraries were comparable to those generated with the standard PicoPLEX workflow in terms of coverage uniformity, GC bias and other metrics. Moreover, the segmental aneuploidies in both GM22601 and GM05067 were reliably detected in &#62;90% of cells at a read depth as low as 250,000 reads per cell. Analysis of the ccRCC samples revealed subclonal heterogeneity with various CNVs common to ccRCC, including deletion of chr. 3p, amplification of chr. 5q, and duplication of chr. 2.<br \/>Conclusion: By adapting PicoPLEX technology to high throughput using the ICELL8 cx Single-Cell System, we have obtained single-cell WGA libraries from up to 1,200 cells at once and enabled the reliable detection of CNVs and tumor subclones at a shallow sequencing depth. In addition, by leveraging the automated nanoliter-dispensing capabilities of ICELL8 cx system this method provides a significant reduction in reagent use and labor compared to plate-based methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Whole genome sequencing,Copy number variation,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Using Archer technology, key AML-related mutations were detected at allele frequencies less than 0.1%, and low transcript numbers of myeloid relevant fusions were identified. In addition, greater than 95% of the bases in the targeted region of interest were powered to detect variants at allele frequencies of less than 0.1% in the VARIANT<i>Plex<\/i> libraries. Finally, error correction and noise filtering techniques remove many false positive variants in order to reduce the false positive variant calling rate.<br \/>To generate the input material, 1,000 ng total gDNA or 200 ng total RNA from commercially available cell lines containing myeloid relevant variants was diluted into a background of wild type gDNA at a mass ratio of 1:100 or RNA at a mass ratio of 1:20 to assess analytical sensitivity. Libraries were prepared using the catalog panels VARIANT<i>Plex<\/i> AML Focus or the FUSION<i>Plex<\/i> Pan Heme assay. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina and Element Biosciences sequencing platforms. Data were analyzed with Archer Analysis using a pipeline which includes read cleaning, deduplication, error correction, variant calling, and reporting steps.<br \/>In conclusion, the VARIANT<i>Plex<\/i> AML Focus assay used with Illumina or Element sequencers demonstrated the ability to detect variants down to allele frequencies of 0.05%, and the FUSION<i>Plex<\/i> Pan Heme assay was used to detect low transcript number fusions which may be useful for AML minimal residual disease research.<br \/>1.

Target enrichment technologies enhance DNA sequencing by enabling users to analyze specific regions of interest only, which helps to effectively increase sequencing depth and sample throughput while minimizing cost. However, many targeted DNA library construction workflows are not optimal for routine genetic testing needs due to inconsistent, lengthy workflow. This poses significant challenge to application like cancer mutation profiling that requires detection sensitivity down to 1% or below due to heterogeneous nature of tumor tissue. In addition, high throughput testing with minimal hands on time is desirable with the rapid advance of precision medicine. Magnetic bead separations are commonly used between the individual reactions of targeted DNA library preparation workflows for cleanup and size selection. These bead clean up reactions are not only labor-intensive and tedious procedures but can also greatly contribute to sample-to sample variation especially when employing automated library preparation procedures. With the sophisticated QIAseq Targeted DNA Pro, we developed a novel streamlined targeted DNA workflow that greatly reduces handling variation by replacing the majority of bead clean up steps with enzymatic reactions, which now can be finished in as little as six hours. In combination with the newly developed QIAseq Normalizer kit, the protocol has been successfully implemented on the Hamilton NGS Star liquid handling platform resulting in up to 96 highly uniform, complex and ready-to-sequence libraries that can be effortless generated in one run. This complete automated solution saves researcher up to four hours of hands-on time. When using commercial reference samples, cancer mutations down to 1% were consistently detected with this automated workflow. The presented data demonstrate that this integrated and streamlined workflow does not only provide an automation friendly workflow but also allows to reliably identify low frequent cancer mutations. The applications presented here are for research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted sequencing,Genomics,High-throughput assay,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Detection of gene fusions plays a valuable role in selecting targeted therapies. A widely used method for detecting fusion transcripts is targeted RNA sequencing, which focuses sequencing reads on known fusions but does not allow for the detection of novel fusions. Whole transcriptome analysis (WTA), where the entire transcriptome is interrogated, offers an opportunity to detect both known and novel fusions.<br \/>Herein we examine the effect of sample quality, input mass, increased reverse transcriptase (RT) and insert size on fusion calling. Libraries are prepared using the Watchmaker RNA Library Preparation Kit with or without Polaris Depletion and, for target enrichment, the Twist Exome 2.0 panel prior to paired end 2x150 Illumina sequencing. First, control samples, specifically Seraseq Fusion RNA v4 high quality and FFPE samples, are used to determine if any of the parameters interrogated increase the number of breakpoint spanning reads both in a WTA and targeted sequencing context. Once established, the optimized workflow is applied to real FFPE samples.<br \/>Targeted sequencing results in a higher number of breakpoint spanning reads, compared to WTA, when controlling for sequencing depth, resulting in a higher number of reads supporting each fusion call. Longer insert sizes, achieved by modified SPRI ratios, maintain library complexity and may enhance fusion calling. Taken together, these data demonstrate an optimized protocol for fusion calling from FFPE and demonstrate the utility of both WTA and targeted sequencing for fusion detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Targeted sequencing,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Conducting single-cell genomic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods has traditionally been challenging since the amount of genomic DNA present in a single cell is limited. PCR-based amplification methods normally have high error rates, low coverage uniformity, and extensive allelic drop-outs making interpretation of SNVs and CNVs challenging.Here we introduce a new whole-genome amplification method which utilizes an optimized isothermal DNA amplification reaction with a Hi-fidelity, error correcting polymerase and downstream library preparation protocol to allow pooling of amplified DNA. The key DNA amplification steps use multiple displacement amplification (MDA) technology to amplify gDNA directly from single cells, nuclei or previously isolated genomic DNA. During the MDA reaction, sample-barcodes are incorporated into the newly synthetized DNA, allowing the amplified DNA to be pooled and processed in to one ultraplex library. This method saves library preparation time, reduces DNA library costs and limits plastic consumable usage.Our current workflow allows 24 samples to be multiplexed in one library and 24 libraries to be produced for a total of 576 samples per sequencing flow cell. This method can be used to investigate chromosomal instability with low pass sequencing or SNV and CNV analysis following whole genome, exome-capture workflows.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,WGA,Whole exome sequencing,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

To achieve this potential, liquid biopsy assays must be optimized to address multiple challenges. For one, cfDNA quantity in the blood is highly variable, with different amounts present depending on malignancy and stage of progression. This requires optimization to detect low concentrations of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and to accommodate variable tumor fractions. In addition, minimizing assay costs will improve test accessibility and adoption. To address these issues, Genece Health is optimizing their lung cancer liquid biopsy assay to accommodate minimal cfDNA input into library preparation. Furthermore, Genece is testing algorithms that tolerate reduced read depths from low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) while maintaining high performance. The Genece lung cancer liquid biopsy assay profiles fragment end-motif and size (FEMS) and fragment coverage signals using LP-WGS (Illumina) and proprietary machine learning algorithms. This study first tested the frequency of end motifs in pooled ctDNA after modifying library preparation (IDT) to reduce reagent volumes from 1X down to 0.5X, 0.25X, and 0.1X of manufacturer specification. A range of cfDNA input from 0.25 ng to 6 ng was tested with each library preparation volume. In addition, LP-WGS read coverage from 5X to 1X was evaluated to assess impact on end motif frequency and assay sensitivity. Performance characterization was further evaluated with a cohort of 50 clinical lung cancer and 100 healthy donor plasma samples tested at 1X and 0.25X library reagent volume. We observed an expected increase in library complexity at higher cfDNA input and library reagent volume. Assay performance was minimally impacted by variable cfDNA input and library reagent volume. However, reducing sequencing read depth is tolerated down to 1.25X depth before increasing the variability of end motif frequencies. These observations are corroborated in the 150 clinical sample cohort. This data shows that by altering standard library preparation conditions and reducing unique read depth, liquid biopsy assays can accommodate a wider range of cfDNA, while concurrently decreasing overall costs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Liquid biopsies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

FFPE samples are therefore one of the most commonly available samples that can be used for discovery and diagnosis. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is one of the most used NGS assays that is used for profiling somatic and tumor mutations. With future clinical trials moving towards less invasive collection methodology, core needle biopsy samples are becoming a method of choice. The FFPE fixation process leads to the degradation of nucleic acids due to cross-linkage and the availability of sufficient nucleic acid from CNB fixed samples for downstream NGS assays is becoming limited. Here we report a comparison of two Whole Exome capture kits from several degraded FFPE samples, NA12878, OncoSpan gDNA HD827 and SeraSeq Breast CNV mix gDNA samples using the xGen Exome Hyb Panel v2 (IDT) Kit and the Twist Exome 2.0 (TWIST) Kit. Libraries were prepared in triplicate at 50ng, and 10ng using the Ultra&#8482; II DNA Library Prep (NEB) kit. Pre-capture libraries were evaluated to determine the total DNA library available for capture using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche) kit. The recommendations for input amount vary between the kits, with IDT recommending 500ng, and TWIST recommending 200ng per library. KAPA Library Quantification Kit kit was used to assess the nanomolar amounts of ligated libraries. Final libraries were pooled equimolar and then sequenced as 2x100bp Paired-end sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 instrument to achieve a target of 150-300X overall coverage. The performance of each capture kit was evaluated on the number of libraries eligible for capture, percent duplication rate, median insert size, and mean target coverage. IDT capture had 49% of libraries eligible at recommended input of 500ng, with 34% of libraries generating between 100-499ng input and the remaining 17% failing to generate 100ng input for hybridization. TWIST capture had 83% of libraries eligible at recommended input of 200ng, with 4% of libraries generating between 50-199ng input and the remaining 13% failing to generate 50ng input for hybridization. Most notably, 96% of libraries at 50ng DNA input were eligible for TWIST capture, while only 46% of libraries at 50 ng DNA input were eligible for IDT capture. The average Q30 for IDT and TWIST capture were 93-94% respectively. Both IDT and TWIST capture kits produced similar duplication rates and average mean target coverage was comparable. Taken together, our testing shows that TWIST and IDT kits generated comparable sequencing metrics. However, the TWIST Kit outperforms the IDT Kit in percent eligible libraries qualifying for hybridization capture. TWIST Kit is a great qualifier for highly degraded FFPE samples, especially those with limited input DNA material.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole exome sequencing,FFPE,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

We validated the Aventa FusionPlus Test, a Laboratory-Developed Test (LDT) that integrates HiC technology to enhance detection of actionable gene fusions and rearrangements in solid tumors, including those that are missed by current standard of care tests. This is a DNA-based test that is robust to DNA degradation in FFPE specimens, in contrast with RNA-seq and long-read technologies. The test utilizes the Element Biosciences AVITI sequencing platform to achieve high quality sequencing data at low cost per sample.<br \/>The Aventa FusionPlus test enables gene-level detection of structural variants near or within 361 medically actionable or diagnostically relevant cancer genes. The 3D structure and long-range linkages captured by the test amplify the signal counts for each rearrangement. The test integrates the Arima-HiC+ FFPE sample prep and the Arima Library Prep Kit workflow. After dewaxing and rehydrating the FFPE tissue, the chromatinized DNA is fragmented and the fragmented ends are filled in with a biotinylated nucleotide. Next, spatially proximal fragmented ends of DNA are ligated, capturing the 3D structure of the genome. The proximally-ligated DNA is then purified and further fragmented, and the biotinylated ligation fragments are enriched. DNA libraries are prepared from these enriched fragments and sequenced in &#8220;paired-end&#8221; mode. Genes involved in genomic rearrangements were detected using the Arima-SV pipeline along with manual curation.<br \/>The test achieved robust detection of structural variants, with accuracy of 98.8% relative to reference methods. FFPE tumor specimens from 10 different tissue types and a wide range of tumor content (20%-100%) were included. No correlation between tumor cellularity and sensitivity was observed, suggesting that samples with as low as 20% tumor cellularity can be tested. When comparing to RNA-based and other targeted reference methods, we found additional fusions nearby oncogenes missed by these reference methods. As an example, in a breast cancer case, a fusion of genomic regions neighboring BRAF and MYC oncogenes on chromosomes 7 and 8 respectively, was missed by the reference method but was successfully detected by the Aventa FusionPlus test.<br \/>The Aventa FusionPlus test is a highly sensitive, specific, and accurate method for comprehensive cancer genomic profiling. The enhanced understanding of gene fusions and rearrangements positions the test as a valuable tool for clinical decision-making in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

FFPE DNA poses many notable challenges for preparing NGS libraries, including low input amounts and highly variable damage from fixation, storage, and extraction methods. It is difficult to obtain libraries with sufficient coverage and the sequencing artifacts arising from damaged DNA bases confound somatic variant detection. Additionally, many laboratories process FFPE tumor samples alongside matched, high quality, normal DNA and many library prep workflows are not readily compatible with both sample types.<br \/>We developed a novel NGS library prep method compatible with both high quality and very low quality FFPE DNA samples, employing a novel enzymatic DNA repair mix, enzymatic fragmentation mix, and PCR master mix. To validate this workflow on real patient sample sets, we obtained DNA extracted from matched tumor and normal tissue of various tissue types preserved by both fresh frozen and FFPE methods. The FFPE DNA samples ranged in quality from DNA integrity number (DIN) 1.5 to 6.8, including samples stored for nearly 3 decades. We prepared libraries using this method compared against other library prep workflows and sequenced them by WGS and target capture. We assessed the performance of these workflows by library yield, library quality metrics, depth and evenness of coverage, and somatic variant calling with fresh frozen-extracted DNA providing the gold standard for library quality and mutation content.<br \/>This new enzymatic fragmentation-based library prep workflow not only reduced the false positive rate in somatic variant detection by repairing damage-derived mutations in FFPE DNA samples but also improved the library yield, library quality metrics (including mapping, chimeras, and properly-paired reads), library complexity, coverage depth and uniformity, and hybrid capture library quality metrics. Comparing the variant calls from matched FFPE and frozen tissues revealed an improved sensitivity and accuracy of variant calling using this library prep method compared to mechanical shearing and other enzymatic fragmentation library prep approaches.<br \/>This new suite of enzyme mixes allows even highly damaged FFPE samples to achieve high quality libraries with a greater sensitivity for somatic variant identification. The workflow is robust and flexible, compatible with both FFPE DNA and matched high quality DNA samples as well as automation-friendly for convenience in sample processing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"FFPE,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Genomics,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been utilized in clinical oncology from discovering and characterizing oncogenic driver mutations to providing personalized treatment of cancer. Among sequencing technologies, Illumina has emerged as the market leader, however, in recent years several alternatives have emerged. Herein, we evaluate the performance of NextSeq2000 and NextSeq550Dx platforms by Illumina to the Aviti platform from Element Biosciences.<br \/>Method: Eight (8) Archer Core Myeloid Panel libraries previously sequenced on NextSeq550Dx as part of a validated workflow were selected, normalized to 100 nanomolar (nM), pooled and sequenced on NextSeq2000 and Aviti sequencers with 2x150 paired-end sequencing. Samples included the HD829 myeloid DNA control from Horizon Discovery, a well-characterized HAPMAP sample, and a mixture of HD829 in HAPMAP. Prior to sequencing on the Aviti system, libraries were circularized with the Elements Adept chemistry. Fastq files from both Aviti and NextSeq2000 sequencing were uploaded to Archer Analysis Software, standardized filtering was applied to all generated datasets, and results compared across platforms.<br \/>Result: Aviti and NextSeq2000 platforms exhibited comparable sequencing reads, with an average total reads per sample of 76,205,719 and 74,201,570 from Aviti and NextSeq2000, respectively, while the lower throughput NextSeq550 platform yielded an average 17,619,350 reads per sample. Standardized filtering across all platforms provided 100% detection of true positives, however additional false positives (FP) were present in all samples and platforms that mapped to regions requiring normal dataset correction as part of the validated NextSeq550 workflow. The lowest numbers of FPs were detected on the Aviti platform, while both NextSeq550 and NextSeq2000 derived results contained several FP calls at elevated (&#62;10%) variant allele frequency (VAF).<br \/>Conclusion: The three platforms compared in this study were able to detect all true positives of the tested samples using the same filtering criteria. The performance metrics of NextSeq2000 and Aviti were comparable and higher than NextSeq550Dx, in line with expectations due to the higher sequencing capacity. Although the Aviti platform required additional hands-on time, it in-turn generated cleaner data with less FP variants in comparison to Illumina&#8217;s sequencing platforms. Overall, these results indicate robust sequencing throughout all three platforms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Changes in telomere length have become an important biomarker, which is closely related to cellular aging, all-cause mortality and a variety of diseases. However, there are still challenges in quantifying telomere absolute length, due to repeats of nucleotide sequence (5&#8217;-TTAGGG-3&#8217;)n in single-stranded G-rich telomeric region, and lack of a method for nucleotide separation and enrichment of individual telomeres.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We developed NanoTelo, a workflow for detecting telomere absolute length based on nanopore sequencing technology. For experimental steps, a self-designed telomere adapter was first connected to the C-rich strand at the end of the chromosome by utilizing the 3' end overhang. And the 5' end of the telomere adapter was complementary to the sequencing adapter, allowing the antisense telomere chain to perform single-strand extension sequencing in the 5' to 3' direction, thus into the sub-telomeric region from the telomere end. The sequencing library was nanopore-sequenced on the QPursue-6k according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. For data analysis, reads were strictly extracted (dataset B) with the telomere adapter and library structure in raw sequencing data (dataset A). The reads of dataset A and dataset B were corrected, aligned to the human reference genome (T2T-CHM13v2.0), and calculated the telomere length distribution of each chromosomal (autosomes and sex chromosomes) p\/q-arm, respectively. Defined the mean telomere length of all chromosomes represented the overall telomere length, the estimated results of dataset A and dataset B were weighted to obtain the final telomere absolute length.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We selected 5 cell lines, which was HCT116, 293T, T24, IMR90 and WI38, and performed 2 experimental replicates for each one. We found that the estimated telomere lengths for each cell line were 3,528\/3,512 bp, 4,298\/4,311 bp, 2,745\/2,685 bp, 4,926\/4,915 bp and 4,143\/4,096 bp, respectively. A comparative analysis with results from the Pacbio sequencing platform for each cell line in the <i>Tham et al.<\/i>'s paper, showed that there was no significant statistical difference (two-tailed T-test: <i>p-value<\/i>=0.98), and the mean absolute difference for estimated telomere length between the two platforms was 7.7 bp (95% CI: 5.4-10.0 bp).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> NanoTelo demonstrated the possibility of measuring telomere absolute length with a single chromosomal p\/q-arm at nucleotide-level resolution. We hope that NanoTelo can not only be used as an important tool for estimating telomere length to dynamically monitor aging, but also provide strong technical support for scientific research and\/or clinical application related to human anti-aging and disease intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Telomeres,Nanopore Sequencing Technology,Telomere Absolute Length,NanoTelo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Thus, we developed AMP reagents in liquid format to satisfy the need for a platform-agnostic method of high-throughput (-HT) AMP library preparation.<br \/>Methods: The performance of our liquid reagent-based VariantPlex-HT and FusionPlex-HT workflows were evaluated relative to legacy lyophilized reagents using several input of varying quantity, quality and type. In addition, we examined liquid reagent performance across multiple AMP panels, which target solid tumor and blood cancers variants. Prepared libraries were then sequenced and analyzed using Archer&#8482; Analysis v7.0 software.<br \/>Results: When using 50ng SeraSeq&#174; Myeloid DNA input (LGC Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) and the VariantPlex Core Myeloid panel (37 gene targets), both the lyophilized VariantPlex and VariantPlex-HT detected 100% (22\/22) known variants ranging from 3.8% to 20.4% allele frequency (AF). When using low-quality FFPE and the VariantPlex Complete Solid Tumor panel (430 gene targets), both workflows captured 28\/28 (AF: 1.4%-20.2%) and 11\/11 (AF:1.2%-18.9%) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Insertion and Deletions (InDels) when 50ng of SeraSeq compromised FFPE or 200ng Horizon Severe FFPE was used as input, respectively. The FusionPlex-HT workflow consistently showed increased library complexity using the FusionPlex Lung V2 panel with 20ng or 50ng of Seraseq RNA Fusion Mix v4 input. This, coupled with greater on-target percentage resulted in an average increase in fusion supporting reads of 1.95x &#177; 0.53 and 2.2x &#177; 0.41 for 20ng and 50ng input, respectively. Next, we prepared a dilution series of SeraSeq RNA Fusion Mix v4 FFPE material at 100%, 25%, 10% and 5% dilutions. We utilized our FusionPlex Pan Solid Tumor panel (137 gene targets) which covers all expected fusions in this input material.

Ion Torrent&#8482; NGS sequencing, combined with Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> HD technology, enables comprehensive genomic profiling with ultra-high sensitivity for low-frequency variants in cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) and highly heterogeneous solid tumor samples. However, the high GC content (&#62;80%) and the presence of G repeats that are known to adopt a compact stacked three-G-quadruplex conformation in the <i>TERT<\/i> gene promoter region pose sequencing challenges such as low read depth and strand-bias, i.e. prematurely truncated reads on one strand.<br \/>Methods: We designed nine AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> HD panels with amplicon sizes of 70 to 104 bp, ideal for cf-DNA and FFPE samples, to target the recurrent <i>TERT<\/i> promoter hotspots. The designs were tested alone and combined with a larger Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> HD DNA research panel resulting in highly multiplexed libraries. The libraries were used for Ion 540<sup>TM<\/sup> chip template preparation on the Ion Chef<sup>TM<\/sup> instrument and subsequently sequenced using the Ion GeneStudio<sup>TM<\/sup> S5 System. Sequencing data was used to evaluate coverage of the target hotspots by each design for each condition, and additional panels were designed to test single amplicons covering both <i>TERT<\/i> promoter hotspots.<br \/>Results: Through performance evaluation, we selected two overlapping amplicons, each effectively amplifying one of the two hotspots. Individually tested, these amplicons yielded approximately 3000 families each from a 10ng gDNA input and when combined into the larger Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> HD DNA research panel, they produced several thousand reads across various libraries, providing molecular coverage of around 200 functional molecules. While capture efficiency was lower compared to <i>TERT<\/i> amplicon-only libraries, these improved amplicons allow downstream analysis of variants. A single-pool solution (single amplicon\/s covering both hotspots) will be explored further using the second batch of amplicons\/primers.<br \/>Conclusions: The optimized amplicons in two pools developed in this study enable the detection of challenging yet clinically significant <i>TERT<\/i> promoter hotspot mutations using the ultra-sensitive Ion AmpliSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> HD technology.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

Globally, bladder cancer is the 10th most prevalent, and the 9th cause of mortality due to malignancy. The challenge addressed here is an improvement to sample preparation for sequencing. Among genders and disease states, urine samples vary in terms of cell count and hence, in DNA concentration. Therefore, it is critical to obtain consistent DNA fragments from variable samples across large cohorts of patients so that the sequencing leads to accurate identification of biomarkers of disease risk, progression, and treatment-response. In this direction, we present the advantages of a novel pixelated ultrasound technology which significantly improves sample-preparation in a very fast, economical, and high-throughput manner. Here, DNA is extracted from human urine samples and subjected to sonication to generate fragment sizes. Extracted DNA was loaded onto a regular 96-well round-bottom plate, which is sealed and placed inside the system where 12 columns of the 96-well plate are individually programmed and run simultaneously, hence enabling quick optimization. The system does not require time- and labor-intensive processing of the samples before or after the sonication which is required for other similar technology. Overall, the DNA samples were processed with significant improvement over other similar technology in terms of consistency, speed, and economy. Subsequently, the fragment sizes were analyzed. Analysis of results, as presented in the figures, show that the DNA fragment had the average size as predicted, uniform shearing, and very consistent across the 96-well plate containing different samples with no cross-contamination. The time, labour, expense, and risk turned out to be very low compared to other similar technology. The sizes were appropriate for library preparation and sequencing. The technology works consistently for both low and high cell numbers which is a critical factor for heterogenous samples from patients. In conclusion, the study presents improvements to library preparation for sequencing which fit into the larger workflow of non-invasive liquid biopsy using urine samples. The ability to obtain consistent DNA fragments in a quick and economical manner will greatly enable unique fingerprinting of an individual's cancer or cancer risk across large cohorts, with the potential for integration in automation workflows.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Genomics,Liquid biopsies,Urine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Stability of microwell cartridges used for single-cell capture and the integrity of the individual lanes are crucial factors in genomics research to ensure the accuracy and reliability of generated data. Stability is paramount to ensure consistent results over multiple experiments. High-quality materials and manufacturing processes are essential to prevent wear and tear, ensuring that the microwell cartridges function optimally for an extended period. Integrity between the individual lanes must also be intact to prevent cross-contamination between samples. To demonstrate partial use stability of the 8-lane microwell cartridge, multiple assay combinations were performed on different lanes of the cartridge, collected at different time points. Whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) together with AbSeq antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-Seq) was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), loaded and captured in Lanes 1 and 2, on Day 1; sample multiplexing was used with targeted mRNA assay on Jurkat and Ramos cells, loaded and captured in Lanes 3 and 4, after four months; and WTA together with the AbSeq Assay was performed on PBMCs, loaded and captured in Lanes 5 and 6, after six months. The different time points collected were compared to a single-lane microwell cartridge. Our data showed that assay performance was not compromised with the storage of a partially used cartridge, and there was no contamination detected between the lanes. High-throughput cell load and capture using WTA and the AbSeq Assay also showed that each lane of the 8-lane microwell cartridge was able to process up to 65,000 cells with no limit of detection on assay sensitivity. By maintaining cartridge stability and stringent measures to prevent contamination, researchers can ensure the reliability and accuracy of their data. This is vital for various applications such as developing targeted immunotherapies and precision medicine approaches, ultimately enhancing our capacity to combat a wide range of diseases.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of single nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC) seq either with or without simultaneous gene expression profiling using the microwell-based BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System. Taking advantage of an eight-lane microwell cartridge, the BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System can support the snATAC seq assay with nuclei input ranging from 1,000 to 400,000 nuclei in a single experiment. To demonstrate the flexible throughput capabilities, 1,000 to 50,000 nuclei from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tagmented and loaded onto a single lane of the BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System. The snATAC assay libraries were prepared and sequenced, revealing multiple high-quality ATAC-seq metrics: high counts of unique ATAC fragments, high fraction of reads in peak regions (FRiP), and high transcriptional start site (TSS) enrichment score. The data were obtained consistently across the wide range of input nuclei with use of the gentle and robust nuclei loading capabilities of the BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System. Moreover, after capturing ATAC fragments, the BD Rhapsody&#8482; Enhanced Cell Capture Beads are stable and can be stored at 4 &#176;C for up to 3 months, allowing researchers the flexibility in sequencing subsets of nuclei or lanes for QC purposes before sequencing the entire library and returning to samples for complete sequencing. Furthermore, to demonstrate the consistency of both open chromatin profiling and mRNA gene expression as a combination (multiomic snATAC + snRNAseq), firstly, we compared snRNAseq data from a whole transcriptome assay (WTA) with snRNAseq from an ATAC+mRNA multiomic assay using the same sample. This strategy enabled us to show that there is negligible gene expression differences between snRNAseq from the BD whole transcriptome assay and snRNAseq from the multiomic scATAC and scRNA assay. Likewise, the snATACseq assay and snATACseq assay with simultaneous whole transcriptome profiling shows that chromatin accessibility profiling is equivalent with and without gene expression profiling. Enabling this new scATAC assay on the BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System can advance the study of epigenetic regulation of gene expression with a robust and flexible workflow. This will allow researchers to analyze both open chromatin and mRNA at varying nuclei inputs with single-cell resolution to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in gene expression regulatory pathways. This assay can be readily extended to broader samples to gain greater understanding of disease states in immunology and immuno-oncology studies. For Research Use Only.

Due to the sensitivity of sequencing techniques, sample quality and stability can potentially interfere with results. BD&#174; OMICS-Guard Sample Preservation Buffer (SPB), a novel preservation solution, allows cells and bulk tissues to be stored for up to 72h at 4 &#176;C, while reliably capturing the true biology of cells. This reagent gently preserves mRNA and protein integrity without the traditional cross-linking and harsh fixatives, increasing flexibility and expanding options for study designs. Here, we showcase the preservation properties ofthis reagent for multiomic readouts in human cells and mouse tissue across three different timepoints.BD&#174; OMICS-Guard SPB&#8217;s preservation of mRNA from human PBMC and bulk mouse spleen tissues wasevidenced by WTA for differentially expressed genes in samples preserved for 24, 48 and 72h comparedto fresh\/unpreserved controls. Protein epitope preservation was demonstrated via CITE-Seq assay withthe BD&#174; AbSeq Human Immune Discovery Panel (human PBMC) or a 30-plex panel of anti-mouse BD&#174;AbSeq Antibody-Conjugated Oligonucleotides (mouse splenocytes) and confirmed with multicolor flowcytometry. For both sample types, high correlation R<sup>2<\/sup> values (&#62;0.87) were calculated for the preservation time points versus fresh controls. Concomitant flow cytometry analysis of major cell types and surface protein expression was consistent with sequencing data for all samples. Specificity and sensitivity of major cell type markers and cell surface proteins across cell types and time is visualized in the BD&#174;AbSeq Antibody-generated heatmap for each sample. Additionally, BD&#174; OMICS-Guard SPB maintains mRNA integrity in targeted gene assays and VDJ full-length assays, suggesting robust preservation of select transcripts readily interrogated in single-cell profiling. Batch effect across time and technical replicates for both sample types was limited with the BD Rhapsody&#8482; HT Xpress System and delineated by donor\/sample specific tSNEs across time. We demonstrate that the BD&#174; OMICS-Guard Sample Preservation Buffer effectively preserves both mRNA and surface proteins for single-cell experiments. BD&#174; OMICS-Guard SPB allows the convenient preservation of samples such as tumor biopsies to be collected and stored for up to 72h at 4 &#176;C while maintaining mRNA and protein integrity, allowing the flexibility for precious samples to be potentially shipped to a central sequencing site to ensure standardized sequencing workflows.

To ensure quality of cells and downstream applications, appropriate quality control (QC) methods are critical. Historically, karyotyping has been employed, but it is limited by its very low resolution and tedious laboratory workflow. Other methods such as PCR and targeted sequencing can characterize only small genomic variants at specific loci. Whole genome sequencing can detect small variants genome-wide but has limited sensitivity in detecting structural variants (SVs). Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a novel genome analysis technique that can fill many of the gaps in current capabilities for assessing genome integrity. To find clonal variants, 400 Gbp of data is collected from the parental\/control and test samples. For both samples, a <i>de novo<\/i> assembly is constructed, and homozygous or heterozygous SVs are assessed. Subsequently, the dual variant annotation pipeline identifies unique SVs in the test sample compared to the parental sample. To discover subclonal SVs down to 5% variant allele fraction (VAF), the workflow leverages the generation of 1.5 Tbp of data, requiring a simple adjustment to longer data collection time. Comparison of test sample to parental sample enables easy determination of acquired variants. Finally, generation of ~5 Tbp of data, requiring 2-3 flowcells to be run, enables the detection of SVs at ultra-low VAF down to ~1%. In this study, several dilutions and simulations were performed to examine OGM&#8217;s limit of detection. Targeting a coverage of 5 Tbp and analysis using the somatic SV-analysis workflow revealed that OGM has the sensitivity to detect deletions &#62;50kbp, insertions &#62;20kbp, duplications &#62;100 kbp, and translocations at ~1% VAF. We have applied the clonal and somatic workflows to verify genomes&#8217; integrity after cell immortalization, induced pluripotency, transgene-integration, and gene-editing. The data using the robust and sensitive workflows demonstrate that the OGM platform is a cost-effective solution for cell manufacturing\/bioprocessing QC applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Genomics,CRISPR,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Such approaches are limited in ultra-low tumor fraction (TF) contexts, such as early cancer detection or the identification of postoperative minimal residual disease, where ctDNA SNVs are difficult to distinguish against background sequencing error. ctDNA detection in these critical low TF contexts is further limited by the sparse amount of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma (Zviran et al., 2020). To reduce single-stranded artifact and base calling errors, duplex sequencing can be used to jointly analyze corresponding Watson and Crick strands to detect true, double-stranded variants. Recent work has demonstrated that duplex sequencing can decrease error rates to 10<sup>-7<\/sup> (Hoang et al., 2016) and can be deployed in the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) setting (Cheng et al., 2023). A significant limitation for existing duplex techniques is the need to analytically pair matching DNA strands through exhaustive sequencing, resulting in inefficient use of scarce input material, particularly in plasma cfDNA. These techniques typically capture 1-5% of sequenced molecules, restricting duplex coverage depth. We present balanced-strand sequencing, a PCR-free approach that leverages the hydrogen bonds of complementary DNA to carry matched native strands directly into sequencing, enabling massively scalable duplex sequencing. The approach relies on Ultima Genomics sequencing, where DNA denaturation is not required prior to clonal amplification. In balanced strand sequencing, double-stranded DNA is partitioned and clonally amplified on sequencing beads through emulsion-PCR. Each double-stranded DNA molecule contributes to a single sequencing read, allowing for a linear increase in duplex recovery with increasing sequencing depth. The approach does not require redundant sequencing and therefore maximizes unique molecule throughput. We applied balanced strand sequencing to cfDNA, input as low as 5 ng, and achieved 7-35x whole-genome duplex coverage, roughly 20-fold higher than our prior duplex WGS. We further developed a machine-learning guided single read mutation calling framework, which when combined with duplex error suppression, reduced error rates to 10<sup>-7<\/sup> and enabled accurate ctDNA detection at concentrations &#60;10<sup>-5<\/sup>. Use of our analysis framework in APOBEC-mutant bladder cancer plasma samples allowed us to identify APOBEC signatures in plasma and platinum exposure signatures indicative of prior chemotherapy treatment. Altogether, balanced strand sequencing radically enhanced duplex efficiency and has broad applications across cancer. In cfDNA applications, balanced strand sequencing enhances error-correction in tumor-informed ctDNA detection and paves the way for non-tumor informed WGS ctDNA detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Cell-free DNA,Machine learning,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The preserved tumor tissue can be interrogated using classical histopathology and complemented with molecular approaches to elucidate cancerous SNPs, indels, structural variants, repeat expansion, copy number expansions, and mutational burden. Increasingly, approaches are being deployed to interrogate tissue not only through individual datasets but through integrated approaches that provide spatial information that defines the tumor microenvironment. Here, we illustrate using FFPE blocks from various tissues a multiomic workflow that allows for deep exploration of the molecular underpinnings of cancerous tissue. FFPE blocks were serially sliced into various FFPE slides with a single slide H&#38;E stained. Individual slides were then utilized to explore the genome, epigenome, single cell RNA-seq, and digital spatial profiling. Genome information was captured using hybrid capture based approaches (whole exome sequencing and targeted cancer panel) followed by deep NGS on an Illumina platform and analyzed for a variety of variants and tumor mutational burden. DNA methylation was detailed using target capture probes targeting DNA methylation sites. Single cell approaches were applied to explore the transcriptome using 10X Genomics scRNAseq Flex kit. Digital spatial profiling was done using the NanoString for both transcriptomics and proteomics, with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas and Human Core and Pan-Tumor protein panels. Aggregating these data illustrates the expanding landscape of information that can be extracted from FFPE derived tissue and the potential for novel discovery and diagnostic power integrating these complex data types holds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Gene expression profiling,Proteomics,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We designed synthetic TCR and BCR spike-in controls to mitigate these biases and to serve as universal standards for any PCR-based immune receptor profiling assay. We synthesized 48 BCR constructs representing different IGH, IGK, and IGL genes and 39 TCR constructs for TRB, TRA, TRG, and TRD genes. The spike-in controls were tested as (16x3) BCR constructs and (13x3) TCR Triplex isoform pools added to multiple samples in the same batch to detect cross-contamination across samples. We successfully discriminated between controls and background sequences by combining a unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based correction strategy with spike-in controls at the data analysis step. We also tested 48 BCR and 39 TCR Premixed Controls by spiking into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) RNA samples before reverse transcription using Cellecta&#8217;s DriverMap&#8482; Adaptive Immune Receptor Profiling Assay that uses a multiplex RT-PCR approach with gene-specific primers and UMIs. We successfully used it to evaluate assay performance by adding premixed controls at different concentrations. Results showed a linear trend as the number of spike-in molecules increased. Our analysis revealed an average sequencing error rate of 0.4%-0.8% per base, aligning with the reported error rate range of Illumina sequencing. This suggests the reliability of our spike-in controls, which can be used to rectify biases in the AIR protocol and accurately estimate error and mutation rates for the DriverMap AIR assay or any other sequencing-based immune receptor profiling assay. This innovative approach enhances the robustness of immune receptor profiling technology, facilitating more accurate assessments of repertoire diversity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,B cells,Immune response,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500), a commercial CGP assay, allows concurrent analysis of DNA and RNA to simultaneously detect multiple types of variants across 523 genes. The assay is intended to detect single nucleotide variants (SNV), insertions and deletions (indel), and multinucleotide variants (MNV), copy number gain (CNV), tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in DNA, and fusions and splicing variants (exon skipping) in RNA. Here we aimed to validate TSO500 assay for its analytical performance on FFPE tumor samples. The validation samples include commercial controls, cell lines, clinical FFPE from NSCLC, CRC, Uterus and GIST (tumor content &#8805;20%). Library preparation was performed from minimum of 40 ng DNA and 40ng RNA. The data analysis is performed using TruSight Oncology 500 Local App software (LRM v2.2). A custom script (v1.0) was used to add SNP annotation for small variants and combine data output into cumulative format. For SNV and indel detection QC, 61 of 64 DNA libraries (95%) passed the QC for library size (median insert size &#8805;70bp) and coverage (median exon coverage &#8805;150). The percentage of DNA libraries passing QC for CNV and MSI are 95% and 88%, respectively. All 64 RNA libraries passed QC. The analytical performance of TSO500 was summarized in the Table below. In summary, the results showed that all the acceptance criteria were met and the TSO500 assay can be utilized for genomic profiling of FFPE tumor samples. The study also identified a few limitations of the Illumina LRM software e.g. potential false positive SNV within a indel background, potential false negative of complex indel, and the challenge of long indel detection.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{722CD031-8B7E-44A2-9F1C-C30A384AEA26}\"><caption>Summary of analytical performance of TSO500<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity and specificity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Assay LoD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accuracy by concordance<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Inter-run reproducibility<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SNV\/Small indel<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity for SNV and indel detection are 99.24% and 99.36%.<br>Specificity for SNV and small indel detection are 99.9998% and 100.00%, respectively.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The LoD for SNV is 3-5%, for DEL is 5-10% and for INS is 3-5%.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PPA for SNV detections is 96.64% (115\/119; 95% CI: 91.68%, 98.69%) and for small indel is 92.86% (13\/14; 95% CI: 68.53%, 98.73%) between TSO500 and comparator assays.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The positive call rate across all SNV and small indel variants is 98.7% (42842\/43419).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity and Specificity for MSI detection are both 100%.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSI status for all samples were detected with 100% of concordance by three assays;<br>PPA is 100% (95% CI: 51.01%, 100%) and NPA is 100% (95% CI: 34.24%, 100%).<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSI concordance for MSI-H is 100% (95% CI: 60.97%, 100.0%) and for MSS is 100% (87.13%, 100.0%).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TMB<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TSO500 reported TMB is well correlated and comparable to exome determined TMB.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The CV values for samples are acceptable.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CNV<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All positive CNVs detected by the comparator assay were detected by the TSO500 assay with similar fold changes;<br>PPA between TSO500 and OCAV3 assays is 100% (95% CI: 51.01%, 100%).<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The overall reproducible call rate is 91.5% (43\/47).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fusion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity and specificity for fusion detection is 91.94% and 100%, respectively.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All TSO500 assay detected fusions were confirmed by other assays;PPA is 100% (95% CI: 60.97%, 100%) and NPA is 100% (95% CI: 75.75%, 100%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The reproducibility of fusion call is 92.59% (25\/27; 95% CI: 76.63%, 97.94%).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Splicing<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sensitivity and Specificity for splicing variant detection are 91.67% and 100.00%, respectively.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The splicing variant detections were confirmed by OCAV3, OFA and Archer assays;<br>PPA is 100% (95%% CI: 20.65%, 100%) and NPA is 100% (95% CI: 83.18%, 100%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The overall reproducibility of positive call is 100% with 95% CI (43.85%, 100%) and negative call reproducibility is 100% with 95% CI (87.13%, 100%).<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor mutational burden,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Microsatellite instability,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Currently these assessments need to be performed using separate assays resulting in higher sample requirements, longer turnaround times and higher costs. In this study a custom NGS assay (Dup-Seq BCR-ABL1) was developed and validated that enables co-detection and identification of transcript variants (common and atypical) and resistance mutations. The assay design covers BCR exon 1 to ABL1 exon 10 and employs duplicate PCR amplification of BCR-ABL1 from a single source of the 1st strand cDNA initiated by ABL1 specific priming. The custom data analysis pipeline enables overlapped mutation calling from duplicates as well as transcript determination. The assay minimizes the low-level artifacts that can be seen with other NGS-based BCR::ABL1 assays. This study demonstrates that the Dup-Seq BCR-ABL1 assay achieves high accuracy (PPA for fusion: 0.985; PPA and NPA for mutation at 0.978 and 0.9999, respectively) and sensitivity (LoD for mutation detection at 3% from 10,000 copies of BCR-ABL1 input). The use of the Dup-Seq BCR-ABL1 assay for both transcript variant identification and mutation detection provides comprehensive and accurate results for the clinical management of CML and Ph+ ALL patients while reducing sample requirements, testing costs and turnaround time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcr-Abl,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,fusion and mutation,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
