[{"Abstract":"Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10-15% of all breast cancers where patients encounter poor clinical outcomes. Treatment modalities for TNBC are conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation leads to 35%-40% relapse within 5 years of diagnosis. There is a growing need for more effective targeted therapeutics to inhibit TNBC growth. The role of EZH2 in maintaining tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC is well documented. EZH2 promotes breast tumor-initiating cell expansion (BITC) and cancer progression by impairing the DNA damage repair process favoring activation of oncogenes. Despite the advancement in the discovery of inhibitors for EZH2 that attenuate its catalytic activity, resistance to these small molecules limits their use in solid tumors. The neurotransmitter dopamine via its D1 receptor activation in TNBC cell lines induces apoptosis and autophagy, as well as inhibits the invasion and regress in mammary tumors in vivo. Here we hypothesize that the presence of dopamine D1 receptor agonist (A77636) enhances the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126) to inhibit in vitro TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. To test the efficacy of the combination we employed a 3D culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells encapsulated in calcium-alginate microgels seeded from a microfluidic droplet generator. We also employed a 3D organ-on-chip-based microphysiological (MPS) platform (SynTumor) to study the effect of the drug combination on metastasis in vitro. The SynTumor MPS devices replicate the pathophysiological architecture of native vascularized breast tumors. The combination treatment enhanced a significant reduction of tumor spheroid diameter compared to the vehicle and indicated spheroid regression over treatment. Furthermore, the combination therapy induced necrosis and caused complete inhibition of EZH2 expression. The knockdown of EZH2 inhibited tumor spheroid formation and displayed cytoskeleton de-arrangement. In the microfluidic SynTumor model, circulating tumor cell numbers were reduced by half at 96 hrs after EZH2 combination treatment. Our data indicate that the combinatorial effect of DRD1 agonist and EZH2 inhibitor efficiently attenuates the EZH2-mediated in vitro tumor growth and metastasis (This work is supported by DOD: W81XWH2010065, for Eswar Shankar).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Drug synergy,Synergism,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"x.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated strong synergism of copanlisib and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in different lymphoma models, and the combination is under clinical evaluation. Understanding the resistance mechanisms could help the design of improved therapies. Hence, we generated MZL cell lines resistant to the copanlisib\/venetoclax combination.<br \/>Methods: All cells were tested for cell identity and Mycoplasma status. Resistance was confirmed stable after 3-weeks of drug-free culture. Multi-drug resistance phenotype was ruled out by confirming sensitivity to vincristine. Targeted agents already in the clinics were combined with copanlisib\/venetoclax. Cells underwent transcriptome and methylation profiling, targeted DNA sequencing, and immunophenotypic and immunoblotting analyses.<br \/>Results: We developed SSK41-derived models with resistance to copanlisib (n.=1) or venetoclax (n.=1) as single agents and to copanlisib\/venetoclax (n.=2) by long IC50 or by upfront IC90 exposure. The single-drug-resistant cells showed only partial resistance to copanlisib\/venetoclax. In contrast, the cells that developed exposing cells to copanlisib\/venetoclax IC90 exhibited a more substantial decrease in sensitivity to the combination. Copanlisib\/venetoclax induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PAR but not in resistant cells. Sensitivity to other PI3K, BCL2, and BTK inhibitors was decreased in all resistant lines. The response to MCL1-i, mTOR-i, and epigenetic agents (decitabine, HDAC, BET, and EZH2 inhibitors) was maintained. Triple combinations of copanlisib\/venetoclax with the AURKA inhibitor alisertib, PLK inhibitor rigosertib, or the multikinase inhibitor amcasertib were active in both parental and resistant cells. No acquired mutations were observed via targeted DNA sequencing designed to cover various coding genomic regions known to be recurrently mutated in mature B-cell neoplasms, including BCL2, nor via RNA-Seq for PIK3CA\/B\/G\/D genes. Integration of RNA and methylation profiles showed deregulation of genes involved in type-I IFN, chemokines (CCL25, CXCL13), apoptosis regulation, and JAK-STAT signaling. Resistant cells upregulated CD19 expression compared to parental cells. Immunoblotting showed the inability of copanlisib\/venetoclax to block BCR signaling in resistant cells.<br \/>Conclusions: We created four novel MZL-derived models of secondary resistance to PI3K and BCL2 inhibitors, which will help clarify possible modalities to overcome resistance. Novel potential targets were already identified, such as AURKA or PLK, to be further exploited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,PI3K,Venetoclax,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Despite recent advancements in novel drug targets for cancer therapeutics, patients often develop treatment resistance even after initial disease remission, leading to tumor relapse. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for developing resistance to standard-of-care therapies, it is essential to gain insights into the stepwise progression leading to complete resistance. Recent research has revealed that cancer cells can evade the effects of chemotherapy and targeted therapy by entering a reversible and slow proliferation state known as the drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state. This DTP state allows cancer cells to survive drug therapy long enough for additional mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to develop. HUB Organoids&#174; or patient-derived organoid (PDO) models are derived from patient tissues, making them more physiologically relevant than traditional cell lines. Thus, studying drug persistence and resistance in PDO models is more likely to reflect in vivo conditions. This study demonstrates the successful development of persistent and resistant CRC PDO models to standard-of-care therapies. All models were characterized using whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to confirm their persistent or resistant state and to identify possible pathways involved in developing therapy resistance, as well as potential new drug targets. In conclusion, developing persistent and resistant PDO models is crucial for understanding drug resistance mechanisms, enabling the development of more effective and personalized cancer treatments, and advancing our overall knowledge of how resistance develops in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Therapy resistance,Drug-discovery screen,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

In recent years, ADCs have rapidly developed in the field of cancer therapy, particularly in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. One representative example is Trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), which has become a new benchmark for anti-HER2 ADCs due to its excellent performance in clinical trials. Despite the impressive clinical outcomes of ADCs, some tumors in patients may still develop resistance to these drugs. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of resistance and develop strategies to overcome ADCs resistance. To achieve these goals, it is essential to establish and utilize preclinical models to study these resistance mechanisms. Preclinical models of resistance to ADCs have mainly been generated using human cultured cell lines. JIMT-1 is a HER2-positive breast cancer cell line that exhibits primary resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab and also shows resistance to trastuzumab-derived ADC T-DM1. However, we found that Enhertu significantly inhibited tumor growth in JIMT-1 xenograft models. We subjected JIMT-1 tumor tissues to continuous passage in mice and administered long-term drug induction. The tumor growth rate gradually increased, and the drug sensitivity decreased, resulting in the acquisition of an Enhertu-resistant tumor model. The obtained resistant tumor tissues not only include tumor cells themselves but also comprise fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and other cellular components, enabling a more comprehensive investigation into the interactions between different cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We believe that the establishment of preclinical Enhertu-resistant models helps predict resistance that has not yet emerged clinically and provides references for future drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Enhertu-resistant,HER2,TME,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors disrupt this alliance by preventing PD-1 from binding to PD-L1, thereby reactivating the patient's immune system. While anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating solid tumors, durable responses are observed in only a minority of patients. The majority of patients do not experience the full benefits of anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy, and a significant proportion of initial responders eventually develop acquired resistance. Thus, the establishment of reliable preclinical PD-1 resistance models is of paramount importance for uncovering resistance mechanisms and devising novel treatment strategies.<br \/>Common mechanisms contributing to PD-1\/PD-L1 resistance include the absence of appropriate tumor antigens, inactivation of tumor surface MHC molecules, aberrant IFN&#947; signaling pathways, and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We have successfully generated multiple drug resistance models at both cellular and animal levels, offering valuable tools for the investigation of diverse drug resistance mechanisms. For instance, our animal model of drug resistance, induced by long-term treatment with the PD-1 antibody (Keytruda), simulates the clinical scenario of acquired resistance due to prolonged medication. Through gene editing techniques, we have created a drug-resistant cell line (CT26-B2M KO) by disrupting the B2M gene in the CT26 cell line, thereby mimicking a tumor model with B2M functional deficiency in mice. Additionally, we have compiled efficacy data from various naturally occurring resistant models, which serve as valuable resources for studying primary resistance or intricate resistance mechanisms.<br \/>In summary, preclinical PD-1 resistance models serve as crucial tools for researchers to dissect the intricacies of PD-1 resistance mechanisms and offer essential guidance for the development of innovative treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Preclinical,Resistance models,Treatment strategies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

For DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), there are two main repair mechanisms: non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ) which is prone to error due to infidelity events, and BRCA1\/2 mediated homologous recombination repair (HR) restoring the original sequence. Therefore, inhibition of PARPs may cause both single stranded break repair deficiency and HR deficiency in BRCA1\/2 deficient patients, leading to cell death. The concept of &#8220;synthetic lethality&#8221; has led to the development of PARP inhibitors, including Olaparib, Niraparib and Rucaparib in clinical practice. Despite encouraging efficacy of these PARP inhibitors, acquired resistance, such as HR repair restoration, drug efflux pump upregulation and replication fork protection, has limited their clinical benefits. Therefore, to investigate novel therapeutic strategies which can overcome the acquired resistance, we established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) ovarian cancer models with PARP inhibitor-induced resistance.<br \/>Methods: OV9402, an ovarian cancer PDX model with BRCA 1 c.3155del, was implanted subcutaneously and treated with Niraparib at 35 mg\/kg, daily, for 129 days. Relapse tumors (tumor #1 and tumor #2) were isolated and inoculated into na&#239;ve mice. Then the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> round of treatment (Niraparib, 35 mg\/kg, daily) was given when the mean tumor volume reached 140 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. The tumors showing no significant response to Niraparib were collected on either day 32 (#1 derived tumor model) and day 22 (#2 derived tumor model) after randomization and their gene changes were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).<br \/>Results: Niraparib significantly inhibited OV9402 tumor growth, with complete regression observed in nine out of ten mice on day 54 after the 1<sup>st<\/sup> round of treatment. However, tumor regrowth was observed in two out of the nine mice from day 68 onwards. The relapsed tumors (tumor #1 and tumor #2) from these two mice were collected and re-inoculated into 5 na&#239;ve mice to establish tumor models for the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> round of Niraparib treatment, separately. For #1 derived tumor model, all the tumors presented complete resistance to the Niraparib treatment. RNA-seq data showed that the gene expression of ABCB1, which encodes for efflux pumps, was upregulated. In parallel, complete resistance to Niraparib was observed in all the tumors derived from 2# tumor bearing mice. The RNA-seq data demonstrated that an acquired secondary genetic deletion on BRCA1 genes, which restored the functional protein expression loss in the parental line and restored HR repair, was found in the tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Ovarian cancer PDX models that have effectively developed resistance to PARP inhibitors have the potential to serve as valuable preclinical tools to evaluate potential next-generation PARP inhibitors and innovative combination strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Drug resistance,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,BRCA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"L.

Kryukov et al. first reported the \"synthetic lethal\" effect of inhibiting PRMT5 in MTAP-deficient tumors, and they identified MTAP as the synthetic lethal partner of PRMT5 in 2016. MTAP is a tumor suppressor gene frequently lost in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Furthermore, the loss of MTAP leads to the accumulation of MTA in cancer cells, which competes with PRMT5's co-factor SAM for binding and forms the PRMT5-MTA complex. Cancer cells lacking MTAP show enhanced sensitivity to PRMT5 loss. Therefore, this complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic target, particularly for the treatment of MTAP-deficient cancers. MRTX1719 is a highly effective selective inhibitor of the PRMT5-MTA complex, capable of selectively inhibiting PRMT5 activity in MTAP-deficient cells. As the most promising candidate drug, MRTX1719 is undergoing Phase I\/II clinical evaluation for patients with MTAP-deficient cancers. Drug resistance is an inevitable problem with small molecule inhibitors. Currently, the mechanism of resistance to MRTX1719 is not clear, as MTAP\/CDKN2A loss is an early driver event in most cancers. To further explore the resistance mechanism of MRTX1719, our group used the MTAP-deficient LN-18 cell line and induced mutagenesis using the mutagen ENU. We then used a drug low-concentration gradient method to establish the LN-18-MRTX1719R-resistant cell line. Specifically, LN-18 cells were treated with increasing doses of MRTX1719 for 6 months, and mixed clones that tolerated MRTX1719 were selected. Subsequently, single clones were selected, and a stable MRTX1719-resistant clone was obtained, named LN-18-MRTX1719R. Cell proliferation inhibition assay showed that the IC50 of LN-18-MRTX1719R was over 1000nM, which is 100-fold more resistant than the parental LN-18 cells (9.87 nM). We explored the resistance mechanisms using RNA-Seq and WES methods. The resistance to MRTX1719 of the LN-18-MRTX1719R cell line was highly stable after 20 cell passages. The LN-18-MRTX1719R cell line can be a useful cell line mode in the development of future PRMT5&#183;MTA inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,MTAP,PRMT5,MRTX1719,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

Resistance to therapy has classically been attributed to the presence of a cancer stem cell or genetic tumor cell heterogeneity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized (40-1000 nm) vesicles that are released by all cells into the extracellular space. EVs carry diverse cargo dependent on the cell of origin and have been studied as a source of novel cancer-specific liquid biopsy biomarkers and contributors to tumor progression and metastasis. However, the paracrine function of EVs in promoting therapy resistance is under-studied, and the impact of EVs released from therapy-resistant cancer cells on surrounding therapy-sensitive cancer cells is unknown. In this study, we develop an innovative microfluidic device, TREVCo, to enable simultaneous single-cell trap, EV detection, and co-culture modules to evaluate EVs-mediated transfer of cellular information between therapy-resistant cancer cells and adjacent cells, and to characterize EVs released from resistant cells and determine their impact on the resistance phenotype of adjacent therapy-sensitive cancer cells. We utilize resistant cells from multiple prostate (PCa) cell lines that have been selected for therapy resistance by culture with increasing dosages of cancer drugs such as cisplatin, docetaxel. We use the matched untreated therapy-sensitive parental cell lines as the sensitive cells. We hypothesize a novel model of therapy resistance in lethal PCa: EVs released from resistant cells contain pro-resistance factors that are transferred to adjacent sensitive cells upon EV uptake, thus directly enabling therapeutic resistance. We will assess the impact of resistant cell-EVs at a single cell level via a novel device, TREVCo, that enables comprehensive downstream analysis. This single-cell approach enables dissection of critical EV-associated therapy-resistant factors within the large heterogeneity of resistant PCa. Co-culture of a single resistant cell and a hundred adjacent sensitive cells mimicking intra-tumoral interactions is also critical to demonstrate evidence of resistant cell secreting factors inducing a pro-resistance phenotype. These studies will be the first-in-field to assess the impact of resistant PCa cell-derived EVs at single-cell resolution. An understanding of resistant cell-derived EVs and the impact of that EV cargo on adjacent sensitive cells will provide critical insight into the acquisition of therapy resistance in lethal PCa. The novel approach to apply resistant cell-derived EVs in co-culture assay with sensitive cells will enable the screening of transmittable resistance-associated factors and provides critical opportunities for accelerating precision medicine for advanced PCa patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Extracellular vesicles,Microfluidics,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.-J.

Although IO shows a high CR\/CRi rate in relapsed\/refractory CD22-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the duration of remission is short due to early acquisition of resistance. Therefore, the present study attempted to enhance the cytotoxicity of IO by focusing on polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. Furthermore, IO-resistant cell lines were newly established to investigate the mechanism of IO resistance.<br \/>Methods: Reh cell line derived from Ph-negative B-ALL cells was used. To establish IO-resistant cell lines, Reh cells were long-term exposed to IO, followed by limiting dilution. FACS analysis evaluated the CD22 positivity and the induction of apoptosis. WTS assay determined the cell growth inhibition effects. The Comet assay quantitatively assessed DNA damage. Gene expression profiles were determined by using DNA microarray.<br \/>Results: The 50%-inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of IO was 2.1 ng\/mL in Reh cells. Reh cells were synergistically sensitized to IO by the addition of non-toxic concentrations of PARP inhibitors, olaparib or talazoparib, with the Combination Index of 0.19 and 0.42, respectively. Moreover, these combinations augmented the induction of apoptosis (23.5% in IO alone, 51.7% in IO + olaparib, 66.1% in IO + talazoparib). The Comet assay demonstrated that DNA strand breaks observed 1h after IO administration were repaired 6h later. In the combination of IO with olaparib or talazoparib, DNA damage remained even at 6h, suggesting the inhibition of DNA repair by PARP inhibitors. Next, six IO-resistant cell lines were established with IC<sub>50<\/sub> more than 60-fold that of parental cells. All these cell lines kept CD22 expression. These cell lines were also resistant to apoptosis induced by IO. In addition of olaparib or talazoparib to IO, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of IO decreased by 40% to 70% in 6 IO-resistant cells. These combinations also augmented the induction of apoptosis (24.2% in IO alone, 45.3% in IO+olaparib, and 56.8% in IO+talazoparib). DNA microarray was performed to compare gene expression profiles between parental and IO-resistant cell lines. ABCB1 (p-gp), a drug efflux pump that causes multi-drug resistance, was overexpressed in resistant cell lines. Moreover, the addition of p-gp inhibitor, PSC-833, to IO enhanced the cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis<u> <\/u>due to more DNA strand break.<br \/>Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that the combination of IO with PARP inhibitors exerted synergistic cytotoxicity via the inhibition of DNA repair. In addition, it was suggested that overexpression of p-gp caused IO resistance, which was partially reversed with the combination of PARP inhibitors or a p-gp inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),DNA repair inhibition,P-glycoprotein,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

However, the current PD-1 blockade monotherapy benefits only a small proportion of patients, and primary or acquired resistance can ultimately lead to cancer progression in clinical settings. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance is both necessary and urgent to enhance clinical outcomes. Increasing evidence suggests that resistance to PD-1 therapy can arise from both tumor-cell-intrinsic and tumor-cell-extrinsic factors. Loss-of-function mutations in the antigen presentation pathway and downstream elements represent intrinsic mechanisms, while tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to immune tolerance as extrinsic factors. Currently, the rational design of combination therapies based on these resistance mechanisms remains to be achieved.<br \/>In this study, we developed two types of anti-PD-1 antibody-resistant models based on the intrinsic anti-PD-1 treatment-sensitive MC38 models. These models include genetically engineered resistant models with B2M or STK11 knockout (KO) and induced resistant models through <i>in vivo<\/i> progressive drug selection. STK11 KO mutations resulted in reduced expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and a lower infiltration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment, while B2M KO led to a lack of antigen presentation on the tumor cell surface, blocking the binding of the anti-PD-1 antibody. In terms of the induced anti-PD-1 resistant models, a higher proportion of immunosuppressive cells, including Tregs, MDSCs, and TAMs, were observed in the tumor microenvironment compared to the parental counterparts, contributing to immune escape from PD-1 blockade. These models simulate extrinsic and intrinsic mechanism-based anti-PD-1 resistance, allowing for the identification of combination therapies to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1.<br \/>Our study enhances our understanding of the biological basis of anti-PD-1 resistance and supports the discovery of mechanistically-designed combination therapies to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, potentially broadening its clinical applicability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

While LUAD treatment options have greatly improved, SQLC remains challenging, as targetable mutations are rare. Immunotherapy provides benefits, nevertheless, chemotherapy remains a backbone of systemic treatment strategies for SQLC patients. Accordingly, a major challenge for SQLC treatment is the development of chemoresistant tumors, oftentimes leading to cross-resistance to multiple drugs and limiting patient survival. Currently, the causal pathways enabling tumor cells to survive therapeutic stress and drivers of chemotherapy resistance are insufficiently known, which impedes the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We therefore leverage forward and reverse genetic approaches including large-scale chemo-genetic perturbations to systematically map the landscape of molecular drivers involved in chemotherapy resistance in SQLC. By integrating the resulting data we derive specific knowledge of the underlying processes, in order to identify druggable targets in chemoresistant tumors and contribute to improved patient care.<br \/>To assess genes causally mediating chemotherapy resistance upon overexpression, we performed genome-wide CRISPR activation screens utilizing clinically used cisplatin and taxol. Additionally, we performed CRISPRa screens against four further drugs currently in clinical trials in order to distinguish genes causing cross-resistance to multiple drugs versus drug-specific mechanisms.<br \/>In parallel, we generated chemoresistant clones by prolonged low-dose treatment, to analyze transcriptomic adaptions to chemoresistance and validate the CRISPRa screening hits.<br \/>Initial findings show a large selection of unique and shared gene sets that were significantly enriched or reduced after treatment in the CRISPRa screen, indicating their involvement in the development of chemoresistance.<br \/>Of note, transcriptomic analysis of chemoresistant cells shows an overlap with the CRISPRa screen specifically for the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is transcriptionally enriched in chemoresistant cells and a positive hit in the CRISPRa screen. Chemoresistant clones show increased resistance to tunicamycine induced ER-stress, indicating an increased ability to overcome the accumulation of misfolded protein under cytotoxic treatment through the UPR. Specific inhibition of the UPR during cytotoxic treatment shows promising results in chemoresistant cells.<br \/>By combining our CRISPR activation screen and systematic analysis of chemoresistant cells we were able to identify the UPR as a driver and a druggable synthetically lethal dependency of chemoresistance in SQLC. This opens the possibility of studying the UPR as a potential target in the treatment of patients with chemoresistant tumors, improving patient outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,CRISPR,Squamous cell carcinoma,Unfolded protein response (UPR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Acquired resistance can be occurred several months after targeted therapy via alternations of drug targets due to the genomic mutations of the targets, epigenetic transcriptional or translational changes, for example the C797S mutation impairs AZ9291 binding to the EGFR kinase domain. To overcome this, novel well-designed chemical compounds targeting new mutations would be urgently needed, as well as the potential new oncogenes\/susceptible genes driving the resistance. Considering about the heterogeneity of primary tumor tissues, LIDE has established one functional cost-effective <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i> screening method, named reverse engineering strategy for targets identification by using patients-derived conditional reprogramed cancer cell lines (CRs) and IO-FIVE (Immuno-Oncology drugs Five In Vivo Efficacy test). Basically, pro-siRNA library or CRISPR\/sgRNA library is carried out in CRs for candidates hunting, alternatively drug-response evaluation among multiple clinical biopsies in mice cancer trials, after filtered with bioinformatic scanning from large groups of patients, and finally it is validated <i>in vivo<\/i> by CRISPR, shRNA silence or targeted compounds. In addition to these known factors (EGFR C797S, Her2\/Met amplification, Ras and MAPK activation), we have discovered that epigenetic factors for DNA modification, protein translation kinases, mitochondrial\/ peroxisomal transporters and cell membrane lectins may contribute to AZ92921 resistance <i>in vivo<\/i>. And one previously unknown acyltransferase member has been identified as key driver gene for pan-cancer development by IO-FIVE, and patients with high expression level of this enzyme have had poor survival outcomes, accompany with uncontrolled tumor growth and immunotherapy resistance, which is becoming a promising therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Target discovery,Immuno-oncology,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"B.
