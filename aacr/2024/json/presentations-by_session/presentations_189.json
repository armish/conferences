[{"Abstract":"Patients with B-cell lymphoma currently have limited treatment options, often with serious side effects; for example, B-cell lymphoma patients undergoing chemo- and radiation therapies experience poor health from off-target toxicity. Similarly, though CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is very effective, patients suffer lifelong B-cell aplasia as a side effect. Comparing a cancer to an autoimmune disease in the same tissue type may grant us additional insights on the immune dysregulation of the cancer, leading to development of more immune-aware cancer treatments. We introduce a new data-driven comparative workflow for the analysis of immuno-oncology attributes by comparing a cancer and an autoimmune disease in the same tissue type. As an example use case, we compare primary B-cell lymphomas to primary B-cells from systemic lupus erythematosus with the goal of delineating new mechanisms that can be leveraged to treat B-cell lymphomas. Our analysis will utilize bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of B-cells for initial discovery, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for validation. Our analytical framework incorporates differential gene analysis, GO Terms, known protein-protein interactions, principal component analysis, and machine learning for biomarker detection. Here, we describe our novel tool in detail and share the results of our lymphoma use case to gain a better understanding of the targetable immune-related attributes of B-cell lymphoma. We expect that this novel tool, along with the results of our B-cell lymphoma use case, will contribute to the continued development of immune-focused treatment options for B-cell lymphoma and other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Immune Imbalance,B-cell lymphoma,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

However, there are strong biases among atlases due to their varying sample sources, conditions, cell type annotation strategies and resolutions. Selecting appropriate atlas for future or smaller-scale studies is complicated due to unclear understanding of atlases, that limits the future or smaller-scale studies take advantage of the wealth of data that such atlases provide. For example, the tumor-infiltrating immune cell atlases including pan-cancer and cancer type-specific atlases provide comprehensive profiling of immune cells, which desperately facilitates future single-cell studies. However, lack of a comprehensive assessment and comparison of tumor immune cell atlases with standardized benchmarks blocked the application of the most appropriate atlas for smaller-scale study. In this study, we compared pan-cancer immune cell atlases including TICA, pan-cancer T cells and pan-cancer blueprint atlases, and cancer-type specific immune cell atlases containing ABTC, HCC and STAD atlases. We quantified the correlations of cell types and observed similar heterogeneity among atlases and unique immune cell populations in TICA as well. Then, we assessed the performance of atlases on accurately annotating immune cell types in the widely studied PBMC datasets&#8212;in which cell types were well annotated. Comparative analysis revealed the complementarity within atlases on mapping success, accuracy, clustering, annotatability and stability by benchmarking reference-based populations to reference-free de novo clustering on real immunotherapy datasets. We identified potential indicators of immune response and found that reference-based populations outperformed reference-free clusters in recognizing immunotherapy-related cell states. Our study can be easily extended to future atlases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Immune cells,Bioinformatics,tumor immune atlases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Since the late 1980&#8217;s it has been known that loss of chromosome 10 (10 loss) and gain of chromosome 7 (7 gain) often co-occur in GBM. The reasons for this frequently co-occurring event are not very clear, with some prior studies speculating on a few driver genes as culprits. In this study, we aim to study and understand the phenomenon of 10 loss and 7 gain in gliomas in a systematic, chromosome-wide level.<br \/>Methods: Our analysis consists of three main analyses, that bring independent sources of evidence to address our research question:<br \/>a) Analyzing data from Progenetix, we developed rigorous probabilistic models that elucidate the probability dynamics of 10 loss and 7 gain in gliomas.<br \/>b) Next, by analyzing hundreds of genomic and transcriptomic samples from TCGA brain cancer patients, and cell lines, we identified a category of clinically relevant genetic interactions termed 'synthetic rescues'. <i>Synthetic rescue<\/i> <i>(DU-SR)<\/i> <i>interactions <\/i>refer to a form of functional interplay in which the detrimental impact on cell fitness caused by the inactivation of a specific gene (termed &#8216;vulnerable gene&#8217;) is compensated by upregulation of another gene (termed &#8216;rescuer gene&#8217;). The enrichment of rescuer genes on 7 for the vulnerable genes on 10 was then tested.<br \/>c) Utilizing large-scale <i>in vitro<\/i> essentiality screens via CRISPR technology in central nervous system (CNS) cancer cell lines, we sought to investigate the fitness effects of different possible sequences of chromosomal 10 and 7 loss and gains.<br \/>Results: The main results emerging from this three-pronged analysis are as follows:<br \/>1) We find that 7 gain after 10 loss is a more likely event than the opposite order of loss of 10 after 7 gain whose probability is explained by a random chance model.<br \/>2) We show that loss of 10 is enabled by the cells&#8217; ability to readily mitigate its loss, specifically through rescue interactions with genes lying on the amplified 7 chromosome.<br \/>3) These findings in the analysis of patients&#8217; tumors are further reinforced by an independent investigation in IDH wild-type CNS cancer cell line essentiality screens.<br \/>Conclusions: The co-occurrence of 10 loss and 7 gain in gliomas is the most frequent loss-gain co-aneuploidy pair occurring in human cancer. Our analysis presents a new multi-pronged approach to analyze co-occurring aneuploidy events in cancer, showing the long-contemplated chromosomal co-occurrence events in gliomas, a mystery that has persisted for decades, is likely to arise from genetic rescue interactions between many genes that lie on those chromosomes. From a future translational standpoint, it additionally points to key rescuer genes that may be potentially targeted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Glioblastoma multiforme,Aneuploidy,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Early studies in BE suggested that all cells within a patient&#8217;s Barrett&#8217;s segment are progenies of a single founder cell. However, in recent years this previously accepted model of BE as a monoclonal disease has been retired in favor of a multiclonal model with new evidence suggesting that a patient&#8217;s Barrett&#8217;s segment can be composed of multiple independent clones with independent founder cells. Nonetheless, single BE samples are still routinely assumed to be monoclonal, leading to independent sets of genomic aberrations erroneously being analyzed as a single set in the case of multiclonal samples. Here, we utilize a previously generated whole-genome sequenced BE dataset and repurpose an established pipeline for detecting subclonal populations to identify BE samples that are comprised of multiple independent clones. Additionally, we present a novel approach for validating multiclonality from sequencing data by phasing pair-end sequencing reads using germline variants. We demonstrate that 20\/80 patients have at least one multiclonal sample and that the independent clones contained in these single biopsies can have drastically different genomic profiles. Further, we speculate that these multiclonal samples capture a snapshot of clonal competition and evolution within BE. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multiclonality when studying BE and provide the first systematic analysis of multiclonal BE samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Barrett's esophagus,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

By the way, although alternative splicing (AS) in cancer cells contributes to proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and immune escape, their role and association with DLBCL molecular subtypes are unknown. Therefore, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bulk RNA-Seq data paired in the public EGA dataset (EGAD00001003600) to explore the patterns of AS events that differ between Lymphgene subtypes. The WES data of 620 DLBCL samples that passed quality control were aligned to the reference using BWA-MEM, and variants were called with Mutect2. We used the information of copy number variants provided by cBioPortal. The RNA-Seq analysis was performed using the STAR-RSEM pipeline and differential splicing events were detected using rMATS to compare subtypes. Among 620 DLBCL samples, there were 19 MCDs, 95 EZBs, 22 BN2s, and 137 ST2s (50 samples with multiple genetic classes, and 291 samples unclassified). Mutations in spliceosome complex genes (ZRSR2 and SF1) were found in 14 and 27 samples, respectively. In BN2 and MCD subtypes, splicing events with significantly different exon inclusion levels were observed at a high frequency of 29 and 16 occurrences, respectively, compared to other subtypes. (P-value &#60; 0.05). In contrast, retained intron is the only event observed in the EZB subtype (Table 1). Samples with mutations in ZRSR2 and SF1 showed four and two aberrant events, respectively, compared to samples without these mutations. Of note, rMATS detected an alternative 3&#8217; splice site event in exon 6 of <i>CD37 <\/i>in the MCD. <i>CD37 <\/i>is involved in tumorigenesis in leukocytes and has been suggested as a potential biomarker in blood cancer, and its dysregulation may have influenced the poor prognosis of MCD.

Various methods have been used to detect AR-v7 in CRPC specimens, including next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. However, NGS technologies applied in clinical sequencing have focused on using blood or fresh-frozen CRPC tissue specimens. There is not yet an AR-v7 detection system tailored to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens commonly used for clinical sequencing in hospitals.<br \/>Methods: In this respect, we propose a novel approach to identify AR-v7 in targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data derived from FFPE specimens. This approach can identify, in addition to AR-v7, all constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) that are co-expressed with AR-v7. In short, our two-step approach first gathers soft-clipped or divided reads that are adjacent to the splicing sites of AR-Vs and then yields the number of splitting reads that support the existence of AR-Vs. Next, the algorithm selects the paired-end reads whose one side and the other side are mapped to the preceding and following exons, respectively. The final number of spanning reads are calculated following to the removal of low-quality reads.<br \/>Results: We validated the proposed approach using two large-scale, independent RNA-seq datasets of prostate cancer (PC) samples: 111 samples from Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and 558 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The majority of both datasets were localized PC tumors, especially in the SNUH dataset, where localized PC accounted for 91% of the total. Overall, our approach successfully identified samples with putative AR-Vs, including AR-v7, AR-v3, and AR-v9. Statistical analyses of 111 SNUH PC patients suggested potential detection threshold in clinical sequencing settings (at least 200 split reads). In the SNUH dataset, the AR-v7 positive group, which included 5 patients (5%) with values above the threshold, shared the following characteristics: higher AR-v7\/full length AR expression levels, AR amplification and co-expression with AR-v3\/AR-v9. AR-v7 positivity was experimentally validated by Sanger sequencing. The similar pattern was also found in the analysis of TCGA dataset.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the detection system can successfully identify AR-v7 positivity not only for metastatic PC but also for patients with localized PC through clinical sequencing. We expect that the further in-depth analyses including larger samples and clinical outcomes can discover clinical applicability of AR-v7.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Splice variants,Prostate cancer,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform classification of genetic variants, such as AlphaMissense, which incorporates structure-function relationships and allele frequencies across large datasets of genetic variants. While this represents a promising new tool, the performance of AlphaMissense has only been compared to known pathogenic and benign variants. Therefore, the discriminatory power for variants of unknown significance (VUS) has yet to be determined. We have performed a comparison of these predictions with variants associated with inherited myeloid neoplasms: 1) to assess the accuracy of these models against VUS; 2) to enhance classification of unpublished VUS by leveraging published information about other variants; and 3) to map the predicted classification onto protein structures to examine spatial patterns.<br \/>Methods: For 83 genes associated with inherited myeloid diseases, a systematic literature review for missense variants was performed using the Mastermind Genomic Intelligence Platform and ClinVar. We used Alphamissense to characterize VUS missense variants according to predicted pathogenicity scores as pathogenic, ambiguous, or benign. Known pathogenic (n=1594) and benign (n=501) variants served as controls to evaluate the accuracy of the system. AlphaFold2 structures were visualized for structure-function rendering of reclassified VUS and known pathogenic variants to compare and identify discernible patterns of spatial distribution.<br \/>Results: This variant dataset comprised 1594 pathogenic, 501 benign, and 46676 VUS missense variants. Among VUS, AlphaMissense reclassified a majority of VUS missense mutations and established that the system was 88% accurate in predicting pathogenicity. A higher percentage of variants was classified as pathogenic among tumor suppressor genes e.g. DDX41 and RUNX1 (57.1% and 40.5%) compared to the oncogenes, GATA1 and GATA2 (25.7% and 34.9%). Furthermore, 3D models revealed a majority of variants reclassified to pathogenic were located in regions with defined tertiary structure clustered with known pathogenic variants, while benign variants were located at peripheral positions lacking definite structure.<br \/>Conclusions: These results demonstrate the discriminatory power of AlphaMissense for VUS pathogenicity prediction for both loss-of-function and gain-of-function disease mechanisms. This work may also have implications for rare or challenging somatic cancer variants and variants in rare diseases. Finally, incorporating information available from empirical and clinical studies for disease-causing variants offers the possibility of significantly enhancing the predictive power of these models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Machine learning,Acute myeloid leukemia,RUNX1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Bulk expression data represent population averages and its interpretation is confounded by both normal cell contamination and somatic copy number alterations. Several computational methods to deconvolve have been developed recently. However, these methods often rely on a set of cell-type-specific reference signatures and ignore the effect of copy number changes. Methods: To address these issues, we have developed a method that formalizes the relationship between allele-specific copy number, expression and sample purity to deconvolve the expression profiles of tumor and normal cells from bulk RNA-seq in an unbiased manner. Our method was applied to sequencing data produced by the TRACERx consortium, a longitudinal study with multi-region whole-exome and RNA-seq of non-small-cell lung cancers. A total of 414 primary tumor regions and 140 adjacent normal tissue samples from 140 patients with matched DNA and RNA-seq data were processed.<br \/>Results: We were able to directly deconvolve a median of ~2,000 genes per sample and indirectly infer tumor and normal expression profiles of ~10,000 genes using an scaled and weighted mean approach. The accuracy of the deconvolution was validated using (1) <i>in-silico<\/i> mixtures of patient-derived tumor and normal cells, (2) pseudo-bulk scRNAseq and (3) in regions with loss of heterogeneity (LOH) directly on the bulk sequencing data, where the total fraction of expression attributed to tumor cells can be computed directly using somatic mutations. CREDAC allows for single sample bulk-level tumor-normal differential expression analysis and revealed a strong and constitutive genome-wide overexpression in cancer compared to admixed normal cells, with a more pronounced overexpression in lung squamous cell carcinoma than lung adenocarcinoma (p&#60;0.001). CREDAC adjusts for variations in copy number, thus facilitating the investigation of cancer-specific dosage compensatory responses triggered by aneuploidy. We revealed that a majority of genes (~65%) exhibit proportionality to copy number alterations, while a substantial proportion (~35%) shows anti-scaling or dosage compensation strategies. We show an enrichment of genes involved in cell cycle and expression processes within the dosage compensated group and revealed methylation as a key mechanism driving this compensatory process.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that CREDAC is able to accurately disentangle the expression of tumor and normal cells from bulk RNA-seq without any previous knowledge. It has potential applications in many studies that include matched RNA-seq and copy number data and can provide new insights functional characterization, the taxonomy of cancer, and tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Alpelisib is approved for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative BC patients with a PIK3CA mutation; however, not all PIK3CA-mutated (MUT), HR+ patients respond to alpelisib and others acquire resistance following exposure, suggesting adaptive mechanisms of PI3K activation. It has been proven that in TNBC, there exists a cohort of mutated genes which activate PI3K-AKT signaling. We hypothesize that testing alpelisib in combination with repurposed approved drugs, targeting alternative mechanisms of PI3K-AKT pathway activation, may be used to treat a cohort of TNBC patients. TNBC patient genetic data from the MSK (N=168), METABRIC (N=209), and TCGA (N=171) datasets were analyzed using cBioPortal to identify frequently occurring mutations. Differential expression analyses based on mutational status were performed on CCLE cell line (N=705) microarray and TCGA BC patient (N=981) RNA-sequencing data using R. Dysregulated genes were functionally analyzed using DAVID Ontology and those associated with poorer survival in TNBC were identified using KM-Plotter. STRING database was used to investigate protein interactions. The antiproliferative effects of targeted drugs tested alone and in combination in a panel of 6 TNBC cell lines were determined using acid phosphatase assays. Reverse-phase protein array analysis was carried out on protein lysates from cells following 24 hour treatment with drugs used alone and in combination.TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in TNBC and mutations were associated with significant genetic dysregulation. A comprehensive analysis of upregulated genes in TP53-MUT TNBC led to the identification of 5 potential therapeutic targets - MET, S100A9, LCN2, CA9, TACSTD2, and KLK5 - based on their association with poorer survival in TNBC, protein interactions with TP53 and PIK3CA, and availability of targeted drugs. MET was selected for <i>in vitro<\/i> analysis based on its strong correlation with PI3K-AKT signaling. The presence of a TP53 mutation was associated with decreased antiproliferative effects in TNBC cell lines treated with alpelisib. Treatment with alpelisib in combination with a MET inhibitor, crizotinib, demonstrated greater antiproliferative effects in TP53-MUT\/PIK3CA-MUT cell lines when compared to TP53 or PIK3CA MUT only models.TP53 mutations are associated with genetic dysregulation in TNBC and may confer resistance to alpelisib. Targeting upregulated proteins in a cohort of TP53-MUT\/PIK3CA-MUT patients may improve sensitivity to alpelisib via dual inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Protein analysis will uncover the mechanisms of synergy observed between alpelisib and crizotinib, and the therapeutic potential of the combination will be experimentally investigated <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PI3K,TP53,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Multiple molecular alteration occur during cancer initiation and disease progression and metastasis. Recent advances in technology led to generation of large amount of molecular data including transcriptome.

However, there is a need for the development user friendly tools for its analysis and dissemination of the large scale cancer molecular data. Earlier, we had developed and upgraded web based comprehensive proteogenomic platform UALCAN (ualcan.path.uab.edu), which allows users to analyze and integrate the disparate data to better understand the gene, proteins, and pathways perturbed in cancer and make discoveries. UALCAN web platform enables intuitive analysis and discovery by cancer research community. In the current study, we describe the development of UALCAN Mobile application (App) that will provide cancer transcriptomic data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, to evaluate protein-coding gene expression based on various stratification including stage, grade, race, gender and molecular-subtypes across over 30 types of cancers. The UALCAN Mobile app aims at providing large cancer dataset on the go. In order to find causative gene expression changes, identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets, UALCAN Mobile will assist as the data will be easily mobile and transportable with this App. Here, we describe the development of UALCAN Mobile and its utility to the cancer research community.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models facilitate preclinical drug testing in an in vivo environment that enables analysis of tumor growth and survival and molecular tumor profiling. These models, combined with single-cell profiling, can be used to study intratumoral heterogeneity under therapeutic pressure and the emergence of drug resistance. Here we investigate the abundance and conservation of ecDNA in PDX models with the aim of assessing the faithful representation of ecDNA compared to the tumors from which they are derived.<br \/>Methods: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied to 27 medulloblastoma (MB) PDX models and their tumors of origin using Amplicon Architect, a tool used to reconstruct focally amplified regions of DNA to provide insights into the landscape of cancer genomes. The frequency of ecDNA in these models was also compared to that of ecDNA in the MB patient population. Optical genome mapping enabled accurate and reliable ecDNA sequence reconstructions. Multiome single-cell RNA and ATAC-sequencing of a PDX tumor enabled analysis of ecDNA conservation and intratumoral heterogeneity compared to similar data previously obtained from the primary tumor.<br \/>Results: Comparative analyses revealed that ecDNA is largely conserved in PDX models, emphasizing their relevance as faithful models of the primary tumors. In addition, we find that ecDNA is significantly more frequent in MB PDX models (16 out of 27 analyzed patient-derived tumors) as compared to their frequency in the overall patient population (~18% of all medulloblastoma tumors contain ecDNA), suggesting ecDNA as a driver for successful establishment of MB PDX models. Single-cell analysis revealed that ecDNA is omnipresent in almost all PDX tumor cells, while its presence was limited to only ~9% of tumor cells in the primary tumor.<br \/>Conclusion: Analysis of ecDNA in medulloblastoma primary tumors and in PDX models revealed that ecDNA is preserved in PDX models. This is an important characteristic that renders patient-derived mouse xenografts as faithful models of their primary tumors. These results emphasize the relevance of PDX models for preclinical in vivo studies aimed at analyzing the role of ecDNA under therapeutic pressure and for analyzing clonal selection along with molecular evolution of ecDNA during the development of therapeutic resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Many patients with PC are diagnosed with metastatic or locally advanced tumors, limiting surgical resection, and increasing the risk of relapse after treatment. Relapse is recorded to be as high as 75% in the first 2 years after clinical intervention, resulting in a mean 5-year survival of 12% in the US, and as low as 2% worldwide. It is vital to develop diagnostic and monitoring techniques for PC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are robustly expressed in patient tumors and provide a rich source of biomarkers for disease detection and status. miRNA are short nucleic acid strands that bind to catalytic proteins to guide the regulation of large RNAs within the cellular space. This system is altered in tumors, leading to abhorrent expression of miRNA. Due to significant advancements in sequencing technology, miRNA-seq has become more accurate and affordable in detecting profile changes. To identify biomarkers for PC progression, we developed from the Gemcitabine-sensitive MIA-PaCa-2 (MP2) cell line the Gemcitabine and FOLFIRINOX resistant MP2-GR cell line. MiRNA-seq was conducted on the parental MP2 and resistant MP2-GR cells to identify those miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the cell lines. These miRNAs were analyzed via pathway analysis and gene ontology to find predicted functions followed by annotations from the miRNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation tool (miEAA) to identify differentially expressed miRNAs associated with PC progression. This comparison indicated several miRNAs related to PC resistance. This dataset was then compared to <i>The Cancer Genome Atlas <\/i>(TCGA), which contains data from over 300 PC patients. The miRNA set was used to predict both PC progression after treatment, and recurrence. We are currently refining this data set to increase its predictive sensitivity and widen our patient data set comparison to further elucidate this approach in a clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Biomarkers,Pancreatic cancer,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, the exact mechanism by which platelets preferentially extravasate into tumor microenvironment is unknown, partly owing to lack of effective tools that can accurately segment and measure platelet counts found in tumor tissues. In this study, we developed a high-resolution digital pathology (DP) platform with whole tissue confocal imaging and deep learning model that can be used to automatically segment out platelets and blood vessels to perform spatial statistics (SA) of platelets with high precision and consistency. We utilized our SADP platform to study an interaction between tumor secreted SDF-1 and CXCR4 on platelets which initiates platelet chemotaxis towards tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: A deep learning algorithm to accurately segment out platelets was developed based on the U-Net structure using our original datasets from the murine ovarian cancer model. Tumor-bearing mice were injected with 5 mg\/kg of Plerixafor, a CXCR4 inhibitor, daily for 4 weeks. Then, tumor nodules were resected, stained with CD41a and CD31 antibodies, and imaged using a whole slide confocal microscopy. We performed manual annotation of these images to generate the mask dataset and performed further data augmentation to increase the diversity of datasets. We trained our model using 85% of these images and performed validation using the remaining 15%.<br \/>Results: Using our SADP platform, the validation dataset achieved pixel-wise accuracy of 98.8%. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99 with high sensitivity and specificity. Intersection over union (IoU) score of 0.765 was obtained. A statistically significant (p=0.0467), 7.03% reduction in the platelet density was shown in the Plerixafor-treated mouse ovarian tumor tissues (n=8) compared to the control tumor tissues (n=9). We also found that platelets are spatially concentrated near blood vessels in the control tumor tissues compared to the Plerixafor-treated tumor tissues (p=0.0377).<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a SADP platform to segment and quantitate tens of thousands of platelets from whole slide mouse ovarian cancer tissues automatically with high accuracy and consistency and incorporated spatial statistics to understand their spatial relationships and patterns that would not be apparent in non-spatial analyses. Applying the SADP platform, we demonstrated that treatment with Plerixafor leads to overall reduction in platelet infiltration within ovarian murine tumors. Our ongoing effort is to utilize our SADP platform on human tumor tissue images from a whole slide digital scanner to further characterize spatial distribution of platelets as a potential prognostic marker for ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Image analysis,Bioinformatics,CXCR4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Oncogenic drivers, including PTPN11\/Shp2, Ikk&#946; kinase (IKK), c-Met and &#946;-catenin, as well as tumor microenvironment as illustrated by a carcinogen or diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated models, have combined contribution to cancer progression that have distinct prevalence in human HCC progression. We previously found that disruption of Ras\/Erk by Shp2 deletion combined with deletion of NF-&#954;B unexpectedly dysregulated circadian clock genes which leads to further cancer progression. Except for this, limited reports investigated how various other oncogenic genes aberration would incorporate with DEN to induce HCC. Further, no reports investigated the dynamic evolution of transcriptomic aberration incorporating genetic changes and the differential functional pathways involved in DEN plus oncogene triggered-HCC progression. Thus, we here sought to investigate the context-dependent contribution of PTPN11\/Shp2, IKK, c-Met and &#946;-catenin to HCC using hepatocyte-specific deletion models (SKO, IKO, MKO, BKO) combined with DEN treatment. Exome sequencing and RNAseq were used to identify dynamic changes of the genomic and transcriptomic variations of HCC development under the influence of both genetic deletion and DEN-treatment. We found that upregulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer metastasis\/migration and downregulated fatty-acid and cholesterol metabolism were highly involved across models. Macrophages together with genes including <i>Spi1<\/i>, <i>Clec7a<\/i>, and microRNA networks including <i>miR-122<\/i> and <i>miR-155<\/i> etc. were also deregulated. Specifically, upregulated IL2-STAT5 signaling in DEN-SKO liver tissues, upregulated myogenesis, KRAS signaling and EMT as well as apoptosis in DEN-MKO, downregulated xenobiotic metabolism and bile acid metabolism in DEN-IKO and -BKO were identified to be distinct to oncogenic deletion in relation with HCC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Carcinogenesis,Liver cancer,Carcinogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

However, formalin induced artificial mutations make it challenging to accurately analyze next-generation sequencing data. Existing FFPE filtering tools tend to categorize all low-frequency variants as artifacts, making it difficult to identify true variants with low allele frequencies, compromising analysis of tumors with low tumor cell content. To address this issue, we developed DEEPOMICS<sup> <\/sup>FFPE, an AI model designed to distinguish true variants from artifacts. We gathered paired exome genome sequencing data from both fresh frozen and FFPE samples of 24 tumors from public sources. These data were used to train and validate the model, with a split of 70% for training and 30% for validation. The deep neural network model, comprising three hidden layers, was trained using input features derived from the outputs of the MuTect2 caller. We employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations algorithm to identify relevant features, and then fine-tuned them based on the training outcomes. We assessed the performance of the final DEEPOMICS FFPE model in comparison to existing models (MuTect filter, FFPolish, and SOBDetector) using well-defined test datasets. Our findings revealed 43 distinguishing characteristics for FFPE artifacts. Refining the quantification of these characteristics resulted in improved model performance. DEEPOMICS FFPE successfully filtered out 99.6% of artifacts while retaining 85.2% of true variants, achieving an F1-score of 87.8 in the validation dataset, surpassing the performance of existing tools. Furthermore, the model demonstrated consistent performance even for variants with low allele frequencies, exhibiting a specificity of 0.998, suggesting its capability to identify subclonal variants. Future enhancement of the model will include the ability to use other variant callers and analysis of whole genome sequencing data. This newly developed tool has potential applications in designing capture panels for personalized circulating tumor DNA assays and identifying candidate neoepitopes for personalized vaccine development.

Meanwhile, the incidence of thyroid cancer ranks first in Korea. To assess the possible influence of ethnicity on the molecular profile of thyroid cancer, we compared the genomic features of South Korean thyroid cancer with European thyroid cancer. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing profiling (WGS) for 459 Korean thyroid cancer patients, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC, n = 274), noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP, n =18), follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC, n = 16), follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA, n = 63), H&#252;rthle cell adenoma (HCA, n = 22), and invasive encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (IEFVPTC, n = 19). We assessed the single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertions and deletions using Mutect2, Varscan2, and Strelka2. For mutation signature and copy number alterations analysis, we used the Maftools and GISTIC2.0 packages, respectively. Our results revealed that most somatic mutations were similar between the Korean thyroid cancer dataset and the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA). However, the Korean cohort (1%) had a much lower NRAS mutation frequency than the TCGA cohort (8%). Mutation signature analysis showed that SBS6 and SBS2 were highly associated with the TCGA and Korean cohort. SBS6 is related to defective DNA mismatch repair, and SBS2 is characterized predominantly by CC &#62; TT doublet base substitutions. In addition, we identified the NIFTP-specific somatic mutations such as KEAP1 and ZFP36L2.

It has been observed that the presence of CHIP can have significant implications for the development and prognosis of various blood cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer involving the abnormal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, is one such condition. Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles, play a role in cell communication by carrying information between cells. Analysis of UK Biobank data confirmed the poor prognosis of multiple myeloma patients with CHIP and identified a potential of paracrine effect on plasma cancer cells. To gain deeper insights into this paracrine effect on plasma cells, we attempted to analyze cell-to-cell interaction, such as the expression of miRNAs in exosomes, through exosome RNA sequencing. In our research, exosomes were extracted from bone marrow samples of 30 multiple myeloma patients, and exosome RNA sequencing was performed. Differential expression of miRNAs was identified. A total of 14 down-regulated miRNAs were identified based on adjusted <i>p<\/i> value &#60; 0.05, log2 fold change &#60; -1. We found that hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, and hsa-miR-148a-3p, which are mainly miRNAs targeting MAP kinase, were significantly down-regulated in the CHIP cases. A computational tool was used to predict and integrate the target genes and pathways regulated by these DE miRNAs. The results suggested that certain inflammatory and oncogenic pathways including the MAPK signaling pathways, were not effectively suppressed in cases with CHIP (KEGG, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.005). In addition, the chemokine signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (KEGG, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.005) related to the paracrine effect, integrins in angiogenesis (PID, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.005) related to poor prognosis and metastasis of cancer were also not adequately inhibited in the CHIP cases. Using UK Biobank data, we called somatic CHIP variants excluding those with VAF &#60; 0.02 and analyzed them against ICD-10 codes. Hazard ratios (HR) were computed through Cox proportional regression with covariates. CHIP presence significantly correlated with MM diagnosis (HR: 1.64, CI: 1.35-2, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001), notably in <i>TET2<\/i> mutation carriers (HR: 2.35, CI: 1.63-3.4, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). <i>TET2<\/i> mutations intensified MGUS to MM progression (HR: 5.0, CI: 2.27-11.0, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001). CHIP in MM impacted EFS (HR: 1.61, CI: 1.25-2.1, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.001), with TET2 mutation carriers facing higher hazards (HR: 1.66, CI: 1.05-2.6, <i>p<\/i> = 0.031). CHIP, especially <i>TET2<\/i> mutations, significantly contribute to adverse MM outcomes and MGUS to MM evolution.

The immune response against NSCLC relies significantly on the vital role by CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, contributing to the regulation of immune system and the suppression of tumor growth. Various CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell subtypes, such as T conventional cells (T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells) and T regulatory cells (T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells), perform distinct functions within the immune system. T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells boost immune responses against specific pathogens, while T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells play a role in suppressing immune reactions. Investigating the correlation between T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells and T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells in NSCLC could serve a valuable biomarker for evaluating the immune status of lung cancer patients. We examine the connection between particular CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the lung and specific gene expressions associated with NSCLC. Through single-cell analysis, we classified the proportions of T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells and T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells within CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in both the lungs and spleen of mice. Our discovery revealed that the proportion of T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells in the lungs exceeded that in the spleen. From the differential gene expression (DEG) analysis using RNA-Seq data for T<sub>reg<\/sub><sub> <\/sub>cells and T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells in NSCLC, compared to the control group of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PMBC), we identified 1823 genes uniquely expressed in NSCLC T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells and 711 genes in T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells. Within these genes, we verified the expression of IL2RA and CTLA4, known to be expressed in NSCLC. Additionally, we identified high expression of genes TM4SF1 and KRT6A. By comparing the genes specific to T<sub>conv<\/sub> and T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells in the lungs with those significantly expressed in NSCLC, we were able to identify 114 co-expressed genes in T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells and 71 in T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells. We conducted GO and KEGG pathway analyses on these genes and examined the interaction networks among the associated genes. Furthermore, we found receptor interactions between T<sub>conv<\/sub> cell subtypes (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh) and T<sub>reg<\/sub> cells through cell-cell interaction analysis. We explored the mouse phenotypes associated with these genes. These discoveries unveiled connections within lung-specific gene networks of T<sub>reg<\/sub> and T<sub>conv<\/sub> cells associated with NSCLC, highlighting candidate genes for targeted therapy in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Regulatory T cells,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyunmin Woo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, JiHye Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Siyoung Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Seong-il Eyun<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d12ca585-a6c3-4d9f-b154-d5681d958857","ControlNumber":"2892","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) genes are present in most lower-grade gliomas and less frequent in high-grade gliomas. The reprogramming of energy metabolism marks cancer to support rapid tumor growth and tumor survival. The remodeling of the epigenome in gliomas with and without IDH1\/2 mutations is associated with changes in the energy metabolism, which has implications for the evolution of the tumor and for patient outcomes. Comprehending the metabolic reprogramming of different subtypes of gliomas is crucial to understanding tumor development and for the identification of better treatment targets. In this research, we explored the cell-to-cell metabolic variability using public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data of IDH wild-type (IDHwt) and IDH-mutant (IDHmut) gliomas. We analyzed 13,000+ single cells from four datasets [IDHwt (n=7,930), IDHmut codel (n=3,304), IDHmut non-codel (n=6,333), and IDHwt\/K27M mutant (n=4,084)]. Data was processed using Seurat. CopyKat was used to distinguish malignant from non-malignant cells. Known marker genes were used to identify normal cell populations (macrophages, T cells, oligodendrocytes). Finally, ssGSEA was used to create a score of activity of 70 important metabolic pathways extracted from KEGG, for each individual cell. Our exploratory analysis revealed a metabolic heterogeneity among malignant cells even within the same patient. Steroid biosynthesis and valine\/leucine\/isoleucine biosynthesis are the top contributors to metabolic heterogeneity. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid metabolism (FA), and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) are among the highest metabolic activities. Comparing the distinct glioma subtypes, IDHmut codel showed the lowest OXPHOS, TCA, and glycolysis\/gluconeogenesis (GLYCO) activities, suggesting a potential link between low metabolic activity and better prognosis. Comparing astrocytomas IDHmut and IDHwt we observed lower TCA, GLYCO, and FA activities in mutant tumors. Overall, malignant cells showed higher metabolic activity than non-malignant cells of the same tumor. The metabolic microenvironment of IDHmut differed the most compared to the other subtypes. Immune and normal cells could also be distinguished by their metabolic features. We observed subpopulations of T cells and macrophages presenting distinct metabolic activity which may reflect distinct immune activation stages. Collectively, we covered the heterogeneity in energy metabolism of gliomas with potential prognostic value. Understanding the metabolic status of cells in the tumor microenvironment could shed light on intratumoral heterogeneity and aid in identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Glioma,Single cell,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

Previous studies have elucidated the mechanisms and structures of HPV-human fusion events, pinpointing potential integration &#8220;hotspots&#8221; (i.e. genes with nearby HPV integration in recurrent patients). However, none has comprehensively investigated the effects of HPV integration on both HPV and human gene expression, nor assessed the clinical implications of these bidirectional expression changes.<br \/>In this study, we conducted bulk RNA sequencing on 67 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) tumor samples from the University of Michigan hospital, and analyzed them in conjunction with bulk and single cell RNA-seq from another &#62;200 HPV(+) HNSCC patients from four previous studies. Among the 117 samples confidently identified as HPV integration positive, we recaptured all previously known integration &#8220;hotspot&#8221; genes as well as several novel ones that have altered expression in the integrated samples.<br \/>Exploring the impact of HPV integration on the expression of human and HPV genes, we found that HPV integration in HNSCC is strongly associated with keratinization, immune response, and the development of HPV(+) HNSCC subtypes. Upon HPV integration, expression of non-oncogenic HPV genes is often lost. We hypothesized that the expression ratio of these potentially HPV immunogenic genes (E1-E5, L1,L2) to the HPV oncogenic genes E6 and E7 (termed the ImmunOnco Score) would predict clinical outcomes. Survival analysis of 70 University of Michigan patients showed low ImmunOnco Score is associated with tumor recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Integration,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Identifying patients who are likely to respond to ICT remains an ongoing challenge. In addition, only a portion of patients with clinical biomarkers respond to therapy. Signatures of RNA expression have been developed to predict response, the majority of which focus on T-cell and cytotoxicity markers, yet have been unable to substantially improve outcome predictions. Here, we present a RNA signature that instead describes tumor-intrinsic immune resistance and a potential mechanism of immunosuppression via tumor signaling on macrophages, derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).<br \/>Methods: We performed dimensionality reduction using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on 30 scRNA-seq samples from 15 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, comprising a total of 183,873 cells from the Cell Ranger pipeline. The VAE model was trained on each sample for 250 iterations, yielding 20 signatures from each patient, for a total of 300 signatures. The relationship of each signature with real-world overall survival (rwOS) across 1,983 bulk RNA-sequenced LUAD patients treated with an FDA approved ICT was assessed via a Cox proportional hazards model with risk set adjustment, using TMB and line of therapy as covariates. The NATMI python package was used to identify putative active ligand-receptor interactions between tumor cells and the immune environment.<br \/>Results: Among the VAE encodings, we identified an immune resistance signature significantly associated with decreased rwOS across the patient cohort (HR = 4.2 [2.8-6.3], adjusted p = 4.3e-10). This signature was derived from a small cluster of neoplastic cells (4.4% of cells) in a patient sample that was otherwise dominated by immune cells, including a substantial fraction of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (24.5%). The strongest predicted ligand-receptor interactions were found between the neoplastic cells and macrophages, via the MIF-CD74 interaction, an interaction we found upregulated in multiple single-cell tumor samples. Further, MIF RNA expression alone was significantly associated with rwOS across the 1,983 patient LUAD cohort (HR = 1.5 [1.1-2.1], p = 0.004).<br \/>Discussion: MIF-CD74 is a known immunosuppressive interaction and MIF signaling from tumor cells on macrophages has been previously shown to have immunosuppressive effects in a mouse model of melanoma that were largely reversible via MIF-CD74 blockade. Taken together, these results identify a signature of tumor intrinsic immune suppression that can indicate patients likely to experience reduced benefit from ICT. In addition, this signature provides evidence to support blockade of the MIF-CD74 axis as a means to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in LUAD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Single cell,Lung adenocarcinoma,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, only a small fraction of patients receives benefits whereas a significant subset of patients experienced severe or even lethal autoimmune diseases. Stratifying patients that would benefit from immunotherapy remain a highly unmet clinical need. Dysregulations of transcriptional programs have been implicated in cancer initiation and progression. To date, there is a paucity of studies on the predictive values of transcriptional factors on ICB response based on the most recently emerged ICB clinical trial datasets. We reasoned that cancer cells may hijack key transcriptional programs in hematological cells to evade the attack from immune cells and acquired tolerance to immunotherapy.<br \/>Method: Herein, we used an R package singscore\/1.14.0 to compute the TFs activity scores based on their validated gene targets (TGs). Leveraging melanoma clinical trial datasets, we analyzed the predictive association of the TF scores with resistance to anti-PD1 ICB. The R package, iGenSig was used to evaluate the potential confounding variables.<br \/>Results: Our landscape correlation analysis revealed NFATC2 (Nuclear Factor Of Activated T Cells 2)-TGs as the most significant predictor of anti-PD-1 ICB resistance in melanoma. NFATCT-TGS as a predictor of anti-PD1 resistance is confounded by liver metastasis and achieved AUC range between 0.71 to 0.74 in three datasets (PRJEB23709, GSE160638, and Phs000452). In addition, prior anti-CTLA4 exposure (AUC=0.87 and 0.89) is associated with higher predictive efficacy of NFATC2-TGS than anti-CTLA4 na&#239;ve tumor (AUC=0.61 and 0.69) in phs000452 and GSE91061 datasets. Survival analysis revealed that NFATC2 is a better predictor of progressive-free survival (PFS; HR=5.95), and overall survival (OS; HR= 3.28-3.38) in anti-CTLA4 exposed tumor than anti-CTLA4 na&#239;ve tumor (PFS: HR=1.92, and OS; HR=1.64-2.17). Finally, NFATC2-TGS show strong inhibitory correlation with B cells and T cells infiltration, but strongly correlated with tumor purity.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate that NFATC2 TGS predicts ICB benefits in melanoma patients, and thus may guide the recruitment of melanoma patients for anti-PD1 ICB.

However, this necessitates reliable and comprehensive profiling of samples at the single cell level and requires whole genome amplification (WGA), which adds amplification errors and bias to common sequencing errors. Therefore, we established a single-cell mutation calling workflow that can identify clinically actionable somatic mutations in rare single cell DNA with high sensitivity and accuracy. Our workflow is an end-to-end solution which can take FASTQ reads from any Panel Sequencing (PanelSeq) data and gives out single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion-deletions (InDels), and copy number variations (CNVs) in single cells alongside with mutation specific information from ClinVar, OncoKB, pathogenicity scores, conservations scores as well as known association to drug response and resistance. We incorporated a Bayesian Neural Network (NN) based Classifier algorithm that assigns a single statistical confidence score to the mutations, enabling prioritization of the mutations in a robust manner. On the training dataset including MDA-MB-453, BT474, BT549 and ZR-75.1 cell lines, the classifier achieved 91% sensitivity and 96% specificity (AUC=0.98), while on the independent test collective including HCC1395\/HCC1395BL cell lines it achieved 84% sensitivity and 96% specificity (AUC=0.90). We applied the workflow to patient samples suffering from advanced metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) assayed with in-house single-cell Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (scIMPACT) and single-cell Whole Exome Sequencing (scWES). Using our method, we detected clinically actionable SNVs with pathogenic relevance in primary tumor, metastatic specimens, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood and disseminated cancer cells (DCC) from pleural effusions, as well as the matched CTC-derived <i>in vivo<\/i> models (CDX). Notably, functional <i>in vitro<\/i> drug screens performed on CDX models uncovered susceptibility to approved drug treatments conferred by mutations detected in the samples. In summary, we introduce a novel mutation calling workflow facilitating detection of SNVs, Indels and CNVs in rare single cells with high sensitivity and precision. Confident scores assigned by the NN classifier enables identification of functionally actionable mutations.

Traditionally, a median approach to normalization has been used, but this could obscure meaningful biological differences between tissues. Here, we present a quantitative proteomic study analyzing proteome composition across tumor and normal tissues in order to assess normalization methods. Human proteomes covering 7 cancer indications (244 samples) and 12 normal tissue organs (370 samples) were analyzed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. On average, over 8,000 proteins were quantified across the study cohorts. Comparison of proteomes revealed an average of 11.4% higher protein identification in tumors compared to matched normal tissues (6 tumor types all p&#60;0.003). Tissue origin strongly influenced proteome composition, most notably in bone marrow, while cancer tissues displayed less proteomic composition variation than normal tissues. Compared to global median normalization, riBAQ and tissue-specific quantile normalization reduced technical variances while maintaining biological differences between tissue types. By revealing tissue-specific proteome signatures as well as systemic proteomic alterations in tumors, this study lays the groundwork for appropriate comparative approaches accounting for tissue origins, and establishes a framework for discovery of tissue-specific biomarkers, which may facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic tests, and guide therapeutic interventions for cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Bioinformatics,Mass spectrometry,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Understanding a tumor's evolutionary path is crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies based on its genomic profile. We developed a method that estimates tumor 'fitness' (w) by analyzing the time of every clonal sweep. This is quantified by driver copy number or point mutations through analytical solutions derived from the branching process of tumor evolution. The method incorporates tumor size and growth rate, assessed through <i>in-vivo<\/i> BrdU staining, to determine the tumor's age, diversity, and aggressiveness. Using our method in the Yates et al. 2015 multi-region study, we analyzed 303 breast cancer tumors from 45 patients using whole-genome and exome sequencing (WES), focusing on ER+ (N=26) and ER- (N=19) subtypes. A negative correlation was observed between clonal cytoband alterations and fitness (ER+, R=-0.41; <i>P<\/i>=0.04; ER-, R=-0.72; <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Expanding the analysis with the METABRIC study (Curtis et al. 2012), clonal cytoband alterations (CA) were linked to survival outcomes for both ER+ and ER- subtypes. Additionally, in the TRACERx NSCLC study (Jamal-Hanjani et al. 2017) of 327 tumors from 100 patients who underwent WES, the median tumor fitness was associated with a higher risk of recurrence or death. Survival analyses are detailed in Table 1 below. Multivariate analysis was adjusted for tumor size, nodal status, and CD8&#945; expression in the breast cancer study, and according to the authors' methodology in the TRACERx study, respectively.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{974A5CFC-948F-4A26-A008-C0400CA619A2}\"><caption>Table 1 Survival Analysis<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Study and Endpoint<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Parameter<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Univariate HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Multivariate HR (95% CI)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">METABRIC: ER- (N=128) on RFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CA &gt; 3 (Ref: CA &#8804; 3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.61 (0.40, 0.93), <i>P<\/i>=0.02<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.49 (0.32, 0.75), <i>P<\/i>&lt;0.001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">METABRIC: ER- (N=128) on OS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CA &gt; 3 (Ref: CA &#8804; 3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.68 (0.47, 1), <i>P<\/i>=0.05<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.60 (0.4, 0.88), <i>P<\/i>=0.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">METABRIC: ER+ (N=458) on RFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CA &gt; 3 (Ref: CA &#8804; 3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.61 (1.33, 1.94), <i>P<\/i>&lt;0.001<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.51 (1.25, 1.82), <i>P<\/i>&lt;0.001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">METABRIC: ER+ (N=458) on OS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CA &gt; 3 (Ref: CA &#8804;3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.44 (1.23, 1.68), <i>P<\/i>&lt;0.001<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.38 (1.18, 1.61), <i>P<\/i>&lt;0.001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TRACERx NSCLC (N=43) on RFS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Med. w &gt; 1.031 (Ref: w &#8804; 1.031)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.24 (1.38, 7.62),<i>P<\/i>=0.007<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.11 (1.12, 15.1), <i>P<\/i>=0.033<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>The observed tumor growth rates in both studies align with known doubling times, demonstrating our method's accuracy.
