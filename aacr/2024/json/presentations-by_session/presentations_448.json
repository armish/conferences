[{"Abstract":"The adhesion G-protein coupled- receptor 1 ADGRB1\/Bai1 was identified as a phosphatidylserine receptor that cooperates with ELMO\/Dock180\/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. This function of Bai1 was also shown to promote myoblasts fusion. Cell-cell fusion has been demonstrated to occur in normal physiological functions as well as in diseases. Studies have shown in cancer that cell-cell fusion increases tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and metastasis as hybrids acquire new properties that allow them to migrate and proliferate at new sites. Activation of ELMO-Dock signaling pathway has been associated with breast cancer metastasis. Moreover, ELMO1 has been identified as a modifier of breast cancer risk for BRCA mutation carriers. Rac1 was also shown to be overexpressed in proliferative breast disease, preinvasive and invasive breast carcinoma as well as lymph node metastases. Our recent studies showed that breast cancer cell fusion with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was modulated by hypoxic conditions and promoted by apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that hypoxia stress induced apoptosis activates the phosphatidylserine receptor Bai1, and it signals through the ELMO\/DOCK180\/Rac to promote breast cancer cell fusion-driven tumor heterogeneity and metastasis. In this study, we determined the ability of Bai1 depleted breast cancer cells to induce tumor growth in immunocompromised mice. We used Bai1 sgRNA to inhibit Bai1 expression in the breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231. These cells (1x 10<sup>6<\/sup>) together with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (1x 10<sup>6<\/sup>) were injected into the fat pad of the breast of 15 NOD SCID female mice. Control mice (15) received the same cells with no inhibition of Bai1. The mice were monitored for eight weeks. We found that Bai1 inhibition significantly reduced tumor growth in these mice in the course of time (P&#60;0.05). The average tumor weight was also significantly reduced when Bai1 was inhibited (P&#60;0.001). RNA sequencing of tumors generated from these mice revealed a significant increase in the expression of genes driving ferroptosis and a reduction in critical oncogenes in the experiment group compared to the control group. These findings will be helpful in the development of new classes of drugs effective in breast cancer treatment. <b>Grant Support<\/b> The NIH\/ NIMHD grant 5U54MD015929-03, the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) Freinkel Diversity Fellowship, and NSF Award Notice for Award ID 2142465 (awarded to FNK).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Xenografts,Metastasis,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Aging further amplifies susceptibility to lung cancer, contributing to elevated incidence rates among Veterans compared to non-Veterans. Our studies aim to elucidate the intricate relationship between aging, smoking, and mutation-driven clonal expansions in lung tissue, examining their impact on lung function and cancer evolution. Using cell culture and mouse models, we introduce mutations identified in human lung tissue into airway epithelial cells. Using CRISPR, base editing, and genetically engineered mouse models, we assess the effects on barrier function, cell differentiation, and gene expression. Ultimately, we are investigating the interaction between induced mutations, aging, and smoking, exploring how mutation-driven clonal expansions contribute to lung dysfunction and pre-malignant phenotypes, potentially forming a feedforward loop. This research addresses critical gaps in understanding the complex interplay of aging, smoking, and mutation-driven clonal expansions in lung cancer evolution.

Our research links chromosomal missegregation, their containment in micronuclei, and subsequent rupture of the micronuclear envelope to histone post-translational modification aberrations. This relationship was across all tested human and murine cancer cell lines, as well as non-transformed cells. Furthermore, we discovered that the observed changes in histone PTMs were caused by either micronuclear rupture or the persistence of histone PTM status during cell division. Moreover, we revealed substantial chromatin accessibility differences in micronuclei. Notably, there is a distinct bias in chromatin accessibility between promoter regions compared to distal and intergenic regions of the genome, which aligned well with observed changes in histone modifications. The induction of chromosomal instability leads to widespread, heterogeneous, and heritable abnormalities in the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells. Therefore, on top of genomic copy number changes, chromosomal instability causes epigenetic reprogramming, which adds another layer to cancer heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Histone modification,Heterogeneity,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Albert S.

Lineage plasticity has emerged as a source of intratumoral heterogeneity and drug resistance, resulting in poor prognosis and treatment failure. The molecular mechanisms driving lung cancer plasticity remain unclear. Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 13 (USP13), a deubiquitinating enzyme, is one of the most amplified genes in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We developed a USP13 knock-in overexpressing mouse model in <i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup><\/i><sup>\/+<\/sup>; <i>Trp53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>(KP) background (KPU mice). USP13 overexpression resulted in aggressive tumorigenesis and a shortened survival in <i>Kras<\/i>\/<i>Trp53<\/i>-driven lung cancer. Notably, while KP mice developed lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KPU mice developed LUSC and LUAD. LUSC in KPU mice faithfully recapitulated the key pathohistological, molecular features, and cellular pathways of human LUSC. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis showed that KPU tumors were heterogeneous and enriched in lineage reprogramming pathways including basal cell signaling, stem cell pluripotency, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using cell-type-restricted adenoviral Cre to target cells expressing surfactant protein C (SPC) or club cell antigen 10 (CC10), we identified bronchiolar secretory club cells as the predominant cell origin of LUSC. USP13 altered the levels of lineage transcription factors such as TTF-1 and SOX2 in club cells during early tumorigenesis. Altered expression of these factors reinforced the fate of CC10+ club cells to squamous carcinoma development rather than adenocarcinoma. In addition, USP13 directly acted on the K48-linked ubiquitination of c-Myc and increased its protein stability, contributing to the elevation of squamous gene expression (SOX2, CK5, P40) in the primary mouse and advanced human lung cancer cells. These results suggest that USP13 promotes lineage plasticity in club cells during the early stage of cancer development and drives reprogramming into LUSC. We also found a potential functional association between USP13 and EMT pathway. Notably, irrespective of cell origin, USP13 overexpression enhanced EMT marker expression including N-cadherin, SNAI1, and ZEB1 in lung cancer cells, promoting cell migration and invasion. USP13 increased tumorigenic and metastatic abilities of lung cancer cells in 3D organoid culture and syngeneic mouse models. Collectively, our research highlights the pivotal significance of USP13 in unleashing lineage plasticity during lung cancer progression, suggesting the potential role of deubiquitinase enzymes in regulating lineage plasticity, which may lead to novel therapeutics for treating lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,USP13,Heterogeneity,Lineage plasticity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Juntae Kwon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jinmin Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Boram Mok<sup>1<\/sup>, Samuel Allsup<sup>2<\/sup>, Cecil Han<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a025228-d97d-461c-9c46-2d93df670b8d","ControlNumber":"2960","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

A major obstacle to the development of effective therapies which prevent resistance is our lack of understanding of the relevant fundamental molecular adaptive processes. Here we report the discovery that tumor cells rely upon sublethal engagement of apoptotic death machinery and apoptotic DNase DFFB to acquire resistance to targeted therapies in multiple tumor types in cell culture and in vivo. We found that while DFFB wild type tumor cells readily acquire resistance to targeted therapies by escaping from the quiescent &#8220;persister&#8221; state into proliferating resistant cells, persister cells lacking functional DFFB remain indefinitely in a quiescent state on treatment. Mechanistically, we found that DFFB, which is activated by apoptotic caspases in surviving cancer persister cells, induces persistent DNA damage which promotes resistance through acquired mutations and nongenetic resistance through suppression of growth-arresting interferon signaling. During drug treatment acute interferon induction arises from sublethal mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic exposure of mitochondrial nucleic acids which activate pattern recognition receptors. However, during longer treatments we found that DFFB knockout persister cells exhibit strikingly elevated levels of STAT1 and STAT2 and interferon stimulated gene sets. This interferon signaling is growth arresting because treatment of DFFB knockout persister cells with a JAK1\/2 inhibitor rescues their ability to regrow. Furthermore, in DFFB wild type persister cells we found that DFFB-dependent DNA damage activates stress response transcription factor ATF3 which blocks the transcriptional activation of interferon stimulated genes following initial interferon induction. This is consistent with prior data in other contexts demonstrating that ATF3 is induced by DNA damage and that ATF3 directly binds to promoters of multiple interferon genes repressing their expression. These findings reveal that DFFB activation in persister cells prevents chronic interferon signaling and enables escape into proliferating drug resistant tumor cells. Therefore, DFFB-mediated interferon suppression represents a novel mechanism that is fundamental to acquired drug resistance. In addition, high expression of DFFB and ATF3 correlates with worse overall survival in a pan-cancer analysis and DFFB knockout mice develop normally indicating DFFB is a nonessential gene in normal tissue. Therefore, we propose that DFFB is a promising therapeutic target to prevent acquired resistance to targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Interferons,DNA damage,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

RCC tissues are metabolically dysfunctional, often resulting from loss of von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) and consequent upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1\/2). HIF1a is a transcription factor that upregulates glycolytic gene expression. Current therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have shown improvements in the outcomes of RCC patients, however, there are no biomarkers clinically available to predict the efficacy of these drugs. While genomic data and transcriptomic signatures have been investigated, they are not used in clinical practice due to lack of prospective validation. Understanding additional pathways pertaining to metabolic features of RCC, is critical. Our bulk gene expression analysis of primary RCC samples from TCGA-KIRC show a predominance of genes expressing mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and electron transport chain in tumors that relapsed early after nephrectomy, warranting further validation.<br \/>Aim: We aim to investigate changes in metabolic adaptation in RCC cells from kidney cancer cell lines (VHL mutant) and primary cells from human-matched primary and metastatic kidney cancer sites. Using a novel biosensor-based technique developed in the Albeck lab, we aim to identify the dependence of live RCC cells on specific metabolic pathways and test the effect of standard-of-care (SOC) pathway inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase, HIF pathway, metabolic pathway inhibitors impacting tumorigenicity.<br \/>Methods: To examine functional metabolic behavior in single cells, we generated immortalized cell lines (MCF10A, 184A1, FL83B and HBE-1) stably transfected with biosensors for the activity of AKT, glycolysis, mTOR and AMPK pathway. Data from Live-cells treated with metabolic inhibitors were collected and analyzed using our MATLAB-based pipeline. We have extended the analysis to RCC cell lines (786-O cell lines) and primary cells collected from nephrectomy specimens and matched metastatic biopsy samples, using current SOC pathway inhibitors (including sorafenib, sunitinib, belzutifan) and investigational metabolic drugs (metformin, IACS-010759, niclosamide).<br \/>Results &#38; Conclusion: Our preliminary results show an association of high OX-PHOS with primary tumors from early relapse after nephrectomy than the relapsed late tumors. Our biosensor single cell data show that even genetically homogeneous cell populations can vary in their usage of OXPHOS and glycolysis to supply ATP for cell growth. Tumor gene expression profile coupled with biosensor data, will address mechanism behind this metabolic shift in RCC tumors in primary cells isolated from primary and metastatic sites.

We have previously shown that tumor heterogeneity - including metabolic, transcriptional and mutational - underlies non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) collective invasion. Using stable subpopulations derived with our Spatiotemporal Cellular and Genomic Analysis (SaGA) technique, we found that two distinct subpopulations of the H1299 NSCLC line cooperate during collective tumor invasion <i>in vitro<\/i>; while H1299 pack leaders are heavily dependent on oxidative phosphorylation, H1299 pack followers are more reliant on glycolysis. To further dissect how intratumoral heterogeneity enables cancer progression to metastasis, we incorporate high resolution imaging, stable fluorescent labeling, gene editing, and <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor invasion models to interrogate mechanisms of metabolic cooperation between heterogeneous NSCLC subpopulations. We hypothesize that cooperation and communication between these distinct metabolic subpopulation drives metastatic tumor progression. To determine mechanisms of metabolic cooperativity between subpopulations, we stably transduced our subpopulations to fluorescently label either the mitochondria (through TOM20 labeling) or a key enzyme in glycolysis (through glucose 6-phosphate isomerase GPI labeling), cultured labeled subpopulations with unlabeled subpopulations, and observed metabolic changes and exchange via time-lapse, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry in 2D culture conditions. Next steps include visualizing the metabolic cooperation that occurs in conditions mimicking the tumor microenvironment (i.e., 3D invasion assays) using super-resolution microscopy. Taken together, we have developed a method of temporally visualizing metabolic exchange with high spatial resolution between NSCLC subpopulations to investigate the underlying mechanisms enabling successful cell invasion in a variety of tumor microenvironments. Thus far, we have discovered multiple broad mechanisms of exchange including tunneling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles, both of which are inducible with certain stressors common to the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Metabolism,Fluorescence imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Clonal evolution of ccRCC proceeds through distinct trajectories characterised by differing levels of genomic intratumoral heterogeneity (gITH) and chromosomal complexity (weighted genomic instability index, wGII). However, accurate evaluation of these indices requires multiregional profiling of fresh tumour; cost prohibitive and logistically challenging in the clinical setting. Clinical histopathology workflows routinely capture multiple tumour areas enabling the use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict tumour evolutionary features directly from clinical grade H&#38;E whole slide image (WSIs). ccRCC displays profound genetic and histological ITH but the link between these entities remains unclear. We leverage the TRACERx Renal cohort, comprising 1485 WSIs from 81 tumours to predict WGII and gITH and to gain insights into the relationship between genetic and histological ITH. Critically, each WSI is associated with a wGII and gITH label derived from a closely linked fresh tumour sample. For both prediction tasks, we extracted meaningful features for each WSI using self-supervised representation learning &#8220;MoCo&#8221;. Since high wGII confers poor prognosis we focussed on predicting binary stratification label of high wGII or low wGII (relative to the cohort median). First we predicted wGII as a continuous variable using a supervised multiple instance learning regression model trained on the MoCo features, and then classified the predicted wGII into &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;low&#8221; achieving 0.80 AUROC. To predict gITH we postulated that the degree of gITH would correlate with histological ITH. Using an unsupervised clustering of refined MoCo features we defined 24 histological clusters. The number of computationally derived histological clusters within a single tumour positively correlated with gITH (pearson&#8217;s 0.56). We used the number of clusters to classify WSIs into prognostic binary groups of high or low gITH (relative to the cohort median) achieving an AUROC of 0.80. To understand the biological relationship between histological and genetic ITH we pathologically characterised the histological clusters: a pathologist annotated WSIs with tumour architecture and cytomorphology. Image tiles were associated with the annotations using spatial coordinates, illuminating phenotypic traits of different evolutionary trajectories and providing an interpretability framework for our AI pipelines. Since the tumour evolutionary course dictates disease progression tempo, applying evolutionary classification in clinic can fundamentally improve patient care. Here, for the first time, we provide a framework to translate fundamental evolutionary principles underpinning tumour biology and clinical progression into a prognostic computational pathology biomarker possible to clinically implement.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Biomarkers,Cancer progression,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

However, accurately assessing an individual cancer&#8217;s evolutionary history in a scalable and clinically relevant manner is currently an open problem. To address this, we introduce a novel methodology (EVOFLUx) to quantitively infer the history of a cancer from single time-point bulk samples using inexpensive, standard methylation arrays.<br \/>Description of Methodology: We recently identified fluctuating CpGs (fCpGs), which are CpGs that neutrally and stochastically change methylation state over time in individual cells, uniquely barcoding cells and thus enabling high temporal-resolution lineage tracing approaches. In a bulk population of cancer cells, the distribution of fCpG methylation is determined by the evolution of the population and thus encode a cancer&#8217;s past clonal dynamics. Here, we have developed a general computational approach to model how the patterns of fCpGs vary according to the evolutionary history of a growing cancer, and a Bayesian inference method to infer these parameters from data.<br \/>Results We applied EVOFLUx to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of 1,976 lymphoid cancers, finding that the tumor growth rates, malignancy age and epimutation rates varied by orders of magnitude across disease types.<br \/>In addition, EVOFLUx allowed us to test for the presence of ongoing subclonal selection and validated our inference with matched whole exome sequencing data. Alongside characterizing the evolutionary dynamics within single bulk samples, fCpGs also allow for the inference of the phylogenetic relationships between longitudinal samples, which we validated with whole genome sequencing.<br \/>Within cancer types, more aggressive subtypes typically had elevated growth rates. In our clinically annotated cohort of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples, we found that patient-specific evolutionary dynamics are strongly associated with outcome.<br \/>Conclusions: Hence, we present a powerful new method that uses widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data to precisely measures cancer evolutionary dynamics in patient samples with clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Leukemias,Methylation,Lineage markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

We tested pre-clinical therapies to eradicate phenotypically distinct cell populations derived from the parental DU145<sup>WT<\/sup> prostate cancer cell line. The derived cell lines are called DU145<sup>AA<\/sup>, DU145<sup>J7<\/sup>, and DU145<sup>G6<\/sup>. The DU145<sup>AA<\/sup> variant is a non-aggressive cell population while the DU145<sup>J7<\/sup> and DU145<sup>G6 <\/sup>are aggressive phenotypes that invade through muscle and metastasize to bone. Flow cytometry analysis documented the phenotypic plasticity of the DU145 cell variants since DU145 aggressive lines expressed 1.3-fold increases in matrix metalloprotease 14 surface expression and a 2-fold increase in tri-methyl Histone H3 at lysine 27 as compared to the DU145<sup>WT<\/sup> parent line. The DU145<sup>AA<\/sup> non-aggressive line expressed an epithelial cell-cell lineage phenotype with up to 2-fold increases in E-cadherin, claudin 4, claudin 7, and a unique cytokeratin 6A expression and a 2-fold loss of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1, EVL, and Kindlin 2. A collaboration with the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) resulted in the identification of pharmacological agents active in eradicating DU145<sup>J7<\/sup> and DU145<sup>G6<\/sup> cells as compared to the DU145<sup>WT<\/sup> population. The agents were selected from a quantitative high-throughput screen of 10,677 combined investigative and approved anti-cancer agents using the Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability assay. We independently validated 31 compounds from the assay that have 2-fold, or greater, differences in concentration to inhibit 50% cell growth (IC&#173;<sub>50<\/sub>) between the wild-type and aggressive variants of DU145 cells. The top 10 hits were tested for the efficacy of different combinations to eradicate defined admixtures of aggressive and non-aggressive phenotypes, including the DU145<sup>AA <\/sup>cells, to model tumor heterogeneity. Tested compounds with differential sensitivity between aggressive and non-aggressive cells were those inhibiting histone deacetylase (vorinostat, fimepinostat, and pracinostat), proteasomes (bortezomib, delanzomib, ixazomib), topoisomerases (gimatecan and daunorubicin), and other compounds identified independently by us targeting nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (FK866) and DNA (bleomycin). Using admixtures of tumor cell phenotypes, we determined optimal combinations of compounds that would selectively eradicate the sub-populations. The results suggest that determination of phenotypes within tumor populations may eliminate the heterogenous tumor and prevent recurrent disease.

Here we demonstrate that ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 targets include the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the NE splicing factor <i>SRRM4<\/i>, which are key drivers of lineage plasticity. Thus, OC2, despite its previously described NEPC driver function, can indirectly activate a portion of the AR cistrome through epigenetic activation of GR. Mechanisms by which OC2 regulates gene expression include promoter binding, enhancement of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, and super-enhancer reprogramming. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC and support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target OC2 as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen independence,Heterogeneity,Multiomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to this deadly disease remain largely unknown. As such, there are no effective strategies to treat metastatic cancer and improve patient outcomes. Anchorage-independent growth of circulating prostate tumor cell clusters is essential for developing cancer metastasis. However, there is no model system to study the molecular and functional characteristics of prostate tumor cell clusters reminiscent of the bloodstream in a laboratory setting. In addressing this need, we have established nonadherent LNCaP cell clusters, LN-G2 and LN-G3, under androgen-depleted growth conditions in a simulated microgravity bioreactor called Slow Turning Lateral Vessel (STLV). Our quantitative PCR analysis repeatedly demonstrated that LN-G2 and LN-G3 cell populations expressed high levels of the well-characterized CD44 and CXCR4 cancer stem cell maker, respectively, compared to the LNCaP parental. In addition, our functional analysis indicates that, unlike the LNCaP cell, LN-G2 and LN-G3 cells showed superior clonogenic and growth behaviors in response to androgen depletion and enzalutamide-treatment under adherent monolayer and nonadherent conditions. These observations suggest that cancer stem cell-like cell clusters that survived under microgravitational stress confer distinctive molecular and functional properties associated with superior survival and contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, the STLV bioreactor could help enrich cancer stem cell populations and enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of lethal cancer, which may lead to novel therapeutics to improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Cancer Heterogeneity,Metastasis,Circulating tumor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Importantly, chromosome 3 CN loss is associated with BAP1 loss-of-function (LOF) and corresponds with tumor metastasis and poor patient prognosis. Understanding the biology underlying this chromosome 3 CN loss event is critical to informing on metastatic UM. To this end, we leveraged CRISPR-based centromere targeting to engineer multiple clones exhibiting chromosome 3 CN loss. We determined that dosage-loss of chromosome 3 was sufficient to develop multiple isogenic clones exhibiting genomic features of &#8220;ultra high-risk&#8221; UM, independent of BAP1 LOF. Leveraging this isogenic system, we evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> profiling, demonstrating site-specific liver metastasis only in orthotopic HR tumors, along with a significantly increased fitness in the liver. Next, we sought to inform on differential signaling pathways and therapeutic sensitivity between LR and HR models. Characterization of established UM oncogenic pathways identified a clear disengagement from classical MAPK and non-canonical Hippo signaling in the HR clones. These findings also correlate with a significant decrease in sensitivity to MEK and FAK inhibitors. In addition, we observed a PKC isoform swap from PKC&#949; and PKC&#948; to PKC&#945;, a feature observed in late-stage UM patient tumors. Interestingly, we also observed an increase in the expression of PRAME and NBS1 in HR models, both markers for poor prognosis in patients. Genome-anchored transcriptomic analysis also captured distinct profiles between the LR and HR clones, highlighting a significant increase in MYC associated targets upon chromosome 3 dosage-loss. This increase in MYC signaling coincides with site-specific 8q amplifications across the HR clones, implicating MYC as a core fitness driver in high-risk UM and a potential contributor to poor patient prognosis in monosomy 3 patients. Leveraging engineered models of chromosome 3 CN loss, and the subsequent induction of &#8220;ultra high-risk&#8221; UM, provides a unique opportunity to inform on the underlying biology of UM evolution and potential therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Modeling,Malignant progression,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of various components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix elements, all of which interact with cancer cells. It is increasingly recognized that the components of the TME are a critical determinant of therapeutic response and resistance, and as such targeting the TME has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy.<br \/>Syngeneic models are necessary to study the TME, and more specifically the tumor infiltrating immune cell populations, as these models allow us to monitor various aspects of the immune response. Another important aspect to consider is tumor heterogeneity, which can cause issues during analysis due to immune cell populations not being evenly distributed throughout the tumor. The decision of whether to analyze whole tumors or halved tumors when monitoring changes in immune cell populations is an important consideration. When considering multiple endpoints from a single tumor sample, halved tumors are oftentimes considered as we remain mindful of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) in animal research. As such, it is important to understand the effects of splitting samples and how it can affect the data that is generated.<br \/>To determine the effects of analyzing whole and halved tumor samples on immune cell subsets, studies were designed to subcutaneously implant either CT26.WT or 4T1-Luc2-1A4 cells into female BALB\/cAnNHsd mice and harvest tumor samples after the completion of treatment. Mice were treated with isotype control (Clone MPC-11) or anti-mCTLA-4 (Clone 9D9). At the time of sample collection, tumors were kept whole intact or halved and analyzed via flow cytometry to quantify lymphoid and myeloid immune cell subsets within tumor samples.<br \/>The data revealed differences in immune cell subset populations for both isotype vs. anti-CTLA-4 treated tumors and whole vs. halved tumors. Changes in the lymphoid cell compartment were observed for whole vs. halved tumors of &#177; ~25-100% and &#177; ~0-40% for isotype treated and of &#177; ~0-30% and &#177; ~25-2600% for anti-CTLA-4 treated CT26.WT or 4T1-Luc2-1A4 tumors, respectively. Changes in the myeloid cell compartment of &#177; ~5-45% and &#177; ~10-65% for isotype treated and of &#177; ~15-100% and &#177; ~0-70% for anti-CTLA-4 treated CT26.WT or 4T1-Luc2-1A4 tumors, respectively, were also observed. Additionally, differences were observed between the two tumor halves, not just between whole and halved tumors.<br \/>Taken together, the data support that splitting tumor samples can negatively impact the analysis of the immune cell populations. Tumors can be split if required to perform multiple analyses, however, this should be done with caution, as it can result in trend differences and increases variability within the dataset.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immune response,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Investigating the role of these phenotypic states has been challenging due to limited marker availability for each cell state. High-parameter molecular methods such as RNAseq have produced more descriptive gene signatures of phenotypic states, but these methods are cell-destructive, labor-intensive, expensive, and can take days to weeks to obtain a readout. Different morphologies have been observed for melanocytic and mesenchymal phenotypic states in culture, thus we hypothesized that morphology could provide an orthogonal method to define and study phenotypes. We utilized the Deepcell platform to develop a classifier to predict the phenotype of melanoma cells as melanocytic or mesenchymal based on morphology alone. This method is free of labels and utilizes viable cells, overcoming the technical and practical limitations of traditional, marker-based methods.<br \/>We used 20 patient-derived cell lines with known melanocytic or mesenchymal transcription scores to develop the &#8216;Melanoma Phenotype Classifier&#8217; to phenotype melanoma cells based on morphology alone. A classifier accuracy of <b>&#62;88%<\/b> was achieved, and morphological analysis of the images revealed distinct morphotypes for each phenotype, highlighting distinct morphological differences. To further link phenotypic state with multi-dimensional morphological profiles, we performed genetic and chemical perturbations known to shift the phenotypic state. The Melanoma Phenotype Classifier successfully predicted shifts in phenotypes driven by these perturbations. These results further demonstrate how phenotype is linked to distinct morphological changes that are detectable by artificial intelligence. Lastly, we applied the Melanoma Phenotype Classifier to dissociated melanoma biopsies, which revealed phenotypic heterogeneity that was confirmed by single cell RNASeq.<br \/>This work establishes a link between cellular morphology and melanoma phenotype and lays the groundwork for the use of morphology as a label-free method of phenotyping viable melanoma cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor heterogeneity,Machine learning,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Evelyn Lattmann<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Andreja Jovic<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Julie Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Aizhan Tastanova<sup>1<\/sup>, Tiffine Pham<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Corona<sup>2<\/sup>, Kiran Saini<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhouyang Lian<sup>2<\/sup>, Senzeyu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Carelli<sup>2<\/sup>, Kevin B.

Carrying capacities of individual isogenic tumors varied by over four orders of magnitude, suggesting that microenvironmental heterogeneity profoundly impacts growth dynamics. Our approach further allowed us to track the growth effects of eleven canonical tumor suppressor gene knockouts introduced via multiplexed CRISPR\/Cas genome-engineering. All but one of these secondary mutations augmented either the exponential growth rate or the carrying capacity of the tumor. However, only three tumor suppressor losses increased both growth parameters (Rb1, Setd2, and Stk11). Hence, the growth benefits of most cancer-causing mutations are missed when growth is measured only at a single time point. Clinically, we find that <i>r-<\/i>promoting and <i>K-<\/i>promoting mutations interact synergistically to create the most aggressive tumors in human patients (HR = 1.71, <i>P-<\/i>value &#60; 10<sup>-10<\/sup>).

However, a significant limitation of these technologies is the lack of ability to resolve protein and RNA information in the same section, as well as conveniently analyze multimodal data sets. Here, we report a spatial RNA detection method, RNAsky, using Miltenyi Biotec&#8217;s MACSima&#8482; Platform as an automated, multiomic approach. Our method integrates spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data to provide in-depth profiling with single-cell resolution on the same tissue section. We demonstrate these capabilities by characterizing key immune-oncology markers across normal and diseased tissues using our specialized MACS&#174; iQ View analysis software. MACS iQ View provides fast segmentation and intuitive gating and clustering strategies to simultaneously assess protein and RNA data. We investigated the impact of clustering using protein, RNA, or the combination of both to evaluate the contribution of different information modalities on TME spatial dynamics. This cutting-edge approach will enable the identification of valuable parameters and new cell types, furthering the discovery and development of predictive and prognostic biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor biology,Image analysis,Multiomics,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Dongju Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Neil<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca  C.

In recent years, genome analysis has revealed the existence of multiple subgroups with different properties within a single tumor, and intratumor heterogeneity is a cause of treatment resistance. It has also been reported that. However, the mechanism of intratumor heterogeneity remains unclear. Previous research on intratumor heterogeneity has mainly focused on analyzing patient cancer cells, classifying subgroups, and estimating characteristic factors. This method has two drawbacks. One is limitations in including all subgroups as research subjects, and other is lack of verification of whether characteristic factors are actually involved in intratumor heterogeneity in patients. Therefore, it is necessary to use a model of \"early intratumor heterogeneity\" in which monoclonal cells are divided into subgroups with different properties, and to verify the discovered factors using patient-derived cancer cell lines. In alectinib-resistant cell line (H2228-AR1S) created from monoclonal ALK-positive lung cancer cell line (H2228) by exposing to alectinib <i>in vitro<\/i>, existence of two fractions with different appearances. Using flow cytometry, it was revealed that H2228-AR1S bimodally expresses EpCAM, and the EpCAM-low fraction has high migration ability. In EpCAM-low fraction, epithelial markers were decreased, and mesenchymal markers were increased using immunoblotting. It suggests that EpCAM low subpopulation has undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, we established a BRAF-positive lung cancer cell line (KTOR83) collected with consent from patients attending Kyoto University Hospital. Cells after <i>in vitro<\/i> dabrafenib exposure to KTOR83 showed bimodal EpCAM expression, and the EpCAM-low fraction has high migration ability. We established an intratumor heterogeneous model using commercially available cells and a patient-derived lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, we will explore factors common to the two models and examine factors involved in intratumor heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ALK,BRAF,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The use of drug combinations limits the emergence of resistance, thereby prolonging their therapeutic utility. The effect of a drug combination is dependent both on the concentration of the individual drugs and the extent of their interaction (synergistic, additive, or antagonistic). Thus, understanding the scheduling implications for efficacy can be valuable for optimizing tumor response and time to resistance for the combination. To examine this more closely, we used a pharmacokinetic\/ pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) modeling approach, coupling one-compartment PK models of two hypothetical drugs based on set synchronous or asynchronous (offset) schedules with an evolutionary model of tumor clone growth. We simulated four tumor subpopulations representing binary resistance to one or both drugs, using an exponential growth model with growth penalties based on drug concentrations. We used the model to simulate the effects of pairs of antagonistic, synergistic, and additive drugs on the growth of sensitive and resistant populations in a tumor. Final tumor volume and resistant population were used to compare the efficacy of various drug schedules. As expected, the effect of a drug interaction&#8212;either synergistic or antagonistic&#8212;is greatest when dosing is synchronous, as this results in the greatest simultaneous drug concentration. The effect of a drug interaction is proportional to the sensitive population size, so the effect of drug interactions decreases over time as the sensitive population is eliminated. Intuitively, the final tumor volume decreases as the strength of a synergistic interaction increases until the sensitive population is eliminated. The resistant populations are unaffected by the strength of the interaction for both antagonistic and synergistic combinations. Resistant populations are not affected by interactions between drugs to which they are resistant, so the growth of resistant populations over time is independent of drug interactions. Crucially, for effective drugs&#8212;that is, drugs that eliminate the sensitive population&#8212;synergy and antagonism converge to additivity as the sensitive population dies out because the remaining resistant populations are not affected by drug interactions. As synergistic and additive drug combinations are equivalent in the long-term, synergy and asynchronous dosing could be used to limit toxicity without sacrificing efficacy. The evolution of resistance also explains why <i>in vitro <\/i>synergy or antagonism may not translate <i>in vivo<\/i>. Taken together, our work provides several unintuitive insights about combination drug scheduling with practical implications for therapeutic design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Combination therapy,Resistance,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

This resistance involves complex factors, including tumor mutational burden and heterogeneity. APOBEC proteins, associated with mutagenesis and DNA damage, are implicated in this process. Our study centers on SYNCRIP, a key regulator of APOBEC activity, and investigates its influence on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in CRPC. Objective: This research aims to explore how SYNCRIP deficiency leads to increased APOBEC activity, and to examine its possible implications for ecDNA formation and its contribution to drug resistance and tumor heterogeneity in CRPC.<br \/>Methods: Genomic and transcriptomic analyses, such as whole exome sequencing and single-cell RNA-seq, were performed on CRPC cell lines and patient-derived samples, with an emphasis on SYNCRIP-deficient models. The study focused on understanding the relationship between elevated APOBEC activity due to SYNCRIP deficiency and potential ecDNA changes, evaluating their effect on AR-targeted drug sensitivity and overall tumor behavior.<br \/>Results: SYNCRIP was identified as a critical factor in resistance to AR therapy in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. Its deficiency resulted in increased therapy resistance and amplified APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. Functional CRISPR screening identified eight key drivers of resistance in SYNCRIP-deficient tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed APOBEC-driven mutagenesis as a key factor in promoting intratumoral heterogeneity and resistance. Notably, in SYNCRIP-deficient CRPC samples, increased APOBEC activity and significant DNA damage were observed, prompting an investigation into a possible correlation between resistance and ecDNA presence.<br \/>Conclusion: The study uncovers a significant link between SYNCRIP deficiency and increased APOBEC activity in CRPC. While it also hints at a potential connection with ecDNA alterations, further research is necessary to establish this relationship firmly. This interplay contributes to the complexity of drug resistance in CRPC, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic targets. The dynamics among SYNCRIP, APOBEC activity, and ecDNA offer valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of therapy resistance in prostate cancer, suggesting new directions for treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Mutagenesis,Prostate cancer,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>X.
