[{"Abstract":"Melanoma-associated antigen gene A (MAGE-A) family of proteins have previously been shown to express in a variety of tumors, having different roles in cancer pathogenesis. MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 have both been shown to inhibit the p53 pathway which leads increased cell growth by stopping apoptosis. Both of these proteins have been associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis. In our studies, we have evaluated multiple MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 antibodies using CytoSections. While previous research had only pointed to these proteins being intracellular, our overexpression studies in the development of CytoSections indicated that some MAGE-A proteins were secreted. In this study, ELISA binding assays corroborated that MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 were secreted from cells overexpressing these proteins, and serum MAGE-A4 was detected in 24% of lung cancer patients. Flow cytometry data was then collected to see that exogenous MAGE-A proteins were binding to cells in a pattern consistent with secretion data from IHC experiments. Variants of MAGE-A4, differing by only a handful of amino acids, showed very different levels of secretion from one another. MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A6 share 95% homology and were also extremely different in secretion shown between IHC, flow cytometry, and ELISA. This study validates that certain members of the MAGE-A family are secreted from cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Protein expression,Serum marker,p53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bailey Gilmore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dehe Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Gonzalez<sup>1<\/sup>, Jina Yom<sup>1<\/sup>, Andy Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Tianli Qu<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Strom<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoxiao Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Eden Zewdu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hailey Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhaoying Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ranran Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaomin Hu<sup>3<\/sup>, Qi Ren<sup>3<\/sup>, Xuan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Fu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Origene Wuxi Biotechnology Co., Wuxi, China,<sup>3<\/sup>OriGene Wuxi Biotechnology Co., Wuxi, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a3afbe50-f43f-4340-b27b-008d4a873f4e","ControlNumber":"7797","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

We aim to investigate the interplay between epigenetic modifiers and pathogenetic markers in the PNET microenvironment. 12 paraffin-embedded PNET specimens and 12 benign adjacent tissue specimens, used as controls, were obtained from Cooper University Hospital Pathology Department (IRB 23-130). IHC was performed using epigenetic markers, including DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-HMC), and pathogenic markers, including Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1 (MEN1), Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTEN), and Ras Association Domain Family 1 (RASSF1). Image J software was utilized for IHC scoring under the guidance of a board-certified pathologist. DNMT1 was upregulated in PNET tumor specimens with a mean density score of 72.02 +\/- 31 versus 16.02 +\/- 17 in adjacent benign tissue (p&#60;.001). Grade 2 tumors displayed increased DNMT1 expression compared to Grade 1 tumors with a mean score of 37 +\/-21 versus 71 +\/- 23 (p&#60;.05). Decreased expression of 5-HMC was noted in tumor specimens in comparison to benign tissue with a mean score of 3.92 +\/- 5.05 versus 19.37 +\/- 5.05 (p&#60;.05). Loss of 5-HMC was observed in higher tumor grades with a mean score of .79 +\/- 2 versus 8.2+\/-2 (p&#60;.01). DNMT3B was upregulated in PNET tumor specimens with a mean score of 13.16 +\/- 3.94 versus 7.02+\/- 2.553 (p&#60;.01) in adjacent benign tissue and was positively correlated to DNMT1 expression. DNMT3A was not found to have a difference in expression between tumor and benign tissue. MEN1 was downregulated in PNET, with 45% of tumor specimens displaying loss of MEN1 expression. Mean MEN1 density in tumor tissue was 4.47 +\/- 5.95 versus 11.41 +\/- 3.53 in adjacent benign (p&#60;.01). Increased expression of DNMT1 found to negatively correlate with MEN1 expression (R<sup>2<\/sup>=.23). Loss of RASSF1 expression was present in 70% of tumor specimens with a mean score of 1.32 +\/- 1.99 versus 9.50+\/- 6.89 (p&#60;.001) in adjacent benign tissue. RASSF1 expression correlated negatively with DNMT1 (R<sup>2<\/sup>=.21). PTEN expression showed intratumoral homogeneity to benign tissue, and its expression was not correlated with any epigenetic markers. Our work provides a framework of epigenetic regulators involved in the pathobiology of PNET, and can refine prognostic evaluation while providing therapeutic benefits for patients with PNET.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Neuroendocrine tumors,Epigenetics,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

In current clinical practice, TLS are often detected by manual assessment of H&#38;E slides, which has been associated with reproducibility issues. Here, we developed a transcriptomic model using TLS density to stratify LUAD patients into TLS-high and -low groups and compared it with 5 published TLS FGES to assess the predictive value for patient outcomes.<br \/><b>Design:<\/b> A regression model to predict TLS density (units(u)\/mm&#178;) was created using RNA expression data and histological mapping of 415 TCGA-LUAD samples. Features were chosen based on differential gene expression analysis of sample groups with low (&#60;Q1, 0.26 u\/mm&#178;) and high (&#62;Q3, 2.04 u\/mm&#178;) TLS density. The model was trained on 269 samples and independently validated on 146 TCGA and 9 internal samples. The RNA model and five previously reported TLS FGES were compared by Wilcoxon paired test to Spearman&#8217;s &#961; and F1-scores from bootstrapped validation set. The resulting predictions stratified immunotherapy-treated samples from SU2C-MARK (n=58) and GSE182328 (n=28) into TLS-high and TLS-low groups by Q2 threshold for TLS density (0.78 u\/mm&#178;) for further univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox model, adjusted for age and sex) analyses for overall survival (OS) with log-rank tests. P-values were adjusted with Bonferroni correction, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Statistically significant upregulated genes in samples with high TLS density included FDCSP, MS4A1, and CXCL13 (logFC &#8805; 0.95, FDR&#60;0.01). The transcriptomic model showed confident superiority in correlation with TLS density compared to the best FGES in TCGA samples (&#961;=0.53&#177;0.03 vs 0.41&#177;0.03, p&#60;0.001). The TLS model also outperformed the highest performing FGES when stratifying TCGA samples into TLS-high and TLS-low groups (F1=0.73&#177;0.02 vs 0.69&#177;0.02, p&#60;0.005). In the internal cohort, the model demonstrated robust performance (F1=0.76&#177;0.05, &#961;=0.81&#177;0.04) and outperformed all FGES except one (FGES F1=0.78&#177;0.05, &#961;=0.86&#177;0.05). The TLS-high group defined by the TLS RNA model had a significantly better prognosis on immunotherapy cohorts (p=0.01; 1 year OS 49% for TLS-low vs 70% for TLS-high), whereas no discernible difference in OS was identified for the 5 TLS FGES. The TLS model had a log hazard ratio (logHR) of -3.11 (CI:-5.31,-0.91; p&#60;0.05, Harrell's C-index=0.64), indicative of a stronger association with OS than of the TLS FGES (logHR=-2.11; CI:-4.1,-0.08; p=ns; C-index=0.59).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Comparative analysis of the proposed transcriptomic model for TLS detection in LUAD samples demonstrated improved performance metrics and prognostic value compared to previously reported TLS FGES, affirming its potential for guiding therapeutic decision-making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,functional gene signatures,Immuno-oncology,Tertiary lymphoid structures,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

CAFs are typically categorized based on function: myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) amplify extracellular matrix production that blocks therapy and immune cell infiltration while inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) produce immuno-suppressive cytokines and chemokines. Here we sought to better understand the role and mechanisms of myCAFs in altering the TME by identifying their unique markers and potential drivers.<br \/>Methods: Z-scores of ACTA2\/TAGLN or ICAM1\/PDPN were used to create datasets high in myCAF and iCAF markers, respectively, from TCGA data. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the resulting differential expression. Samples of patients were collected to create a cohort of colorectal cancers that were stained via immunohistochemistry (IHC) for alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;SMA), transgelin (TAGLN), myocardin (MYOCD) and myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA). Slides were evaluated for collagen using Masson&#8217;s trichrome stain. MYOCD and MRTFA nuclear expression was expressed as positively stained nuclei per high powered field (HPF; 400x). TAGLN, &#945;SMA, and collagen were scored on a scale of 0-3+.<br \/>Results: Of the 592 TCGA patients compiled across all disease stages, 23 (median age 63) formed the myCAF-high group (7 males, 16 females). Within this group, GSEA indicated an upregulation of myogenesis (q &#60;0.001) with the following genes positively associated with myCAF markers: MYLK (q &#60; 0.001, log2 fold change [FC] 1.52), DES (q &#60; 0.001, 5.32), and MYH11 (q &#60; 0.001, 3.57). The following were also upregulated in the myCAF high cohort: CNN1 (q &#60; 0.001, 2.95) and MYOCD (q&#60; 0.001, 2.27). These genes are targets of MYOCD and MRTFA transcription factors potentially driving the myCAF phenotype. To assess this potential relationship, we evaluated 306 tumor samples from 153 patients with CRC. The cohort consisted of 56 female patients and 97 male patients aged 13-90 years old across all disease stages. High amounts of nuclear MRTFA were associated with high scores for myCAF markers aSMA (average score 1.54 when MRTFA+ nuclei &#60; 5 per HPF vs 2.06 when MRTFA + nuclei &#62; 5 per HPF, p&#60;0.001, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test), TAGLN (1.37 vs 1.62, p = 0.043), and collagen (1.73 vs 2.10, p = 0.009). Likewise, for MYOCD, &#945;SMA (1.79 vs 2.14, p = 0.001) and collagen (1.87 vs 2.15, p = 0.017) were positively correlated.<br \/>Conclusions: Increased nuclear expression of MYOCD and MRTFA in stromal cells of CRC are positively correlated with myCAF gene expression, supporting our initial hypothesis of these being drivers of the phenotype. Our findings now motivate further analysis as to whether the inhibition of these transcription factors could lead to a reduction in the immune regulatory myCAF phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Here, we aimed to characterize the phenotypes of the TECs of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), identify distinct features that are pivotal in tumor progression, and discover potential therapeutic applications.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 128 NSCLC patients to include I (N=52), II (N=18), III (N=21), and IV (N=14), and compared them with normal cells (N=24). Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR<\/i>)-mutant accounted for 69 samples. <i>EGFR<\/i>-wild (N=35) was further classified as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) high (N=14) and low (N=21) with PD-L1 high defined as tumor proportion score <u>&#62;<\/u> 50%.<br \/>Results: Twelve distinct EC types were characterized based on clinical information, including <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations and PD-L1 expression. We classified our subset as normal cells and tumor-enriched ECs, which were further classified as <i>EGFR<\/i>-wild or mutant ECs. Compared to normal cells, phenotypes such as activated post-capillary veins (APCVs), tip ECs, and endothelial mesenchymal transition (endoMT) ECs were predominantly observed in all tumor-enriched ECs. In <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant ECs, ribosomal ECs, and vascular mimicry (VM) ECs were primarily enriched. Trajectory analysis showed that endoMT and VM ECs had lineage tracing of fibroblasts and epithelial cells, respectively. By clinical stage, APCVs, tip ECs, endoMT, and VM ECs were more enriched at advanced stages. PD-L1-high subset had higher expression of adhesion molecules, APCVs, and median transmigration score than other phenotypes. Also, high endothelial venules (HEVs) mediating lymphocyte trafficking to lymphoid organs were enriched in high PD-L1 subset. In the APCVs of <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant group, there were interactions related to immune cell suppression and interactions of chemokines\/chemokine receptors involved in recruitment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings reveal distinct phenotypes of ECs, including the enrichment of APCVs, tip ECs, and endoMT ECs in all tumor-enriched EC populations, as well as VM ECs in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant ECs. APCVs, which is abundant high PD-L1 subset, play a crucial role in the transmigration progress of immune cells across vascular endothelium. In <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC, dysfunctional immune cells are recruited into the tumor, along with relatively low transmigration, resulting in poor tumor-killing effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,tumor-associated endothelial cells,Heterogeneity,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-J.

Mapping RNA targets at high specificity with fully customizable assays and quick workflow, it uses rolling circle amplification and interpretation-ready data is available immediately after the run. At BioChain Institute, Inc. (BioChain), we are conducting validation studies for reproducibility of results with the Xenium platform using BioChain&#8217;s oncology biospecimen.FFPE tissues from BioChain&#8217;s repository were screened by our pathologist for tumor content above 30%. Four carcinoma tissues from Breast, Colon, Lung, and Kidney with high DV200 scores were selected. An array was constructed with these tissues to fit the Xenium slide&#8217;s imageable area. Two serial sections were used for the Xenium run per 10x Genomics&#8217; protocol. The Off-the-shelf Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel was used for targeting 377 genes. H&#38;E staining and imaging was performed, and the image was integrated with the data on the Xenium platform. The results were found to be reproducible between two different operators. For example, in the breast section, over 96,000 cells were detected and median transcripts per cell were 70 in both the runs. There were 20 clusters representing different cell types\/ states, 99% transcripts were within cells, and ~85% of the transcripts were found to be high quality. Furthermore, we are analyzing the expression of unique tumor type and immune transcripts to map the heterogeneity of the tissues, as well as sensitivity, and standard deviation between the runs. The Xenium platform is a powerful tool for the sub-cellular spatial transcriptomics study of tissues with targeted gene panels. However, one of the four tissues used here failed to show enough transcripts. Further investigation is underway to examine the issue and conclude best practices thereafter. Our future studies will include accuracy and concordance validation with Xenium run on different days and Visium whole transcriptome assay post- Xenium.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biospecimen,Breast cancer,Colon cancer,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

By examining fibroblast clusters, we identified distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and revealed four clusters: normal fibroblasts cluster, inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) cluster marked by increased expression of IL6 and other cytokines, myofibroblast CAFs (myCAFs) cluster solely in the KPC model, and antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) cluster expressing Mesothelin. We found that expression pattern of iCAFs in the KPC appeared similar to normal cells than myCAFs, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting cancer. it is reported that mesothelial cells might transition to apCAFs under the influence of IL6 and TGF&#946; due to tissue damage and inflammatory effects. This transition was visualized in our apCAF cluster, suggesting a potential pathway for the transformation of mesothelial cells into apCAFs.<br \/>Next, in order to analyze epigenetic profiles of fibroblasts, we conducted single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) using 90-day-old KPC mice (n=2) and a wild-type mouse (n=1).scATAC-seq showed that there are mainly two clusters of fibroblasts, one cluster corresponded to myCAF, enriched with PDPN, while the other represented iCAF cluster, enriched with COL1A2. These data suggest that in terms of the epigenetic state, myCAF contain several different CAFs and have the potential to differentiate into either myCAFs or other type of based on certain stimulation. Ultimately, CAF differentiated into three distinct subtypes as revealed by scRNA-seq. This highlights that despite similar epigenetic states, various transcription factors characterize the functionality of these fibroblast subtypes. Further exploration of the underlying mechanism that lead to different CAF subtypes might help in controlling the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Single-cell RNA sequencing,Single-cell ATAC sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

LMTK3 is highly expressed within the central nervous system (CNS) and has been demonstrated to influence neuronal signaling. This study aimed to investigate the potential connection between LMTK3 and neuronal signaling pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/>Methods: Using the Cre\/loxP system, we generated a C57BL\/6 mouse strain that lacks the expression of LMTK3. 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> MC38 cells were subcutaneously implanted into 8 weeks old male and female wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mice. Tumor growth was measured until endpoint was reached. Tumors were then processed for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each comparison group: WT Female vs WT Male, WT Female vs KO Female, WT Male vs KO Male, and KO Female vs KO Male were analyzed. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was done for identification of upstream regulators involved and affected cellular pathways. Expression levels of DEGs for glutamate receptor subunits were validated using qRT-PCR.<br \/>Results: Both male and female LMTK3 KO mice showed highly significant (p&#60;0.01) reduced tumor size when compared to WT mice of the same sex. Additionally, the KO female tumors were significantly (p&#60;0.05) smaller when compared to the KO males. RNA sequencing revealed 761 DEGs in KO and WT female and 133 DEGs in KO female and male cohort comparisons (q&#60;0.05). IPA results showed significant (p&#60;0.01, Z-score&#60;-2) alterations in pathways including glutaminergic receptor signaling, neurovascular coupling, CREB signaling in neurons, and synaptic long-term depression in the WT vs KO female tumor cohort comparison. Within these pathways DEGs: CACNA1E, CACNA2DA, CACNG2, GRIA1, GRIA2, GRIN1, and GRIN2B, were downregulated in KO females. Upstream regulator analysis identified transcription regulators such as OTX2 and NEUROD1 as well as beta-estradiol to be significantly inhibited (p&#60;0.01, Z-score&#60;-2) in KO females. qRT-PCR analysis showed significant (p&#60;0.05) decreased expression in GRIA1, GRIN1, and GRIN2B as well as GRIN2A and GRIN2C in KO females when compared to WT females or KO males, validating RNA seq results.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>These results showed the involvement of LMTK3 in the gut-brain axis and its effect on CRC tumor growth. Downregulation of multiple neuronal pathways and genes suggest that LMTK3 may influence neuron signaling and neurotransmitter release to produce stimulatory or inhibitory effects within the tumor environment. The concurrent inhibition of beta-estradiol in LMTK3 KO tumors allude to possible sex differences the kinase&#8217;s effect on the observed tumor growth. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of interaction of LMTK3 within these pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Colorectal cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

While conventional chemotherapy has improved 5-year survival rates for localized disease to 70%, metastatic disease remains at 20-30%. Failure of modern treatment options to improve survival reflects the failure of agents that appear promising in preclinical models to demonstrate clinical efficacy in human patients. We hypothesize that this is because most preclinical testing is performed on tumors implanted subcutaneously in immune deficient mice. Our previous work has shown that tumors implanted subcutaneously do not metastasize, whereas genetically identical tumors implanted orthotopically (in the tibia) metastasize to lungs and bones. Thus, to better understand non-genetic drivers of metastasis, we implanted patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) either orthotopically or subcutaneously into NSG mice. Once tumors reached 1.5cm, tumors were extracted along with distant metastases and analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic analysis reveals 1) that fragments of the same tumor implanted subcutaneously have a vastly different transcriptome than fragments implanted orthotopically, 2) the transcriptome of distant metastases is dramatically different from the transcriptome of the primary tumor, and 3) the gene expression profile of metastases is different in different metastatic sites. In all 3 of these circumstances, these differences reflect differences in differentiation status, signaling pathway activation, and immune cell infiltrate. Thus, we conclude that the environment in which a tumor grows significantly alters its gene expression and phenotype. Our study highlights the need for careful consideration of the tumor microenvironment when designing pre-clinical studies to ensure accurate representation of human osteosarcoma and may help to explain the dismal record of translating novel agents from preclinical studies into standard therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Microenvironment,Gene expression,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

This is due to a lack of diagnosis strategies, high recurrence rates, and the development of chemo-resistant diseases, which require synergy between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We have demonstrated the functional importance of a TME gene, periostin (POSTN), in OC and recurrent OC, using in vitro and in vivo models. Our objectives were to identify differentially expressed genes by POSTN expression in the TME that contribute to the progression of ovarian cancers.<br \/><b>Procedures<\/b>: Gene expression data was generated from an ovarian cancer cell line, HEYA8, cultured in a high POSTN conditioned 3D cell culture environment, using the NovaSeq 6000 system to generate RNA-seq data. The data was analyzed to determine the genes expressed at different levels between the HEYA8 cells grown with or without POSTN-high conditioned medium (CM). The gene functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment were further analyzed from 10,115 significant differentially expressed genes between the HEYA8 cells grown in high levels of POSTN (CM<i><sup>POSTNhigh<\/sup><\/i>) or low levels of POSTN (CM<i><sup>CTL<\/sup><\/i>) culture conditions, using DAVID bioinformatics.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Using a cell culture and co-culture model, we found that OC cells cultured under conditioned media containing CM<i><sup>POSTNhigh<\/sup><\/i> exhibited faster cell migration, more invasiveness (p=0.006), more chemo-resistance (p&#60;0.05), and increased resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, compared to OC cells cultured with control medium (CM<i><sup>CTL<\/sup><\/i>). OC cell lines cultured with CM<i><sup>POSTNhigh<\/sup><\/i> showed increased side population cells relative to CM<i><sup>CTL<\/sup><\/i> -cultured cells, suggesting POSTN plays important roles in cancer stem cell enrichment. POSTN-transfected 3T3-L1 cells exhibited more intracellular and extracellular lipids and were linked to increased cancer cell expression of the oncogene fatty acid synthetase. In correspondence to the functions of POSTN in OC cells, the pathways identified to be significantly impacted by POSTN expression included, but were not limited to, the cell cycle, apoptosis, p53 signaling, MAPK signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Interestingly, we also found cellular senescence pathways was one of the most significantly impacted by POSTN suggesting that POSTN may play roles in ovarian cancer via the regulation of cellular senescence, which has not yet been explored.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: These data emphasize the importance of TME factors in tumor progression and prognosis via various ways in ovarian cancer, establishing promising potential therapeutic targets of OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Aging,Chemoresistance,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Output was analyzed using Seurat (v.4.1.1), corrected for ambient RNA expression with CellBender (v.0.3.1) and detected and removed doublets with Scds (v.3.9). Tumor cells were distinguished from normal epithelium cells by a combination of inferCNV (v.1.12.0) and supervised learning with random forests classification.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Through snRNAseq, we show that CAFs, and not tumor cells, entirely drive the expression of previously validated poor prognostic signatures (Mortensen, 2015). Our analysis revealed that the TGF&#946; pathway expression, TGF-&#946;1 in particular, is upregulated in CAFs rather than PCa cells. This pathway, along with poor prognosis signatures are selectively elevated in CAFs from patients with Gleason high compared to low, implicating the TGFb axis as a PCa vulnerability. We also derived a snRNAseq CAF signature that differentiates non-responders to immune checkpoint therapy in mCRPC (Nivolumab+Ipilimumab). Furthermore, cluster profiling of tumor nuclei revealed that hgPCa harbors high heterogeneity with distinct niches of hgPC, mCRPC or neuroendocrine phenotypes for each patient.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Through snRNAseq we show that CAFs are the main contributors to prior bulk RNAseq classifiers of poor response, resulting in a refined CAF signature that allows for direct investigation of the contribution of CAFs in other patient segments (mCRPC). Our findings point to a hgPCa patient segment with high CAF representation that may benefit from the addition of a CAF targeting agent (ie.TGFbi) to androgen deprivation therapy. This data has the potential to help refine our prognostic classifiers for patient selection and clinical applicability. Further study of the reported tumor heterogeneity will inform rational combination therapies to tackle resistance mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,TGF-&#946;,Prostate cancer,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

MRCL is characterized by oncogenic DDIT3 fusions, with FUS::DDIT3 being present in over 90% of cases. However, the cellular origins and oncogenic mechanisms of MRCL remain incompletely defined. Here we report oncogene transcription, and tumor-immune interactions in a cohort of 5 patient tumors with matched normal tissue for which we sequenced the transcriptomes of approximately 45,000 single cells using 10X Genomics, and full-length transcripts in approximately 20,000 single cells via Oxford Nanopore in 2 of these patients.<br \/>Our results reveal two distinct cancer cell populations: Early Cancer Cells (ECC) and Advanced Cancer Cells (ACC). These cells appear to derive from adipose stem progenitor cells (ASPC) and fall along an ASPC&#8594;ECC&#8594;ACC pseudo-time axis. Along this axis, a distinct pattern emerges where oncogenes tend to be upregulated and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) tend to be downregulated and these appear to be mutually exclusive. Comparing ECC to ASPC we see increased expression of HIPPO and PI3K pathway oncogenes, FGFR2 and IGF1R RTKs, and downregulation of the TSG CDKN2A and CDKN1A. ACC show upregulation of hedgehog, ErbB, WNT, HIPPO, PI3K, and MAPK signaling pathways compared to ECC. Full-length transcript sequencing at the single-cell level shows a consistent expression of the FUS::DDIT3 fusion transcript in both ECC and ACC populations, confirming that these populations are cancer cells. Furthermore, MRCL displays several immune escape mechanisms, including poor immune infiltration and a marked decline of HLA Class I expression along the pseudo-time axis from ECC to ACC, suggesting a complex interplay between oncogenic signaling and immune evasion.<br \/>These results suggest that MRCL likely originates from ASPC and expression of FUS:DDIT3 oncoprotein induces early HIPPO, PI3K, FGFR2, and insulin signaling pathway expression in ECC with further hedgehog, ErbB, MAPK, and WNT pathway activation in ACC. This progressive activation in oncogenic signaling is associated with immune evasion. This is the first single-cell RNA seq analysis to detect the presence of the FUS::DDIT3 fusion in ECC and ACC significantly advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of MRCL oncogenesis, immune escape, and identifies potential novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Signaling pathways,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

Improving our understanding of the metastatic cascade is imperative to improve patient outcomes. Prior research indicates cancer cells with increased metastatic potential have acquired adaptive properties induced by factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia. However, previous hypoxia research has primarily focused on signaling changes that occur when cancer cells are in the hypoxic TME and does not account for long-term changes that may occur once cancer cells re-enter normoxia, such as when they metastasize. Our research in patient-derived circulating tumor cell (CTCs) lines and breast cancer cell lines indicates that certain transcriptional changes are maintained after cells leave hypoxia, and that these post-hypoxic cells maintain a higher metastatic potential compared to cells not exposed to hypoxia. Taking an un-biased approach to define changes in hypoxia-exposed breast cancer cells upon reoxygenation, we performed bulk RNA-Seq on post-hypoxic luminal breast cancer cell lines compared to normoxic controls cultured either in adherent or suspension conditions, the latter to mimic the physiological context of CTCs. We found that a subset of genes that were differentially expressed in hypoxic conditions were maintained as up- or down-regulated after cells were reoxygenated, indicating a &#8220;hypoxic memory&#8221;. Additionally, a subset of differentially expressed genes were unique to the post-hypoxic cells, demonstrating both prolonged and novel gene expression changes induced by hypoxia exposure. We also performed functional assays and observed that this post-hypoxic state is associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Current research in our lab is on-going to understand the epigenetic changes that may be responsible for this hypoxic memory. Overall, this research will improve our understanding of the prolonged consequences of hypoxia on CTC biology and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hypoxia,Metastasis,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not yet fully understood. Based on the described <i>in vitro<\/i> interplay between cancer cells and adipocytes that induces adipocyte dedifferentiation and the acquisition of an inflammatory phenotype, it is conceivable that tumor-adipocyte crosstalk promotes cancer progression even in normal weight patients (pts). To study tumor-induced AT alterations, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of matched adjacent and distant tumor AT samples from 41 breast cancer (BC) pts (78% Luminal B, 12% HER2+, 7% TNBC) undergoing mastectomy. Comparison of the gene expression landscape of BC-adjacent <i>vs<\/i> distant ATs derived from normal weight pts (BMI&#60;25, n=28) identified 723 differentially expressed genes (FDR&#60;10%). Metabolic signaling processes were over-represented in genes resulted downmodulated in the BC-adjacent AT, while those upmodulated were mainly classified into proliferation, migration and inflammatory response, cell programs associated with dedifferentiated adipocytes <i>in vitro<\/i>. Accordingly, BC-adjacent ATs were found to be enriched (NES=1.78, p&#60;0.0001) in a set of genes unique of <i>in vitro<\/i> dedifferentiated adipocytes compared to mature adipocytes. In overweight\/obese pts, no differentially expressed genes were found between BC-adjacent and -distant ATs, although gene sets composed of modulated genes in normal weight pts were found to be significantly enriched (NES=1.50, p&#60;0.0001; NES=-1.52, p=0.0025). In addition, a significant enrichment of altered BC-adjacent AT genes and inflammatory response process was observed (NES=1.49, p=0.0029; NES=1.62, p=0.011) in the BC-distal AT of overweight\/obese <i>vs<\/i> normal weight pts, indicating that AT is already altered and inflamed independently of the presence of the tumor in overweight\/obese women. To further analyze AT heterogeneity, we performed an unsupervised clustering of all AT samples using the K-means algorithm. Five stable clusters were identified, which were independent of sampling site. Indeed, the matched AT samples derived from 70% of the pts were assigned to the same cluster, with a significant grouping of overweight\/obese pts in clusters K1 and K2 (p=0.0217). BC-adjacent AT samples from the remaining pts clustered significantly (p=0.030) in the other 3 clusters, especially in K5, which had the highest CAA score, a signature reflecting adipocyte dedifferentiation. Consistent with the association with obesity, K1\/K2 pts had significantly higher circulating PCR, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin and recurrence rate. Overall these data suggest that BC cells induce adipocyte modifications in normal weight pts and that obesity-associated BC aggressiveness is related to intrinsic characteristics of adipose tissue.(Supported by AIRC)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Adipocytes,Body mass index,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

Understanding this remodeling process during intervention and tumor recurrence will likely guide the development of future therapeutic treatment paradigms with long-term responses. 56% of never-smokers with non-small cell lung cancer have KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant cancer and respond little to immune checkpoint therapy (ICI) compared to smokers, who often have mutations in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. Our analysis of the TME in a unique Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> inducible and reversible mouse model of NSCLC using single cell RNA sequencing data shows Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>-dependent control of the TME, particularly of the expression of PDL1 in a subset of myeloid cells. PDL1 expression was found to be Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> dependent as it was reduced significantly when Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> was turned ON in mouse lungs. Interestingly, when Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> was turned OFF, the expression of PDL1 increased, indicating mechanisms of resistance. Furthermore, the cytokine expression and secretion of IL6, a known regulator of PDL1 expression, increased in lung tissue and lung cancer cells derived from this model upon genetic and chemical (MRTX1133) Kras inhibition. Moreover, the mechanisms of resistance to oncogenic Kras inhibition appear to be mutant specific. Transcriptome and secretome analyses in human and murine Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> or Kras<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant lung cancer cells show distinct cytokine regulation upon KRAS inhibition. Identification of mechanisms of resistance like the induction of PDL1 expression upon KrasG12D inhibition may provide a strong rationale for co-treatment of KRAS inhibitors with ICI for KrasG12D never-smokers with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Resistance,Lung cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Further, specific microbe-cancer relationships have been established. One such microbe is <i>Candida albicans, <\/i>which has been identified within several gastrointestinal cancers and is associated with an increased risk of metastases and decreased overall survival. By completing RNA-sequencing on murine rectal tumors colonized with <i>C. albicans<\/i>, we can better understand whether intratumoral changes in gene expression exist based on colonization of specific microbes. This study utilizes gut-to-tumor translocation and whole transcriptome analysis for a discovery-based approach to identify the effects of <i>C. albicans<\/i> on the host tumor.<br \/>We established a rectal tumor model with C57BL\/6 mice using MC38 rectal cancer cells subcutaneously injected on the right flank, local radiation to the tumor (standard-of-care for rectal cancer), and gavage with either <i>C. albicans<\/i> (<i>Ca<\/i>) or PBS. Fungal presence within tumors was validated by staining with calcofluor white and subsequently, tumors were sent for bulk RNA-sequencing to determine differences in gene expression using DeSeq2 and a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).<br \/>In unsupervised analysis of gene expression differences between PBS-gavaged and <i>Ca<\/i>-gavaged with bulk RNA sequencing, tumors gavaged with <i>C. albicans<\/i> possessed unique gene expression and pathway analysis when compared to PBS-gavaged mice. Global differential gene expression showed 1,947 genes upregulated in <i>Ca <\/i>gavage and 593 genes upregulated in the PBS gavage (p &#60; 0.05). <i>C. albicans <\/i>colonized tumors showed decreased expression in gene pathways relating to immune activation (interferon alpha response, IL-6 and <i>STAT3<\/i> signaling), <i>p53<\/i> expression, DNA repair, oxidative phosphorylation, <i>NOTCH<\/i> signaling, and apoptosis. We subsequently used a network-based approach to identify the most important genes driving the differences in the tumors, calculating the degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities.<br \/>Several microbes have been regarded as potential contributors to decreased treatment response and survival in rectal cancer. In the case of tumors colonized with <i>C. albicans, <\/i>bulk RNA-sequencing indicates down regulation of gene pathways related to cell proliferation, immune activation, and DNA maintenance. Down regulation of gene pathways related to cell cycle control and arrest suggests that intratumoral colonization of <i>C. albicans<\/i> may causally affect tumorigenesis. Decreases in immune signaling in tumors suggest a potentially causal role of <i>C. albicans<\/i> immune suppression. These results highlight initial steps to understand how intratumoral <i>C. albicans<\/i> may be affecting rectal cancer progression and treatment response and serve as a technique to allow better insight to individual microbial impact on tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Gene expression analysis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common head and neck cancer and accounts for over 90% of cancers that develop in the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity. Additional<sup> <\/sup>carcinogenic risk factors, including tobacco, alcohol, and HPV infection are also associated with the pathogenesis of oral carcinogenesis. Unfortunately, today the failure of standard treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy underscore the need for comprehensive genomic profiling to provide a better picture of the genetic alterations and gain an improved understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in the development of potential treatment resistance as well as the identification of novel biomarkers that discriminate between smokers and non-smokers.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on biopsied Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples from OSCC patients with and without a history of smoking and treated +\/- chemotherapy. Patient samples representing matched normal tissue to serve as controls were compared to tumor squamous cell carcinoma samples and profiled using a single assay panel that includes 517 genes by both DNA and RNA NGS, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Further analysis was also performed using the NanoString nCounter&#174; PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (PCIP), 770-comprehensive gene expression panel<br \/>Results: The Neo Comprehensive<sup>TM<\/sup> Solid Tumor pan cancer assay enabled simultaneously analysis of both DNA and RNA in one integrated workflow with an accompanying Dragen<sup>TM<\/sup> bioinformatics analysis platform and provided comprehensive genomic profiling of sequence and structural variants, as well as genomic signatures such as TMB and MSI in OSCC patients. Utility of the NanoString PCIP highlighted immune-relevant gene expression changes within the different sample cohorts. The detailed molecular information highlighted by our study emphasizes the need for improved patient classification based on smoking status in the management of OSCC and also in establishing potential therapeutic options based on the many altered cell signaling pathways that we identified. By combining a multi-omics approach with expression data for immune-related genes and associated overall survival data, we provide an effective strategy and workflow for the identification of prognostic biomarkers in OSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Gene expression analysis,Smoking,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kirsteen Maclean<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qinqin Zha<sup><\/sup>, Lakshmi Chandramohan<sup><\/sup>, Anna Juncker-Jensen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NeoGenomics, Aliso Viejo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"880e8590-4196-41d8-acda-a90d4a65f922","ControlNumber":"4857","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Subsequent post-translational O-acetyl modifications add an extra layer of control by modulating many of these interactions in both normal and transformed colorectal cells. The processes through which this modification is added to sialic acids are not completely understood. To date only one gene, <i>CASD1<\/i>, has been identified to encode a sialic acid O-acetyltransferase in human cells. We used whole-genome sequencing on normal human colon tissue to identify a haplotype strongly associated with colorectal sialic acid O-acetylation, as determined by histopathological mPAS staining. Only SNP&#8217;s of a single candidate gene within the haplotype correlated perfectly in a 91-sample validation set. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of this gene in 2D cell line and 3D normal colon organoid models yielded changes to modified sialic acid levels. These findings suggest that this candidate gene functions as a novel sialic acid O-acetyltransferase in colorectal tissue and could have implications as a diagnostic tool for patients with inflammatory diseases of the bowel or as an indicator for therapeutic targets in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glycosylation,Sialic acid O-acetylation,Whole genome sequencing,Siglec,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

This immunotherapy has proven to be successful for a subtype of CRC that carries mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), despite a lack of response by microsatellite-stable CRC. For these types of non-responsive cancers, new immunotherapy targets are currently being investigated for alternative therapy such as the MAGE-A cancer testis antigen family whose expression is restricted to germline cells in normal tissue but is overexpressed in many cancer cells. In this study, we examine the relationship between MAGEA3 and MMR proteins MSH6 and PMS2. Immunohistochemical staining of CRC tissues demonstrated co-expression between MAGEA3 with both MSH6 and PMS2. Immune cells were observed to express MAGEA3 in CRC as well. To investigate the possibility of secreted MAGEA3 from tumor cells, we performed western blot analysis of CRC cell lines, ELISA, and binding assay on cell lines and the positive results suggest that MAGEA3 protein is secreted. The results suggest that MAGE-A3 may be a promising target for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Immunohistochemistry,Immune cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Understanding cooperativity between these two treatment modalities will inform novel combination treatments for GEA. Towards this end, we conducted a trial (n = 47) sequentially adding pembrolizumab to 5-FU\/platinum in previously untreated advanced GEA. Using serial biopsy of the primary tumor at baseline, after one cycle of 5-FU\/platinum, and after the addition of pembrolizumab we transcriptionally profiled 358,067 single cells and obtained TCR-sequences from single tumor-resident T cells. Stratifying patients into slow- (&#62; 6 months) and fast-progressing (&#60; 6 months) groups based on progression-free survival allowed us to quantify differences in immune, stromal and epithelial subpopulations across treatment time points. Using topic modeling with consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF), we identified gene expression programs in each population at each time point and developed a methodology to verify the stability of those programs across the cohort using cross-validation. Faster clinical progression featured decreased M1-like macrophage repolarization and increased MUC5A and MSLN containing metaplasia programs in tumor cells. We next selected features from cell state gene programs and identified trajectories of tumor cells across a spectrum of treatment sensitive and resistant states. We identified several factors that correlated with these trajectories and regulons that may be influencing them. After pembrolizumab we observed slower progression was associated with further increased CD8 T cell infiltration with increased CXCL13+ T cells. We next calculated covarying programs between patient samples at each time point and performed permutation testing to identify which programs (and respective cell types they were expressed in) were significantly correlated to infer the presence of multicellular tumor communities. We found that the tumor cell interferon program co-varied with the CXCL13 T cell program, and the emergence of a covarying module with tumor-reactive CXCL13 program expression happens as early as after the first dose of chemotherapy. To better understand the behavior of tumor reactive T cells within the tumor microenvironment, we leveraged TCR-sequencing data to study T cell clonality and diversity across treatment time points and between fast and slow progressors. Our data provide an invaluable resource to dissect chemoimmunotherapy response in tumor cells, understand T cell behavior and propose strategies to drive anti-tumor immune hub formation to expand the portion of patients benefiting from immunotherapy approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Gene expression patterns,Cancer immunotherapy,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Simultaneously, IGF2BP3 is primarily expressed in the tumor cells of squamous cell carcinoma, rather than in stromal cells, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a subtype mainly prevalent in East Asia. However, the mechanism of IGF2BP3 in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unknown and require further exploration. Our research reveals that IGF2BP3 not only plays a significant oncogenic role in tumor cells, including the activation of the Wnt pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway, and MAPK pathway, but also, the high expression of IGF2BP3 is positively correlated with the enrichment of M2 macrophages in ESCC tissues, in the TME, IGF2BP3 promotes the infiltration of M2 macrophages, ultimately facilitating the progression of ESCC. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 enhances the translation of USP36 mRNA by directly binding to its mRNA, rather than increasing the stability of mRNA. The IGF2BP3-mediated USP36 protein elevation enhances the binding capacity with CTNNB1 protein, reducing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and following improved the Wnt\/CTNNB1 pathway activating, Ultimate, IGF2BP3 aggravated the malignancy of the tumor. Additionally, the activation of the Wnt pathway promotes TGFB1 transcription and secretion, subsequently activating the polarization of M2 macrophages, infuriating the formation of the tumor immune-suppressive microenvironment, ultimately promoting the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings strongly emphasize the oncogenic role of IGF2BP3 in the progression of ESCC both in vitro and in<br \/>vivo, providing new insights and perspectives for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Macrophages,Gene regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Z.

How the bone microenvironment (BME) changes and contributes to tumoral progression in MM remains unresolved. Published data on BME are mainly produced <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> <\/i>few data are on MGUS\/SMM patients. Up to date, no single-cell RNA sequencing database of the BME cells has been described in MM. The aim of this project was to characterize for the first time at single cell level, the BME in patients with newly diagnosed MM (MMD) and MGUS\/SMM to identify alterations involved in tumoral progression. From 15 bone biopsies of MMD, MGUS and SMM patients, we depleted CD235a+, CD45+, CD31+, and CD138+ cells to enrich the rare BME non-hemopoietic cells. The CD45-CD31-CD235a-CD138- cells were analyzed by scRNAseq. Data were generated on Chromium 10X Genomics. Cellranger and Seurat pipeline in R software has been used. Cell identities were assigned by manual curation. The trajectory analysis has been made by Monocle3. Decouple R and FindMarkers were used to compare pathways, and differential gene expression (DGE) of the samples throughout the different conditions. A total of 35723 cells were profiled. We identified 13 BME cell type clusters: 7 mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) clusters (proliferating MSC, MSC DDK-OPG-, MSC DKK+, MSC RUNX2-, MSC OPG+, MSC Osteogenic, Perivascular MSC) and 6 osteoblasts (OBs) clusters (OB precursor, OB precursor LEPR+, OB BGLAP+, OB SPP1+, OB NFkB+, OB late). Psdeudotime analyses highlighted a complex trajectory of differentiation from more immature cell clusters (proliferating MSC) to late OB cluster, confirming the ability of the dataset to snapshot the <i>in vivo<\/i> complexity of BME and we highlighted an alteration of the MSCs clusters trajectories starting in SMM samples till a disruption in MM. Pathway analyses, in MMD compared to MGUS\/SMM, revealed an upregulation of VEGF and PI3K activity in proliferating MSC, perivascular MSC and OB clusters. TRAIL pathway activity, known to suppress MM cell proliferation, was upregulated in MSC osteogenic and OB BGLAP+ in MGUS. Finally, DGE analyses revealed the modulation of different genes, many not yet described in MM. MGUS MSCs clusters showed an upregulation of <i>FBLN1, SERPNF1 <\/i>and MMD MSCs clusters dramatically downregulated <i>WISP2 <\/i>and upregulated <i>SRGN<\/i>, involved in MM cell proliferation. Interestingly, in SMM samples, we reported an upregulation of genes involved both in the promotion of osteoblastogenesis (<i>SCARA3, SPON2<\/i>) and inhibition (<i>GREM1<\/i>), likely underling the attempt to contrast the establishment of altered BME, characteristic of MM. Our approach is able to dissect the complex organization of the BME and to highlight at single cells level the alterations of the BME in patients with MM compared to MGUS and SMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Single cell transcriptomic,Bone microenvironment,Premalignancy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

However, the specific stromal molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of HGPIN and their contribution to epithelial cancer cell motility and invasiveness remain poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the driver genomic alterations involved in shaping the perineoplastic stroma of HGPIN, with the goal of unraveling their role in promoting cancer invasion, and metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed gene expression profiling on laser capture microdissected perineoplastic stroma of HGPIN and PCa in tissue samples from 25 PCa cases, including 12 low-grade (Gleason 6) and 13 high-grade (Gleason &#62;\/= 8) cases. We used the standard moderated t-test from the Bioconductor limma package to assess the statistical significance of differential gene expression between perineoplastic stroma high grade PCa and perineoplastic stroma HGPIN, as well as between perineoplastic stroma low grade PCa and HGPIN. The -log10 <i>p<\/i>-values represents the level of statistical significance for each gene, while the log2 fold change represents the magnitude of gene expression difference between the two comparison groups. Additionally, we computed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) scores using the Bioconductor package and discerned the leading-edge genes among the pathways. This study is supported by the NIH-NCI-T32 program for next-generation pathologists at our institution.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the gene expression analysis comparing High Grade PCa and HGPIN, several genes, including <b><i>POSTN, BGN,<\/i> <i>GREM1<\/i><\/b><i>, C1QA, THBS4, COL1A1, COL1A2, SFRP4, <\/i><i>RNU6-847P, FCGR2P, <\/i><i>and TOMM22,<\/i> exhibited the highest level of both biological and statistical significance.

Metallomics is a relatively new discipline that studies the abundance of metal ions in biological samples. Metallomic analysis has identified differences in BC patients in elements such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) but it is unclear if these reflect metabolic changes in the tumor. In this study, we conducted metallomic profiling to characterize 55 trace elements in the circulation and in the tumor microenvironment of orthotopic mammary fat pad tumors from two isogenic BC cell lines (highly metastatic 4T1; nonmetastatic 67NR). We complemented this analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing of the tumor to determine if complementary changes occur in molecules known to utilize metals as co-factors or transporters and identify drivers of metal metabolism in different tumors. We performed analysis on systemic metal elements by examining whole blood (including blood cells and platelets) and plasma separately. Tumor samples were assessed at the whole tissue level, and we also profiled separated immune or non-immune cells from the tumor. Li, Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb were detectable within 100ul of input of whole blood or plasma. Metallomic analysis of the tumor and associated cell populations detected differential levels of Na, Mg, P, S, K Ca, Fe, Zn, and Rb from an average of 200mg of tissue or 2 million cells. Based on scRNAseq analysis, 67NR tumors were composed of greater proportions of cancer cells relative to the 4T1 tumors (79.1% vs 58.8% of tumor cells respectively) and endothelial cells (2.5% vs 1.8%). 4T1 tumors contained an increased abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (5.6% vs 2.1%) as well as immune infiltration (33.8% vs 16.3%). Fibroblasts and macrophage populations also showed elevated metal transporter expression levels based on gene expression relative to other tumor residing cell types yet minor differences induced by cancer type. Cancer cells express high levels of metal transport genes (Zn, Ca, Co, Na, Mg, Fe). 67NR cancer cells exhibited increased gene expression of many metal-transporting proteins including numerous solute carrier (<i>SLC<\/i>) group of membrane transport proteins such as <i>Slc41a2<\/i> when compared to the more aggressive 4T1 cells.

Recent pre-clinical data suggest that TEM8-targeting therapies may convert immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironments (TME) into &#8220;hot&#8221; milieu more amenable to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).<br \/>Methods: NextGen sequencing of DNA (592 genes or WES) and RNA (WTS) was performed on neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs; <i>N<\/i> = 1724), excluding small-cell lung cancer, submitted to Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Mutations were defined as pathogenic SNVs\/indels. <i>ANTXR1<\/i> expression was divided by <i>ANTXR1<\/i>-expression quartiles (transcripts per million [TPM];Q4:<sup>H<\/sup>;Q1:<sup>L<\/sup>). PD-L1 expression (SP142; Positive (+): &#8805;2+,&#8805;%5) was assessed by IHC. High tumor mutational burden (TMB-H) was defined as &#8805;10 mutations per MB. Cell infiltration in the TME was estimated by QuantiSEQ. Gene expression profiles were analyzed for transcriptional signatures predictive of response to immunotherapy (T cell-inflamed) and MAPK pathway activation score (MPAS). Overall survival (OS) data was obtained from insurance claims, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for molecularly defined subpopulations of patients. Mann-Whitney U and X<sup>2<\/sup>\/Fisher-Exact tests were applied where appropriate, with <i>p<\/i>-values adjusted for multiple comparisons (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05).<br \/>Results: NENs from the adrenal gland had the highest median <i>ANTXR1<\/i> expression (50 TPM), followed by those from the colon and rectum (43.5), genitourinary organs (43.3), and small bowel (excluding appendix) (39.2). The lowest median <i>ANTXR1<\/i> expression was observed in NENs from the pancreas (31.5). No pathogenic mutations were significantly associated with <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>H <\/sup>vs <sup>L<\/sup> tumors (<i>p<\/i>&#62;0.05 for all), along with no differences in the prevalence of TMB-H (8.6% vs 12.6%, <i>p<\/i>=1) or PD-L1+ (5.8%: vs 3.1%, <i>p<\/i>=1). A greater proportion of B cells (5.34 % vs 3.78%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), M1 (1.46% vs 0.15%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) and M2 macrophages (3.92% vs 2.67%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), and T-regulatory cells (1.77% vs 1.08%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) was observed in ANTXR1<sup>H<\/sup> TMEs, which were more frequently classified as T cell-inflamed compared to <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>L<\/sup> (42% vs 8%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>H<\/sup> tumors also had higher MPAS compared to <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>L<\/sup> (1.16 vs -1.61 arbitrary units, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). There was no significant difference in median OS between <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>H<\/sup> vs <sup>L<\/sup> tumors (18.8 mo. vs 21.2 months, Hazard Ratio:1.18, <i>p<\/i>=0.114).<br \/>Conclusion: The increased immune cell infiltrate and prevalence of T-cell inflamed status among <i>ANTXR1<\/i><sup>H<\/sup> NENs suggests these tumors might be more responsive to treatment with ICIs. As trials incorporating intratumoral injections of SVV-01 in combination with ICIs are underway, further investigation of clinical and molecular associations with <i>ANTXR1<\/i> expression in NENs is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor antigen,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Although PABC is a rare subgroup of BC, the outcome of PABC is worse than BC developed in the same age group unrelated to pregnancy. The proliferation and involution of mammary gland during and after pregnancy create a unique immune microenvironment in the breast. Comprehensive profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment in PABC is important but lacking.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively identified PABC patients from electronic medical records and their tumor blocks from pathology department in our institution. Age- and stage-matched BC patients were selected as control group. NanoString Breast Cancer 360 Gene Expression panel and Opal Polaris 7 color immunohistochemical (IHC) were utilized to profile PABC from transcriptome and protein levels.<br \/>Result: PABC (N=26), BC developed 2 years (BC&#62;2Y, N=54) after pregnancy, and matched non-pregnant BC patients (NPBC, N=27) were included in the final analysis respectively. Samples from BC&#62;2Y (remote influence from pregnancy) and NPBC (pregnancy did not contribute to BC) both served as control groups for PABC patients in our study. PAM50 subtyping categorized patients into luminal A(N=42), luminal B(N=26), basal(N=12), and HER2 (N=25) enriched subgroups. In multiplex IHC analysis, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, CD20+ cells, and CD68+\/CD163+ (M2) cells were all statistically higher in the tumor samples from PABC and BC&#62;2Y than from NPBC. This suggests a potential contribution of pregnancy in the immune microenvironment. In the luminal A subgroup, CD8+ cells, CD20+ cells, and CD68+\/CD163+ cells remain statistically higher in the PABC than in the NPBC samples. In NanoString BC360 transcriptomic profiling, immune cell abundance was evaluated from representative gene signatures. Mast cells were significantly lower in the PABC group than in the NPBC group. Cytotoxic T cells are significantly higher both in the PABC and BC&#62;2Y groups than in the NPBC group.<br \/>Conclusion: We are the first study to profile immune microenvironment using both transcriptomic and IHC methods. Our study is also unique in using NPBC and BC&#62;2Y patients as control groups for PABC patients. CD8+ T cells are statistically higher in PABC patients than in NPBC patients using either transcriptomic profiling or multiplex IHC analysis. M2 macrophages, which promote tumor growth, are abundant in all the PABC and the luminal A PABC samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immune cells,Tumor microenvironment,Pregnancy associated breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.-C.

BE progresses to EAC within an inflammation rich environment, however a detailed understanding of the types of inflammatory cells present, how that population changes over time or diagnosis, and the related immunomodulatory pathways that may mediate BEs progression is still understudied. Traditional immunohistochemistry is often inadequate to provide detailed information about a broad number of cells, local cellular proportions, and cellular heterogeneity; while bulk or single cell RNA sequencing lose the spatial context and relationships between the stroma and epithelium. Utilizing modern multiplex profiling technologies such as Nanostring&#8217;s GeoMx digital Profiler (DSP) aid in identifying both cellular composition and distribution of cells within the epithelium and stroma. Therefore, our aim of this study was to determine the suitability of the DSP platform for analyzing formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) endoscopic samples of BE and determine any differences between non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) samples from patients who eventually progressed (progressors) compared to those who did not (non-progressors), with the goal to gain deeper insights about cellular composition and spatial distribution of immune cells that may dictate progression of BE. Our secondary goal was to investigate the relationship of these cells to the BE epithelial cells through understanding the immune signaling and regulatory pathways. Our pilot study utilizing a 49-plex antibody panel on 7 NDBE samples from progressors and 8 NDBE samples from non-progressors showed good quality metrics and deciphered an immune rich microenvironment in BE with several immune markers including CD66b (neutrophils), CD14 (monocytes), CD68 (macrophages) and CD56 (NK cells) being overexpressed in the stroma of progressors compared with non-progressors, corrected p value less than 0.05. The myeloid activation marker CD80 was overexpressed in the BE epithelial cells of progressors. To determine how spatial transcriptomic profiling performed in FFPE endoscopic samples, 1,812 transcripts within 48 regions of interest of four BE, HGD, and EAC samples was interrogated. Only 36 (2%) probes fell below the limit of detection quality threshold. Thus, our pilot results show that robust proteomic and transcriptomic profiling can be obtained from endoscopic BE biopsies using this system. Based on these results, we systematically interrogated the immune cell makeup and distribution as well as their related inflammatory and immunoregulatory pathways in 40 NDBE biopsies (20 progressors and 20 with stable non-progressing disease) within discrete compartments (stroma and epithelium) through spatial whole transcriptome profiling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Barrett's esophagus,Microenvironment,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.
