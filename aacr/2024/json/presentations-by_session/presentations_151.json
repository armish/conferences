Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a significant proportion of solid tumors, including breast cancer. TAMs play a major role in tumorigenesis as they can enhance tumor cell growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. In addition, TAMs can inhibit anti-tumor responses of T cells. Our recent work has shown that removal or conversion of TAMs to an anti-tumor phenotype enhances chemo- and immuno-therapy establishing TAMs as targets for anti-cancer therapy. Using high-dimensional single-cell and multi-omics profiling of murine and human breast tumors we reveal multiple subsets of TAMs with distinct transcriptional and activity profiles that correlate with progression of disease and response to therapy. This work has revealed the complexity of TAMs and major gaps in our knowledge of the functional and phenotypic characterization of TAM subsets associated with cancer, before and after treatment. Here we will discuss the complexity of TAMs in solid tumors including characterizing TAM subsets, location, and crosstalk with neighboring cells, as well as novel TAM-modulating strategies and combinations that are likely to enhance current therapies and overcome chemo- and immuno-therapy resistance. Our findings support the idea that targeting TAMs offers great potential to enhance both chemo- and immuno-therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jennifer L.
