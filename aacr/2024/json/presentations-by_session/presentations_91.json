It has traditionally been proposed that heightened resistance to apoptosis\/cell cycle arrest can account for clonal advantage. P53 mediated clonal dominance has also been observed in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells, though it is not clear how this is established. Using live cell imaging we show that human ES cells (hESCs) mutant for TP53 induce death of hES-WT cells and outcompete them. Competition is mediated by apoptosis induction and requires direct cell contact, as in co-cultures of hES-P53KO and hES-WT cells where contact is prevented competition is not observed. To ask if hES-P53KO competition is mediated by mechanical interactions, we cultured cells on deformable membranes to measure their resistance to cell compaction. Interestingly, while hES-WT cells displayed apoptosis induction upon cell compaction, hES-P53KO cells were resistant to compaction-induced apoptosis. We suggest that differential sensitivity to compaction in crowded cultures\/tissues can drive p53-induced competitive cell elimination. Identifying the mechanisms by which p53 confers resistance to cell compaction could lead to novel actionable targets to prevent the expansion of p53 mutant stem cells in cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-02 Cell-cell interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,p53,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eugenia Piddini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Every week, the entire epithelium is replaced by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside in crypt-like structures within the monolayer. Within these crypts, a small number of ISCs continuously divide to provide all specialized cell types necessary to maintain normal intestinal homeostasis, while simultaneously competing with each other for a position within the crypt bottom. This competition, characterized by neutral loss-and-replacement events, can be drastically disturbed when one of the ISCs acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage. As a result, mutant ISCs will replace all normal ISCs, colonize the intestinal crypt, and facilitate the initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC).<br \/>CRC development is a stepwise process characterized by the accumulation of mutations in cancer driver genes over time. Almost 80% of all CRCs present with early mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>APC<\/i>, leading to constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway and the formation of pre-malignant adenomas. We have previously demonstrated that, within individual crypts, <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant ISCs have a competitive advantage over normal ISCs, although the mechanism underlying this unequal competition remained unclear. Recently, we revealed that <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant ISCs in fact act as \"supercompetitors\" by secreting Wnt antagonists such as NOTUM, WIF1 and DKK2, that actively disadvantage neighboring wild type ISCs by forcing them do differentiate. We demonstrated that boosting wild type fitness by downstream pharmacological activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by GSK3&#946;-inhibitor lithium rendered wild type ISCs resistant to the Wnt antagonists, reduced the number of <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant crypts, and prevented adenoma formation. Together, this work highlights that modulating cell competition between normal and mutant cells within the crypt can provide a novel approach to prevent CRC development. Our findings are particularly relevant for<i> familial adenomatous polyposis<\/i> (FAP) patients, that carry germline mutations in <i>APC<\/i> and are predisposed to the development of CRC. Based on our fundamental discoveries, we are currently performing a clinical trial to assess the chemopreventive effect of lithium on the expansion of <i>APC<\/i>-mutant clones in FAP patients [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05402891].<br \/>Importantly, it is becoming increasingly evident that intestinal adenomas do not form from a single <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant crypt, but require fields of multiple mutant crypts to facilitate tumor initiation. Although field cancerization by enhanced crypt fission has been observed for several oncogenic mutants in the gut (e.g. <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>, <i>PIK3CA<sup>H1047R<\/sup><\/i>), <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant cells are often contained within individual crypts. This indicates that multiple independent mutant clones may act cooperatively to facilitate tumorigenesis, thereby pointing towards a polyclonal origin of intestinal adenomas. Our current work investigates how <i>Apc<\/i>-mutant clones interact by modifying their local environment through reciprocal signalling with stromal and epithelial cells to escape the anatomical constraints of the crypt, thereby unlocking their oncogenic potential in the gut. Ultimately, unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying clonal cooperation will inform potential chemoprevention strategies for CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Colorectal cancer,Target discovery,Chemoprevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanne Van Neerven<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Using cancer metastatic latency models, we show that cell competition results in the displacement of latent metastatic (Lat-M) cells from the primary tumor. Lat-M cells resist anoikis and survive as residual metastatic disease. A remodeled extracellular matrix facilitates Lat-M cell displacement and survival in circulation. Disrupting cell competition dynamics by depleting secreted protein and rich in cysteine (SPARC) reduced displacement from orthotopic tumors and attenuated metastases. In contrast, depletion of SPARC after extravasation in lung-resident Lat-M cells increased metastatic outgrowth. Furthermore, multiregional transcriptomic analyses of matched primary tumors and metachronous metastases from patients with kidney cancer identified tumor subclones with Lat-M traits. Kidney cancer enriched for these Lat-M traits had a rapid onset of metachronous metastases and significantly reduced disease-free survival. Thus, an unexpected consequence of cell competition is the displacement of cells with Lat-M potential, thereby shaping metastatic latency and relapse. Overall, we demonstrate that cell competition within the primary tumor results in the displacement of Lat-M cells. We are investigating the impact of altering cell competition dynamics on metastatic incidence that may guide strategies to limit metastatic recurrences.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,cell competition ,Matrix Remodeling ,Metastatic Dormancy ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Srinivas Malladi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
