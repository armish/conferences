[{"Abstract":"Cardiotoxicity is the second leading cause of death among cancer survivors and can manifest as arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, or pericarditis\/myocarditis. Chronic myocyte damage and apoptosis can transition from an asymptomatic phase to adaptive myocardial hypertrophy, followed by decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, and eventual heart failure. Cardio-oncology is an emerging field that studies cancer therapy-associated cardiotoxicities. The development of reliable and effective preclinical models for cardiotoxicity prediction and prevention is essential to improving the long-term cardiac health of cancer patients. Zebrafish are a promising animal model for the field of cardio-oncology and have emerged as an invaluable tool for investigating genetic and molecular aspects of cardiovascular research. Zebrafish heart cells are like human heart cells at the molecular level, making them an ideal system for studying the genetic underpinning of cardiac function. Zebrafish myl7 gene, a myosin light chain-7 gene, is a regulatory gene of heart orthologs to human MYL7. In-vivo imaging is limited due to the opacification of skin and subdermal structures. To conduct in-vivo whole organism imaging studies, skin transparency is a primary requirement, necessitating the blocking of pigmentation. The Zebrafish Casper mutant maintains skin transparency throughout its life, offering the ideal combination of sensitivity and resolution for in-vivo analyses and imaging. In this study, we have developed a novel transparent transgenic zebrafish model and established time-lapse in-vivo confocal microscopy to study cellular phenotype\/pathologies of cardiomyocytes. The newly developed homozygous transparent transgenic Casper\/ myl7:RFP; annexin-5:YFP\/NF-kB: GFP\/mpeg1:mcherryFP, <\/i>allows us to study cell death process (Annexin5) and inflammatory activity (NF-kB) in microglia and cardiomyocytes. We have successfully established in vivo fluorescence and confocal microscopy in this newly developed strain, enabling the study of cellular morphology and function changes under various conditions. This will allow us to elucidate cell death patterns, and cardio-inflammatory and cardiotoxicity pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-10 Zebrafish models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cardiotoxicity,Zebrafish,In vivo imaging,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Microglia play key roles in the healthy brain, ranging from phagocytosis of dying neurons and CNS debris to modulating adaptability. The role of microglia has been well documented but their specific contributions to the development and progression of cancers, such as glioblastoma, have recently garnered wide attention. The zebrafish have proven novel tool for modeling innate immune responses. A macrophage-specific marker mpeg1 and its promoter are used in mpeg1-driven transgenes. mpeg1-driven transgenes mpeg1:mCherryFP are expressed in macrophage-lineage cells that do not express neutrophil-marking transgenes. These zebrafish transgenes contribute to the fields of inflammation, infection, and leukocyte biology.

Notably, oncogenic functions of AR rely on chromatin-binding regulatory proteins, which includes a pioneer transcription factor called FOXA1. FOXA1 de-compacts chromatin to enable AR&#8217;s binding to the DNA and expression of it's target genes. Recently, our lab found FOXA1 alterations to recur within three distinct structural classes in over 35% of metastatic castration resistant PCa (mCRPC) in Caucasian men. Subsequent studies found FOXA1 mutations to be prevalent in over 40% of primary PCa in Chinese men, positioning FOXA1 as a principal oncogene in this disease. Yet, hitherto, no studies have defined the pathobiology of FOXA1 alterations in mouse models. Here, we have developed the first-in-field transgenic mice with conditional overexpression of FOXA1 mutants in the prostate luminal epithelia. We found truncal FOXA1 Class1<sup> <\/sup>mutants to initiate luminal hyperplasia in a monogenic model, or hyperproliferative prostate adenocarcinoma in a compound Trp53-deficient genetic background. Mechanistically, Class1 mutants concurrently upregulate the AR and mTORC1\/2 pathways to drive transformation, with this being the first report of FOXA1-driven PCa formation in mice. In contrast, FOXA1 Class2 mutants&#8212;which are acquired in mCRPC&#8212;do not drive prostate luminal transformation. Instead, single-cell multi-omics (RNA+ATAC) profiling of Class2-mutant mouse prostate tissue uncovered extensive transcriptional remodeling of epithelial cells into a luminal stem-like cell fate, leading to a dramatic 15-20-fold expansion of the progenitor population vs control tissue. These luminal stem cells are similar to the Club\/Hillock cells detected in the human prostate that have been implicated in driving resistance to ADT. Consistently, we found Class2-mutant prostates to show minimal atrophy upon castration, with immunohistological assessment uncovering a higher density of Ki67+ luminal epithelial cells relative to wild type and Class1 tissues. Class2-mutant organoids also showed higher subcutaneous grafting ability in mice in limiting dilution assays. Mechanistically, we found the cistromically-dominant Class2 mutants to pioneer over 40,000 <i>neo<\/i>-enhancer elements harboring motifs of stemness-associated transcription factors, which in turn instruct the ADT-resistant luminal progenitor gene program. Altogether, findings from our mouse models uncover FOXA1&#8217;s versatility as a driver oncogene that, depending on the mutation type, either activates enhancer-wired luminal tumorigenesis (Class1-initiating event) or therapy resistance-associated stemness (Class2-promoting alteration) gene programs in the mouse prostate tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Hormone receptors,Tumorigenesis,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanjana Eyunni<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Abhijit Parolia<sup><\/sup>, Eleanor Young<sup><\/sup>, James Matthew George<sup><\/sup>, Rahul Mannan<sup><\/sup>, Sandra  E.

LUSC patients suffer from high prevalence of relapse and a dismal 5-year survival of only ~24%. The lack of animal models that reflect the salient features of human disease to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of LUSC tumor biology, is a major impediment for LUSC patients. We have identified concomitant 3q26 copy number gain (CNG) and <i>TP53 <\/i>loss as a defining genetic alteration present in ~90% of LUSC tumors. Furthermore, we have identified and characterized three 3q26 oncogenes (<i>PRKCI<\/i>, <i>ECT2 and SOX2) <\/i>that genetically and biochemically collaborate to drive LUSC tumor formation. Using syngeneic mouse modeling, we have demonstrated that coordinate overexpression of <i>Prkci<\/i>, <i>Ect2<\/i> and <i>Sox2<\/i>, and loss of <i>Trp53<\/i> in <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures of lung basal stem cells (LBSCs; a cell of origin for LUSC) drives transformation of these cells into tumors of exclusively LUSC histopathology.

This expression profile renders CLDN18.2 an ideal tumor associated antigen (TAA) for CAR-T targeting and an armored targeted CAR-T, AZD6422, is in clinical development. While CAR-T are beginning to show clinical promise in solid tumors, a consistent challenge is to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) where immune and stromal cells secrete high levels of TGFb. Since the majority of pre-clinical CAR-T efficacy data is generated utilizing immunocompromised mouse models, which lack a proper TME, the team utilized syngeneic xenograft models to circumvent this challenge. &#8203; In vitro studies showed that CLDN18.2 targeted murine CAR-T cells generated by retroviral transduction induced efficient cytolysis of target positive mouse tumor cells accompanied by cytokine release. To model the clinical scenario, tumor-bearing mice were lymphodepleted with total body irradiation (TBI) to enhance CAR-T engraftment. The dosage of TBI used in these studies was predetermined to have caused leukopenia and minimal impact on tumor growth. We observed substantial tumor control and extended tumor efficacy in mice treated with mCAR-T cells compared to those infused with untransduced T cells or in non-target bearing control tumors in the absence of gross toxicities. &#8203; This syngeneic mouse model platform will additionally allow us to investigate how mCAR-T cells perform within a fully competent TME in combination with other therapeutic agents targeting cancer cells via altered mechanism of action. &#8203;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mouse models,Gastric cancer,CLDN18.2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In bladder cancer, the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is widely activated by mutation but untargeted. Our study focuses on developing an immunocompetent, CRISPR-edited bladder cancer mouse model that mirrors common PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR mutations. We aim to establish genotype-effective kinase inhibitor pairings using <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR-edited organoids and Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) to create a pro-tumorigenic environment <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> Urothelial cells were isolated from the bladder of Rosa26 Lox-Stop-Lox-Cas9\/GFP transgenic mice to develop organoids. These organoids were co-edited for <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Rb1<\/i> KO, and further editing of the <i>Pten<\/i> gene resulted in a nine-fold increase in sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor ipatasertib. Despite successful engraftment into mouse bladder, these edited cells regressed before tumor formation, and intradermal injection did not yield subcutaneous tumors. An alternate model featuring a <i>9p21<\/i> deletion with <i>Trp53<\/i> KO also displayed similar regression post-engraftment into bladder or skin. However, co-injection with skin-cancer-derived CAFs subcutaneously yielded palpable subcutaneous tumors that grew for 12 weeks. Enhancing orthotopic model fidelity, we established a BBN bladder-tumor-derived CAF line, leading to the formation of tumors with squamous differentiation upon intramural co-injection with edited organoids. These models displayed immune-excluded architecture and a predominance of M2 over M1 macrophages. Following our accomplishments in establishing bladder tumors, we aimed to enhance our model's adaptability by introducing common PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR mutations, specifically <i>TSC1\/TSC2<\/i> KO and <i>Pik3ca<\/i> hotspots, into our <i>9p21\/Trp53<\/i> KO model. While <i>TSC1\/TSC2<\/i> KO lines exhibited elevated P-S6K signaling, they displayed resistance to Torin 1, Voxtalisib, and Everolimus&#8212;kinase inhibitors targeting mTORC1\/2. In parallel, we employed CRISPR-mediated HDR to successfully introduce a <i>Pik3ca<\/i> H1047R hotspot into our <i>9p21\/Trp53<\/i> KO model, as evidenced by increased Phosphorylation of AKT compared to wild-type <i>9p21\/Trp53<\/i> KO cell lines.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our research establishes the crucial role of CAFs in bladder tumor formation.

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are critical to studying tumorigenesis and tumor-immune interactions in DMG, which may inform the design of new urgently-needed treatment approaches. One approach to generate DMG GEMMs uses RCAS\/tv-a, an avian retrovirus gene delivery system to express transgenes in specific brain cell lineages in the mouse brain. However, this approach often requires resource-intensive breeding to generate mice with the desired genetic alterations in their germline. As a result, we aimed to establish a new approach that combines this system with CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing technology. This methodology has been described for model adult supratentorial gliomas in mice but has not been described for pediatric or brainstem gliomas. To express Cas9 and the avian retrovirus receptor TVA in mouse neural stem cells, we bred mice of genotype Nestin-TVA; Nestin-Cre; LoxP-STOP-LoxP-Cas9-EGFP. RCAS retrovirus plasmids were generated containing various guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting DMG-relevant genes for disruption by Cas9, including <i>Trp53<\/i>, <i>Cdkn2a<\/i>, <i>Atm<\/i>, <i>Ppm1d<\/i>, <i>Pten<\/i>, and a non-targeting control (Cntl). For each gRNA, two plasmids were generated, one with a platelet-derived growth factor beta ligand (PDGFB) oncogene driver and one with a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) marker. In a pilot experiment, avian fibroblast cells transduced with RCAS-Trp53_gRNA_BFP and RCAS-Cntl_gRNA-PDGFB were injected into postnatal day 4 mouse brainstems of the aforementioned genotype and observed for tumor formation. High grade tumor formation was observed. We also observed high grade tumors in mice of genotype Nestin-TVA; LoxP-STOP-LoxP-Cas9-EGFP when injected with an additional RCAS-Cre construct, indicating that Cre can be expressed from the mouse germline or delivered via a retrovirus payload to drive tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed tumor features that model human DMG, expression of Cas9 and PDGFB, and loss of p53. Thus, RCAS\/tv-a and CRISPR\/Cas9 can be combined to model pediatric glioma tumorigenesis in the mouse brainstem. This approach to mouse modeling will streamline future GEMM DMG research by allowing new genes of interest to be rapidly perturbed by simply generating RCAS retrovirus constructs. The workflow may also enable sophisticated experiments such as pooled <i>in vivo <\/i>genetic experiments that screen gRNAs targeting various tumor suppressor genes or therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,RCAS\/tv-a,Diffuse Midline Glioma,Genetically Engineering Mouse Models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

SCLC is a highly aggressive and deadly neuroendocrine malignancy. Two major factors that contribute to the high mortality of SCLC are (1) early metastasis and (2) rapid development of therapy resistance. Recent research suggests upregulation of EMT and the EMT transcription factor Twist1 correlated with accelerated tumor progression and CRT resistance in SCLC. Due to the lack of suitable animal models, the causal relationship between the EMT program and SCLC tumorigenesis and therapy response has not been rigorously investigated. To this end, we have generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) termed RPGT (<i>Rb1<sup>Flox<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>Flox<\/sup>; ROSA26<sup>LSL-rtTA-IRES-EGFP<\/sup>; Twist1-TetO<sub>7<\/sub>-Luc<\/i>). The RPGT GEMM enables the generation of autochthonous SCLC tumors after induction with Cre recombinase adenovirus. By withdrawing or providing doxycycline to mice, we can control Twist1 expression to activate or inactivate EMT in tumors. Upon characterizing mouse tumor samples with histological and molecular analyses, we observed that both control (no Twist1 overexpression) and Twist1-overexpressing RPGT mice developed neuroendocrine SCLC tumors. While SCLC-A was the predominant subtype in both cohorts, RPGT tumors exhibited more heterogeneity. Importantly, although no difference in tumorigenesis was observed, Twist1 overexpression dramatically increased the metastatic incidence in RPGT (87-100%) compared to control (25-50%) animals, indicating an important role of EMT in SCLC dissemination. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling of primary tumors and matching metastases in RPGT mice revealed downregulation of Twist1 and EMT in metastases, suggesting that EMT suppression was necessary for metastatic outgrowth. To evaluate the impact of EMT activation on SCLC sensitivity to CRT, we performed <i>in vitro <\/i>viability assays on primary tumor cell lines established from RPGT tumors. We found that repressing Twist1 expression enhanced SCLC susceptibility to CRT. To validate these results <i>in vivo<\/i>, we treated RPGT mice with vs. without Twist1 overexpression with CRT. Consistent with our <i>in vitro <\/i>results, our <i>in vivo <\/i>data indicated that Twist1 overexpression promoted CRT resistance in SCLC tumors. Overall, our data suggest that the EMT program plays an important role in SCLC differentiation, metastasis, and resistance against chemo-radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Mouse models,Therapy resistance,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Mutations in a histone modifier, UTX (KDM6A) are common in prostate cancer (PCa), which is frequently associated with loss of its counterpart UTY (KDM6C). However, mechanisms underlying the development of UTX-deficient PCa are not clear. We aimed to address this issue by generating and analyzing genetically-engineered mice.<br \/>Methods: We generated mice with deletion of both <i>Utx<\/i> and <i>Uty<\/i> in the prostate tissue (<i>Utx<\/i>&#916;, <i>Uty<\/i>&#916;) and crossed with mice with a heterozygous deletion of <i>p53<\/i> (<i>p53<\/i>+\/&#8722;) to create <i>Utx<\/i>&#916;, <i>Uty<\/i>&#916; and<i> p53<\/i>+\/&#8722; compound mice. High-fat diet (HFD) that is known to promote cancer growth was administered to mice. We found that <i>Utx<\/i>&#916;, <i>Uty<\/i>&#916;,<i> p53<\/i>+\/&#8722; mice treated with HFD developed PCa with Gleason score (GS) = 3+3. Isolated prostate tissues were subjected to pathologic, molecular, and cellular analyses. In addition, RM-2 mouse PCa cells which do not express UTY were knocked down for <i>Utx<\/i> (si<i>Utx<\/i>) and <i>control<\/i> (si<i>NC<\/i>) by siRNAs to assess changes in the abilities of proliferation and migration.<br \/>Results: RM-2 si<i>Utx <\/i>cells showed increased proliferation and migration compared with RM-2 si<i>NC<\/i> cells. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA seq) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using mouse prostate tissues, we found that loss of UTX in the prostate activated inflammatory pathways, whereas inactivated DNA damage repair pathways. Immunostaining prostate tissues with an antibody to a macrophage marker, F4\/80, exhibited significant accumulation of macrophages in <i>Utx<\/i>&#916;, <i>Uty<\/i>&#916;, <i>p53<\/i>+\/+ mice compared to <i>Utx<\/i>+, <i>Uty<\/i>&#916;, <i>p53<\/i>+\/+ mice.

Chronic intestinal inflammation, as observed in poorly controlled inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), leads to the development of inflammation-associated cancer. Thus, a deeper understanding of the regulatory system that controls intestinal homeostasis is essential. Retinoblastoma-binding protein 9 (RBBP9) is expressed in a range of human cancer cells. RBBP9 was initially reported to have the ability to regulate the cell cycle pathway. More recent studies have identified RBBP9 as a serine hydrolase (SH) that promotes cancer progression by subverting the anti-proliferative function of TGF&#946; in a pancreatic cancer model. However, little is known about the roles RBBP9 plays in the development of intestinal cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of RBBP9 in inflammation and inflammation-associated cancer in the intestine. Analyses of surgically resected human samples and publicly available datasets demonstrated that RBBP9 expression was reduced in patient samples of ulcerative colitis (UC) and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Genetically knockout mice for Rbbp9 (<i>Rbbp9<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>) were susceptible to experimental colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Furthermore, <i>Rbbp9<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice exhibited enhanced azoxymethane\/DSS-induced tumorigenesis, a model for human CAC. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of these tumors showed increased enrichment of inflammation-associated signatures, including interferon signaling pathways. Ex vivo organoid experiments revealed the suppressive function of RBBP9 in interferon signaling-mediated apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium. Simultaneous inhibition of RBBP9 and STAT1, a downstream transcription factor of interferon signaling, reverted the apoptotic phenotype of <i>Rbbp9<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> organoids. Collectively, our data provide insight into the understanding of the crucial role of RBBP9 in protecting against intestinal inflammation and inflammation-related tumorigenesis via regulating the interferon signaling-mediated apoptotic pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Colorectal cancer,Inflammatory bowel disease,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Historically pre-clinical models have failed to predict response in humans, despite promising preclinical data. Moreover, current models seldom incorporate surgical resection and\/or standard of care chemotherapy treatment. These models also commonly employ young animals exclusively, whose immune contexture differs from older patients. We therefore sought to establish an improved, orthotopic, preclinical GBM model, which better recapitulates patient response to standard-of-care and targeted treatments.<br \/>Methods: NFpp10a-Luc2 GBM cells were orthotopically implanted into C57BL\/6-mice (aged[&#62;18months] and young[6-8weeks]) and weekly bioluminescence imaging performed to monitor tumor growth. Overall survival (OS) and tumor growth were assessed in response to (1) Surgical Resection, (2) Temozolomide (TMZ) (3) anti-PD1 (4) neoadjuvant anti-PD1 and (5) Regorafenib (REGO) therapy. Tissue collected post-mortem underwent bulk RNA sequencing followed by analysis via microenvironment cell population counter (MCP) and gene set enrichment (GSEA) to determine changes in the GBM-TME following treatment.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated OS advantage in aged mice undergoing surgical resection (Resection:33.5 days vs Non-Resection: 18 days; p=0.0166) and observed age to be a significant prognostic factor (Young:62 days vs Aged: 22 days; p=0.0002). Subsequently, we observed that TMZ and anti-PD1 monotherapies had no impact on NFpp10-Luc2 growth (p=0.9001, p=0.7933) or survival (p=0.3035, p=0.6328). Neoadjuvant anti-PD1 treated mice demonstrated no significant survival advantage compared to IgG control (33 days vs 35 days; p=0.9429). Lastly, REGO treatment demonstrated a trend towards improved OS vs Vehicle (p=0.096). MCP analysis revealed both neoadjuvant anti-PD1 and REGO treatment induced influx of CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes into the TME, with neoadjuvant anti-PD1 associated with an upregulation of CXCR3 (p=0.0045).<br \/>Conclusions: We have, for the first time, established and characterized response of the NFpp10a-C57BL\/6 model to surgical resection, TMZ, anti-PD1 and REGO therapy in both young and aged mice. We have shown the model is markedly insensitive to intervention with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint therapy, mirroring what is seen clinically in patients. The model may therefore be employed in future pre-clinical studies to guide clinical trials in the setting of mesenchymal GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Preclinical,Tumor microenvironment,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common type of RCC. c-Met activating mutations have been associated with Type 1 PRCC which are made up of small cells containing basophilic cytoplasm covering papillae and tubular structures. In patients with PRCC, c-MetH1112Y missense mutations are associated with both somatic and germline mutations. Previous functional studies indicate codon H1112 plays an important structural role in maintaining c-Met in the inactive conformation and alterations at this codon, including H1112Y, likely disrupt this interaction facilitating constitutive activation with increased c-MET activity. A c-MetH1112Y (c-MetHY) transgene with tetO promoter sequence was micro-injected into the mouse oocyte. Transgenic mice carrying this transgene have the ability to express this activated Met protein in cells expressing rtTA (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator) and when doxycycline is present. Mutant mice harboring this transgene along with additional trp53 mutations showed glomeruloid like Type 1 PRCC. Our in vivo studies confirmed the expression of c-MetHY gene within the kidney and Lrp2 and Ki67 staining indicated that PRCC arises from PT (proximal tubule). PRCC canonical markers CK7, AMACR and MET expression confirmed the Type1 PRCC in our mouse model. Additionally Pan-CK, E-Cad positive expression in mutant mice further confirmed PRCC arises from epithelial cells. We have generated and described type 1 PRCC mouse model with activating-MetHY mutation. This mouse model will help illustrate the oncogenic mechanism of Met activation and identify the critical events during progression of PRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Mutations,c-Met,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Preet Lal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Li Ding<sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Chen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine-Nephrology, Washington University In St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine-Oncology, Washington University In St. Louis, Saint Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5ca4edad-fb7b-4e97-b4f7-7bf8781b492d","ControlNumber":"7217","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

However early reports of resistance with inactive state-selective KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors have highlighted the pressing need for rational combination partners. While preclinical combination strategies to enhance KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibition and combat innate resistance have already been reported for pancreatic and colorectal cancer, the application of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitors alongside combination partners in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-driven NSCLC has not been investigated.<u><\/u> Here we compared KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>- and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-initiated lung tumorigenesis using isogenic genetically engineered mouse models and human and mouse cell models of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-driven NSCLC initiation to compare oncopotency and signaling of each subtype. We then examined whether signaling differences observed at initiation persist in established tumors. We identified that KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> is more potent than KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> in inducing tumor formation. This higher potency was accompanied by co-operative activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis. Disruption of this pathway using either an AKT inhibitor or mTORC1-specific inhibitor (RMC-6272, a preclinical tool compound representative of the clinical candidate RMC-5552) led to a greater reduction in transformation and proliferation in a KRAS<sup>G12D-<\/sup>driven lung initiation model compared to the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> counterpart. Although differences between these oncogenic phenotypes become less distinguishable once tumors are established, signaling dependencies and vulnerabilities are still preserved. For instance, KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>lung tumor cells are relatively more susceptible to ERK and MEK inhibition, while KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>lung tumor cells are more susceptible to AKT and mTORC1 inhibition. Inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis alongside KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibition (MRTX1133) induced a robust, synergistic apoptotic response in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> tumor cell lines of varying sensitivity to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibition alone, highlighting a potential combinatorial approach to override intrinsic resistance to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> inhibitors. Our preclinical data identify treatment vulnerabilities and suggest patient selection strategies for combination approaches that should be i) contextualized to individual RAS mutants, and ii) tailored to their downstream signaling programs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Lung cancer: non-small cell,mTOR,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Genomic sequencing of human PDAC tissues and cell lines have identified four molecular subtypes: quasimesenchymal (QM), pancreatic progenitor, immunogenic, and aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX). QM-PDAC has the worse prognosis, but no <i>in vivo<\/i> models exist for this molecular subtype. Our preliminary analysis using publicly available data demonstrated that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor <i>TWIST1<\/i> is upregulated in QM-PDAC. We hypothesized that the <i>TWIST1<\/i>-dependent plasticity program was a key regulator of QM-PDAC subtype development. We created a tetracycline-inducible tissue specific <i>Twist1<\/i> PDAC genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). Tumor development in the mouse pancreatic ductal epithelium was directed using the <i>Pdx1 promoter-Cre<\/i> (P) allele leading to stable native expression of the <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> oncogene (R) and <i>LSL-rtTA-IRES-GFP<\/i> (G) alleles. The non-<i>Twist1<\/i> GEMM (PGR) was crossed with the <i>Twist1-tetO-Luc<\/i> (T) mouse to create the PGRT model which allows inducible expression of <i>Twist1<\/i> and<i> luciferase<\/i> in pancreatic epithelium under doxycycline treatment (Tet-ON system). Tumor progression, lineage tracing and metastatic invasion are followed by fluorescence (GFP) and bioluminescence (BLI) imaging. The characterization of this novel PGRT mouse model showed decreased overall survival compared to control non-<i>Twist1<\/i> containing mice (~35 weeks PGRT (n=17) vs ~60 weeks PGR (n=10)). Histological and immunohistochemistry analyses showed the PGRT pancreatic tumors resemble the QM-PDAC subtype and vimentin overexpression correlates with <i>Twist1<\/i>-dependent induction of EMT. We attempted to confirm the QM-PDAC profile via cellular markers: GATA6-, HNF1A-, KRT81+, KRT17+, KRT20+, P63+ and &#8710;P63+. The PGR and standard KPC (<i>Kras<sup>+\/LSL-G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>+LSL-R172H<\/sup>; Pdx1-Cre<\/i>) PDAC model were also profiled. We observed that 75% of the PGRT tumors displayed a QM-PDAC profile, contrasting with the absence of such profile in both PGR and KPC tumors. Examining the tumors from PGR and KPC, 100% of the PGR and 72.27% KPC tumors exhibited a non-squamous PDAC profile while an intermediate squamous profile was observed in 25% PGRT tumors and 27.27% KPC tumors. Furthermore, <i>Twist1<\/i> induction resulted in intra-abdominal and lung metastases. We observed that 87.5% of the PGRT mice were positive for metastases while we observed no positivity for PGR mice and 63.64% positivity in KPC mice. In conclusion, these data suggest that <i>Twist1<\/i> overexpression cooperates with <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> for PDAC tumor development mimicking the human QM-PDAC subtype to promote progression towards metastasis and early lethality. Potential uses of this novel model include testing treatment strategies to ultimately improve patient outcomes with QM-PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Twist1,Pancreatic cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Mutations at coding mononucleotide repeats (MNR) usually result in frameshift mutations (FSMs). Recurrent FSMs are thought to play a central role in the increased risk of different types of cancer. Neoantigens produced by FSMs have been shown to elicit immune responses, which is the basis for frameshift neoantigen-based vaccines. To develop a prophylactic vaccine and prevention strategy for this high-risk population, we assessed FSMs during tumorigenesis from histologically normal mucosa and fecal DNA of a LS mouse model using targeted sequencing and a panel of FSMs in MNR regions. <i>Msh2<sup>LoxP\/LoxP<\/sup>;Villin-Cre<\/i> mice (VCMsh2) started developing detectable tumors at 7-8 months and median survival was 11.5 months with 100% penetrance. Interestingly, FSMs were detectable not only in tumors and mucosa at 7-8 months, but also in young mice (1 month), embryos and pups although FSMs detected and variant allele frequency (VAF) were very low, indicating that FSMs accumulated over time, and FSMs alone may be not sufficient for tumorigenesis since tumors emerge at older age. To determine whether Msh2 was absent in embryos and pups, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed. Msh2 was lost in almost all intestine epithelial cells in 2-month-old mice but still present in young pups and embryos with very few cells absent of Msh2, indicating that emerging FSMs in these young pups may be due to decreased Msh2 expression because of delayed Cre function. To determine whether low Msh2 expression could lead to the emergence of FSMs, intestine mucosa from 8-, 10-, and 12-month-old <i>Msh2<sup>LoxP\/+<\/sup>;Villin-Cre<\/i> heterozygous mice was sequenced. FSMs were detectable with low VAF, although they didn&#8217;t develop tumors. IHC staining revealed that Msh2 was absent in only a few intestine epithelial cells in these heterozygous mice, suggesting that loss of heterozygosity was a late event and rare at 12 months. To determine whether MSI emerged in young VCMsh2 pups and heterozygous mice due to haploinsufficiency of <i>Msh2<\/i>, MSI was assessed using seven markers and fragment size analysis. One marker (mBat67) showed instability in the intestinal mucosa of heterozygous mice and three showed instability in fecal DNA of one month old VCMsh2 mice. Interestingly, mucosal and fecal samples from a time course study in VCMsh2 mice showed progressive increase in MSI with a good correlation between MSI and FSMs during the tumorigenesis process. In summary, FSMs emerged at an early stage of tumorigenesis in VCMsh2 mice, which correlated with MSI status.

MMR impairment in sporadic tumors is due to <i>MLH1 <\/i>epigenetic silencing or mutations in other MMR genes (such as <i>MSH2, MSH6, PMS2<\/i>) and leads to microsatellite instability (MSI). Two independent molecular classifications reported the existence of a MSI subgroup in gastric cancer (GC), including 22-23% of all cases. GC MSI inter and intra-tumoral heterogeneity represents a significant challenge for precise patient stratification and treatment. Even if MSI status in GC is usually associated with a good prognosis, some reports described a subpopulation of MSI GC patients displaying a worse outcome. Moreover, while clinical trials testing immune checkpoint inhibitors in MSI tumors showed effectiveness across all treatment lines, the outcomes in GC patients were not as remarkable as in other cancer types. From the analysis of MSI GC patients enrolled in phase III clinical trials testing anti-PD1 monotherapy, it emerged that nearly half of the tumors are intrinsically resistant and complete and long-lasting responses are achieved in very few cases. Tumor mouse immunocompetent models allow to mimic the complex interactions between a fully functional immune system and a developing tumor. MSI GC syngeneic mouse models could thus represent a valuable tool to better understand the molecular complexity and predict the clinical behavior of this subgroup. To obtain MSI GC mouse models, we generated non-transformed organoids from normal gastric mucosa of BALB\/c mice as a starting point for the induction of a neoplastic transformation <i>ex vivo<\/i>. To induce MMR deficiency, we inactivated either <i>Mlh1<\/i> or <i>Msh2<\/i> genes using CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing. Importantly, we did not introduce any other alteration in known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing the natural emergence of driver mutations in the context of the genetic instability. Over time, MMR deficient models, but not the WT controls, exhibited MSI and increased their mutational burden. Furthermore, when cultured in stringent culture conditions (two-dimensional culture, growth factor deprivation), only MMR deficient cells generated tumor masses upon subcutaneous injection in immunodeficient NOD SCID mice. Importantly, cells retrieved from the tumor masses (n = 8) exhibited mutations in a relevant fraction of genes associated with the MSI subgroup by TCGA (21 out of 35) &#8211; including <i>Kras, Arid1a, Erbb3<\/i> and <i>Tpr53<\/i> &#8211; thus offering a good representation of the human MSI GC mutational landscape. Given the immunogenicity of the Cas9 protein, we finalized our models optimizing the genome editing protocol to avoid a persistent Cas9 expression. Cas9-free MMR deficient models were able to generate tumors in immunocompetent BALB\/c mice, thus representing a valuable resource to investigate tumor development, progression and responses to immunotherapy <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Mismatch repair deficiency,Mouse models,Microsatellite instability (MSI),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniela Conticelli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriele Picco<sup>2<\/sup>, Cristina Migliore<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Orrù<sup>1<\/sup>, Fabrizio Maina<sup>3<\/sup>, Emanuela Boccuni<sup>1<\/sup>, Simona Corso<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvia Giordano<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"268f572d-1fb4-42d8-8d6a-a3a203fe639d","ControlNumber":"4402","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

CAS frequency is around 1-2% of all angiosarcoma cases and mostly arise in the right atrium. At present, there are no effective treatments and the survival rate is less than 10% at 5 years. Furthermore, the dearth of preclinical models has limited the advancement of biological insights into CAS. To address this challenge, we developed a somatic mosaic genetically engineered mouse model (smGEMM) with the aim of accurately mirroring the biological features of CAS. This model will be a crucial instrument for acquiring in-depth insights into the disease and steering the development of impactful therapeutic strategies. To develop a CAS smGEMM, we leveraged an endothelial-specific CRE recombinase to activate a fluorescent reporter in a tissue-dependent manner and CRISPR\/Cas9 technology to engineer somatic drivers of CAS tumorigenesis. Using this strategy, all endothelial cells express tdTomato fluorescent reporter and spCas9. We then administered adeno-associated viral (AAV) particles carrying selected tandem sgRNAs with two different approaches: a direct approach where AAV particles were administered by ultrasound-guided injection in the cardiac wall of the smGEMM; and an <i>ex-vivo<\/i> approach where primary endotheliocytes derived from cardiac tissue of our smGEMM were first transduced with AAV particles <i>in vitro<\/i>, and then transplanted orthotopically by ultrasound-guided injection. With the latter strategy, we successfully generated the first cardiac angiosarcoma model that faithfully recapitulates angiosarcoma features, including lung dissemination. Cell lines from primary and metastatic tumors were also established, characterized and utilized for genome-wide CRISPR Cas9 screening. Current efforts are focused on prioritizing hits for validation, aiming to glean insights that can inform potential therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Cardiac Angiosarcoma,Mouse models,Rare Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Rosalba Minelli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Luigi Perelli<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin  J.

Loss of nkx3.1 is thought to lead to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), the pre-invasive form of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Previous evidence suggests that estrogenic dysregulation and testosterone imbalance play a significant role in PCa initiation and progression.<br \/>Objectives\/Aims: We aimed to investigate how estrogen impacts the progression of PIN in the anterior prostate of mice lacking nkx3.1.<br \/>Methods: To investigate the effect of long-term exposure to 17&#946;-estradiol (E2), nkx3.1<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>and nkx3.1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> 12-week-old mice were given 2 mg\/day of E2 over 90 days by subdermal implantation of 90-day extended-release tablets. After 90 days, the anterior prostate lobes of the mice were harvested and analyzed post-treatment for signs of pre-cancerous tissue. The immediate, early effect of E2 exposure was also investigated by the subcutaneous injection of 8- and 20-week-old mice with 0.300 mg\/kg of E2. Within two hours, the anterior prostate lobes were harvested, and ~500 ng\/&#956;L of RNA was isolated from the tissues. cDNA was reverse-transcribed, in triplicate, from the RNA and the expression of c-myc, p53, estrogen receptor ER&#945; (ESR1), and ER&#946; (ESR2) were assessed via qRT-PCR. Three technical replicates from three biological replicates were performed for each treatment.<br \/>Results: Nkx3.1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice chronically exposed to elevated E2 developed PIN following E2 treatment, while the placebo group had tissue hyperplasia. Nkx3.1<sup>+\/+<\/sup> mice had normal prostate tissue regardless of E2 treatment. In response to immediate exposure to E2, the prostates of 8-week-old nkx3.1<sup>+\/+<\/sup> mice showed reduced c-myc expression. 8-week-old nkx3.1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice showed no changes in expression of any of the four genes assayed, in response to E2 as compared to the placebo treatment. In contrast, regardless of exposure to E2, c-myc, p53, and ESR2 were significantly elevated in these mice compared to the nkx3.1<sup>+\/+<\/sup> groups. Furthermore, c-myc and p53 expression was suppressed in 20-week-old nkx3.1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice in response to E2, while ESR1 and ESR2 remained unchanged.<br \/>Conclusion: Our evidence suggested that prolonged exposure of wild-type mice to E2 had no pathohistological impact on the anterior prostate tissue. In nkx3.1-deficient mice, however, E2 exposure promoted the onset of PIN, and caused immediate differential expression of estrogen-responsive genes, suggesting a role of nkx3.1 in protecting the prostate in the presence of a hormonal imbalance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Estradiol,Histopathology,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Nash  S.

Patients who develop brain metastases tend to be associated with progressive neurologic deficits and short overall survival, which represents an unmet medical need. Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate the mechanism of cancer metastasis with limited information gained as to how cancer cells extravasate and colonize to the brain. Recently, we identified a novel mechanism by which squalene epoxidase (SQLE), the second rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, plays a critical role in the process of breast cancer metastasis to the brain. Thus, toward a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and applications of molecular target(s) for brain metastasis therapy, murine models were employed for investigation of brain extravasation and colonization with intracardiac or direct intracranial injections of GFP\/FLuc-labeled human MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast carcinoma cells. The MDA-MB-231 cells were found to metastasize to the brain and other organs following intracardiac implantation into nude mice and were further isolated from each tissue. Interestingly, the isolated brain-metastasized tumor cells (MDA-MB-231-BrM) exhibited a significant upregulation of SQLE expression when compared with those that metastasized to other distal sites. The essential role of SQLE in the specific steps of the breast cancer-to-brain metastatic process was evaluated by <i>ex vivo<\/i> immunofluorescence analysis and immunohistochemistry staining of brain slices from the study subjects. Our data demonstrate that high SQLE expression is essential for MDA-MB-231-BrM to extravasate into the parenchyma, as well as the formation of micro- and macro-metastases in the brain. Interestingly, we found that blood vessel co-option and the surrounding neuronal cells play key roles in supporting MDA-MB-231-BrM to develop brain macro-metastases. <i>In vitro<\/i> blood-brain barrier (BBB) models further demonstrated the critical role of SQLE in promoting tumor cell invasion and penetration through the BBB. To verify SQLE as an oncogenic factor that can be selected as a potential therapeutic target in suppressing breast cancer brain metastasis, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of terbinafine (a SQLE inhibitor) in both the MDA-MB-231-BrM orthotopic and intracardiac mouse models. Pharmacologic inhibition of SQLE by terbinafine suppressed MDA-MB-231-BrM tumor growth at the mammary fat pad and distal metastases to the brain, suggesting that targeting SQLE represents a therapeutic opportunity for breast cancer brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Brain metastasis,Preclinical testing,Terbinafine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Mouse brain can be regarded as a miniaturized model of the human brain, permitting visualization of the whole tissue to provide spatial cellular context. Imaging Mass Cytometry&#8482; (IMC&#8482;) is a highly relevant tool capable of quantitative evaluation of the multiparametric protein composition in brain tumor microenvironment (TME) without the complications of autofluorescence, tissue degradation, and spectral overlap. The Hyperion XTi&#8482; Imaging System (Standard BioTools&#8482;) utilizes IMC technology to simultaneously assess more than 40 individual structural and functional markers in tissue, providing insight into the organization and function of the TME.<br \/>We demonstrate the whole slide imaging (WSI) application using a 40-marker panel composed of the Maxpar OnDemand&#8482; Mouse Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel Kit and the Maxpar&#174; Neuro Phenotyping IMC Panel Kit on mouse normal and glioblastoma (GBM) brain tissue. The panel was composed of mouse-specific antibodies, which highlight tumor and immune components of the mouse TME. We performed imaging using two new features of Hyperion&#8482; XTi. Ultrafast preview mode (PM) was applied to rapidly screen entire brain sections for marker expression signatures associated with various immuno-oncology processes. This enabled biomarker-guided selection of areas in tumor tissue that were imaged using region of interest-based IMC and analyzed using single-cell analysis (SCA). In parallel, a high-throughput tissue mode (TM) was applied to perform a detailed whole-slide scan of normal and GBM mouse brain tissues that were quantified using pixel-based analysis (PBA) to unravel the composition of the TME.<br \/>Using TM, we were able to successfully visualize the entire coronal and sagittal sections of normal mouse brain as well as mouse GBM tissue. PBA on TM data provided quantitative spatial expression patterns of structural and immune markers across the whole tissue. In normal tissue, we visualized the highly organized structure of the normal brain and detected neurons, oligodendrocytes, vascular-adjacent astrocytes, and axonal tracks.

While histologically heterogeneous, MBC are typically triple negative: they lack expression of ER, PR and HER2. Importantly, approximately 40% of MBC harbor oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, the gene encoding for the catalytic subunit of PI3K. These alterations are targetable by an array of inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway. However, few animal models of MBC are available, and it is currently difficult to study MBC biology and response to therapy. Here, we describe the generation of a new mouse model of MBC driven by the <i>PIK3CA<\/i> H1047R mutation. We histologically and biologically characterize this model and assess potential therapeutic strategies. We used genetically-engineered mouse models to express the human <i>PIK3CA<\/i> H1047R mutation under the control of the MMTV promoter, which is mostly expressed in the mammary epithelium. Tumors developed in mice in about 1 year. We histologically characterized these tumors and generated cell lines, organoids, and tumor grafts in immunocompromised mice. The resulting model, termed MMTV-102, was evaluated for the response to PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The MMTV-PIK3CA<sup>H1047R<\/sup> tumor was a high grade poorly differentiated MBC negative for ER, PR, and HER2. It presented squamous components, keratin depositions, mitotic figures, and vascular invasion and stained positive for the basal marker CK14. In addition, due to the presence of the <i>PIK3CA<\/i> H1047R mutation, it stained positive for phosphorylated AKT, PRAS40, and S6RP, indicating constitutive activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway. MBC derived cell lines and organoids were confirmed to be triple negative and could form tumors in mice. In addition, these cellular models were sensitive to PI3K&#945;, pan-PI3K, and mTORC1 inhibitors <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, but the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus exhibited the strongest effect. When resistance to everolimus eventually developed <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established cell lines from these resistant tumors. In addition, we generated an everolimus resistant cell line following chronic drug exposure <i>in vitro<\/i> (MMTV-102 Par res). Both cellular models were tested for their sensitivity to the next-generation mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-5552 by proliferation and clonogenic assays. We show that our mouse model can originate MBC with an active PI3K pathway. These tumors are amenable to transplantation into immunocompromised mice and to generate cell lines and organoids, allowing us to develop a simple, versatile, and rapid model of MBC. Tumors derived from our model are sensitive to PI3K&#945; and mTORC1 inhibitors, but eventually develop resistance to these agents. The use of next-generation mTORC1 inhibitors can overcome resistance in some cases, providing a rationale for their implementation in the treatment of patients with MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Breast cancer,PIK3CA,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

The establishment of clinically relevant prostate cancer models is crucial for advancing our understanding of the disease and evaluating potential therapeutics. Oncology studies in rats provide a secondary species to mice with the advantage of extensive longitudinal blood sampling and tumor biopsies in pharmacodynamics analysis. This <i>in vivo<\/i> study evaluates the behavior of subcutaneous and orthotopic luciferase (luc) tagged metastatic PC3M-luc cells in immunodeficient SRG rats (Hera Biolabs) for tumor growth kinetics, metastasis, and response to paclitaxel and carboplatin alone and in combination.<br \/>Methods: PC3M-luc cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank or orthotopically into the prostate of SRG rats. Subcutaneous tumor progression and treatment responses were monitored using calipers and bioluminescent imaging (BLI), with the capacity to detect developing metastases prior to necropsy. Orthotopic implants were monitored exclusively using BLI. Tolerability was evaluated based on biweekly changes in body weight, daily observations for signs of tumor- or treatment-related clinical signs, necropsy results, and complete blood count (CBC) and clinical chemistry marker comparisons with immunocompetent CD rats.<br \/>Results: PC3M-luc prostate carcinoma was successfully established orthotopically and subcutaneously in SRG rats, with similar growth rates and the development of spontaneous metastases to distant organs, modeling metastases observed in prostate cancer patients. Paclitaxel treatment was less tolerated in SRG rats in comparison to nude rats, enhanced toxicity was observed when combined with carboplatin. Comparison of CBC and clinical chemistry blood markers in na&#239;ve immunocompetent CD and immunodeficient SRG rats differed mainly in White Blood Cell (WBC) counts that were significantly lower in SRG rats, as expected due to the lack of mature B, T, and NK cells in these animals.<br \/>Conclusion: The development of orthotopic and subcutaneous PC3M-luc prostate cancer models in rats provides a valuable alternative platform for assessing the effectiveness of established and novel therapies. This rat-based models offers a secondary species for comparison of prostate cancer behavior in mice, successfully mimics the clinical development of metastases, and provides additional insights into disease progression and therapeutic strategies.

While the most significant advantages are observed in cancers with BRCA1\/2 mutations, it is evident that the benefits extend beyond this specific group. Preclinical evidence encourages the exploration of PARP inhibitors in neoplasms demonstrating BRCAness or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. This study employs spontaneous canine tumors as a complementary model for cancer research, aiming to seamlessly bridge the transition from preclinical investigations to clinical application. Leveraging the FidoCure&#174; Precision Medicine Platform, we identified biomarkers associated with prognosis and treatment prediction, specifically with the PARP inhibitor olaparib, facilitating a smoother translation from laboratory findings to practical clinical use. Analyzing real-world clinico-genomic data from 1278 dogs with cancer revealed intriguing insights of specific targeted treatments developed for humans showing a positive prognosis when applied to canine tumors with specific genomic alterations. Notably, olaparib exhibited efficacy in TP53 and BRCA1-mutated cases (OS HR 0.34, P&#8201;&#60;&#8201;0.001; HR 0.39, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.004), while rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) demonstrated promising outcomes in TP53 and RB1-mutated canine tumors (OS HR 0.73, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.028; HR 0.32, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.024). Further stratification by tumor types unveiled noteworthy correlations. TP53 mutant osteosarcomas exhibited improved prognosis with olaparib treatment (OS HR 0.11, P&#8201;&#60;&#8201;0.001), and soft tissue sarcomas with TP53 mutations demonstrated favorable responses to rapamycin and olaparib therapy (OS HR 0.11, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.012; HR 0.07, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.011). These findings underscore the potential of leveraging canine tumor models and clinico-genomic analyses to inform targeted treatment strategies, offering valuable insights for advancing precision medicine in both veterinary and human oncology. Further investigation into the association between TP53 mutation and olaparib response is warranted. The intriguing aspect lies in the role TP53 mutation has been linked in previous studies to heightened chromosomal instability and elevated HRD scores. Utilizing real-world evidence and data tools within the FidoCure dataset, we have effectively pinpointed correlations between gene mutations and survival, particularly in relation to responses to targeted therapy treatment. Canine models, mirroring human diseases with intact immune systems and comparable tumor genomic profiles, as verified by the FidoCure database, expedite clinical studies of novel treatments that face significant scalability challenges.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,PARP inhibitors,Targeted therapy,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

The research for brain metastasis is difficult because of its complex and unique microenvironment, including blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB maintains strong cell adhesion of the vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to protect the brain parenchyma. The BBB is composed of three cell types: vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. As the role of pericytes in maintaining the BBB function has become more evident, the reconstituted models of the BBB in which ECs, pericytes, and astrocytes are seeded on the front and back of the insert membrane have gotten our attention. In the field of cancer, the role of not only ECs but also wall cells, corresponding to pericytes in the brain, has been focused on. In this study, we aimed to create the <i>in vitro<\/i> BBB models and elucidate the interaction of the BBB and the metastasizing cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: We applied a reconstituted model of the BBB consisting of ECs, pericytes, and astrocytes of human immortalized cells (Ito R, et al. <i>Mol Pharm<\/i> 2019) and created the co-culture system for evaluating brain metastasis. We constructed four co-culture systems and compared the migration ability of MDA231 in those models: EPA model (ECs, pericytes, and astrocytes), E0A model (ECs and astrocytes), EP0 model (ECs and pericytes), and E00 model (ECs only). We also analyzed the migration ability of the pairs of parental and brain metastatic (BrM) cell lines.<br \/>Results: The BBB reconstituted model (EPA model), in which ECs were co-cultured with pericytes and astrocytes, showed higher trans-epithelial electrical resistance and lower permeability than the other co-culture models. When cancer cells were seeded, the EPA model strongly inhibited metastatic invasion of cancer cells compared to the other models. It suggests that both pericytes and astrocytes are essential for regulating cancer cell invasion. In addition, when the BrM cells of MDA231 and Ex3LL were seeded, the BrM cells invaded the EPA model more easily than the parental cells. It indicates that this model can reproduce <i>in vivo<\/i> brain vascular functions.<br \/>Conclusion: We created the BBB reconstituted model which mimics the brain vascular microenvironment. This model reproduced the <i>in vivo<\/i> BBB function to protect brain from cancer cells and evaluated the brain metastatic ability of the cancer cells. Using this model, we showed that pericytes and astrocytes were essential for the BBB barrier function against the cancer cells. We need further investigation to elucidate the mechanism of brain metastasis using this BBB model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Blood-brain barrier,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Late diagnosis, location of the tumor, tumor burden, and metastases makes liver tumor very challenging to treat by liver transplantation, surgical procedures, and other ablation techniques like cryoablation and thermal ablation. Also, the absence of a preclinical animal model makes it challenging to develop and explore the feasibility of treatment modalities. Histotripsy is a non-invasive, non-ionizing, non-thermal, image-guided focused ultrasound ablation treatment method that uses high-pressure pulses to create acoustic cavitation, a &#8220;bubble cloud,&#8221; at the target. The bubble cloud expands and collapses, which ablates the tissue into an acellular homogenate. Pigs are ideal animal models as they closely resemble human anatomy and are significant in improving the translation to human patients. This study aimed to establish the feasibility of successfully ablating liver tumors by histotripsy using an immunocompromised porcine model to generate HepG2 human liver cancer cell line tumors in the liver of the immunocompromised pigs. The orthotopic porcine model was established using RAG2\/IL2RG double knockout immunocompromised pigs. HepG2 cells were injected orthotopically into the liver of immunocompromised pigs. Three weeks after the injections, CT images and necropsy indicated successful engraftment and growth of liver tumors in the pigs. The ultrasound images and post-histotripsy treatment histology images showed confirmed ablation zones in the liver. Therefore, in conclusion, our preliminary results in the study could demonstrate, for the first time, a highly robust model of human liver cancer in a large animal model. Soon, we plan to conduct more such studies and explore all the possible utilities of these immunocompromised porcine models to develop therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of liver tumor ablation by histotripsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Animal models,CRISPR\/Cas9,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

PDX1 is an important transcription factor for embryonic development of the pancreas, endocrine lineage differentiation and the maintenance of mature beta cells. Notably, in PDAC patients, the expression of PDX1 is downregulated in tumor cells compared to adjacent non-tumoral tissue. Interestingly, increasing tumor PDX1 expression has been shown to enhance the overall survival rate in PDAC patients. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the role of PDX1 on tumor aggressiveness of PDAC cells. To induce PDX1 expression, PANC1 cells were treated with BRD7552 (a PDX1 inducer) for 9 days. Overexpression of PDX1 was confirmed by Western Blot analysis and no cytotoxic effects were observed by MTT or Trypan Blue exclusion assays on treated cells compared to control. Wound healing and transwell migration assays showed a significant reduction in the migration rate compared to the control group. A higher proportion of cells in G1 phase was observed in treated cells compared to control by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry assay. Furthermore, the cell confluence assay showed a significant reduction in proliferation rate in treated cells compared to control, but no differences were observed on the proportion of KI67<sup>+<\/sup> and PH3<sup>+<\/sup> cells by immunostaining. To assess the <i>in ovo<\/i> effects of BRD7552, treated PANC1 cells were implanted onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos and tumor growth was measured at different stages observing a<b> <\/b>significant reduction in tumor growth in PANC1 cells compared to control between days 3 and 8 post implantation. No significant differences in morphology or color were observed between treated and control implanted cells. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed reduced invasion of treated cells into the chorioallantoic membrane compared to control. In conclusion, the overexpression of PDX1 affects cell cycle, reduces proliferation rate and inhibits migratory potential <i>in vitro<\/i>. Moreover, in an <i>in<\/i> <i>ovo<\/i> model this overexpression diminished tumor growth and invasion<i> <\/i>in PANC1 cells. In conclusion, the overexpression of PDX1 induced by BRD7552 drives pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to a less aggressive tumoral phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Spheroids,Adenocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, the poor preclinical predictive power of current model systems explains in part the failures during late-stages clinical drug development for the numerous potential immunotherapies. Thus, there is a crucial need for innovative technologies offering fast and reliable evaluation of immunotherapies on patient-derived models. Using its proprietary process of micro-implantation of patient tumor cells within selected organs of series of avian embryos, Oncofactory developed two humanized avian xenograft models, namely IMMUNO-AVI-patient derived xenograft (iAVI-PDX<sup>TM<\/sup>) and IMMUNO-AVI-cell line derived xenograft (iAVI-cellDX<sup>TM<\/sup><i>)<\/i>. These models, consisting in the co-implantation of human peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and human cancer cells were validated through a sequence of experimental steps. First, we found that transplantation of PBMCs into avian tissues exhibited good survival and low allogenicity against the avian embryonic organism. Second, in embryos engrafted with tumoral cells, we established that intravenously injected PBMCs successfully populated the tumor. Third, to reduce the dilution of immune cells in the embryonic tissues and to better standardize the number of implanted cells in between embryos, we optimized the process by direct co-implantation of both PBMCs and cancer cells. We analyzed the immune cell contingent sorted from dissected tumors and found that all major immune cells populations, including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes as well as NK cells were preserved post-grafting, when compared to pre-grafted PBMCs. The AVI-cellDX<sup>TM<\/sup> and AVI-PDX<sup>TM<\/sup> models initially developed by Oncofactory allows fast and reproducible tumor growth with statistical evaluation of molecule efficacy already at 24 hours post-injection. To assess whether our humanized models retain these advantages, we analyzed the outcome of anti-PD1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) intravenous injection in series of avian embryos co-engrafted with human PBMCs and PDL1-expressing breast and colorectal cancer cell lines. Twenty-four hours post vehicle or Pembrolizumab exposure, we analyzed the tumor volumes in grafted embryos using light sheet microscopy. In all three cancer models, we found a statistically significant reduction of the volume upon pembrolizumab, compared with vehicle. Using a panel of molecular markers in flow cytometry, we found that the Pembrolizumab efficiently targeted T lymphocytes in the tumors. Finally, we validated the efficiency of Pembrolizumab treatment in models of co-implantation of human PBMCs with melanoma and colorectal patient samples. Thus, humanized iAVI-cellDX<sup>TM<\/sup> or -PDX<sup>TM<\/sup> technology bring powerful and fast alternative to mouse models, to strongly accelerate preclinical developments in immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pembrolizumab,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.
