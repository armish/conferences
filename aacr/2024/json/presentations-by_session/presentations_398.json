[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer (PC) is a prevalent and deadly malignancy, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an ion channel highly expressed in prostate epithelium, has emerged as a potential target. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that TRPM8 plays a crucial role in PC progression. We observed an initial increase in TRPM8 mRNA expression during early-stage PC, followed by a decline in advanced and androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) stages. Additionally, TRPM8 knockout mice exhibited elevated serum testosterone levels, heightened androgen receptor (AR) activity, and increased cell cycle, invasion, and adhesion-related effects. In xenograft models, TRPM8 demonstrated potent antitumor properties in both AR+ and AR- contexts. Our research suggests that TRPM8 activation on the plasma membrane promotes calcium influx and induces apoptosis in PC cells. Conversely, TRPM8 internalization correlates with PC pathogenesis. By exploring the effects of TRPM8 on PTEN-mediated cellular signaling, we aim to uncover novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TRPM8's role in PC. This abstract underscores the potential of targeting TRPM8-mediated Ca2+ signaling as a promising therapeutic approach to combat PC progression, offering hope for improved patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor suppressor,Receptors,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Mutation or loss of the tumor suppressor gene <i>SMAD4<\/i> occurs in up to 20% of EAC cases, and we have previously shown that loss of SMAD4 is sufficient to promote EAC tumorigenesis in an <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft model. The present study aimed to delineate the role of SMAD4 in EAC tumorigenesis and identify synthetic lethal interactions in SMAD4-deficient cancers as a novel approach for treating EAC.<br \/>Our multi-omics methodology integrated RNA-sequencing, proteomics, polysome-sequencing, reverse-phase protein arrays, and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to unveil a SMAD4-deficiency signature and new therapeutic avenues for EAC. These data reveal a complex interplay between SMAD4 loss and regulation of mTOR signaling, with specific downstream effects to reprogram translation. SMAD4-deficient cells express decreased levels of 4E-BP1, the inhibitory binding partner of EIF4E, which is the rate-limiting component of the cap-dependent translation initiation complex. This was accompanied by increased mTOR activity, including phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1. We found that SMAD4-deficient cells exhibit vastly different polysome traces compared to their wildtype counterparts and preferentially upregulate cap-dependent translation, acquiring an addiction to translation of oncogenic mRNAs. Furthermore, perturbation of additional negative regulators of mTOR signaling in combination with <i>SMAD4<\/i> knockout exacerbated these effects and accelerated tumorigenesis <i>in vivo <\/i>and growth of patient-derived organoids <i>in vitro.<\/i><br \/>This work advances our knowledge of EAC tumorigenesis, provides new mechanistic insights into SMAD4-driven transformation as well as novel potential therapeutic avenues for SMAD4-deficient EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Smad,CRISPR\/Cas9,Translation,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Using multi-omics data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=10,295) and lymphoma datasets from our group (n=702), we defined genetic features associated with <i>MGA<\/i> and its related MYC\/MAX\/MXD network members across 36 cancers. Pan-cancer, <i>MGA<\/i> mutation, predominant as nonsense or frameshift, was observed in 4.39% of all samples. <i>MGA<\/i> expression was significantly downregulated in mutated samples than that of wild type samples. Moreover, <i>MGA<\/i> mutation was positively associated with inferior clinical outcomes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (P=0.001 and P&#60;0.001 in 2 independent datasets), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (P=0.044) and natural killer\/T-cell lymphoma (P=0.012), encouraging in-depth study on the important role of <i>MGA<\/i> in lymphomagenesis. Conditional knockout of <i>MGA<\/i> in hematopoietic system using Vav-iCre (<i>Mga<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>,<\/i> <i>Vav-iCre<\/i> mice) led to reduction in the numbers of peripheral blood lymphocyte due to blockade differentiation and enhanced stemness as evidenced by flowcytometry and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). To investigate the molecular mechanism, we performed pulldown assay in NK-92 cells molecular silencing of <i>MGA<\/i> or scramble control, and subsequently subjected for mass spectrum analysis. A total of 97 proteins were identified to interaction with MGA and mainly enriched to nucleosome (26), cytosolic ribosome (16), immune response (13), and glycolysis (6). Molecular silencing of <i>MGA<\/i>, localizing in the nucleolus, interfered with ribosomal RNA processing, enhanced &#8220;onco-ribosome&#8221; biogenesis, and contributed to aberrant translational program characterized by mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Changes in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential are key to maintaining stemness in cancer cells. Considering that stemness is important for tumorigenesis, recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, we exploited high-throughput drug screening platform and found that targeted inhibition of Exportin 1 (XPO1) significantly suppressed the viability of tumor cells molecular silencing <i>MGA<\/i>, which were resistant to chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine, etoposide, etc. Mechanically, molecular silencing <i>MGA<\/i> induced abnormalities of nucleocytoplasmic localization in 739 proteins involving in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I assembly, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial translation, 50% (332\/739) of which were rescued by treatment with XPO1 inhibitor Selinexor. In summary, MGA initiated lymphoma cell stemness via onco-ribosome mediated activation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Selinexor targeted the aberrant nucleocytoplasmic localization and served as a promising therapeutic agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Transgenic mice,Mitochondria,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The <i>DACH1<\/i> gene, in the<i> <\/i>13q21.31-q21.33 region, encodes a winged helix\/Forkhead DNA-binding protein that governs cell-fate determination that is deleted in ~ 18% of human PCa, where it is associated with poor prognosis (3). Prostate-specific deletion of the <i>Dach1<\/i> gene enhanced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).<br \/>Methods: Analysis of <i>DACH1<\/i> gene deletion and expression was conducted from public data bases and human prostate cancer samples. Cells derived from <i>Dach1<\/i> gene deletion mice and human prostate cancer cell lines with DACH1 overexpression were analyzed for PARP inhibitor responses and mechanisms of PARPi resistance. Transgenic prostate Oncomice were generated in which the <i>Dach1<\/i> gene was deleted in the prostate.<br \/>Results: Herein, <i>DACH1<\/i> was shown to be co-deleted with <i>BRCA2<\/i> in each of 8 separate cohorts (N=2,186 patients), in ~3-12% of patients. <i>Dach1<\/i> gene deletion or knockdown conferred PARP inhibitor resistance (talazoparib &#62; niraparib &#62; olaparib &#62; rucaparib &#62; veliparib). DACH1 enhanced PARP sensitivity through several mechanisms affecting replication stress, PARP1 binding, inhibiting G9a (reducing H3K9me2), inhibiting CHK1<sup>p<\/sup> and CDK1<sup>p<\/sup> and inducing expression of snoRNA, specifically the snoRNA known to bind PARP. PARP1 has a BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminus 1) homology domain governing PARP1 dimerization and binding to intact DNA in a complex within a nucleosome. DACH1 binding to PARP1 requires the BRCT domain.<br \/>Conclusions: There is a correlation between <i>DACH1a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and PARPi resistance, correlating with PARPi trapping ability.

Currently approved pan-FGFR inhibitor therapy is limited by off-isoform toxicity (FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia and FGFR4-mediated diarrhea) and acquired FGFR2 or FGFR3 kinase domain resistance mutations. The second generation of FGFR inhibitors currently undergoing clinical evaluation such as RLY-4008 and LOXO-435 are primarily focused on achieving selectivity against either the FGFR2 or FGFR3 isoform, which may narrow their clinical potential. To overcome this limitation and to allow a favorable toxicity profile, we designed and evaluated the anti-cancer effects of a novel and selective FGFR2\/FGFR3 dual inhibitor, ISM8001. Biochemically, ISM8001 showed superior inhibition against FGFR2 and FGFR3 with &#62;90-fold and &#62;800-fold selectivity of FGFR2 over FGFR1 and FGFR4, respectively. As an irreversible inhibitor, ISM8001 displayed strong affinity and high efficiency of covalent bond formation with FGFR2\/3. Additionally, ISM8001 showed broad inhibition against multiple FGFR2\/3 mutant isoforms, especially gatekeeper mutation (FGFR2-V564F and FGFR3-V555M). ISM8001 inhibited cell proliferation of multiple human cancer cell lines with FGFR2\/3 aberration with IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#60;10 nM while IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#62;1 &#181;M was observed in cell lines without FGFR2\/3 alterations. Furthermore, ISM8001 demonstrated robust <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy in multiple cell line-derived xenograft mouse models including the SNU-16 gastric cancer model (FGFR2-amplification), the AN3CA endometrial cancer model (FGFR2 N549K mutation) and the RT4 bladder cancer model (FGFR3-fusion), with tumor growth inhibition varying from 80%~120% while no significant serum phosphate increase or body weight loss. ISM8001 also displayed strong anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of Ba\/F3-FGFR2\/3 engineered cell lines with different gatekeeper mutations. ISM8001 is classified as a BCS II compound with favorable DMPK properties and druggability, high permeability, low efflux ratio and low DDI risk. <i>In vivo<\/i> PK profiles showed moderate to low clearance and high oral bioavailability across preclinical species. In addition, ISM8001 showed a promising <i>in vitro<\/i> safety profile with favorable selectivity in 468-kinase and Cerep-44 panel studies, and no hERG concerns. Results of 28-day non-clinical toxicology studies in rat and dog showed a safety window of approximately 2-5 fold based on efficacious exposure in different models. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of ISM8001 as a novel, selective FGFR2\/FGFR3 dual inhibitor for the potential tissue-agnostic therapy of advanced solid tumors with FGFR2\/3 aberrations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-04 Oncogene growth factors and their receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Growth factor,Oncogene,Resistance,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Y.

Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) staining confirmed that <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection induces WEE1 overexpression in GC cells with an unexpected cytosolic localization of WEE1 in GC cells. <i>Tff1<\/i> knockout GC mouse model (<i>Tff1<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup>) was infected with mouse-adapted <i>H. pylori<\/i> strain PMSS1.

To study how <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection induces WEE1 in GC, analysis from miRTAR, Target Scan, and miRDB demonstrated that WEE1 is predicted to be targeted by miR-497-5p. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we assessed 30 normal and 30 GC human tissue samples, revealing a pronounced downregulation of miR-497-5p in GC specimens. Western blot analysis confirmed that the restoration of miR-497-5p in GC cells markedly reduced WEE1 protein expression. Interestingly, <i>H. pylori <\/i>infection further decreased miR-497-5p levels in GC cells, upregulating WEE1 protein expression. Since the miR-497-5P host gene promoter region contains CpG islands, we confirmed that treatment with 5 Azacytidine (demethylating agent) or DNMT1 knockdown induced expression of miR-497-5p with decreased WEE1 level in GC cells. Furthermore, our preliminary results indicate that aberrant WEE1 overexpression in GC demonstrates a significant positive correlation with immune-suppression gene signatures, underscoring its predictive value for unfavorable patient survival outcomes in GC. Using the <i>TFF1<\/i> knockout mouse GC model, we found that WEE1 inhibition notably decreases the number and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in neoplastic gastric tissues. These findings also indicate a crucial relationship between WEE1 and the immunosuppressive microenvironment in GC, establishing WEE1 as a promising therapeutic target to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome immunotherapy resistance in GC.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our findings demonstrated a novel mechanism in which <i>H. pylori<\/i> activates the WEE1 in GC, promoting an immune suppressive microenvironment.

Though STK11 is commonly inactivated in human cancer with strong implications for treatment outcomes, few STK11 mutations identified from tumor samples have been functionally characterized.<br \/>TNG260 is an inhibitor of CoREST that is currently being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of STK11-mutant cancer (NCT05887492). Patients are eligible for enrollment in the TNG260 phase 1\/2 trial if their tumor contains a deleterious STK11 mutation. To begin classifying non-annotated variants, over 2,000 distinct mutations in the STK11 gene were identified from STK11 literature or public repositories of tumor sequencing data such as AACR Project GENIE and ClinVar. Where possible, loss-of-function annotations were captured from literature or predictive tools such as PolyPhen-2. However, many STK11 variants, particularly missense mutations, have never been functionally characterized.<br \/>We developed a functional screening approach to characterize STK11 alterations using the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. A549 cells contain homozygous loss of STK11 via a truncation mutation at Q37, and re-expression of wild-type STK11 in these cells strongly impairs their growth in vitro and in vivo. We created a library of STK11 variant cDNAs, each containing a unique barcode. This library was expressed in A549, and cells were maintained in vitro or in vivo to allow for positive selection of STK11 loss-of-function variants and depletion of variants that behave like wild-type STK11. At the end of the screen, variants were quantified by NGS using each mutant cDNA&#8217;s unique barcode and compared to well-annotated controls.<br \/>These data were assembled to generate TNG260mutationfinder.com -- the first website to curate STK11 variants with functional annotations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Immune checkpoint blockade,Mutations,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leanne G.

Mutation in the Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) gene and epidermal growth factor (EGFR) amplification are key diagnostic markers for GBM. However, the prognostic role of genetic variants of these genes remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for IDH and EGFR genes, and their impact on the risk and prognosis of GBM patients within the Jordanian Arab population.<br \/>Methods: We carried out a case-control study involving 63 GBM patients and 226 healthy controls at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue for GBM patients and blood samples for controls. IDH1 (rs121913500C&#62;T), IDH2 (rs11540478G&#62;A), EGFR (rs231677G&#62;A), and EGFR (rs1468727C&#62;T) SNPs were genotyped and analyzed using the Sequenom iPLEX assay sequencing technique. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed between SNPs using the univariable Cox proportional hazard model. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-GBM) cohort of 585 patients were analyzed for IDH1, IDH2, and EGFR alterations with OS, disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Single-cell RNA analysis was performed on the following scRNA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE163108 (n=25,013 cells), and GSE102130 (n=3,321 cells) .<br \/>Results: Our study revealed a significant difference in genotype frequency between GBM cases and controls for IDH1 rs121913500C&#62;T, and EGFR rs1468727C&#62;T SNPs. Univariable Cox model showed that the G\/G genotype of rs231677G&#62;A (EGFR) SNP was associated with better OS in the codominant model (HR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.73, p-value=0.012), and rs11540478G&#62;A (IDH2) SNP (HR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.0-0.29, p-value=0.005) showing significantly better prognosis compared to the A\/G genotype. In the TCGA validation cohort, the altered group of IDH1 were significantly associated with better OS (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24-0.50, p-value&#60;0.001), DFS (HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.23-0.50, p-value&#60;0.001) , and PFS (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.30-0.62, p-value&#60;0.001). The scRNA analysis showed predominant expression of IDH1, IDH2, and EGFR by malignant cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and macrophages.<br \/>Conclusion: Our investigation into the genetic landscape of GBM within the Jordanian population suggest that specific genetic variants, particularly in IDH1 genes and EGFR, may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for GBM. Additionally, IDH1 alterations were associated with better prognostic outcomes. Single-cell RNA analysis further illuminates the predominant expression of IDH1, IDH2, and EGFR by malignant cells which can be used as potential avenues for targeted therapies based on genetic profiles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Prognostic markers,Genetic polymorphism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

There is an urgent need for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for PDAC. The transport of molecular cargo between the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitated by Ran-GTPase, is a critical process that dividing cells rely on to maintain their growth. Elevated nuclear Ran-GTP levels are produced by the activity of the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) known as Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1), which is found in the nucleus bound to chromatin. This creates a Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear membrane, which maintains proper directional transport of proteins and RNA. To sustain proliferative signaling, cancer cells become reliant on high rates of nucleocytoplasmic transport through dysregulation of transport machinery.<br \/>Methods: We examined the role of RCC1 in the biology of PDAC. The impact of RCC1 modulation on PDAC growth was evaluated using RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> using PDAC cell lines and LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) tumor-derived cells. The broader impact of RCC1 silencing on PDAC-sustaining signaling was evaluated through RNA-sequencing and proteomics.<br \/>Results: Transcriptomic sequencing of PDAC tissue (n=5,071) as well as analysis of publicly available data from the TCGA, CPTAC and GTEx revealed that RCC1 expression is higher in PDAC tissues compared to normal pancreas. Moreover, PDAC patients with higher RCC1 expression were more likely to have poorer outcomes. RCC1 silencing by RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in reduced proliferation in 2D and 3D cultures and attenuated tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. RCC1 KD decreased migration and colony formation, enhanced apoptosis, and altered the cell cycle in human and KPC mouse PDAC cells. Subcutaneous RCC1 KO cell line-derived xenografts show arrested growth. Subcellular Ran distribution was disrupted upon RCC1 KO, suggesting that nuclear Ran concentration is important for PDAC proliferation. Nuclear and cytosolic proteomic analysis revealed altered subcellular proteome in RCC1 KD KPC tumor-derived cells. Altered cytoplasmic protein pathways include several metabolic pathways, PI3K-AKT, and Hedgehog signaling. Nuclear enriched pathways include cell cycle, mitosis, metabolic processes, and RNA processing. RNA-seq of RCC1 KO cells showed widespread transcriptional alterations. Upstream of RCC1, c-MYC activates the RCC1-RAN axis, and RCC1 KO cells show differential sensitivity to c-MYC inhibitors. Finally, RCC1 KD resulted in the sensitization of PDAC cells to Gemcitabine.

Treating AML patients exhibiting a higher inflammatory signature with anti-inflammatory molecules resulted in significant increase of overall survival. Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMTs) are epigenetic factors known to regulate gene expression through methylation of histone tails. It has been previously reported that PRMT1, 4, and 5 inhibition exhibit anti-proliferative effects on AML models. In this study, we investigated the role of another PRMT, called PRMT2, in the development of AML through its regulatory roles in inflammatory pathways. We first determined from an AML cohort (The Leucegene project, IRIC, Montr&#233;al, QC, Canada) that patients with a low PRMT2 expression display an enrichment of proinflammatory pathways compared to patients with a high PRMT2 expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that PRMT2 could be a key regulator of inflammatory processes in AML. We thus used a PRMT2 knockout mouse model (Prmt2 KO) and a PRMT2 knockout human AML cell line to validate our hypothesis. Although we demonstrated no difference in the bone marrow progenitors or mature cell populations of Prmt2 KO mice compared to control, we observed that Prmt2 KO Bone-Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) are more sensitive to LPS stimulation and express higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, supporting our previous findings for a role of PRMT2 in the negative regulation of inflammatory processes. PRMT2 depleted human AML cells displayed an increased pro-inflammatory signature due to overactivation of STAT3, which is caused by an enhanced activation of the NFkB signaling pathway, leading to an overproduction of IL6. Together, these findings demonstrate that PRMT2 is a key regulator of the control of inflammation in AML. Recognition of PRMT2 as a biomarker of inflammation in AML would help to adapt treatment possibly through the synergistic use of anti-inflammatory molecules with other cytotoxic drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Inflammation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

Large sequencing studies have revealed only rare co-occurrence of <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations with <i>CBFB::MYH11<\/i>. We initially used <i>CBFB::MYH11<\/i> as a negative control for an unrelated study of <i>TP53<\/i> function and unexpectedly found striking synergy. While expression of <i>CBFB::MYH11<\/i> in WT murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) induced a low-penetrance (~20%), long latency (~6 months) myelomonocytic AML, expression of <i>CBFB::MYH11<\/i> in <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> HSPCs induced AML with 100% penetrance and a median latency of 8 weeks. <i>CBFB::MYH11<\/i>-induced<i> <\/i>AMLs arising in <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> cells were similar by morphology and flow cytometry phenotype.

The mammalian SWI\/SNF, also termed the BrG1\/Brm associated factor (BAF) complex, is the major chromatin remodeler in ontogeny and adult life. Three major BAF complexes namely canonical (cBAF), polybromo (pBAF), and non-canonical (ncBAF) have been studied. BAF components, classified as a tumor suppressors, exhibit frequent mutations in cancers. Though, studies have evaluated functional roles of BAF subunits, very few attempted to study BAF mutations identified across cancer types. In our previous studies, we identified tumor specific mutations in the gene encoding &#8216;A-T rich interaction domain containing 1B&#8217; (ARID1B), within its nuclear localization signal (NLS). NLS-inactivated ARID1B exhibited cytoplasmic localization and promoted tumorigenesis by activating the ERK and Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathways. More recently, we detected inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ARID2, a component of the pBAF complex and an ARID1B paralogue. We now present detailed characterization of tumor-specific ARID2 truncations that were presumed to be inactivating in nature. One such truncation mutation viz. p.Ser989fsArg21*, identified in our previous study, is expected to yield an ARID2 protein truncating at amino acid position 1010 (as against the full length of 1835 amino acids). Scrutiny of The Cancer Genome Atlas cBioPortal and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia mutation data bases revealed several ARID2 mutations expected to truncate the protein around the 1010 position. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of truncated ARID2 forms promoted oncogenic function in both ARID2 proficient and deficient backgrounds, thus validating a neomorphic gain of function for the truncated protein. Fluorescence based intracellular localization assays revealed a surprising cytoplasmic localization of truncated ARID2. Further, we mapped the ARID2 NLS by <i>in silico<\/i> analysis followed by evaluation of several deletion constructs, to be located at 1488-1518 position; thus, explaining the cytoplasmic localization of ARID2 forms truncating around 1010 position. Further, truncated ARID2 was unable to bind other pBAF components and did not sequester other pBAF components to the cytoplasm, in both ARID2 proficient and deficient cells. Tandem Affinity Purification Mass-spectrometry revealed putative interaction partners for truncated ARID2; analysis is currently underway to reveal the mechanism of tumorigenic induction exhibited by truncated ARID2. Immunohistochemistry on colorectal and breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed ARID2 cytoplasmic localization in a significant fraction of samples. We have discovered a novel YIN-YANG function of BAF components expected to yield efficient therapeutic options in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Tumor suppressor gene,Oncogene,AT-rich interaction domain (ARID),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

In AML arising from <i>JAK2<\/i><sup>V617F<\/sup> myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), HMGA1 is required for leukemogenesis by inducing transcriptional networks that drive aberrant proliferation and cell fate. Like MPN AML, KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) AML is refractory to therapy and highly lethal. KMT2A-r AML is caused by rearrangements of the <i>KMT2A<\/i> gene, which encode abnormal fusion proteins that induce pro-leukemogenic genes, including <i>HOX <\/i>genes. While prior work identified KMT2A fusion partners and protein complexes, this has not led to better therapies for most patients. We therefore sought to examine HMGA1 function in KMT2A-r AML. We hypothesized that: 1) HMGA1 drives plasticity in KMT2A-r AML by altering chromatin state and transcriptional networks, and, 2) Targeting HMGA1 will enhance sensitivity to therapy. In two KMT2A-r AML patient cohorts, <i>HMGA1<\/i> is highly overexpressed compared to CD34<sup>+<\/sup> stem and progenitors from healthy controls, suggesting it drives leukemogenesis. To define HMGA1 function, we silenced <i>HMGA1 <\/i>using CRISPR or short hairpin RNA in KMT2A-r cell lines (MOLM-14, THP-1, MV4-11). Strikingly, silencing <i>HMGA1<\/i> disrupts proliferation and clonogenicity <i>in vitro<\/i>, while prolonging survival in immunosuppressed mice transplanted with KMT2A-r AML cells. Intriguingly, leukemic cells that engraft in the bone marrow from the pool of cells with <i>HMGA1<\/i> silencing express higher levels of <i>HMGA1,<\/i> suggesting that escape from gene silencing and a specific level of HMGA1 is required for leukemic engraftment and expansion. <i>HMGA1<\/i> also increases in KMT2A-r AML cells that become resistant to cytarabine (AraC), suggesting that HMGA1 endows AML cells with the capacity to survive and expand after AraC. Because repression of tumor suppressors was recently defined as a mechanism of therapy resistance in AML, we also examined tumor suppressor pathways in both <i>JAK2<\/i><sup>V617F<\/sup><i><sup> <\/sup><\/i>and KMT2A-r AML. Intriguingly, HMGA1 occupies the promoter region of the <i>CDKN1A <\/i>locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation and represses its expression in KMT2A-r and <i>JAK2<\/i><sup>V617F<\/sup> AML cells. To define additional mechanisms underlying HMGA1 in KMT2A-r AML, multi-omics studies are underway. In preliminary work thus far, we also found that HMGA1 induces <i>HOX<\/i> genes. Together, these findings implicate HMGA1 as a promising therapeutic target and novel epigenetic regulator in KMT2A-r AML by altering chromatin state and downstream gene expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Gene expression,Acute myeloid leukemia,Tumor suppressor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Extensive studies confirm both androgens and AR are required for normal growth and development of the prostate gland, and also in prostate cancer pathogenesis and androgen-independent cancer progression. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapies or targeting AR function have always been the mainstay of therapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancers. However, the current therapeutic strategies are temporally effective in suppressing prostate tumors, and eventually develop metastatic disease. Nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large complex composed of approximately 30 different proteins termed nucleoporins (NUPs), which serve as the structural and functional units for macromolecules shuttling including proteins and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between nucleus and cytoplasm. Abnormal expression or genetic alterations of NUP genes has been indicated to involve in the progression of prostate cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We recently found that the m<sup>6<\/sup>A methyltransferase METTL3 directly interacts with nucleoporin 93 (NUP93), one of the NPC components in multiple prostate cancer cells, which seems to be more robust in the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines. Disruption of METTL3-NUP93 axis abrogated proliferation and oncogenic phenotypes of CRPC cells, suggesting that the METTL3-NUP93 axis may play an important role in prostate cancer progression to castration resistance. Most importantly, a subgroup of mRNAs regulated through METTL3-NUP93 axis encode cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes that trigger the activation of persistent AR signaling in CRPC. Therefore, Our current findings suggest that inhibition of METTL3-NUP93 axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CRPC, the lethal form of the disease.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Androgen,Cholesterol,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Univariable Cox models were used to study the survival outcomes, differential expression analysis between the high- and low-risk groups was carried out to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene ontology (GO and tumor microenvironment analyses were carried out.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In our primary cohort, we identified a significant association between rs4940595 (<i>SERPINB11<\/i>) SNP and survival, with the G\/T- genotype showing worse prognosis compared to the G\/G-T\/T genotype in the over dominant model (HR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.29-5.88, p-value=0.009). In the TCGA validation-cohort, alterations in the <i>SERPINB3<\/i>gene showed significantly worse OS (Median: 9.53 vs. 14.3, p-value=0.044) compared to the no alteration group. Univariable Cox showed worse PFS outcomes with higher SERPINB5 (HR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.15-2.43, p-value=0.007) and SERPINB6 expression (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96, p-value=0.021). A Serpin B 5-gene risk score was constructed revealing significant association with IDH mutation status and a trend towards worse PFS in the high-risk group. Upregulated DEGs showed GO enrichment in cytokine regulation and production, positive regulation of leukocyte activation and MAPK cascade. While the downregulated DEGs were enriched in forebrain development, and negative regulation of neuron differentiation. The high-risk group showed a significantly higher infiltration of M2 macrophages and activated mast cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our findings showed a significant role of the Serpin B family with GBM survival in the Jordanian population. Molecular analyses showed potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Our exploration of SERPINB family and associated SNPs provides valuable insights into the molecular landscape of GBM, paving the way for potential targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-02 Genotype\/phenotype correlations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Bioinformatics,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

However, the exact role of Cornulin in the pathophysiology of HNSCC is not reported. Here, we investigated its role in the pathophysiology of HNSCC and elucidated its potential as a prognostic marker as well as its antitumour effect.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> Sandwich ELISA and immunohistochemistry were performed to estimate the salivary and tissue levels of Cornulin, respectively, in HNSCC patients, along with an analysis of the effects of Cornulin levels on disease outcome. To investigate the antitumor effects ,its levels were upregulated through lentiviral transduction in low expressing Cal27, FaDu cell lines. Subsequently, various assays were conducted to examine the antitumor effects of Cornulin upregulation. The molecular signalling pathway was elucidated by analysing transcriptome. Additionally, the effects of increased Cornulin expression were also evaluated in an <i>in vivo<\/i> nude mice model.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> The pre-treatment salivary Cornulin levels were significantly low (<i><u>p=0.0001<\/u><\/i>) in HNSCC patients (n=128,146.4&#177;5.589pg\/mL) and in oral premalignant disease patients (n=25, 174.6 &#177; 9.924 pg\/mL) with respect to healthy controls (n=84,185.2&#177;7.170pg\/mL). Also, the tumor tissue expression of Cornulin (n=113,H-score=12.70&#177;2.396) was significantly downregulated (<i><u>p&#60;0.0001<\/u><\/i>) compared to the tumor-free margin (n=72,H-score=139.6&#177;10.34). The patients showing complete clinical response regained normal salivary levels within 6 months of completion of treatment (<i><u>p&#60;0.0001<\/u><\/i>). More importantly, low salivary Cornulin level at diagnosis was associated with poor overall survival (<i><u>p=0.0282<\/u><\/i>), indicating it to be a potential prognostic marker. On upregulation of Cornulin in low-expressing HNSCC cell lines (Cal27 and FaDu), the cellular viability, migration, and invasion showed a significant decrease. These indicate its potential as a tumor suppressor. RNAseq data of Cornulin overexpressed cell lines and further Gene set enrichment analysis, the G2\/M checkpoint pathway was found to be positively enriched. Cornulin overexpression also arrests the G1\/S phase of the cell cycle. GSEA and in vitro experiments revealed Cornulin to be involved in the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signalling pathway. In the nude mice xenograft model, decreased tumor progression, and tumor volume, was<br \/>documented after Cornulin overexpression. There was an increase in differentiation in the xenograft tumors formed by Cornulin overexpressed cells.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u> <\/b>Here, we report for the first time that intrinsic Cornulin has a role as a potent antitumor and has potential as a prognostic marker.

Despite the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in treating BRCA1 mutation carriers, the lack of response or the development of acquired drug resistance underscores the pressing need for new therapeutic targets. One intriguing BRCA1 mutation, BRCA1-Y1853ter, characterized by a minimal truncation, has been identified in multiple individuals with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome. We have developed a Halo Tag and adenovirus-based system where wild-type BRCA1 (WT BRCA1) and mutant BRCA1 protein complexes can be studied in multiple cell types. Here, we used this system to affinity purify BRCA1 wild-type and mutant complexes, followed by label-free quantitative proteomics to investigate the dynamic interactome variations between WT BRCA1 and BRCA1 mutant. Contrary to the assumed loss of function, our preliminary findings suggest a potential gain of function, as a significant number of candidate proteins exhibit enhanced binding affinity with the mutant BRCA1. We are currently exploring whether these distinct binding characteristics are shared among various BRCA1-BRCT mutants, which may hint at a common tumorigenesis mechanism. Our overarching hypothesis is that identifying a specific binding partner, shared among various BRCA-BRCT mutants, could unveil a novel therapeutic target with broader applicability in treating BRCA1-related malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Mass spectrometry,Protein-protein interactions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Gemcitabine (GEM), a deoxycytidine nucleoside analog is currently considered the most effective therapy for PanCa. However, it shows only a marginal survival benefit of six months. Aberrant ribosome biogenesis occurs in most tumor types. We observed that PanCa cells are addicted to ribosome biogenesis (RiBi), which supports their highly aggressive metastatic phenotypes. Thus, strategically targeting RiBi process could be one of the ideal strategies for the prevention and treatment of PanCa. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of POLR1A (RPA194) overexpression and how its targeting along with p53 status impacts RNA polymerase I inhibitor therapy against PanCa. The expression level of RPA194 was significantly elevated in pancreatic tumor tissues when compared with adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. BMH-21 is a potent pharmacological inhibitor of RNA Pol I, which is known to degrade RPA194 protein. Our results demonstrated that BMH-21 can selectively induce apoptosis in various PanCa cells but not in HPNE cells. We also found that the cytotoxic effect of BMH-21 was dependent on the expression pattern of RPA-194 and p53 status. We further examined the therapeutic efficacy of BMH-21 in<i> <\/i>orthotopic<i> <\/i>xenograft mouse models by using two different PanCa cells, AsPC1 which contains non-functional p53 and MIA PaCa-2 which contains functional mutant p53. We observed that BMH-21 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors derived from both cancer cell lines. Interestingly, BMH-21-mediated inhibition of tumor growth was more significant in tumors derived from MIA PaCa-2 cells compared to AsPC1 cells. Further examination revealed that the inhibition of tumor growth was correlated with RPA194 degradation followed by inhibition of cell proliferation. Overall, our results strongly suggest that BMH-21 is a promising non-toxic agent for the treatment of advanced PanCa and its therapeutic potential depends on RPA194 expression and p53 status in PanCa cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ribosomal RNA transcription,POLR1A,p53,BMH-21,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Although putative chromosome 7 tumor suppressor genes have been identified, the effects of combinatorial 7q gene loss remain unclear. A barrier to understanding the pathogenesis of -7\/del(7q) is the challenge of modeling aneuploidy in animal models. To address this knowledge gap, we established an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of del(7q) clonal hematopoiesis and drug resistance using multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 to simultaneously target four 7q genes (<i>Cux1, Ezh2, Kmt2c, <\/i>and <i>Kmt2e<\/i>) in murine hematopoietic stem cells. After chemotherapy exposure, we observe significant myeloid expansion of clones edited for both <i>Cux1<\/i> and <i>Ezh2<\/i>.

Several HOX genes have also been implicated in a myriad of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, how HOX genes play a role in SC regulation and contributes to cancer development is unclear. HOX expression is regulated by WNT, FGF, and retinoic acid (RA) signaling - pathways which also become dysregulated in cancer. <i>Goal<\/i>: To determine how regulation of HOX genes specifies differentiation of colonic SCs into specialized cell lineages and how dysregulation of HOX genes contributes to CRC development. <i>Hypotheses<\/i>: <i>i<\/i>) Each of the different cell types within human colonic epithelium has a distinct HOX gene expression signature; <i>ii<\/i>) All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation of CRC cells changes HOX expression that correlates with specific HOX expression signatures in normal colon and CRC cells. <i>Results<\/i>: Immunostaining shows that specific HOX proteins (e.g., HOXA9 &#38; HOXC9) are selectively expressed in ALDH-positive SCs and expression of these HOX genes is increased in CRC tissues compared to normal epithelium. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that these HOX genes (plus HOXA4, HOXA10, HOXC8) are regulated by RA signaling. Accordingly, we studied how ATRA influences HOX expression in CRC cells (HT29 &#38; SW480). We found ATRA treatment: 1) Decreases proliferation and increases neuroendocrine cell (NEC) differentiation; and 2). Leads to specific changes in HOX gene expression patterns. Using NanoString profiling, we also discovered that LGR5+ SCs, ALDH+ SCs and GLP2R+ NECs have unique HOX signatures. By defining how these HOX gene expression changes in response to ATRA treatment in comparison to the HOX gene signatures of different colonic cell lineages will help us understand the role that HOX genes play in SC differentiation and how dysregulation of HOX gene expression contributes to CRC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Retinoic acid,Wnt signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.
