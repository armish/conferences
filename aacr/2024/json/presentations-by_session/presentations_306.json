[{"Abstract":"Summary: Defects in homologous recombination DNA repair (HRD) both predispose to cancer development and produce therapeutic vulnerabilities, making it critical to define the spectrum of genetic events that cause HRD. However, we found that mutations in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> and other canonical HR genes only identified 10-20% of tumors that display genomic evidence of HRD. Using a networks-based approach, we discovered that over half of putative genes causing HRD originated outside of canonical DNA damage response genes, with a particular enrichment for RNA binding protein (RBP)-encoding genes. These putative drivers of HRD were experimentally validated, cross-validated in an independent cohort, and enriched in cancer-associated GWAS loci. Mechanistic studies indicate that some RBPs are recruited to sites of DNA damage to facilitate repair, whereas others control the expression of canonical HR genes. Overall, this study greatly expands the repertoire of known drivers of HRD, with implications for basic biology, genetic screening, and therapy stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,DNA damage,Breast cancer,Hereditary cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

The substrate specificity of PP1 holoenzyme complex is mediated by PP1-interacting proteins and its catalytic subunits. Of note, PPP1R15B\/CReP and PPP1R15A\/GADD34 are regulatory subunits of PP1 complex that regulates global protein synthesis and mRNA translation through eIF2&#945; dephosphorylation. Notably, PPP1R15B is constitutively expressed, whereas the expression of PPP1R15A is stress-inducible. Previous studies showed that multiple myeloma (MM), a hematological malignancy arising from immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, is characterized by continual ER stress and high dependency on the unfolded protein response (UPR). The integrated stress response (ISR) activated by eIF2&#945; phosphorylation is the fastest reaction pathway of the UPR; however, its functional role and therapeutic potential in MM remains largely unknown.<br \/>In this study, we performed gene expression analysis and super-enhancer (SE) profiling in MM cell lines, primary patient samples, normal CD138+ plasma cells and memory B cells. we found that PPP1R15B is highly expressed in MM cells as compared to healthy controls, but did not observe significant upregulation of PPP1R15A in MM cells. In addition, higher expression of PPP1R15B predicted poor overall survival of MM patients, suggesting its clinical relevance in MM pathogenesis. Depletion of PPP1R15B significantly reduced cell viability, proliferation and induced G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest. Gene Ontology analysis of downregulated genes in response to PPP1R15B knockdown indicates significant association with the UPR pathway. Immunoblot analysis showed activation of ER stress pro-apoptotic executors PUMA, NOXA, and cleavage of caspase-12 in PPP1R15B knockdown cells.<br \/>Furthermore, we examined the therapeutic effects of eIF2&#945; dephosphorylation inhibitors, Salubrinal and Raphin1, on MM cells. Raphin1 is a selective inhibitor of PPP1R15B that binds strongly to the PPP1R15B-PP1c complex, whereas Salubrinal inhibits both PPP1R15A-PP1c and PPP1R15B-PP1c complex. Our data showed that both Salubrinal and Raphin1 inhibited MM cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, while sparing normal plasma cells. MM cell lines with elevated PPP1R15B expression level were more sensitive to Salubrinal or Raphin1 than those with lower PPP1R15B level. Similar changes in the expression patterns of ISR-related genes were observed in response to eIF2&#945; dephosphorylation inhibitors. Taken together, our study suggests that targeting PPP1R15B-PP1c complex or maintaining eIF2&#945; hyperphosphorylation may serve as a new therapeutic approach in MM, which warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Unfolded protein response (UPR),Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Although current treatment with surgery and extensive chemoradiation has led to increased survival rates, many MB patients still die from the disease. Moreover, surviving patients suffer severe long-term side effects as a consequence of treatment. It is therefore crucial to develop more effective and less toxic therapies. The most aggressive subtype of MB tumors often exhibits amplification or overexpression of the MYC oncogene. Patients with MYC-amplified MB exhibit a high frequency of cerebrospinal tumor dissemination, often experience treatment resistance and have extremely poor prognoses. While the MYC oncogene is established as the oncogenic driver in Group 3 MB, it has remained undruggable. Thus, targeting regulatory components of MYC and the signaling pathways regulated by it is of great potential therapeutic value. Studies have revealed that MB has very few germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes, suggesting that dysregulated epigenetic pathways might be critical in MB pathogenesis. Particularly, dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers, including histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, is very common in Group 3 MB, compared to other MB subgroups. Therefore, it is important to identify such epigenetic modifiers that may have controls on MYC and its tumorigenic activities and explore these as the epigenetic drug-candidate targets in Group 3 (MYC-driven) MB. In this regard, we found that protein arginine demethylase Jumonji C domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6), an emerging key epigenetic enzyme in cancers, is a novel regulator of MYC expression in MYC-driven MB. We observed high levels of JMJD6 that not only mirror MYC expression in the most aggressive MB but also correlate with poor outcomes in these patients. Knockdown of JMJD6 decreased MYC expression, cellular proliferation\/survival and stemness in MYC-amplified MB cells. Mechanistically, our results revealed that JMJD6 forms complexes with proteins involved in maintaining and regulating the promoter-pause at super-enhancers, suggesting that JMJD6 can regulate MYC at the transcription level. Moreover, our in vivo analyses of JMJD6 inhibition, either with inducible gene knockdown or a pharmacologic small molecule inhibitor, demonstrated anti-MB potential with suppressed MYC expression. Based on this background and preliminary observations, we hypothesize that JMJD6 plays crucial roles in the most aggressive MB by regulating MYC expression and hence MYC-driven tumorigenesis. Accordingly, we hypothesize that targeting the JMJD6-MYC axis by JMJD6 inhibition can serve as a powerful therapeutic strategy for MYC-driven MB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Myc,Epigenetics,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

We previously demonstrated that CDK2 antagonism inhibits clustering of supernumerary centrosomes at mitosis leading to multipolar cell division and apoptotic death in non-small cell lung cancer. This antineoplastic process was designated anaphase catastrophe. Anaphase catastrophe can preferentially affect cancer cells sparing normal cells with two centrosomes. On the other hand, as CDK2 functions in normal cell cycle progression, its inhibition can also affect normal and malignant cells. Identification of a novel drug target that would preferentially cause anaphase catastrophe is needed. The motor protein KIFC1 affects centrosome clustering. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), known for its poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options, displays disruptions in the cell cycle checkpoint mechanism due to inactivation of p53 and RB. We hypothesized SCLC was susceptible to mitotic abnormalities, including anaphase catastrophe. In this study, we explored the possibility of KIFC1 as a novel therapeutic target that triggers anaphase catastrophe in SCLC. In-silico GEO database analysis revealed elevated levels of KIFC1 and PLK4 in SCLCs compared with other cancers and normal tissues. PLK4 plays a key role in centrosome amplification. Our in-silico analysis results imply that centrosome amplification and their clustering frequently occur in SCLC. We performed in-vitro functional analysis of KIFC1 inhibition in SCLC cell lines (NCI-H146, SHP77, NCI-H209, and NCI-H524 cells), using siRNAs and CRISPR-Cas9 system for genetic inhibition and AZ82, a specific KIFC1 inhibitor, for pharmacologic inhibition of KIFC1. Cell proliferation was measured by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay and apoptosis was scored by annexin V and PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. Cell growth was reduced and apoptosis was statistically significantly increased after genetic inhibition of KIFC1 by siRNAs and by use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in SCLC cell lines. These antineoplastic effects also occurred after AZ82 treatments, in a dose-dependent manner in these SCLC cell lines. To examine the mitotic status of SCLC cells after KIFC1 inhibition, SCLC cells were stained with &#945;-tubulin antibody and DAPI before analysis with a fluorescence microscope. Besides normal bipolar mitotic cells, multipolar mitotic cells were observed, and their population was increased after KIFC1 knockdown with siRNAs. This indicated that clustering of supernumerary centrosomes was inhibited by targeting KIFC1 in SCLC cells. Taken together, KIFC1 is a potential therapeutic target to induce anaphase catastrophe in cancer cells. Targeting KIFC1 is a novel therapeutic strategy to consider for SCLC that currently has limited treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,KIFC1,Centrosome clustering,Anaphase catastrophe,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer with around 50% of patients in Asia expressing mutated EGFR, which makes EGFR an effective therapeutic target to treat lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). Unfortunately, resistance to EGFR-TKI often occurs in patients through either dynamic EGFR mutation, driver oncogenic pathway shift, or transdifferentiating to evade EGFR-TKI treatment. circRNAs are a type of RNA molecule with a circular shape. Their importance in several biological processes and disease progression was intensively studied recently, and have emerged as promising diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring biomarkers for diseases like cancer. CircRNAs&#8217; unique circular structure and resistance to degradation make them robust candidates for non-invasive diagnostics of cancers.<br \/>Aims: This study aimed to identify and investigate the involvement of a novel circular RNA (circSPINT2) in acquired resistance against the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation EGFR-TKI Osimertinib.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods:<i> <\/i>Comparative circRNA sequencing (circRNA-Seq), qRT-PCR, sanger sequencing, and RNase R treatment were applied to identify and verify the identity of Osimertinib-resistance-related circRNA. Biotinylated circRNA pull-down assay, miRNA-seq, and in-silico analysis were employed to delineate the downstream miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis. Osimertinib-resistant mouse xenograft model was established to explore the molecular mechanisms associated with both circSPINT2 and Osimertinib resistance.<i><\/i><br \/>Results: We identified circSPINT2 as particularly downregulated in Osimertinib-resistant cell lines (OR) using circRNA-Seq. Overexpression of circSPINT2 in resistant cells increased cellular sensitivity to Osimertinib, whereas knockdown of circSPINT2 conferred Osimertinib resistance in parental cells. The circSPINT2-dependent regulation of Osimertinib sensitivity is mediated through modulating apoptosis. <i>In-vitro<\/i> analysis indicated high circSPINT2 increased tumor suppressor RBP1 expression by sequestering oncogenic hsa-miR-1296 further improving Osimertinib sensitivity.

Current OS treatment strategies rely on multi-drug chemotherapy, and the prognosis for metastatic cases remains grim, underscoring the pressing need for novel therapeutic approaches. OS is considered a differentiation-related disorder, stemming from the inability of mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblastic progenitors to progress towards terminal differentiation. In our study we explored the impact of targeting ZEB1, a transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in maintaining mesenchymal and stemness characteristics in cancer, on OS cells. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA interference techniques to inhibit ZEB1 expression in mouse immune competent OS models. In vitro, ZEB1 deficiency significantly diminished the stemness potential of OS cells, as assessed by spheroid formation assays, while promoting osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, ZEB1 deletion in OS cells led to a significant reduction in primary tumor growth. Tumors originating from ZEB1 KO cells exhibited a more differentiated morphology and higher extracellular matrix deposition compared to controls. Intriguingly, the absence of ZEB1 in tumor cells also influenced the immune infiltrate, with ZEB1-deficient tumors showing significantly fewer pro-tumoral CD206+ M2-like macrophages. This observation is in line with the significant down-modulation of CCL2 expression we detected in ZEB1 KO cells. When injected intravenously, ZEB1-deficient cells produced fewer and smaller lung metastases than control cells. Transcriptional changes induced by ZEB1 deletion were investigated by gene expression profile (GEP) and identified 849 down-regulated and 1093 up-regulated genes in ZEB1 knockout (KO) clones versus ZEB1-competent controls. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a down-modulation of pathways related to cellular proliferation and survival, such as MTORC1 signaling, MYC targets, GM2 checkpoint, E2F targets and oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of ZEB1. Single gene analysis identified among the most up-regulated genes in ZEB1-deficient cells Sfrp1, a negative regulator of the WNT\/b-CAT pathway, which in turn regulates MYC, whose pathway is indeed repressed in ZEB1 KO cells. We hypothesize that a high expression of SFRP1 could vicariate the effects of ZEB1 inhibition on OS cell stemness, differentiation state, and in vivo aggressiveness, and therefore could act as a tumor suppressor, which could be potentially exploited for therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Mouse models,Differentiation,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

QN-302 was invented at University College London UK and has been subsequently developed by Qualigen Therapeutics Inc. It was cleared by the FDA in August 2023 for clinical evaluation and is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial at select oncology centers in the USA. Genes that are significantly down-regulated by QN-302 are mostly up-regulated genes in human PDAC. We report here that some of these genes are also up regulated in other cancer types, whose expression frequently correlates with poor patient prognosis. We have used human cancer data from https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org which contains pathology information based on mRNA and protein expression data from 17 different forms of human cancer, together with millions of in-house generated immunohistochemically stained tissue sections, images and Kaplan-Meier plots showing the correlation between mRNA expression of each human protein gene and cancer patient survival. We have revisited the RNA-seq data for QN-302 in PDAC MIA-PACA2 cells exposed to QN-302 for 24 hrs. (GSE151741 at https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/) in detail and now identify a small group of eleven down-regulated genes, all with &#62;3-fold expression changes. Interestingly all these genes and their gene products have been previously identified as playing a role in human PDAC (they also have varying roles in other cancer types). Some have been validated as anticancer targets. 10\/11 of these genes (https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/) have been previously reported as being over-expressed in significant fractions of large (&#62;150) groups of human cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Members of the PDAC susceptible gene panel are mostly disfavored in prostate, lung and breast cancer. However, the patient data does not discriminate between cancer sub-types nor does it show resistant data. They are especially favored in colorectal, liver and renal cancers, suggesting that QN-302 may have anticancer effects in these cancers as well as in PDAC. We also do not exclude the strong possibility that each cancer type also has its own group of G-quadruplex containing genes that are sensitive to QN-302.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA binding,Target discovery,Transcriptional repression,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Aberrant EVI1 expression is observed in ~10% of <i>de<\/i> <i>novo<\/i> AML, of which about half are due to inv3(q21;q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) chromosomal rearrangements [3q26.2-r]. 3q26.2-r AMLs generally have a stem-like phenotype, are refractory to current therapy options and exhibit poor overall survival. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel targeted therapies with improved efficacy in repressing EVI1 and its targets, thereby improving outcomes in AML with EVI1 overexpression. We conducted an unbiased high-throughput drug screen, utilizing a library of mechanistically annotated drugs (NCATS Mechanism Interrogation Plates [MIPE 5.0]), against seven AML cell lines (3q26.2-r: UCSD-AML1, HNT-34, AML191, AML194; non-3q26.2-r AML: SET-2, MV4-11, OCI-AML3). This exploited the mechanistic redundancy in the library to identify druggable, target-level dependencies in 3q26.2-r AML, exhibiting absolute potency and relative activity as compared to other AML subtypes. BRD4 was identified as an absolute dependency in 3q26.2-r AMLs. An unbiased epigenetic modifier CRISPR screen in UCSD-AML further confirmed BRD4 as a dependency, confirming previous reports of BET inhibition (BETi) efficacy in 3q26.2-r AML. Comparison of 3q26.2-r versus other AML cell lines also identified XIAP, mTOR, PIK3CA and Bcl-xL as druggable vulnerabilities in 3q26.2-r AML. In follow-up experiments, IAP family inhibitors\/SMAC mimetics induced significantly more dose-dependent apoptosis in 3q26.2-r versus the other AML cell lines, which was associated with reduction of IAP proteins, p-ERK, MCL1 and Bcl-xL, but increase in levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. BETi (mivebresib) also induced dose-dependent apoptosis, and reduced EVI1, c-Myc, c-Myb, IAP proteins, and CDK4\/6, while increasing levels of HEXIM1 and cleaved PARP. Consistent with this, co-treatment of mivebresib with SMAC mimetic birinapant or IAP inhibitor LCL161 was synergistically lethal against 3q26.2-r cells. Co-targeting the other identified druggable vulnerabilities from the drug screen with BETi (mTOR\/PI3K with BGT-226 and dactolisib, Bcl-xL with navitoclax and A1155463, as well as CBP\/p300 (with GNE781, identified through the CRISPR screen), exerted synergistic lethality in 3q26.2-r AML cells. Finally, in a xenograft model of 3q26.2-r AML in immune-depleted mice, while monotherapy with LCL161 or dactolisib significantly reduced the AML burden with minimal toxicity, co-treatment with mivebresib and LCL161 or dactolisib was superior in reducing AML burden in the xenograft model. These findings demonstrate promising preclinical activity of BETi and IAP protein or mTOR\/PI3K antagonists in the cellular models of AML with EVI1 overexpression. This supports the rationale to determine <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of these BETi-based combinations against this therapy-resistant AML sub-type.<b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Drug-discovery screen,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The primary aim of this prospective study was to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based personalized functional genomic testing with fresh patient samples in the clinical setting.<br \/>Methods: AML and ALL patient peripheral blood samples (10-16 mL) were obtained at time of initial diagnosis and\/or at relapse, and if feasible post-treatment. Primary cells were transduced with lentivirus harboring Cas9 enzyme and a &#8216;drug targets&#8217; sgRNA panel. Transduced cells were harvested at early (input) and Day 8 timepoints, and sgRNA distribution was assessed by amplicon sequencing of DNA barcodes. Changes in barcode abundance were quantitated and aggregated to calculate gene-level phenotype scores, enabling identification of gene dependencies.<br \/>Results: 37 patients were included in the study, 23 with AML, 9 with Philadelphia (Ph) (+) ALL, 5 with Ph (-) ALL. The majority of patients had adverse or poor risk disease. The average age of patients was 52.6, range 18-84. 23 were male, 14 female; 20 identified as white, 17 as other. 20 patients were sampled at initial diagnosis, 12 were sampled at time of relapse and 5 at time of refractory disease. Serial samples were collected from 9 patients. 34 patients received treatment following sample collection. The majority of patients received intensive chemotherapy or a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax, however 15 patients received some form of targeted therapy. At the time of the abstract submission, Fx Heme results were available for 23 patients and among these, we identified potential treatment targets in 10 samples (43%). Importantly, 60% of the positive samples have a dependency on a gene clinically targetable by an approved leukemia drug. In addition, our profiling platform enabled the discovery of novel druggable dependencies in 100% of the positive samples.<br \/>Conclusions: With this pilot study we demonstrated that utilizing small volume fresh patient samples to assess CRISPR-defined gene dependencies on targeted therapies in AML and ALL is feasible, timely, and results in clear Fx Heme dependency gene output. Our data indicates that CRISPR-based comprehensive functional profiling has the potential to add valuable information beyond traditional NGS methods to determine the optimal therapy for patients with AML and ALL. Future directions include translating further into the clinical setting and correlating Fx Heme dependence with response to targeted treatment in acute leukemia patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression profiling,CRISPR\/Cas9,Acute myeloid leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Mechanisms regulating metastasis represent high-potential therapeutic targets for preventing development of lethal PCa. Inhibitors of extracellular heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) have been shown to inhibit prostate cell motility. In contrast to the intracellular HSP90 (iHSP90), whose biology has been extensively studied, and whose therapeutic targeting is associated with systemic toxicity, the biology of extracellular HSP90 is not well understood. We undertook a series of investigations to better understand eHSP90 biology in PCa.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Human PCa cells were subjected to cellular stress by heat shock combined with serum starvation. Resultant conditioned media was probed for matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) by zymography and subject to scratch-wound and Boyden chamber invasion assays. Expression of HSP90 and CDC37 was measured by Western blot. Plasma from patients with PCa and healthy controls was probed for eHSP90 by ELISA.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We have examined expression of iHSP90 and eHSP90 after cellular stress, induced by heat shock and serum starvation, in human PC3, LNCaP, C4-2B, 1532NPTX and 1532CPTX PCa cell lines. Cell stress induces increased eHSP90 in all PCa cell lines examined. This is associated with a decrease in MMP-2 activity in conditioned media. Conditioned media from stressed cells was also shown to decrease invasion of PC3 cells, consistent with changes in MMP-2. Of high interest, the addition of protease inhibitors to conditioned media led to a complete reversal of the MMP-2 response: its activity increased with cellular stress. When measuring HSP90&#945; in plasma from healthy controls (N = 20) and patients with PCa (N = 40, 20 localized and 20 metastatic), we demonstrated a significant (p=.001) &#62;2 fold increase in PCa compared to control. Further, a significant increase in HSP90&#945; was observed when low versus high T stage lesions were compared. There was no statistically significant difference in HSP90&#945; for those with metastasis to regional lymph nodes, non-regional lymph nodes, bone, or liver.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We demonstrate that increased eHSP90 due to cellular stress is a response observed across all PCa cell lines examined and should be considered typical. Its association with extracellular MMP-2 activity is dependent on the presence of other proteases and indicates a complex regulatory mechanism. Examination of eHSP90 in humans supports its association with aggressive disease. These factors support further investigation of underlying biology and therapeutic opportunities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Metastasis,Heat shock proteins,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Although triple negative and HER2 positive subtypes are enriched in Y patients, the hormone receptor (HR) positive subtype (luminal, LBC) remains the most common. A thorough understanding of LBC biology in Y women has not been reached yet, also hampered by lack of appropriate models that faithfully recapitulate these tumors in molecular and preclinical studies.<br \/>Methods: To investigate molecular determinants of progression and therapeutic resistance, we collected a large panel of fresh specimens (N=226) from Y (&#60; 40 years) and nY (&#62;55 years) LBC patients, characterized by targeted sequencing and used to generate Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) and Xenografts (PDX). A selected panel of Y and nY LBC patients (N=96), sharing similar clinical-pathological features, was used for whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic analyses.<br \/>Results: We generated stable LBC PDO (N=32, 13 from Y patients), with a success rate of 50% and stable LBC PDX (N=15, 11 from Y patients), with a success rate 17%. Our targeted panel of NGS, covering most mutated genes in LBC at high coverage (1000x), revealed a significantly higher number of Y patients displaying mutations in PIK3CA and in PIK3CA+TP53. However, these data were not observable in WES analyses (200x), likely because many of those mutations displayed a VAF &#60; 5% (20% of PIK3CA and 30% of TP53). The transcriptomic analysis showed an enrichment in signatures of aggressiveness in the Y LBC subgroup. The EGF family member AREG (Amphiregulin) was the most enriched gene in tumors from pre- versus post-menopausal patients. Following validation in a larger panel of LBC, both at RNA and protein level, we tested the impact of AREG in LBC cell lines. AREG expression was timely induced by growth factor and hormonal stimulation. Furthermore, stimulation using amphiregulin induced the activation of EGFR and its downstream pathway, creating a positive feedback loop. Relevant to the Y LBC phenotype, a consistent and time dependent induction of AREG transcription was induced following estrogen and progesterone stimulation, indicating that, in LBC, AREG might act as a transcriptional target of ESR1. Finally, high levels of amphiregulin reduced response to tamoxifen and CDK4\/6 inhibitors in LBC cells and PDOs.<br \/>Conclusions and Perspectives: Our study provides valuable molecular and biological insights into LBC in Y women. We identified distinct genetic and transcriptomic profiles, including PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and AREG overexpression, which may be exploited to plan more targeted and efficient treatments. The establishment of a living biobank of PDO and PDX from LBC patients of Y age will enable preclinical trials, facilitating discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies tailored to the unique biology of Y LBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hormone receptors,Epidermal growth factor (EGF),Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

While glioma cells can migrate along blood vessels and in neuron-rich regions, their preferred route of migration is along white matter (WM) tracts, which allows tumor cells to spread to the contralateral hemisphere with devastating neurocognitive consequences. The underlying mechanisms of in vivo glioma cell migration are poorly understood. There is emerging evidence that glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells may hijack migration mechanisms used during brain development. Accordingly, we used a neonatal plasmid electroporation GBM model (CRISPR-Cas9, -Cre,gRNAs targeting NF1, p53, PTEN, and piggyBac-glast) to generate a highly penetrant diffusely invasive glioma models with preference for migration along myelinated fiber tracts including the corpus callosum (CC). To test the in vivo role of integrin-mediated migration, tumors were generated using conditional integrin &#946;1f\/f (ITGB1) or focal adhesion kinase (FAKf\/f ) mice. Both ITGB1 and FAK null GBM cells (confirmed by western blot analysis) showed diffuse infiltration similar to WT mice, suggesting that integrin signaling is not essential for in vivo GBM cell migration. Next, we tested the role ephrin-signaling using a series of transgenic neonatal mice, including EPH-B1-\/-, -B2-\/-, -B1\/2-\/-, -kinase-dead (KD) and a gain-of-function mutant). EPH1\/2-\/- GBM, but not the other genetic models, consistently formed tumors which showed no diffuse single-cell infiltration, but rather grew as a solid expanding mass. An extensive panel of in vitro studies comparing WT and EPHB1\/2-\/- GBM patterns of growth and migration, including time-lapse random walk, neurosphere radial migration, migration along patterned surfaces, and laminin-coated confined 3D channels, showed similar patterns of migration, despite the marked differences in vivo. These contrasting in vivo and in vitro results raise the possibility that EPH-B1\/2 receptors may require their cognate ephrin ligands to facilitate migration through the WM tracts. To test this hypothesis, we are using Ephrin-B1f\/f, B2f\/f mice for in vivo cell-type specific deletion in WM tract stroma cells and primary astrocytes derived from these mice for ex vivo co-culture studies. Our preliminary data suggest that EPH\/EPHRIN interactions may regulate GBM cell migration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Cell migration,Tyrosine kinase receptors,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Phospholipase D (PLD) is a lipid-signaling enzyme that appears to play a critical role in cell proliferation, survival\/apoptosis, and downstream oncogenic transformation. Elevated PLD1 or PLD2 (the two classical mammalian isoforms) activity has been shown to promote tumor progression in various cancer types, however, the role and mechanisms of PLD in pancreatic cancer are not yet understood. Thus, the objective is to determine the role of PLD1 regulation in pancreatic carcinogenesis through genetic and pharmacological inhibition. To evaluate the role of PLD1 in tumor growth, we subcutaneously transplanted human MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells expressing endogenous PLD1 levels (Ctr KD cells), or MIA PaCa-2 cells in which PLD1 was knocked down<i> (<\/i>Pld1 KD cells), into immunodeficient nude mice. After 18 days post implantation, tumors that arose from Pld1-KD cells<i> <\/i>presented a significantly smaller tumor size (p&#60;0.05) and had reduced levels of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, compared to controls (Ctr KD). Then, to assess the role of PLD1 in the tumor microenvironment, we implanted KPC pancreatic cancer cells into C57BL\/6 wild-type (WT) or C57BL\/6 PLD1 knockout (<i>Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) mice with and without treatment with gemcitabine. Fourteen days after tumor implantation, the growth of KPC tumors was attenuated in <i>Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice by 49% (p&#60;0.05). Treatment with gemcitabine reduced tumor growth by 51.6% (p&#60;0.05) in WT mice and by 79.5% (p&#60;0.03) in <i>Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of PLD1 genetic ablation by crossing <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>; Ptf1Cre\/+<\/i> (<i>KC<\/i>) mice into PLD1 knockout (<i>Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>) mice to generate<i> KC; Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. At 8 months of age, <i>KC; Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice had significantly smaller pancreases (p&#60;0.05) compared to <i>KC<\/i> mice. Interestingly, PLD1 ablation increased phosphorylation of ERK and c-Jun in <i>KC; Pld1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice compared to <i>KC<\/i> mice. Finally, to assess whether pharmacological inhibition of PLD can inhibit pancreatic carcinogenesis, <i>KC<\/i> mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of a small molecule inhibitor of PLD1 and PLD2 (FIPI) at a dosage of 3 mg\/kg of body weight for a duration of 5 weeks. Treatment with FIPI reduced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (p&#60;0.05) and reduced cell proliferation (p&#60;0.01), when compared to vehicle-treated KC controls. Additionally, FIPI treatment was safe demonstrating no significant differences in body weight between the groups and no significant alteration in the serum levels of liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. In conclusion, these findings reveal PLD1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis and might represent a novel therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Cancer therapy,Inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Gain-of-function mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK<\/i>), of which 85% occur at residues F1174, F1245, and R1275, confer inferior survival compared to patients with wild-type <i>ALK<\/i>. Lorlatinib, a third generation ALK<i> <\/i>inhibitor, has completed Phase 1 testing in the NANT Consortium and has moved to frontline therapy in the Children&#8217;s Oncology Group. The robust and sustained activity observed with minimal toxicity is transient in relapse patients harboring <i>MYCN <\/i>amplification and ALK<i> <\/i>activation. We aim to elucidate and target mechanisms of acquired resistance that emerge from lorlatinib treatment. We utilized the Brunello library, a genome-wide CRISPR-CAS9 loss of function screen targeting 19,114 genes (4 sgRNA per gene), which allows for a high confidence of detection of hits. We screened four clinically representative cell lines: Kelly (ALK<sup>F1174L<\/sup><i>, MYCN-<\/i>amplified, p53<sup>P117T<\/sup>), SMS-SAN (ALK<sup>F1174L<\/sup><i>, MYCN-<\/i>amplified), LAN5 (ALK<sup>R1275Q<\/sup><i>, MYCN-<\/i>amplified), and SY5Y (ALK<sup>F1174L<\/sup><i>, MYCN-<\/i>nonamplified). sgRNAs were ranked according to the degree of depletion or enrichment. We validated top depleted targets through cell-based assays and immunoblotting. We identified several actionable targets across multiple NB cell lines that, when depleted, increase the efficacy of lorlatinib, including <i>FGFR2<\/i>, <i>BCL2L1<\/i>, <i>SOX11<\/i>, <i>SMARCA2<\/i>, and <i>SMARCD2<\/i>. Genetic knockout of <i>FGFR2 <\/i>led to a 40% reduction (p&#60;0.05) in KO cells upon lorlatinib treatment compared to control. PROTAC degradation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-xL (<i>BCL2L1<\/i>) revealed the combination of lorlatinib and the PROTAC led to a decrease in IC50 <i>in vitro<\/i>. Additionally, we identified conserved core components of the SWI\/SNF complex, a subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, as well as SOX11, a regulator of the SWI\/SNF complex and transcription factor of the core regulatory circuitry in adrenergic high-risk NB. In conclusion, we identified actionable targets across four NB cell lines that, when depleted, increase the efficacy of lorlatinib. Depletion of FGFR2 led to increased sensitivity to lorlatinib, however enzymatic inhibition showed minimal effect. Future investigation into dual targeting of ALK and FGFR2 through novel alternative methods is warranted. Furthermore, we observed a synergistic relationship between lorlatinib and a BCL-xL PROTAC <i>in vitro<\/i>. Ongoing<i> in vivo <\/i>studies will test the combinatorial efficacy in lorlatinib-na&#239;ve and resistant models. Finally, we are investigating epigenetic remodeling by the SWI\/SNF complex and its regulators in NB cells during lorlatinib treatment through targeted genetic manipulation of <i>SOX11<\/i> to understand its role as a master transcriptional regulator of <i>MYCN<\/i> and <i>FGFR2<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Neuroblastoma,ALK,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Joshua Renn Kalna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Smita Matkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily O'Drisoll<sup>2<\/sup>, Skye Balyasny<sup>1<\/sup>, Matteo Calafatti<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Gerelus<sup>3<\/sup>, Dave Groff<sup>1<\/sup>, Tina Acholla<sup>1<\/sup>, Colleen  E.

The current therapies are largely ineffective and therapy resistance is commonly encountered. We have recently shown that TRIB1, a Ser\/Thr pseudokinase contributes to therapeutic resistance in GBM cells by activating both ERK and Akt pathways. Here we show that, increased expression of TRIB1 contributed to RT\/TMZ resistance by activating pro-survival Akt signaling resulting in increased viability of GBM cells. High level of Akt phosphorylation\/activation is correlated with poor prognosis of GBM patients. Many pan Akt inhibitors have been developed which are currently in various phases of clinical trials. The three Akt isoforms (1, 2 and 3) are known to play a role in cancer during proliferation, transformation and metastasis. A previous report has shown that TRIB1 interacts with Akt1 in <i>Drosophila<\/i> and blocks its activation. In this study we show that Akt binds and forms a complex with TRIB1 in GBM cells and this interaction could be isoform and cell line specific.<b> <\/b><br \/>We utilized patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM cell lines and established GBM cell lines in this study. Stable TRIB1 overexpressing cell lines were generated by antibiotic selection. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was performed utilizing Anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc magnetic agarose beads to evaluate protein-protein interactions. Western blotting was done to detect protein levels. The FLAG tagged TRIB1 deletion mutants were a generous gift from Dr. Takuro Nakamura (Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.<br \/>Co-IP studies showed that TRIB1 formed a complex with Akt in PDX GBM cell lines. We then transiently transfected respective TRIB1 deletion mutants lacking either N and C terminal residues in HEK 293 cells and performed Co-IP with Anti-FLAG magnetic agarose beads. We observed that all TRIB1 deletion mutants except TRIB1-&#916;N2 (lacking first 160 amino acids) were able to pull down Akt. The western blot results showed that each Akt isoform had a variable protein expression across different cell lines. Co-IP studies in the PDX cell lines showed that TRIB1 interacted with all three Akt isoforms in T08-387 cells whereas TRIB1 consistently interacted with only Akt3 but not Akt1\/2 in GBM30 cells that lack wild-type p53 expression.<b> <\/b><br \/>Our data suggest that TRIB1 forms a complex with Akt in PDX GBM cell lines. The potential Akt binding site on TRIB1 lies between 90-160 amino acids. TRIB1 can interact with different Akt isoforms in a cell type dependent manner thereby playing a role in their activation and consequent tumorigenic processes. Therefore, targeting TRIB1 mediated Akt activation could be considered a better therapeutic option over targeting Akt directly, which may decrease Akt&#8217;s oncogenic activities without risking the toxicity associated with available Akt- specific inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,AKT\/PKB activation,Therapeutic target,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

It accounts for 2%~10% of all chondrosarcomas and affects mainly adolescents and young adults. Genetically, this tumor is characterized by the recurrent HEY1::NCOA2 fusion. To functionally characterize the fusion in MCS tumorigenesis, we generated stably transduced iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSC) with inducible expression of HEY1::NCOA2. We previously demonstrated that the expression of HEY1::NCOA2 significantly enhanced cell proliferation, upregulated PDGFB\/PI3K\/AKT signaling, and induced genes that are involved in chondrocyte differentiation. In this study, we evaluated the impact on chondrogenic lineage differentiation and dysregulated pathways resulting from HEY1::NCOA2 expression and further elaborated oncogenic pathways in MCS tumorigenesis. We first successfully established the differentiation culture of inducing iPSC-MSC on chondrogenic lineage differentiation, showing an increase in glycosaminoglycans and the expression of differentiation markers (COL1A1, COL2A1, ACAN, COMP, SOX9 and COL10A1) at 7-, 14-, and 21-days post treatment with differentiation medium. The iPSC-MSC-HEY1::NCOA2 cells and control cells were cultured for chondrogenic lineage differentiation. During differentiation culture, we collected cells from each condition at multiple time points to (1) monitor the expression of differentiation markers and (2) perform transcriptomic profiling. Principal component analysis showed that cells with the expression of<i> HEY1::NCOA2<\/i> possessed a distinct feature from parental cells and control cells, however, <i>HEY1::NCOA2<\/i> did not simply suppress chondrogenic differentiation. The differential gene expression indicated that HEY1::NCOA2 fusion disrupted genes related to fine tuning of chondrogenic differentiation (<i>SOX9<\/i>, <i>COMP<\/i>, and <i>IGF1<\/i>) and activated oncogenes (<i>PDGFB, BCL2, CCND1, IGF2<\/i>, etc.). Notably, we demonstrated that both <i>BCL2 (<\/i>an anti-apoptotic protein) and <i>COMP (<\/i>possess antiapoptotic function that protects chondrocytes against death and blocks activation of caspase 3) were directly targeted and consistently upregulated by <i>HEY1::NCOA2<\/i> fusion. In addition, the functional classification of genes (n=86) consistently increased with HEY1:: NCOA2 expression through differentiation of the chondrogenic lineage demonstrated that the PI3K \/ AKT pathway was the most significantly enriched, which further supports targeting the PDGFB\/PI3K\/AKT axis in MCS therapy. Together, this study sheds light on how <i>HEY1::NCOA2<\/i> fusion shapes key mechanisms of chondrogenic differentiation and exerts oncogenic activation. Our findings provide the rationale for anti-apoptosis along with anti-PDGFB\/PI3K\/AKT signaling in the treatment of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal stem cell,HEY1-NCOA2 Gene fusion,Chondrogenic lineage differentiation,PDGFB\/PI3K\/AKT axis ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"W.

Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) facilitate the development of treatment resistance by establishing tumor-promoting networks between GBM and surrounding cells. Only having emerged in 2004, many key players remain to be identified which is why we propose that MARCKS regulates TNT directionality through phosphorylation of its effector domain (ED).<br \/>Methods: We quantified TNT sinuosity, numbers, branching points, and average length in (3) PTEN-null doxycycline-inducible U87-MARCKS-mutant models in serum-free conditions. Mutants overexpress MARCKS as wild-type (U87-WT), non-phosphorylated (U87-NP), or pseudo-phosphorylated (U87-PP). TNTs were characterized using immunofluorescence, confocal imaging, ICY manual TNT plugin, and negative staining. We also investigated a cytotoxic peptide derived from MARCKS-ED, termed MED2, on PTEN-null brain tumor-initiating cell (BTIC) TNTs. Statistical analysis was conducted with one or two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons.<br \/>Results: The most striking difference between all mutants is the loss of rigidity and directionality in U87-NP TNTs. Negative staining revealed U87-NP TNTs have deformed bodies with clubbed tips compared to ordered filaments in U87-WT and U87-PP. 4h MED2 treatment in non-mutated BTICs results in cytotoxicity as well as truncated TNTs that phenotypically resemble U87-NP.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first report supporting MARCKS to be a novel regulator of TNTs through ED phosphorylation. Future directions will investigate the functionality of TNTs in U87 mutants to determine if the lack of MARCKS phosphorylation renders TNTs nonfunctional. Defining MARCKS' role in GBM TNTs not only advances the field of cellular communication but also offers a new perspective on GBM treatment.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{2DF9E3F5-40A1-40C9-92D1-20A0E89D5CE4}\"><caption>Quantitative TNT Characterization<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Sinuosity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TNT Number<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Branch Points<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Average Length<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MARCKS\/F-actin Correlation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">U87-WT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.00 +\/- 0.00<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.0 +\/- 2.94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.0 +\/- 2.94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.80 +\/- 1.74<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.9245<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">U87-NP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.21 +\/- 0.10<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.5 +\/- 1.29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.00 +\/- 0.82<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.90 +\/- 1.79<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.5497<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">U87-PP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.03 +\/- 0.02<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">34.3 +\/- 11.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.50 +\/- 3.41<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.90 +\/- 1.05<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.7249<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT vs. NP: P=0.0026 WT vs. PP: P=0.7804 NP vs. PP: P=0.0070<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT vs. NP: P=0.0126 WT vs. PP: P=0.5344 NP vs. PP: P=0.0025<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT vs. NP: P=0.0053 WT vs. PP: P=0.0036 NP vs. PP: P=0.9616<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">WT vs. NP: P=0.9975 WT vs. PP: P=0.0363 NP vs. PP: P=0.0312<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">U87-WT: P&lt;0.0001 U87-NP: P&lt;0.0001 U87-PP: P&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BTIC + No treatment<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.00 +\/- 0.00<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.5 +\/- 1.29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.00 +\/- 1.83<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.2 +\/- 10.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not determined<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BTIC + 3&#956;M MED2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.48 +\/- 0.33<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.3 +\/- 3.5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7.50 +\/- 1.92<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.0 +\/- 11.7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not determined<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NT vs. MED2: P=0.0198<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NT vs. MED2: P&gt;0.9999<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NT vs. MED2: P&gt;0.9999<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NT vs. MED2 P=0.2003<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Not determined<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Tumor microenvironment,Molecular markers,Cell penetrating peptides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Lauren C.

While PARP1\/2 inhibitors are efficacious in the <i>BRCA<\/i> mutant setting, this efficacy is limited and resistance develops readily. Additional therapeutic targets beyond PARP1\/2 are needed to treat cancer patients with <i>BRCA<\/i> mutations. We performed CRISPR screens in 11 <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> wild-type and 2 <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant cancer cell lines to identify targets that are synthetic lethal with <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutations. In addition to USP1, PARP1 and POLQ, we identified the DNA ligase gene <i>LIG1<\/i> as a novel target that when knocked out kills <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant cells selectively. Internal analysis of <i>BRCA<\/i> mutations in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines in the Project Achilles database further validated the hyperdependence of <i>BRCA1 <\/i>mutant cells on <i>LIG1<\/i>. Single-gene perturbation of <i>LIG1 <\/i>using CRISPRn, CRISPRi, and RNAi confirm the lethal effect of <i>LIG1<\/i> inactivation in <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant cell lines, but not <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>wild-type cell lines. This loss of viability could be rescued by complementing with an exogenous wild-type <i>LIG1 <\/i>cDNA, demonstrating the on-target nature of the genetic tools. Using a degradable DNA Ligase I fusion protein, we demonstrate a strong correlation between DNA Ligase I protein level and viability in <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant cells. Enzymatically inactive DNA Ligase I mutant protein (LIG1<sup>K568A<\/sup>) was unable to rescue the loss of viability caused by endogenous <i>LIG1<\/i> depletion supporting the tractability of this target from a small molecule inhibitor perspective. These data were reproduced <i>in vivo <\/i>using <i>BRCA1<\/i> mutant MDA-MB-436 derived tumors, in which tumor growth was inhibited &#62;80% upon loss of <i>LIG1.<\/i>Mechanistically, DNA ligase I plays a critical role in DNA replication and damage repair by sealing nicks in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. When these nicks are not repaired, they are marked by the addition of PAR chains. Consistent with this mechanism, we demonstrated that inactivation of <i>LIG1 <\/i>leads to increased PARylation. The induction of PARylation was proportional to the level of inactivation of LIG1 protein, supporting a correlation between LIG1 activity and DNA nick repair.

Many of the 9p21.3-deleted cancers are further characterized by poor clinical outcomes including subsets of glioblastoma, pancreatic, esophageal, and urothelial cancers. Large deletions of chromosomal regions may also provide unique therapeutic opportunities. Specifically, cancer-specific therapeutic opportunities can arise from co-deletions of passenger genes neighboring tumor suppressors. As such, we sought to identify novel therapeutic targets associated with Ch9p21.3 loss in cancers and identified the pelota mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor (PELO) as the top preferential dependency in 9p21.3-deleted cancers. Intriguingly in another analysis, we identified PELO to be amongst the top preferential dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which accounts for subsets of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Given the strength of PELO as a candidate synthetic lethal target in two distinct cancer subsets, we performed focused validation with CRISPR interference across multiple cell lines. Knockdown of PELO preferentially impaired the viability of MSI or 9p21-deleted as compared to control (9p21-proficient and microsatellite stable) cells. Further validation with patient-derived organoid and in vivo xenograft models confirmed these findings. We next sought to refine the predictive biomarkers for PELO dependency and identified loss of FOCAD (a 9p21.3 gene and an interactor of the SKI mRNA surveillance pathway) as necessary and sufficient for PELO dependency in the 9p21.3-deleted context. Our findings implicate splicing alterations involving TTC37, a key protein in the SKI mRNA surveillance complex, as the underlying cause of PELO dependency in MSI cancers. Together, we found that loss of large deletions of 9p21.3 and MSI independently impair the SKI complex, uncovering a dependency upon PELO and highlighting a novel functional interaction between PELO and the SKI complex. Furthermore, the strength of this synthetic lethal interaction in a broad range of cancers with poor outcomes underscores the potential of PELO as a promising drug target for patients with 9p21.3-deleted or MSI cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Therapeutic target,Microsatellite instability,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

FH-amp on ecDNA promote intra-tumoral heterogeneity, resistance to therapies, and poor prognosis. Recently, a Phase 1 clinical trial exploring ecDNA-directed treatments has begun. However, to date, bioinformatic detection of ecDNA has relied on whole-genome sequencing data, and no standard method exists to detect ecDNA on targeted NGS. We thus sought to explore the feasibility of detecting ecDNA in a large cohort of patients with solid tumors sequenced with the targeted NGS panel, MSK-IMPACT, and describe the pan-cancer prevalence of oncogenes amplified on ecDNA.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We utilized a novel bioinformatic ecDNA-diagnostic algorithm, ECHO, to determine the presence of oncogene FH-amp on ecDNA (including HSR) vs. chromosomal in clinical-grade NGS data. 72,651 tumor samples profiled by MSK-IMPACT were queried for high level oncogene FH-amp (<i>AR,<\/i> <i>CCNE1, CDK4\/6, EGFR, FGFR1-4, KRAS, MDM2, MDM4, MET, MYC, MYCL<\/i>, and <i>MYCN<\/i>) above a fold-change of three, and subsequently annotated with ECHO. Patients with concomitant oncogenic driver mutations or fusions (e.g., <i>EGFR L858R, EML4-ALK<\/i>) were excluded based on the hypothesis that they might be mutually exclusive with oncogene FH-amp.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>FH-amp of any above listed oncogene were found in 3065 (4.2%) samples. Cancer types with frequent FH-amp without concomitant driver alterations were liposarcoma (LPS) (61% FH-amp; 43% were ecDNA+), glioblastoma (GBM) (22%; 72%), gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GE AD) (10%; 57%) squamous cell lung cancer (7%; 18%), and breast cancer (BRCA) (7%; 23%). Among tumors with oncogene FH-amp, GBM and GE AD had high frequencies of ecDNA+ FH-amp of <i>EGFR<\/i> (39% and 15% of all EGFR ecDNA+). LPS had the highest frequency of ecDNA+ FH-amp of <i>CDK4<\/i> (64%), followed by GBM (15%). The majority of ecDNA+ <i>FGFR1<\/i> and <i>FGFR2<\/i> FH-amp were in BRCA (75% and 47%). <i>EGFR<\/i> in GBM and EGFR or <i>FGFR2<\/i> in GE AD were ecDNA+ in more than 90% of patients, while <i>CDK4<\/i> in LPS and <i>FGFR1 <\/i>in BRCA were ecDNA+ in 45% and 39% respectively.Evaluation the relationship between ecDNA+ by ECHO and amp FC range showed higher ecDNA+ in samples with higher level amp (FC &#62; 5; 58% ecDNA+) compared to lower level amp (FC 4~5; 12%, FC 3~4; 6% ecDNA+).<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>A novel ecDNA clinical diagnostic tool, ECHO, was successfully applied to a large clinical cohort of patients enriched for actionable oncogene amplifications sequenced with MSK-IMPACT.<b> <\/b>The results demonstrate that detection of ecDNA using clinical-grade NGS assays is feasible and that key oncogene FH-amp on ecDNA (e.g., <i>EGFR, FGFR2<\/i>) are common in select tumor types.

PAR chains function as docking platforms for DNA repair proteins that are required to resolve DNA lesions. Equally important is the subsequent removal of PAR chains from protein substrates to conclude the repair process and restore genomic integrity. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is the key enzyme in this process and has recently garnered significant attention as a novel cancer target. FoRx-06-428 is a novel, orally bioavailable and highly potent, low molecular weight PARG inhibitor. It binds to the catalytic domain of human PARG with high affinity, as evidenced by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and displays potent inhibition of enzymatic activity. FoRx-06-428 shows selective reduction of viability in a panel of cancer cell lines highlighting therapeutic potential in multiple cancer indications. Pharmacological inhibition of PARG leads to accumulation of PAR chains and is indicative of target engagement, accompanied by modulation of DNA damage response markers, such as phosphorylation of replication protein A (pRPA) and phosphorylation of H2AX (&#947;H2AX). Compelling anti-tumor efficacy as single agent was observed in several xenograft models (breast and gastric cancer) with excellent tolerability. Dose-dependent accumulation of PAR chains was demonstrated <i>in vivo<\/i> and constitutes a tractable target engagement biomarker for clinical exploration. Sensitivity to PARG inhibition is partly driven by distinct genomic instabilities, such as defects in homologous recombination (HR) repair, however the activity of PARG inhibitors is also influenced by aberrations in other cancer-relevant pathways. This report represents the first disclosure of the pharmacological characterization of FoRx-06-428 and highlights the value of PARG inhibition as a novel targeted approach to treat DNA repair-deficient cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARG,DNA repair,Small molecule inhibitor,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Top1ccs can be stabilized by antitumor Top1 poisons, such as clinically-effective camptothecin analogs. Camptothecin-stabilized Top1ccs can lead to R-loop-dependent transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), single-end DNA double-strand breaks (seDSBs) and genome instability in cancer cells. To define the genomic location of TRCs and the underlying mechanisms, we integrated genomic maps of Top1cc-induced DNA cleavage by END-seq and DNA:RNA hybrids by DRIP, determined the cell-cycle specificity of micronuclei formation and the effects of elongation transcription factor IIS (TFIIS). We have defined the genomic sites of both seDSBs and increased R-loop levels (gains) induced by Top1ccs. seDSBs are highly enriched at regions with R-loop gains at highly-transcribed genes in early replicating zones. Kinetics analyses of R-loops and genomic ChIP data of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) revealed that R-loop gains can either be upstream or downstream of RNAPII. TFIIS effects showed that downstream R-loop gains can follow RNAPII backtracking and arrest. seDSB strandness showed that co-directional TRCs occur mainly at downstream hybrid-associated RNAPII, whereas head-on TRCs occur mainly at upstream hybrid-associated RNAPII. Therefore, Top1ccs can increase two structurally-different R-loops and R-loop-associated backtracked RNAPII causes co-directional TRCs at higher rate than head-on collisions. Moreover, Top1ccs trigger micronuclei formation at G1\/early S, but not late S\/G2, which are attenuated by TFIIS. Thus, our findings establish a role of RNAPII backtracking at highly-transcribed genes in Top1cc-induced co-directional TRCs and micronuclei formation. The findings can accelerate the development of new effective strategies to treat cancer patients.

Altered intrinsic signaling pathways significantly contribute to therapeutic resistance, demanding exploration of novel strategies to induce tumor cell demise. Dysregulated cell cycle and DNA damage repair constitute pivotal events driving HNSCC progression, offering potential therapeutic targets.CHK1 and CHK2, pivotal regulators of the DNA replication checkpoint, are promising targets in HNSCC. The convergence of DNA-damaging agents with DNA checkpoint inhibitors represents a burgeoning paradigm in cancer management. Our study delves into elucidating the intrinsic signaling mechanisms triggered by the synergistic action of the CHK1\/2 dual inhibitor (Prexasertib) and the nucleoside analog (Gemcitabine) in HNSCC.Our study unveiled a robust synergistic effect between Prexasertib and Gemcitabine, inducing substantial cell death in multiple HNSCC cell lines and mouse model. Remarkably, the combination rapidly induced DNA damage and reduced tumor growth in vivo. To unravel the underlying intrinsic signaling mechanism provoked by the Prexasertib\/Gemcitabine combination, we conducted comprehensive molecular analyses.Proteomic profiling uncovered distinct alterations in key signaling pathways upon combination treatment. We identified unique overexpression of an embryonic stem cell-specific transcription factor pivotal in genomic stability regulation, solely induced by single-agent Prexasertib. Specifically, the combination therapy showcased unique modulation of critical genes involved in DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle regulation. These alterations included overexpression or suppression of key genes associated with DNA stability and cell proliferation pathways, accompanied by evidence of CHK1\/2 inhibition-mediated DNA damage response accompanied by cleavage of CHK-2 and caspase-3 proteins, validated through Western blots.Additionally, functional assays including the colony formation assays demonstrated markedly reduced survival rates with the combination treatment compared to single-agent therapy. Cell cycle analysis revealed a replication catastrophe and increased pH2AX across multiple HNSCC cell lines following combination treatment.Our findings highlight the significance of CHK1\/2 inhibition coupled with nucleoside analog-induced DNA damage in unveiling novel intrinsic signaling mechanisms in HNSCC. These insights offer a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment efficacy and outcomes in HNSCC.This work has been supported by the MGC, FC, P&#38;MC, and BBSR at the H.

Additionally, over 80% of ECs exhibit PI3K pathway activation (e.g., <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations), linked to enhanced DNA repair and drug resistance. Therefore, we hypothesized that dual ATR and PI3K&#945; inhibition would enhance DNA damage, increasing cell death in EC.<br \/>Methods: CNH EC cell lines included platinum-resistant (KLE, MFE280, HEC1A, ARK2) as well as platinum-sensitive (ARK1) lines used to evaluate the activity of ATR inhibitor (ATRi) camonsertib and PI3K&#945; inhibitor (PI3K&#945;i) inavolisib. Cell growth was assessed by 3-day XTT and 9-12-day colony-forming assays. The degree of combination synergy, additivity, or antagonism was calculated using SynergyFinder with a reference highest single agent (HSA) model. An HSA synergy score &#62; 10 indicates synergy, -10 to 10 suggests additivity and &#60; -10 represents antagonism. DNA damage endpoints were measured by alkaline comet assay and immunoblotting for &#947;-H2AX. Data were repeated in triplicate, analyzed using one-way ANOVA test, and shown as mean &#177; SD. <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.05 was statistically significant.<br \/>Results: All tested EC cell lines showed sensitivity to clinically attainable doses of ATRi monotherapy (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.09 - 0.98 &#956;M), but varying sensitivity to PI3K&#945;i monotherapy (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.03 - 67.01 &#956;M) unrelated to their <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation status. Combination treatment using clinically<br \/>attainable concentrations (camonsertib &#60; 6 &#956;M; inavolisib &#60; 10 &#956;M) yielded additivity in all cell lines independent of platinum sensitivity (HSA synergy scores -0.8-10.0). Notably, increased cytotoxic effects were observed in both <i>PIK3CA<\/i> wild-type (KLE) and <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutant (MFE280 and HEC1A) platinum-resistant lines by colony-forming assays (4.8- to 15.4-fold decrease in colony-forming ability relative to ATRi; 1.5- to 3.5-fold decrease relative to PI3K&#945;i). ATRi and PI3K&#945;i combination induced greater DNA damage, evidenced by elevated mean comet tail moment relative to ATRi (increased 2.5- to 6.7-fold; <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.01) or PI3K&#945;i (increased 2.1- to 5.6-fold; <i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.01) regardless of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation status. Increased &#947;-H2AX levels were found in HEC1A cells with combination treatment (3.2-fold increase relative to ATRi; 16-fold increase relative to PI3K&#945;i).<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that dual inhibition of ATR and PI3K pathways induces greater cell death by increasing DNA damage in platinum-resistant EC cells independent of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PIK3CA,ATR inhibitor,PI3K inhibitor,Endometrial cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Proteins can undergo asymmetric arginine methylation by type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), predominately by PRMT1 and to a lesser extent PRMT4, or symmetric arginine methylation by type II PRMTs, predominately PRMT5. Here, we performed targeted proteomics following inhibition of PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 across cancer cell lines. We found that inhibition of both type I and type II PRMTs suppressed levels of total and phosphorylated ATR protein in cancer cell lines, and down-regulated expression of the ATR<\/i> gene. Loss of ATR from PRMT inhibition resulted in defective DNA replication stress response activation in following exogenous replication stress. Since PARP inhibitors are known to induce replication stress, we next combined PRMT inhibition with PARP inhibition and found inhibition of PRMT1 or PRMT5 greatly exacerbated PARP inhibitor induced DNA damage. Based on this observation, we assessed the combination of PARP and PRMT inhibition in a panel of cell lines. While inhibition of both type I and type II PRMTs were synergistic with PARP inhibition in both cells with intact and deficient homologous recombination, type I PRMT inhibition resulted in higher toxicity in non-malignant cells. Therefore, we validated the synergy of combined PARP\/PRMT5 inhibition in primary patient-derived organoids. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of PARP and PRMT5 inhibition improves overall survival in both BRCA-mutant and wild-type patient-derived xenograft models without any detectable hematological toxicities typically associated with PARPi combination therapies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRMT5 inhibition may be a well-tolerated approach to improve tumor sensitivity to PARP inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Membranous &#946;-catenin interacts with the cellular cytoskeleton through threonine 120 (T120) phosphorylation and its association with &#945;-catenin. We want to investigate the role of protein Kinase D1 (PrKD1) in DNA damage response, using various prostate cancer cell lines; PrKD1-silenced cells (LNCaP sh-PrKD1) and overexpression of PrKD1 (C4-2 PrKD1). PrKD1 silence and overexpress cells were treated with PrKD1 inhibitor and Etoposide to observe the effect of DNA damage repair altering various genes in prostate cancer cells. Silencing &#945;-Catenin increased p-&#947;H2AX (ser-139) expression in C4-2 PrKD1 cells. Conversely silenced PrKD1 (LNCaP sh-PrKD1) cells represented decreased &#945;-Catenin expression, and increased p-&#947;H2AX (ser-139). Overexpression of PrKD1 in prostate cancer cells increased &#945;-catenin levels and conferred resistance to etoposide-induced DNA damage. Silencing PrKD1 compromised DNA damage protective effect. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of Protein kinase D1 (PrKD1), a unique serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates &#946;-catenin at T120, in this interaction. We treated C4-2 and C4-2 PrKD1 cells with PrKD1 inhibitor and immuno-precipitated &#946;-Catenin complex represented decrease in &#946;-Catenin (T-120) and &#945;-Catenin than untreated C4-2 PrKD1 cells. We observed crosstalk between &#945;-catenin and PrKD1 in DNA damage repair. In-silico analysis affirmed that the loss of T120 phosphorylation disrupts &#946;- and &#945;-catenin interaction. PrKD1 inhibitor decreased cell viability in dose response fashion, and also decrease the p-&#947;H2AX (ser-139) in C4-2 PrKD1 cells than C4-2 cells. In vitro findings were corroborated in a mouse prostate cancer PDX xenograft model by inhibiting PrKD1 kinase activity, resulting in reduced &#946;-catenin T120 phosphorylation and &#945;-catenin levels. In vivo experiments with PrKD1 inhibitor represented tolerability in mice and its efficacy in modulating &#945;-catenin and PrKD1 expression to inhibit tumor progression. Study for the first time provides a mechanistic basis of the protective role of PrKD1 against DNA damage.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage and repair,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,DNA repair,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
