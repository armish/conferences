[{"Abstract":"CheckMate 548 (NCT02667587, CM548) is a phase III, randomized trial evaluating first line nivolumab (NIVO) in combination with standard of care (SOC) [surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ)] versus placebo plus SOC in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) positive for promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). MGMT promoter methylation status and PD-L1 expression predict better outcomes in GBM patients treated with TMZ and in patients treated with NIVO in other indications, respectively. However, the impact of varying levels of MGMT promoter methylation and PD-L1 expression on patient outcome in GBM remains unclear. In CM548, MGMT promoter methylation levels were quantified through a central lab assay (LapCorp) and PD-L1 expression was determined by percentage of detectable membrane staining of tumor cells. MGMT methylation and PD-L1 data were prospectively generated at the time of enrolment. Our analyses showed that increasing levels of MGMT promoter methylation level were associated with longer overall survival in patients treated with SOC alone (n = 349). However, no survival benefit was observed with increasing levels of MGMT methylation in patients treated with NIVO in combination with SOC (n = 353). In addition, our data showed a non-linear relationship between PD-L1 expression and overall survival across both arms. In patients with intermediate PD-L1 expression (&#8805;5%, &#60;20%), longer survival was observed in the nivolumab + SOC arm compared to SOC alone. This benefit was not observed in patients with low (&#8805;1%, &#60;5%) and high (&#62;20%) PD-L1 expression. Potential mechanisms driving these observed associations are currently explored using genomic data generated from patient samples. MGMT promoter methylation and PD-L1 expression are potential clinically relevant predictive biomarkers of response to treatments administered in the CM-548; however, the binary classification of positive\/negative status of these markers does not fully capture their relationship with efficacy in CM548. Data generated from our exploratory analyses suggests that new, refined criteria are needed for better patient outcomes prediction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Anti-PD-1,Nivolumab,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-H.

PMID: 37285865). We explore potential associations of ctDNA genomics and tumor gene expression with efficacy in TP-2.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The analysis was based on the safety population (n=799). Two data sets were used: a FoundationOne&#174;Liquid CDx data set (Azad et al. ASCO 2023, #5056) of prospectively collected\/retrospectively analyzed plasma samples (n=681); and a tumor transcriptomic data set generated via HTG&#8217;s Oncology Biomarker Panel (with 10 additional genes implicated in PARP inhibitor sensitivity; n=304). Correlations between baseline molecular biomarkers and rPFS were assessed via a Cox proportional hazards model. Multivariate elastic net regression analysis incorporated 151 pts in the TALA + ENZA arm with 2,868 molecular features (ctDNA: 309 genes [only short variant alterations incorporated]; HTG: 2,559 tumor transcripts).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Positively predictive candidate tumor biomarkers for TALA + ENZA included androgen response signature and individual androgen receptor (AR) target genes such as <i>PSA<\/i>, <i>ALDH1A3<\/i>, and <i>CAMKK2<\/i>. These expression signatures\/transcripts had no\/minimal predictive value for PBO + ENZA. A 33-feature (3 genes, 30 transcripts) elastic net signature was identified that was predictive of rPFS with TALA + ENZA: <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>AR<\/i> short variant alteration status were each prognostic and associated with worse rPFS. Expression of multiple AR target genes, including <i>ALDH1A3<\/i> (top selected feature) and <i>CAMKK2<\/i>, was positively associated with rPFS. For TALA + ENZA, this multiomic signature was predictive of rPFS in pts regardless of HRR gene alteration status, and to a lesser extent for PBO + ENZA. None of the 12 HRR genes used for stratification in TP-2 were included in the signature.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our exploratory analysis identified candidate gene expression signatures, including AR pathway elements, potentially associated with differential benefit from TALA + ENZA, reinforcing the potential for exploitable crosstalk between AR and DNA repair pathways. Though validation is necessary, a predictive multiomic signature for benefit from TALA + ENZA regardless of HRR alteration status was identified that included alterations in genes previously implicated in prognosis and expression of multiple AR target transcripts. Strikingly, it did not include any of the 12 HRR genes used in prospective stratification for TP-2, reinforcing the potential benefit for TALA + ENZA beyond HRR-deficient tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Prostate cancer,Cancer genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

In 2016, the <i>Intense Exercise for Survival among Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer<\/i> (INTERVAL-GAP4) was launched to determine if supervised exercise improves overall survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Here, we describe the demographic characteristics, completion rates, exercise adherence, and safety of the first 12 months of the intervention at the pilot site, Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia.<br \/>Methods: INTERVAL-GAP4 is a multi-center global randomized controlled phase III trial. Patients are randomly allocated (1:1) to: (intervention) a high intensity combined resistance and aerobic exercise supervised program for 1 year tapering to self-management in year 2; or (control) self-directed unsupervised exercise with print materials. Patients were stratified by site and by disease\/treatment status (metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [mHSPC] or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC] and if the latter, treatment modality). The study did not meet recruitment goals and closed to further enrollment in February 2023.<br \/>Results: 240 participants were evaluated between April 2016-Feb 2023, 60 patients were consented, 52 participants were randomized, and two patients did not receive the allocation, resulting in 50 participants (27 intervention and 23 control). Main reasons for exclusion were not meeting clinical criteria (N=81), time commitment (N=24), unable to contact (N=22), not interested (N=19), and poor physical function (N=13). Median age at randomization was 72 years (IQR: 68, 77), median body mass index (BMI) was 31.7 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> (IQR: 27.5, 35.7), 94% identified as white, and time since diagnosis was 5 years (IQR: 1, 9). 13 participants (26%) had mHSPC and 37 (74%) had mCRPC. Completion rates were the following at 6 months: 84% completed surveys, 62% exercise testing, and 66% biological samples. Of 42 alive at 12 months: 85% completed surveys, 73% testing, and 73% biological samples. Median exercise adherence was 90% (IQR: 78, 97) for the first 12 months of the study. Adherence was not significantly different for those with mCRPC vs. mHSPC status. There were 10 SAEs in first 12 months; all (100%) were unrelated to the intervention.<br \/>Conclusions: Exercise training was feasible and safe in men with metastatic prostate cancer with no difference observed in exercise session adherence by disease status. Survey completion was high, while in-person completion rates were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional analysis of the entire study population (N=145) is ongoing and will be compared with the pilot site.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exercise,Prostate cancer,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In cancer TK1 release is increased both by increased cell proliferation and cell death. Thus, serum concentration of TK1 reflects the tumor volume, proliferation rate, and extent of cell death. Serum Thymidine Kinase 1 (sTK1) enzyme has been used as a prognostic, predictive, and monitoring biomarker in leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Additionally, sTK1 enzyme levels have been elevated in breast cancer and prostate cancer. This study evaluated whether sTK1 predicts the risk of castration resistance in patients with metastatic prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).<br \/>Materials and Methods<br \/>sTK1 levels was measured in men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at 3 time points; before the initiation of ADT, 6 months after the start of treatment, and within 6 months before the development of castration resistance. Samples at study visits of ESTO2 trial, which compares atorvastatin to placebo in combination with ADT. The trial intervention was blinded at analysis. Cox regression modeling was used to assess whether sTK1 values predict the risk of castration resistance. sTK1 was analyzed both as continuous and categorical variable, stratified by median value 0.12 ng\/ml. The time from the initiation of ADT to the formation of castration resistance, death, or a general index date (May 31, 2023) was used as the time-metric.<br \/>Results<br \/>The study included serum samples from 70 patients, of which 23 had developed castration resistance by May 31,2023. The median follow-up time was 13 months. The sTK1 value measured before ADT initiation did not predict the risk of castration resistance (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.35). However, sTK1 at 6 months after the initiation of ADT or up to a maximum of 6 months before formation of castration resistance did predict the risk (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.07-2.1 and HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16-2.76, respectively). sTK1 predicted the risk at both measurement points also when analyzed as categorical variable. sTK1 was predictive only among men with metastatic disease; sTK1 no longer predicted the risk of castration resistance who started ADT for biochemically recurrent, non-metastatic disease.<br \/>Conclusions<br \/>Our findings suggest that sTK1 value can be used to predict the risk of progression to castration resistance during ADT in metastatic prostate cancer. However, these findings need validation from larger datasets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Thymidine kinase,Metastatic tumors,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

IMpower151 did not meet its primary endpoint of INV-PFS. The objectives of this biomarker analysis were to characterize the molecular subtypes of metastatic nsqNSCLC and to explore the relationship between molecular subtype, predefined gene expression signatures, PD-L1 status and clinical outcomes with ABCP and BCP.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>RNA sequencing of 250 nsqNSCLC tumor samples from IMpower151 was analyzed in the ACBP (n=123) and BCP (n=127) treatment arms. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was applied to variably expressed genes to define molecular subtypes. Gene expression signatures were defined based on previously published associations with their respective biology. Tumor PD-L1 levels were determined by SP263 immunohistochemistry (Ventana).<br \/><b>Results <\/b>No PD-L1 dependent difference of survival benefit of ABCP compared to BCP was observed at the cutoff of TC 1% or TC 50%. Four molecular subtypes (NMF1-NMF4) were identified based on RNA sequencing. NMF1 (n=78) were immune-depleted and had low tumor proliferation. NMF2 (n=73) were characterized by low level of anti-tumor immune cells, increased expression of stromal signatures and high tumor proliferation. NMF3 (n=65) had the most inflamed transcriptomic profile with high enrichment of immune cells, and increased expression of stromal signatures as well. NMF4 (n=34) had the enrichment of granulocytes, a less inflamed immunophenotype and decreased expression of stromal signatures. The positive rate of PD-L1 expression with TC&#62;=1% was significantly lower in NMF1 compared to other subtypes. None of patients with the four NMF subtypes showed significantly longer PFS or OS with ABCP than BCP. Overall, patients with NMF2 showed numerically shorter PFS and patients with NMF3 showed numerically longer PFS than other subtypes. Gene expression signatures of antitumor cytokines are correlated with survival benefit of ABCP compared to BCP. Patients with high expression level of antitumor cytokines showed substantially improved PFS and OS benefit from ABCP than BCP in both ITT population and EGFR mutation population.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Four molecular subtypes of nsqNSCLC with different immune-cell and tumor microenvironmental features were characterized. NMF2 may identify a fibrotic and immune-depleted subgroup correlated with worse prognosis. NMF3 may identify an immune-inflamed subgroup correlated with better prognosis. Neither NMF subtypes nor PD-L1 IHC level showed a correlation with survival benefit of ABCP controlled by BCP. The gene expression signature of antitumor cytokines could serve as a potential predictive biomarker for survival benefit of ABCP in metastatic nsqNSCLC including EGFR mutant patients. This finding is based on the exploratory analysis of a single clinical trial with limited sample size. It needs further investigation in other cohorts of tumor tissues and with larger clinical potential in blood samples as well.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT06-01 Phase III adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

We report exploratory ctDNA analyses during neoadj treatment (Tx) and associations of ctDNA dynamics and clearance with pathological response, including pCR, MPR and percentage residual viable tumor (%RVT). <b>Methods: <\/b>AEGEAN is a double-blind placebo (PBO)-controlled study (NCT03800134). Adults with Tx-na&#239;ve resectable NSCLC (stage II-IIIB[N2]; AJCC 8th ed) were randomized (1:1) to receive neoadj CT + D or PBO IV (Q3W, 4 cycles) prior to surgery (Sx), followed by D or PBO IV (Q4W, 12 cycles), respectively, after Sx. Evaluable resected samples from patients in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (patients without known <i>EGFR<\/i>\/<i>ALK<\/i> aberrations) were assessed centrally for %RVT and determination of pCR (absence of any RVT in resection specimen, including primary tumor and all sampled lymph nodes) and MPR (&#8804;10% RVT in primary tumor) per IASLC recommendations. Plasma samples were collected prior to each neoadj Tx cycle (at baseline [BL], C2D1, C3D1, and C4D1) and before Sx. ctDNA analysis was performed using patient-specific, tumor-informed assays, following identification of mutations in Tx-na&#239;ve, diagnostic biopsies by whole exome sequencing. ctDNA variant allele fractions (VAFs; mutant sequences as a % of total sequence reads at ctDNA panel sites) and dynamics, including ctDNA clearance, were assessed during neoadj Tx, and their potential associations with pCR, MPR, or %RVT were evaluated. <b>Results:<\/b> ctDNA was evaluated in 831 samples from 186 patients (D arm, n=90; PBO arm, n=96) in the mITT population from the interim pCR analysis cohort (n=402). ctDNA dynamics were assessed during neoadj Tx in relation to whether patients had a pathological response at surgery; patients without surgery were designated as non-responders. BL VAF levels were not significantly different between patients who had tumors with vs without pCR (D arm, P=0.09; PBO arm, P=0.7) or MPR (D arm, P=0.4; PBO arm, P=0.8); however, on-Tx VAF levels were significantly lower in the D arm from C2D1 onwards in patients with vs without pCR (P&#8804;0.001) or MPR (P&#8804;0.01) and in the PBO arm from C3D1 for pCR (P&#8804;0.003) or C2D1 for MPR (P&#8804;0.002). %RVT was significantly lower in patients with vs without ctDNA clearance from C2D1 onwards in the D arm (median, &#60;5% vs &#8805;30%, P&#8804;0.01) and from C3D1 onwards in the PBO arm (median, 10% vs &#8805;50%, P&#8804;0.0004). <b>Conclusions: <\/b>In AEGEAN, reduced VAF levels during neoadj Tx appeared associated with pCR or MPR.

Based on these findings, atezo was approved as adjuvant therapy after platinum-based chemo in patients with completely resected PD-L1 TC &#8805;1% stage II-IIIA NSCLC in the US, China and other countries, and in patients with completely resected PD-L1 TC &#8805;50% stage II-IIIA NSCLC in the EU and other countries. In a previous exploratory analysis at the time of the DFS IA, the IMpower010 Asian subpopulation showed efficacy and safety outcomes that were consistent with those of the global population (Kenmotsu et al. JSMO 2021). Here we report updated data from the IMpower010 Asian subpopulation at the first overall survival (OS) IA.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> The IMpower010 study design and DFS IA have been previously reported (Felip et al. Lancet 2021). Eligible patients with completely resected stage IB (&#8805;4 cm)-IIIA NSCLC (AJCC\/UICC v7) received one to four 21-day cycles of cisplatin-based doublet chemo and were subsequently randomized 1:1 to receive atezo 1200 mg q3w (16 cycles) or BSC. The first pre-specified OS IA was conducted at the clinical cutoff date of Apr 18, 2022. OS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population will be formally tested if DFS in the ITT population reaches statistical significance at the final DFS analysis. Exploratory OS and updated safety outcomes were evaluated in the Asian subpopulation.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> The Asian ITT population included 233 patients recruited from Japan, mainland China, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong. At data cutoff (Apr 18, 2022), the unstratified OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.88) in favor of atezo in the PD-L1 TC &#8805;1% (SP263) stage II-IIIA population (n=129). The Asian safety-evaluable population included 229 patients (atezo, n=122; BSC, n=107). Any-grade adverse events (AEs) were reported in 95.1% (atezo) and 72.0% (BSC) of safety-evaluable patients; events were Grade 3\/4 in 24.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Grade 5 treatment-related AEs occurred in 1 patient in the atezo arm. AEs leading to atezo discontinuation occurred in 21.3% of patients treated with atezo.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> The IMpower010 Asian subpopulation showed an OS trend favoring atezo vs BSC in the PD-L1 TC &#8805;1% stage II-IIIA population, as was observed in the global population, although OS data were not formally tested in either population at the first OS IA. With longer follow-up, the safety findings for atezo in the IMpower010 Asian subpopulation remained broadly unchanged, were consistent with those of the global IMpower010 population and were in line with the known safety profile of atezo.<br \/>Medical writing support for this abstract was provided by Kia C.
