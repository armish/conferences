[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction<\/b>: Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting cancer-cell antigens can improve therapeutic index and show prominent clinical impact. Limited studies have used ADCs to target antigens present in non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment or to deliver immunomodulatory agents. We developed an immune-cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC) TAK-500 that selectively activates STING in C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) expressing cells to achieve enhanced efficacy over non-targeted STING agonists. Here, we spatially mapped CCR2 protein in human NSCLC and studied the immunomodulatory role and anti-tumor effect of the novel iADC TAK-500 on human lung cancer tumor explants <i>ex vivo<\/i>.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (mQIF) panels we measured the levels of CCR2 protein, myeloid cell populations and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 411 primary NSCLC carcinomas from treatment-na&#239;ve patients in 2 independent cohorts and determined their clinical significance. In addition, we longitudinally studied CCR2 levels, myeloid cells (DAPI\/CCR2\/CD68\/CD11b), TILs (DAPI\/CK\/CD4\/CD8\/CD20), T-cell functional markers (DAPI\/CK\/CD3\/Ki-67\/GZMB [Granzyme B]) and cancer-cell death\/proliferation markers (DAPI\/CK\/TFR1\/Ki-67\/CC3 [Cleaved Caspase 3]) in 314 primary cultured tissue fragments from paired tumor and non-tumor specimens resected from 11 lung cancer patients at Yale New Haven Hospital between 2021-2023 (8 adenocarcinomas, 2 small cell carcinomas, and 1 squamous cell carcinoma). Each biopsy was divided into 4-mm<sup>2<\/sup> fragments, cultured in extracellular matrix for 5 days with or without TAK-500 treatment. Samples were processed into FFPE tissue and stained with mQIF panels using a tissue microarray format.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: CCR2 protein was detected in 386 of 411 (94%) NSCLCs from 2 independent cohorts predominantly localized in CD11b+ intratumor myeloid cells and CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Elevated CCR2 was associated with adenocarcinoma histology, increased PD-L1, activating KRAS mutations and longer survival. Treatment with TAK-500 for 5 days reduced CCR2 levels in myeloid cells and CD68+ TAMs, without significant changes in TIL or T-cell GZMB\/Ki-67 levels. TAK-500 also significantly reduced tumor proliferation (Ki-67 expression) and increased tumor cell apoptosis (CC3 levels) after 5 days of treatment. Notably, these TAK-500-induced changes were observed only in tumor specimens with high baseline CCR2 levels above the median in retrospective NSCLC cohorts. No significant effect was observed in the paired non-tumor fragments.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our results reveal prominent myeloid CCR2 expression in a subset of human NSCLCs with distinct clinicopathologic\/molecular characteristics. Using a novel lung cancer explant <i>ex vivo<\/i> system, we demonstrate a CCR2-dependent immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effect of TAK-500 iADC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Tumor explant ex vivo,Myeloid infiltrating cells,STING agonist,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Dazostinag (TAK-676) is a novel systemically delivered STING agonist that ignites the innate immune system and mobilizes adaptive immunity. Preclinical studies with dazostinag demonstrated a strong, persistent CD8+ T cell anti-tumor response driven by innate immune derived type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The role of CD8+ T cells in response to dazostinag was further supported by a previously demonstrated correlation between response and CD8+ T cell frequency in a patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) model of mesothelioma. Within the current work, we sought to determine the extent to which response to dazostinag in mesothelioma depends on CD8+ T cells versus the contribution of other immune cells.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Surgical mesothelioma cases were collected along with clinicopathological variables at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital under an IRB-approved protocol. PDOTS were generated as described previously. Ex vivo response was determined by fluorescent life\/dead imaging, and orthogonally evaluated by multiplexed cytokine array, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry; subset of tumors was studied using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Dazostinag-driven tumor cell killing was evaluated in 20 mesothelioma PDOTS. 11 samples were characterized as responders (R) with a cut-off of &#62;30% reduction in live cell area; 9 as non-responders (NR). In 12 out of 20 PDOTS, CD8 neutralization effect was assessed: four were TAK-676 NR, and out of 8 R 4 had at least 20% killing abrogated by aCD8. Effect did not depend on the baseline amount of CD8+ T cells in the sample. scRNAseq analysis showed that R and NR T cells have different activation\/exhaustion phenotypes and varying levels of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in response to STING agonism. Other cell populations emerged as candidates for dazostinag resistance: NR cases carried remodeled immunosuppressive myeloid cells or matrix metalloproteinases-expressing fibroblasts. In general, myeloid cell abundance at baseline characterized by flow had a trend in negatively correlating with dazostinag response. Intrinsic expression of type I interferons shown by multiplexed cytokine array was linked to dazostinag sensitivity (R vs. NR IFN-&#946; p=0.028; IFN&#945;2a p=0.016) and can potentially be used as a predictor for response.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We evaluated immune modulations in mesothelioma after treatment with a systemic STING agonist dazostinag using human tumor ex vivo culture. Innate interferon type I expression was higher in responding samples. TAK-676 efficacy was partially reduced in absence of effector lymphocytes, however other cells, such as immunosuppressive myeloid cells and fibroblasts, can have a negative impact on dazostinag response in mesothelioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Immunomodulation,Ex vivo,STING agonist,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Given the potential risk of immunotoxicity from associated cytokine release due to STING agonist treatment, there is a need to identify mitigation strategies that minimize immune-related toxicity while offering a therapeutic window for STING-mediated anti-tumor effects. This strategy is particularly relevant for myeloid-targeted immunotherapies, as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) can be myeloid cell-mediated. We utilized preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacological impact of pretreatment with agents routinely used for management of CRS in advance of delivering TAK-500, a novel, systemic, immune-cell directed STING agonist antibody drug conjugate (iADC) that selectively targets CCR2+ myeloid cells.<br \/>Methods: Dexamethasone and anti-IL-6R antibodies were tested at clinically relevant doses 1 hour prior to treatment with TAK-500 or mTAK-500, a murine surrogate, to study immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. Induction of innate and adaptive immune responses and cytokine release was evaluated in human, ex vivo, and in tumor-bearing mouse models to characterize potential impact of premedication strategies on drug pharmacology and anti-tumor efficacy.<br \/>Results: TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent monocyte activation and cytokine secretion ex vivo. Monocyte activation was minimally impacted by dexamethasone or anti-IL-6R pretreatment. Suppression of IL-6 and IFN-&#436; and increase in IL-10 were observed following dexamethasone pretreatment, whereas anti-IL-6R maintained a more proinflammatory milieu. In syngeneic mouse models, pretreatment with dexamethasone and anti-mouse IL-6R had minimal impact on mTAK-500 anti-tumor efficacy. Key pharmacodynamic effects, including innate immune cell activation in periphery and tumor-draining lymph node and intratumoral CD8+ T cell accumulation, were minimally impacted by either pretreatment agent. Serum cytokine analyses demonstrated suppression of IL-6, IFN-&#436; and increases in IL-10 with dexamethasone, but not with anti-IL-6R, similar to ex vivo findings.<br \/>Conclusion: Premedication of TAK-500 and mTAK-500 with dexamethasone or anti-IL-6R antibodies does not substantially impact STING-mediated innate immune activation, mobilization of adaptive immune responses or anti-tumor efficacy, despite altered cytokine profiles compared to (m)TAK-500 without premedication. Clinically, these premedication strategies have been effective in mitigating immunotherapy-associated CRS with T cell therapeutics, and here resulted in maintained anti-tumor activity when used in combination with TAK-500, suggesting a viable potential strategy for mitigation of STING-induced immunotoxicities in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,STING,TAK-500,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Most STING agonists were tested in clinical trials using intratumoral injection with limited systemic efficacy. Several systemically administered STING agonists have progressed to clinical trials, with their efficacy yet to be determined, while their systemic toxicity may limit their application. Our study aimed to develop a novel systemically administrated non-nucleotide STING agonist formulated within albumin nanoparticles, demonstrating potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity.<br \/>Methods &#38; Results: We synthesized a novel non-nucleotide small molecule STING dimer ZSA-51D. The acid form of ZSA-51D exhibited a high binding affinity (EC 50: 1.3 nM) to human STING. ZSA-51D demonstrated potent STING activation in THP1-Blue<sup>TM<\/sup> ISG cells, with an EC50 of 5.1 nM. To enable systemic delivery, ZSA-51D was encapsulated in albumin nanoparticles (nano ZSA-51D) with a particle size of 115 nm. Surprisingly, nano ZSA-51D exhibited a tenfold increase in STING activation (EC50 of 0.44 nM) compared to free ZSA-51D. Furthermore, nano ZSA-51D demonstrated sevenfold greater activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (EC 50 of 3.5 nM), and eightfold enhanced repolarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (EC 50 of 4.2 nM) from M2 to M1 compared to free ZSA-51D. The <i>in-vivo<\/i> anticancer efficacy was evaluated on MC-38 and KPC 6620 xenograft in C57BL\/6 mice using intravenous administration of ZSA-51D (1 mg\/kg) or nano ZSA-51D, in combination with PD-1 antibody (&#945;-PD1, 100 &#956;g) for 5 dose every 3 days. The results revealed that nano ZSA-51D exhibited superior anticancer effects compared to free ZSA-51D. Remarkedly, nano ZSA-51D, in combination with &#945;-PD1, completely eradicated cancer in the MC-38 xenograft model. These cured mice completely rejected the rechallenge with MC38 cells 120 days after the initial tumor inoculation, indicating potent and long-term anticancer immune memory for anticancer activity. In addition, we performed the toxicity evaluation of nano ZSA-51D and free ZSA-51D at the same dose regime as the efficacy study. Nano ZSA-51D shows no hematological and liver toxicity. However, free ZSA-51D has a sever local inflammation after injections, whereas nano ZSA-51D has no local toxicity.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we developed a novel systemically administered non-nucleotide sting agonist formulated within albumin nanoparticles. Nano ZSA-51, in combination with &#945;-PD1, demonstrated superior anticancer efficacy and low toxicity, holding the potential for future clinical trials. The significantly enhanced STING activation and in vivo efficacy of nano ZSA-51D warrant further investigation into its underlying mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Drug discovery,Drug delivery,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>JINSONG TAO<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hongyi Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Zhongwei Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hanning Wen<sup><\/sup>, Chengyi Li<sup><\/sup>, Qiuxia Li<sup><\/sup>, Miao He<sup><\/sup>, Bo Wen<sup><\/sup>, Wei Gao<sup><\/sup>, Duxin Sun<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"eb662222-20c6-4918-89c1-99c62df88fe4","ControlNumber":"2533","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a T-cell excluded or deserted tumor microenvironment. Innate agonist treatments may serve as a T cell priming mechanism to sensitize PDACs to anti-PD-1 antibody (a-PD-1) treatment.<br \/>Design: Using a transplant murine model with spontaneously formed liver metastasis and also the genetically engineered KPC mouse model that spontaneously develops PDAC, we compared the antitumor efficacy between intrahepatic\/intratumoral and intramuscular systemic administration of BMS-986301, a next-generation STING agonist. Flow cytometry, Nanostring, and cytokine assays were used to evaluate local and systemic immune responses.<br \/>Results: The study demonstrated that administration of STING agonist systemically via intramuscular injection is equivalent or potentially superior to its intratumoral injection in inducing both effector T cell response and antitumor efficacy. Compared to intratumoral administration, T cell exhaustion and immunosuppressive signals induced by systemic administration were attenuated.

Frameshift insertion\/deletions (fs-indels) are a key source of immunogenic neoantigens. However, fs-indels often result in the introduction of premature termination codons (PTCs), leading to mRNA degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. In human malignancies, NMD activity is increased in response to the heightened burden of somatic fs-indel mutations and effectively prevents the generation of highly immunogenic tumor-specific neoantigens, thereby promoting immune evasion.<br \/><b>Approach: <\/b>Here, we pharmacologically targeted SMG1, a core component of the NMD pathway, for the first time in patient tumor and normal samples as well as in a panel of human cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids, to prevent the degradation of highly immunogenic frame-shifted transcripts. We analyzed the changes in transcriptome, proteome and immunopeptidome following SMG1 inhibition (SMG1i). We then made use of tumor-T cell co-cultures and Patient-Derived Tumor Fragments (PDTFs) to assess the effects of SMG1i on anti-tumor immunogenicity. Ex vivo immunological responses were measured by high-dimensional flow cytometry, cytometric bead array and single cell RNA and TCR sequencing.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our data demonstrates a significant increase in T cell activation, expansion of tumor-reactive intratumoural CD8<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes and cytokine secretion following SMG1 inhibition in ex vivo PTDFs (n=15) but not in matched normal-adjacent tissue (n=10). Mechanistically, SMG1 inhibition increased the abundance of frame-shifted mRNA transcripts, and aberrant HLA-presented peptides. Co-culture of tumor cells and patient-derived organoids with CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells upon SMG1 inhibition induced potent MHC class I antigen-dependent T cell activation and tumor cell killing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings, in a clinically relevant platform, highlight SMG1 inhibition as a novel cancer immunotherapy approach to promote neoantigen production and to induce anti-tumor immunogenicity irrespective of the tumor type or TMB status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Neoantigens,Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,Immunogenic cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Here, we asked whether these distinct immunotherapies utilize similar cellular and functional mechanisms. We used multiple approaches to compare effective therapeutic mutant neoantigen (NeoAg) cancer vaccines with &#945;PD-1, &#945;CTLA-4, or &#945;PD-1 and &#945;CTLA-4 ICT in preclinical <i>Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup>Cdkn2a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> melanoma models. Synthetic long peptide (SLP) MHC-I NeoAg vaccines induced a more than 3-fold expansion of proliferating intratumoral NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells that were functional despite high expression of PD-1 and TIM-3. NeoAg vaccines required not only CD8, but also CD4 T cells for efficacy. &#945;CTLA-4 and\/or &#945;PD-1 ICT also increased the frequency and effector capabilities of CD8 T cells but to much less of an extent than NeoAg vaccines. These included NeoAg-specific CD8 T cells that displayed reduced expression of PD-1 and TIM-3. &#945;CTLA-4 treated tumors displayed robust induction of ICOS<sup>+<\/sup> Th1-like CD4 T cells expressing Bhlhe40 that resembled Th1-like CD4 T cells described in &#945;CTLA-4-treated patients and when &#945;CTLA-4 was combined with &#945;PD-1, a small subset of Th2-like CD4 T cells was observed. Remarkably, we noted divergent effects on certain subsets of intratumoral macrophage populations induced by NeoAg vaccines as compared to ICT. Although effective NeoAg vaccines expanded M1-like iNOS<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages with ICT also following this same pattern, NeoAg vaccines expanded rather than suppressed (as observed with ICT) distinct subpopulations of M2-like CX3CR1<sup>+<\/sup> CD206<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages. CODEX spatial imaging using a 46-marker panel revealed tumors from mice treated with NeoAg vaccines displayed concentrations of CD8 T cells expressing functional markers and the proliferation marker Ki67, with mice treated with &#945;CTLA-4 or &#945;PD-1 displaying both Ki67<sup>+<\/sup> conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells within interior regions of tumor. Interestingly, these regions contained prominent blood vessels, along with MHC-II<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells and iNOS<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages. Our work shows that NeoAg vaccines lead to distinct, as well as overlapping alterations when compared to ICT. These distinct alterations provided a rationale for combination therapies that we validated in both our melanoma model, as well as the MC38 tumor model, where delayed treatment with NeoAg vaccines combined with &#945;CTLA-4 or &#945;PD-1 yielded anti-tumor immunity that was superior to combination &#945;PD-1 and &#945;CTLA-4. These findings suggest that NeoAg vaccines combined with single-agent ICT may be an effective therapy with potentially less toxicity than &#945;PD-1\/&#945;CTLA-4 combination ICT. Further, we hypothesize that immunotherapies that deplete CX3CR1<sup>+<\/sup> CD206<sup>+ <\/sup>macrophages may synergize with NeoAg cancer vaccines, which we are currently assessing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Cancer vaccines,Immune checkpoint therapy,Preclinical models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that immunotherapy can be highly effective. Our lab has been working on an immunotherapy approach to treat women with ovarian cancer that utilizes mesoporous silica nanoparticles(MSN). MSN that present pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) are able to significantly reduce tumor burden in mouse models of serous epithelial ovarian cancer when administered by intraperitoneal injection. These microbial mimetic particles are decorated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), CpG oligonucleotide, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). When in the presence of antigen presenting cells, they bind to Toll-like receptors (TLR) present on the cell surface and within the endosome. To better understand mechanisms underlying their efficacy, we injected fluorescent MSN-PEI-CpG-MPLA (100 or 500 nm) or unmodified MSN into mice with advanced ovarian cancer. The particles, regardless of the presence of TLR-agonists, were rapidly internalized by myeloid cells, with trafficking almost exclusively to immune clusters located in tumor-burdened adipose tissues when administered by intraperitoneal injection. Conversely, intravenous injection of MSN-PEI-CpG-MPLA led to predominate accumulation in liver, with no particles found in tertiary lymphoid clusters 24 hours post injection. Furthermore, unlike intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection of MSN-PEI-CpG-MPLA was without therapeutic effect. Currently we are studying MSN safety and the impact of administration route and dose on efficacy and cytotoxicity. In summary, MSN, with and without TLR agonists, are trafficked by myeloid cells to tumor-burdened fat-associated lymphoid clusters when administered by intraperitoneal injection. Intraperitoneal injection of TLR-agonist modified MSN effectively reduces tumor burden in mice with ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunotherapy,mesoporous silica nanoparticles,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Here we report that novel mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccinations induce robust expansion of antigen-specific T cells, although this does not always correlate with their ability to infiltrate and kill solid tumors. Using a portfolio of novel ionizable lipids and a robust <i>in vivo<\/i> model that reliably identifies LNPs with prominent anti-tissue T cell activity we have identified a putative LNP candidate that provides long term tumor control in a murine syngeneic tumor model.<br \/>We utilized the model antigen glycoprotein (Gp), from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and produced mRNA encoding the immunodominant epitopes gp33<sub>33-41<\/sub>, gp61<sub>61-80<\/sub> and gp276<sub>276-286<\/sub> (3GP-mRNA).

Successful candidate LNPs were then tested in the RIPgp model of autoimmune diabetes. RIPgp transgenic mice express LCMV-Gp in the pancreatic &#946; cells and offer a robust assay for the ability to induce antigen-specific T cells capable of breaking self-tolerance and infiltrating and killing target tissue. Utilizing the RIPgp model to screen LNP candidates we identified a lead candidate, C2-5A, that both induced a robust expansion of antigen-specific T cells and tissue destruction. When utilized in a colon adenocarcinoma model expressing the LCMV-Gp antigen (MC38-Gp), therapeutic dosing of LNP C2-5A as a monotherapy lead to long term tumor clearance in 40% of the treated animals. We believe this screening platform allows the selection of LNP candidates capable of breaking self-tolerance, and one such candidate C2-5A provides a potent vehicle and adjuvant for mRNA based cancer vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,mRNA,Vaccines,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"D.

The urgent need for effective treatments has driven research into immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, which have demonstrated significant clinical benefits across various cancer types. Despite the success of ICB therapies, a significant proportion of CRC patients exhibit resistance to treatment, prompting the identification of mechanisms that hinder therapy resistance or enhance treatment response. CRC cells display remarkable adaptability, orchestrating metabolic changes that confer growth advantages, pro-tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic resistance. One such metabolic change occurs in glutamine metabolism. In this study, we found that colorectal tumors with high glutaminase (GLS) expression exhibit reduced T-cell infiltration and cytotoxicity, leading to poor clinical outcomes. To validate these findings, we applied the ovalbumin (OVA)\/OT-I T cell-based cytotoxicity assay and the CRC patient-derived organoids (PDOs)\/autologous T cell killing assay. Our results indicated that inhibition of GLS significantly enhanced T-cell cytotoxicity in vitro and ex vivo. Mechanistically, we elucidated that inhibition of GLS activated reactive oxygen species-related signaling pathways in tumor cells, thereby potentially increasing tumor immunogenicity by promoting antigen presentation. The combinational therapy of GLS inhibitor and ICB exhibited a superior tumor growth inhibitory effect in comparison with either of the monotherapies. These findings shed new light on clinical therapeutic strategies for CRC patients, offering a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of ICB therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Glutamine metabolism,Antigen presentation,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Globally, HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer, leading to over 890,000 new cases and more than 450,000 deaths annually. Primary risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (HPV-positive HNSCC) and exposure to tobacco and excessive alcohol (HPV-negative HNSCC). Despite multimodal treatments, survival rates remain low due to recurrence and metastasis (R\/M HNSCC), creating a need for safe, innovative therapies to reduce tumor burden with minimal adverse events. PV-10 (10% rose bengal sodium) is a novel intratumoral immunotherapeutic agent that has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor cancer types with few adverse effects in pre-clinical research and clinical trials. However, the role of PV-10 in HNSCCs and its role in enhancing immune response warrants further investigation.<br \/>Methods: Cell viability was assessed using Alamar blue assay after PV-10 treatment of murine mEER and MTE-RAS HNSCC tumor cell lines. To evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of PV-10, we employed flow cytometry, confocal analysis, and luminescence-based assays. Additionally, we performed a DCFDA assay to measure the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V\/dead cell apoptosis assay to evaluate apoptosis. To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying PV-10's immunomodulatory effects in cancer cells and tumors from mice, western blotting and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) were used.<br \/>Results: Our <i>in vitro<\/i> findings reveal that PV-10 induces cytotoxicity in both mEER and MTE-RAS cells. Notably, PV-10 promotes a significant increase in ROS, leading to an elevation in late apoptotic cells. Markers of immunogenic cell death (ICD), including a statistically significant increase in the release of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules HMGB1 and ATP, as well as enhanced surface expression of calreticulin, HSP-70, and HSP-90, were observed. At the molecular level, a remarkable activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, pro-apoptotic protein, and autophagy markers were observed. Intratumoral PV-10 injection <i>in vivo<\/i> has shown significant tumor regression in both mEER and MTE-RAS tumors, and a complete response was noticed in some mice, indicating that PV-10 induces potent ICD in both mEER and MTE-RAS tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Our collated evidence strongly suggests that PV-10 induces ICD-associated immunogenicity in both mEER and MTE-RAS <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo,<\/i> fostered by ROS-based ER stress and apoptosis. These findings hold promise for potential therapeutic avenues to manage HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor effect,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cytotoxicity,Preclinical testing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Despite considerable research efforts and progress, the effectiveness of cancer vaccines remains a challenge. This is primarily due to relatively low immune responses against tumors, stemming from issues of poor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive microenvironment commonly found in many solid tumors. Use of an optimal adjuvant can augment immune responses against tumor antigens and guide them towards a specific adaptive immune enhancement. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a primary role in initiating immunes response to vaccines, often through activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs). Identifying novel immunomodulatory proteins that regulate DCs or TLR activation can identify novel adjuvant candidates with applications for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: We constructed a Membrane Proteome Array (MPA) encompassing ~6,000 structurally intact human membrane proteins in their native conformation (94% of the entire membrane proteome) and used it to screen for cellular proteins that can modulate response to vaccination through DCs and TLRs. To identify proteins that interact with TLRs, the library was expressed in live TLR reporter cells, and these cells were tested for response to known activators. In addition, cells expressing the MPA were presented to DCs to identify membrane proteins that modulate DC activity. TLR-expressing cell activation was measuring using an NF-kB-activated luciferase reporter, while DC assays used upregulation of cell surface markers (CD80, CD83, and MHCII) to measure the activation of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells.<br \/>Results: Screening of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR5 reporter cell lines identified both known and novel regulators of TLR activation. Activators common to several TLRs were identified as well as activators unique to individual TLRs. Screening of primary human DCs likewise identified known regulators of activation (for example CD40L) and several novel targets. Putative novel regulators of DC activation are being further investigated to determine their biological significance.<br \/>Conclusion: Discovering novel immunomodulatory targets and proteins that regulate DCs and TLR activation can identify novel adjuvant candidates with targeted immune outcomes, such as immune stimulating and anti-cancer responses. This study identified novel regulators of immune activation which are being further investigated as adjuvant candidates for cancer vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adjuvant,Dendritic cells,Toll-Like Receptors,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Significant enthusiasm existed for immunotherapy\/HMA combinations for these patients, but studies have failed to deliver on the initial promise. We have demonstrated that patients with MDS have a deficiency in antigen-presenting cells, called CD141<sup>Hi <\/sup>dendritic cells (DC). DC-deficient MDS patients have reduced response to HMAs, worse overall survival, and show less response to cancer vaccination. We hypothesized that restoration of this population using a novel DC vaccination approach - alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cells (&#945;DC1) - might compensate for this deficiency and restore immunity. To generate &#945;DC1s, we collected monocytes from MDS patients and healthy donors (HD) and cultured them for 6 days <i>in vitro <\/i>in the presence of recombinant human GM-CSF and IL-4 followed by an additional 18-24 hours in the presence of &#945;DC1 maturation factors (poly-I:C\/IFN&#945;\/IFN&#947;\/TNF&#945;\/IL-1&#946;). Overall, we attempted to generate &#945;DC1s from 15 MDS samples; 13\/15 exhibited intermediate to very high-risk disease and 10\/15 are currently receiving HMA therapy. We successfully cultured cells from 8\/15 samples (53%). Of the 8 MDS samples, 5 were collected from patients receiving HMA therapy (62.5%). We were unable to successfully culture &#945;DC1s from the other 5 patients receiving HMA therapy, and thus the effect of HMA therapy on aDC1 generation remains unclear. To test the function of MDS &#945;DC1s, we focused on two signals necessary to activate immune responses: 1) the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and 2) the production of IL-12p70. Flow cytometric analysis on &#945;DC1s and immature DCs from MDS samples revealed intra-patient variation in the fold-change surface expression of CD40\/80\/83\/86 and HLA-DR proteins. Additionally, there was a trend towards decreased up-regulation of CD80 and CD86 in MDS specimens compared to HD. To assess production of IL-12p70, we stimulated immature DCs and &#945;DC1s with CD40L and performed ELISA analysis on the media supernatant. We found that 3 out of 4 samples could produce IL-12p70 (range 27 - 5,480 pg\/ml). To date, our results suggest that generation of MDS patient-derived &#945;DC1 cells is feasible and additional work is being performed to fully characterize their ability to activate anti-MDS immune responses. Since &#945;DC1s have an established safety profile in patients with solid tumors, we anticipate that we will be able to rapidly translate our results to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Vaccines,Myelodysplastic syndromes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"D.

This hyaluronic acid derivative (HA nanogel) has demonstrated the ability to encapsulate various modalities, including low- and medium-sized molecules, peptides, and proteins. Previous reports have highlighted its efficacy in solubilizing poorly water-soluble drugs and serving as a sustained-release matrix. In this study, we explore the potential of HA nanogels encapsulating antigen peptides with adjuvant as a cancer vaccine and a priming tool for combinational immunotherapy.<br \/>Method: We prepared HA nanogels as a novel peptide carrier for cancer vaccines and attempted to encapsulate various peptides, including neoantigen (mERK2) peptides expressed in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy-resistant fibrosarcoma cell line CMS5a, gp-100 peptides expressed in metastatic melanoma cell line B16F10, and MAGEA4. Our experiments covered APC uptake, antigen-specific CTL induction, and anti-tumor studies to demonstrate the utility of HA nanogels in these applications.<br \/>Results: HA nanogel efficiently formed stable complexes with mERK2, gp-100 and MAGEA4 long peptides, each with diameters of 30-100nm. The facile and simple vaccine formulation processes with HA nanogel achieved high drug content and high encapsulation efficiency of 90% or higher. Fluorescently labeled mERK2 long peptide encapsulated in HA nanogel vaccines were subcutaneously administered to BALB\/c mice, and uptake analysis of mERK2 long peptides in draining lymph nodes (dLN) was performed using flow cytometry. In comparison to the group receiving mERK2 long peptide without nanogel encapsulation, the HA nanogel group exhibited higher uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells in the dLN. Administering HA nanogel vaccines containing mERK2 long peptides with CpG oligoDNA resulted in higher antigen-specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells compared to the group receiving mERK2 long peptides without encapsulation. Strong anti-tumor effects were demonstrated in mice models with subcutaneously transplanted CMS5a and B16F10 cell lines. The enhanced efficacy through co-administration with ICI was also confirmed.<br \/>Conclusion: HA nanogel vaccines efficiently deliver antigen peptides to macrophages and dendritic cells, inducing antigen-specific CTL responses, thereby demonstrating anti-tumor effects against cold tumors such as CMS5a and B16F10. HA nanogels have the potential not only as carriers for cancer vaccines but also as priming tools for combinational immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Nanoparticle,Adjuvant,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

We developed a <u>T<\/u>oll-like <u>R<\/u>eceptor <u>A<\/u>gonist <u>A<\/u>ntibody <u>C<\/u>onjugate (TRAAC) comprised of a potent TLR9 agonist (T-CpG) conjugated to an antibody against CD22, a receptor restricted to B cells (TAC-001). Systemically administered TAC-001 delivers T-CpG to B cells, resulting in TLR9 activation, and innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity<sup>3<\/sup>. TAC-001 is being evaluated as an immunotherapy in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05399654)<sup>4<\/sup>. In this study, we investigated whether TAC-001 mouse surrogate, mCD22 TRAAC, can potentiate cancer vaccine efficacy using preclinical vaccination models. Human Nectin-4 ectodomain protein (N4, 94% homology to its mouse ortholog) was used as a neoantigen-like vaccine, alone and in combination with mCD22 TRAAC, MPLA (a TLR4 agonist), or unconjugated T-CpG. Mice were immunized, then challenged 2 months later with syngeneic CT26 tumors expressing N4. Mice in treatment combination cohorts that resisted tumor development were split into two groups and rechallenged 3.5 months later with a more aggressive tumor, syngeneic 4T1 or 4T1 expressing N4. The combination of vaccine with mCD22 TRAAC was the only treatment able to inhibit growth of the 4T1-N4 tumor. No efficacy was observed in mice inoculated with parental 4T1, thereby demonstrating neoantigen vaccine specific anti-tumor immunity. An MHCI restricted peptide of HER2\/neu, GP2, fused to a B cell epitope peptide, P4, and conjugated to KLH, was used as another vaccine model<sup>5<\/sup>. GP2-P4-KLH was administered to mice alone or in combination with mCD22 TRAAC or unconjugated T-CpG. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> GP2\/GP2-P4 stimulation of lymphoid organ immune cells from mice treated with vaccine plus mCD22 TRAAC resulted in elevated Granzyme B, IFN&#947; and IL17A levels, indicating that mCD22 TRAAC enhances T cell activation and cytotoxic activity. Lastly, to investigate the effect of mCD22 TRAAC in elderly mice, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was used as a vaccine. Spike was administered alone or in combination with mCD22 TRAAC, MPLA or T-CpG. Combining mCD22 TRAAC with vaccine resulted in high levels of spike neutralizing IgG in both youth and elderly cohorts, showing that mCD22 TRAAC rejuvenates vaccine responses in elderly. In all studies, mCD22 TRAAC led to the most potent vaccine recall response, with high antigen specific IgG titers skewing towards a Th1 phenotype, as shown by elevated levels of effector function antibodies of IgG2a subclass and increased IFN&#947; production. These findings provide a strong rationale for combining TAC-001 with cancer vaccines.

However, engineering neoantigen-displaying phages for cancer vaccines using phage display technology has been challenging and yielded inconsistent results.<br \/>We developed a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting cancer vaccine platform with M13 filamentous phages using the phage display technology. The engineered phages express DC-targeting peptides (SLS) on p3 sites and spy-catcher proteins on p8 positions, allowing neoantigens and proteins of interest to be linked to the phage vector. We named our platform SCP (SLS-spy catcher phage). Imaging and western blot showed that spy-tagged proteins can be easily attached to SCP by simple mixing. Further studies demonstrated that targeting DCs can enhance antigen presentation and anti-cancer immunity.<br \/>We tested SCP in MB49 and B16 mouse models and the serum, spleen and tumor tissues were isolated for further investigation of immune response upon treatment. We found that SCP effectively suppressed tumor growth by inducing systemic anti-tumor humoral and cell-mediated immunity. SCP also showed efficacy in late-stage tumor models. SCP treatment triggered particularly robust local anti-tumor response. Histological and flow cytometry analysis revealed increased infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells, reduced PDL1 expression, and restricted neovascularization in the tumor microenvironment after intratumoral administration of SCP.<br \/>Our study demonstrated that SCP can induce multifactorial modifications in the tumor microenvironment to impede tumor growth. SCP overcomes the limitations of traditional phage display technology, enabling a wide variety of peptides and proteins to be loaded onto the phage vectors. SCP is also cost-effective and scalable as phage production and purification processes are relatively mature. We propose that SCP can serve as a universal platform for cancer immunotherapy, and may offer novel treatment options for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunomodulation,Phage display,Synthetic biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

DNA-based cancer vaccines have shown promise in generating precise and long-lasting immune responses. In particular DNA vaccines are capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of DNA vaccines targeting the mouse Tyrosine-related protein-2 (Trp2) and human New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) TAAs in mouse melanoma model. These DNA vaccines were formulated with a functionalized polymer designed to protect DNA from degradation and improve its bioavailability<i>. <\/i><i> <\/i>DNA vaccines targeting both mouse Trp2 (pVACTR) and human NYESO-1 (pVACNY) were constructed. A mouse melanoma cell line (B16F10-NY) overexpressing human NYESO-1 was also generated and demonstrated to induce tumors in C57BL\/6 mice. Female C57BL\/6 mice received two doses of intramuscular (i.m.) injection of formulated pVACTR or pVACNY or a combination <i>thereof<\/i>, formulated with the synthetic functionalized polymer, with a 3-week interval. The DNA vaccination induced a potent T cell response, as evidenced by ELISPOT assays showing strong IFN-&#947; secreting T cells against NYESO-1 and Trp2. Flow cytometry analysis of spleenocytes showed strong IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; secreting CD4 T cells against NYESO-1. We further evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of DNA vaccines targeting both Trp2 and NYESO-1 using a murine syngeneic model. Animals were challenged with a lethal dose of B16F10-NY two weeks after the second immunization exhibited a significant (p&#60;0.0001) delay in tumor progression and a substantial increase in survival compared to the mock control group. In the therapeutic testing, animals challenged with B16F10-NY and subsequently vaccinated at 4, 11, and 25 days also demonstrated delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival. These findings indicate that formulated DNA vaccine delivered via i.m. triggers robust T cell responses and exhibit both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy, leading to significantly prolonged survival and delayed tumor growth. A DNA-based vaccine independent of viral vector or device has potential to elicit potent anti-tumor responses with better safety and compliance.<i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor-associated antigen (TAA),DNA vaccine,Melanoma\/skin cancers,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

PDAC is characterized by highly dense stroma, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), high resistance to chemotherapy, and poor presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) by dendritic cells (DC), which results in low immune cell infiltration to the tumor site. To that end, we designed a DC-targeted nanovaccine (NV) containing PDAC TAA and TLR agonists to modulate the PDAC immune-microenvironment. In recent years, the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy has been explored for PDAC therapy to improve efficacy. Therefore, we demonstrate the effect of our NV on the anti-tumor immune-mediated response in PDAC-bearing mice, alone and in combination with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel (Gem\/NabP). Our DC-targeted NV was formulated by the double emulsion method and loaded with PDAC&#8217;s TAA and immune potentiators. We conjugated the NV to a mannose moiety as a targeting moiety for the mannose receptor expressed on DC to increase the NV uptake, which resulted in the enhanced presentation of the encapsulated TAA. Followed by physicochemical characterization and evaluation of preclinical safety of the NV, the stimulation of T cell-specific response against PDAC tumor was assessed <i>in vivo <\/i>and<i> ex vivo<\/i>. The NV induced significant changes in PDAC&#8217;s TME, such as increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, decreased CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T regulatory cells, and induced memory immunity in the tumor site. The combination of NV and Gem\/NabP inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to mice treated with Gem\/NabP alone. This could also be related to the immunogenic cell death effect caused by the chemotherapies.<b> <\/b>In addition to our mice model of PDAC, we also established a patient-derived model, in which we generate 3D-spheroids from the patient&#8217;s tumor and activate PBMCs with our NV from the same patient. This unique 3D model enables us to evaluate <i>ex vivo<\/i> the NV effect in a more clinically relevant manner. The NV proposed herein could induce a strong antigen-specific immune response against PDAC with restricted tumor growth while re-shaping PDAC immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, our 3D patient-derived PDAC model allows us to assess the ability of our NV to generate specific immune responses in patients and to test other possible drug combinations predicting the clinical outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Immunotherapy,Nanoparticle,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

If detected before the tumor has metastasized, osteosarcoma has a 75% survival at 5 years after the conventional therapy with surgery and chemotherapy. However, most osteosarcomas are high-grade tumors that grow quickly and spread before being detected, lowering patient survival to 20%.<br \/>Our unique protocol using the human platelet lysate PLTMax<sup>&#174; <\/sup>allows establishing tumor cell lines without genetically modifying cells and with minimal genetic drift. The use of PLTMax<sup>&#174;<\/sup> and allogeneic tumor cell cultures has proven to be a major advantage for the generation of large amounts of rich tumor antigen libraries for dendritic cell (DC) vaccines. This protocol was used in an autologous dendritic cell \/ allogeneic tumor lysate vaccine developed at the Mayo Clinic and licensed to Mill Creek Life Sciences (MCLS) to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), which normally has a poor survival rate at only 2%. The technology was used in a phase I clinical trial (MC1272) performed at the Mayo Clinic. The clinical outcomes proved over a 10 time increase in survival rate of patients that received the DC vaccine after the conventional therapy, providing over 20% three-year survival rate.<br \/>Our technology differs from other clinically used DC vaccines in three primary ways:<br \/>a) Highly efficient cell line establishment: The unique method for generating tumor cell lines uses Mill Creek Life Sciences&#8217; PLTMax<sup>&#174;<\/sup>, a media supplement derived from human platelets. PLTMax<sup>&#174;<\/sup> more closely mimics the native microenvironment of tumors and is used to reduce genetic drift and senescence.<br \/>b) High genetic fidelity: GBM tumor cells expanded via PLTMax<sup>&#174;<\/sup> maintain genetic fidelity and TAA expression&#8212;a feat that has not been previously achieved by any other GBM cell culture method.<br \/>c) Reduction of treatment delays and inclusion of all patients that qualify for treatment: Because we will use allogeneic tumor cell lines, we will be able to avoid delays in treatment caused by the time required to culture autologous tumor cell lines, and all patients may receive treatment without exclusion.<br \/>Through our preliminary work we transferred the technology from a labor-intensive, small-scale approach, to an automated scalable system. Our ultimate goal is to apply this strategy to not only osteosarcoma, but also several other tumor types to validate it as a platform. Like osteosarcoma, there are other therapy-refractory cancers that we believe can benefit from the use of our platform technology, through the use of DC vaccines that offer an immune response against a wider panel of tumor antigens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Immunotherapy,Dendritic cells,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

Recent studies reveal that responses to PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade are associated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cell infiltration and high baseline PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), while impaired tumor antigen presentation and the immunosuppressive TME have been associated with resistance to ICB. One approach to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance is to intratumorally vaccinate NSCLC tumors with gene modified conventional dendritic cells (cDC), specifically the type I conventional DC (cDC1) lineage. Recent studies have established that generation of an anti-tumor immune response driven by CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cells requires the cross presentation of tumor associated antigens and that cDC1s are the primary cross presenting APC subtype&nbsp;<i>in vivo,&nbsp;<\/i>which can license CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cells to initiate an adaptive anti-tumor immune response. In addition, previous studies have shown that intratumoral administration of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) protein can expand endogenous CD103<sup>+&nbsp;<\/sup>cDC1s in the TME and augment anti-tumor immune responses to ICB therapy. Here, we engineered murine CD103<sup>+&nbsp;<\/sup>cDC1s to constitutively secrete soluble FLT3L (FLT3L_cDC1) and performed&nbsp;<i>in situ<\/i>&nbsp;vaccination studies on anti-PD1 resistant murine models of NSCLC with LKB1-deficiency and elevated TMB that better represents human disease. <i>In situ <\/i>vaccination with FLT3L_cDC1 enhances anti-tumor efficacy compared to non-modified cDC1 vaccination and synergizes with anti-PD-1 ICB to inhibit tumor growth.

Unlike traditional vaccines, which are designed to prevent diseases by stimulating an immune response against a specific pathogen, personalized cancer vaccines are therapeutic, aiming to treat cancer by training the immune system to recognize and attack the patient&#8217;s own cancer cells. The key is to induce a fast, strong, broad, and persistent CD8+ T cell response.<br \/>Nykode Therapeutics has developed a platform that targets antigens directly to antigen presenting cells (APCs) using a modular dimeric protein format known as a Vaccibody<sup>TM<\/sup>. Individualized neoantigen vaccines delivered in a DNA-encoded Vaccibody format have been shown to induce strong and broad T cell responses in pre-clinical and clinical settings.<br \/>Here, we wanted to determine if the APC-targeted approach leads to superior T cell responses if Vaccibody vaccines are encoded in mRNA and administered in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. For this purpose, we designed and evaluated a model cancer vaccine composed of 20 unstructured 27 amino acid long neoantigens derived from the murine MC38 tumor model.<br \/>A DNA-encoded Vaccibody vaccine elicited faster T cell responses compared to an untargeted mRNA-LNP-encoded vaccine. DNA-encoded Vaccibody responses were also broader, targeting a substantially greater number of neoantigens.<br \/>Next, we compared the APC-targeting Vaccibody vaccine to an untargeted vaccine when both were formulated in an mRNA-LNP format. The APC-targeting Vaccibody vaccine elicited a greater breath and magnitude of T cell responses compared to the untargeted vaccine. Further studies to evaluate the functional differences associated with the various formats, in terms of T cell phenotype and response to tumor challenge, are ongoing.<br \/>In summary, the data demonstrate that an APC-targeted Vaccibody vaccine containing MC38 neoantigens can be encoded in both DNA and mRNA-LNP to induce faster, broader, and stronger T cell responses compared to a non-targeted neoantigen vaccine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,mRNA,DNA,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Cancer, however, often derails this immune cycle, prompting contemporary cancer immunotherapy approaches to seek its reinstatement. Despite significant advances, the inherent disruption of the cancer immunity cycle at multiple junctures, coupled with current therapeutic strategies focusing on isolated stages within this intricate process, has left the attainment of curative therapies as an aspirational goal. We believe that targeting multiple immune processes can restore natural anti-cancer immunity and yield sustained responses. To this end, BriaCell is utilizing gene-modified tumor cells as an immunotherapeutic platform. Our initial version, SV-BR-1-GM, a breast cancer cell line expressing GM-CSF, demonstrates promising clinical outcomes by directly activating CD4+ T-cells in an antigen-specific, HLA-restricted manner. Building on our findings, we hypothesize that tumor cells not only supply antigens but also directly stimulate the immune system. Presenting our second-generation platform, we enhance antigen cross-presentation and direct immune activation through the expression of cytokines, co-stimulatory factors, and HLA alleles.<br \/>Methods: To achieve this objective, we have developed Bria-OTS cell lines derived from various cancer types with the following genetic modifications: 1) Expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, 4-1BBL, CD40) and immunomodulatory cytokines (GM-CSF, IFN&#945;, IL-12 and IL-7). This modification aims to improve the cell's ability to present antigens and activate the host immune system. 2) Expanding HLA alleles to create semi-allogeneic cell lines matching at least one HLA allele across the population aims to enhance the host immune response, enabling recognition of tumor-associated antigens in the context of syngeneic HLA molecules<br \/>Results: We generated four cell lines for each tumor type, and these cell lines secreted GM-CSF, IFN&#945;, IL12 &#38; IL7, while also expressing CD80, CD86, CD40, and different combinations of both Class I and Class II HLA alleles. In functional assays, our cell lines demonstrated potent antigen presentation, effectively triggering anti-tumor immune responses across diverse immune populations, including T-, NK, and NKT cells.<br \/>Conclusions: The Bria-OTS cell lines will offer the following key features: 1) multimodal mechanisms of action including thwarting some mechanisms of cancer immune escape. 2) Precision Therapy; Bria-OTS will be precisely matched to individual patients based on their HLA alleles, encompassing over 99% of the U.S. population. 3) rapid, cost-effective treatment as our 'off-the-shelf' cell lines eliminate the need for personalized manufacturing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Cancer vaccine,Tumor antigen,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Current therapies, including surgical excision, are associated with significant morbidities and considerable expense. Multiple efforts are now underway to develop novel therapies that are effective, durable, safe, cost-effective, and patient-friendly. Here, we report ongoing efforts to develop a localized dissolvable microneedle array patch (MAP) based therapy for cSCC. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the delivery of an immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducing chemotherapeutic agent to the tumor microenvironment (TME) of accessible cSCCs could kill tumor cells as a source of antigen and induce a proinflammatory TME to generate a potent patient-specific anti-tumor immune response. Specifically, we evaluated MAP therapy using a UV-induced preclinical cSCC mouse model. We applied MAPs delivering the potent ICD-inducing chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DOX) to UV-induced tumors. MAPs efficiently delivered DOX to the tumor microenvironment. Compared to traditional needle injection, MAP delivery resulted in sustained high levels of DOX in the TME with minimally systemic exposure. Cell death was evident in MAP-DOX-treated tumors, and treatment resulted in tumor regression, increased survival, and long-term immune protection. Further, we found that tumor regression was associated with an early proinflammatory neutrophilic infiltrate. Taken together, our results suggest that MAP delivery of doxorubicin may be a promising approach to cSCC treatment. and that proinflammatory neutrophils are likely an important component of the early infiltrate that leads to tumor regression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Microneedle Array Patch,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Immunogenic Cell Death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Current immune checkpoint blockade therapies only show effectiveness in some cancer patients, so there is an urgent need for more effective immunotherapy strategies. One alternative is the use of neoantigen-based cancer vaccines, which target tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens) on cancer cells and induce strong T-cell responses. Advances in technology now allow for precise identification of tumor neoantigens using bioinformatic analysis or mass spectrometry. While cancer vaccines have demonstrated strong anti-tumor immune responses and therapeutic effectiveness in some cancer types, their success in HCC remains limited. A contributing factor is the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) found in advanced HCC. Some studies suggest that combining neoantigen vaccines with anti-PD1\/PD-L1 therapies can significantly enhance HCC treatment outcomes. Overcoming the suppressive immune microenvironment is crucial in cancer treatment, and reactivating intratumoral immunity is essential. In our study, we developed an HCC cancer vaccine using transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Our ELISpot assay results showed that this vaccine induced strong tumor-specific immune responses and significantly inhibited tumor growth in early-stage orthotopic HCC mouse models when administered five days after tumor inoculation. However, the effectiveness decreased in advanced tumors when administered ten days after tumor inoculation. We also discovered a significant relationship between the therapeutic effectiveness of the neoantigen vaccine and the activation of intratumoral NKT cells in HCC. Our study suggested that the type-I NKT cell activator, &#945;-Galactosylceramide (&#945;-GalCer), significantly improved the therapeutic outcomes of the cancer neoantigen vaccine in advanced orthotopic HCC mouse models. In some cases, tumors were almost completely eliminated. This indicates the potential of combining iNKT activators with neoantigen vaccines for HCC treatment. To further understand the role of NKT cells in HCC's TME, we plan to investigate intratumoral NKT cell subtypes following neoantigen vaccine therapy. Additionally, we will develop a new delivery system to deliver type I NKT cell activators and type II NKT inhibitors to tumor sites, aiming to reactivate the suppressive TME in HCC after neoantigen vaccine therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Vaccines,Tumor microenvironment,Liver cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

The application of these technologies for the treatment of cancers represents significant hope, but clinical effectiveness remains to be demonstrated. For this purpose, researchers require high quality production of vaccine mRNA and accurate and cost-saving test tools that are adapted to oncology research. Since 2021, Tebubio has developed a miniscale RNA production platform for providing RNAs (from 100 &#181;g to 1 mg) to researchers around the world. This service is completed by offers on RNA delivery solutions using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and cellular tests with biomarker analysis. Through an ingenious design, our DNA matrix for mRNA is easily transferable for GMP production for clinical studies. Recently, Tebubio has developed DNA matrices for circular RNA production. Indeed, circular RNA has many advantages by being less immunogenic and more stable than linear RNA. We compared the quality and the quantity of CAP1 capped linear RNA and circular RNA produced from our DNA templates. We also assessed the stability of both RNAs expressing GFP and the typical tumor antigen, p53, and their relative expression into antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Finally, we quantified the response of the APCs expressing p53 by using our biomarker multiplex analysis system. This new type of RNA and its efficiency testing in APCs will constitute a new addition to our pipeline of RNA production and testing for preclinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA,APC,Vaccines,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"C.

TROP2 overexpresses on various epithelial cancer cell surfaces, and is commonly found in prostate, colon, pancreas, lung, and breast cancer. Therefore, anticancer strategy targeting TROP2 may be a potential treatment option for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Sacituzumab govitecan, a Trop-2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), has shown significant benefits associated with progression-free and overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy for treating metastatic TNBC; however, its toxic effects were more frequent than that of chemotherapy (NCT02574455). In this study, we discovered TROP2 target peptides with T-helper 1 (Th1) polarization and anticancer efficacy. We then evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of these epitopes and possibility of co-administration with ADC in a TNBC murine model.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods: <\/b>Th1 peptides were identified using the Th-Vac&#174; platform and the predictive binding affinity ranking that indicates potential immunogenicity points of interest for HLA class II. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) Th1-specific polarization-induced activity and in vivo immunogenicity (Module 2b) were evaluated using flow cytometry and ELISpot analysis. The anti-tumor efficacy of the selected Th1 peptide was evaluated against MDA-MB-23 inoculated athymic Balb\/c mice. Each peptide was administered intradermally once weekly for a total of four times at a concentration of 100 &#956;g\/head. Sacituzumab govitecan (0.81 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously once weekly, for a total of two times.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Ten peptides with high affinity for HLA class II were selected, and three epitopes that induce differentiation of T cells secreting TROP2-specific IFN-&#947; were subsequently selected. These epitopes (p1, p3 and p6) showed tumor growth inhibition efficacy of 52.4%, 38.5%, and 57.2%, respectively, compared to the control (vehicle) group in the TNBC tumor-bearing mice. The cocktail vaccine (AST-07X), which combined these epitopes, was the most dominant at 65.4%. The anti-tumor efficacy of the combination group of the cocktail vaccine and ADC was 77.4% compared with the control group, showing a potent synergistic effect compared to the 46.1% anti-tumor efficacy of the ADC-mono group.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>AST-07X that induce TROP2-specific Th1 anticancer immune responses, showed sufficient anti-tumor efficacy; these effects were evident under immunodeficient conditions, such as those of TNBC tumor-bearing athymic mice. Synergy effects were also induced via combined ADC administration. We are currently conducting further research on humanized mice to address the limitations of the immunodeficient murine model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2,Triple negative breast cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Transient strong activation leads to immune activation and tumor suppression, while prolonged weak activation leads to immuno-suppression promoting tumor development. Reprogramming of M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) toward an M1 phenotype, suppression of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs), as well as activation of dendritic cells (DCs) to train T-cells are advantageous, while the activation of STING pathway in T-cells is leads to their apoptosis. Thus, targeted delivery of STINGa to specific cells with TME to induce strong transient activation may be a key to therapy. We have developed a delivery approach that uses one or two pH Low Insertion Peptides (pHLIPs) that collaborate in the targeted intracellular delivery of a STINGa. STINGa were conjugated with pHLIPs via S-S cleavable self-immolating linkers. Biophysical studies were performed to ensure proper interactions of pHLIP-STINGa agents with membrane lipid bilayers. pHLIPs extend the lifetime of STINGa in the blood and target them to acidic cancer and stromal cells (CAFs), as well as M2-TAMs, mMDSCs and DCs within TME. The targeting results in selective cytokine activation in tumors with no systemic activation, which triggers the eradication of small (100 mm3) and large (400-700 mm3) CT26 tumors in mice after one or two doses of pHLIP-STINGa. The tumor stroma was destroyed, intratumoral hemorrhage developed, and the level of acidity within the TME was reduced. No tumors developed in mice re-challenged by an additional injection of cancer cells in a 90-day experiment. Thus, targeted delivery of STINGa to cancer cells, tumor stroma and TAMs induces activation of signaling, potentially resulting in the recruitment and infiltration of T- and NK-cells, which gain access to the tumor core. The cytotoxic activity of T- and NK-cells is not impaired by the acidic environment and immune memory is developed. The pHLIP technology may allow transformation of immuno-activating agents into more potent therapeutics, since pHLIP can target and deliver these agents to cancer cells, tumor stroma and myeloid cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Among the immunogenic epitopes widely investigated is &#945;-Gal, since humans exhibit specific anti-Gal reactivity. However, the repertoire of immunogenic epitopes could be significantly enhanced if therapeutic efficacy did not rely on the presence of natural antibodies, but instead relied on the production of anti-epitope endogenous antibodies induced by immunization against the selected epitope. Therefore, we designed and tested several HA-pHLIP agents, where the HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) from the influenza virus was selected as an exogenous highly immunogenic epitope, since it is absent in the human genome, and a pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP) was selected as the tumor targeting agent. HA peptides were attached to the N-termini of pHLIPs either directly or via PEG polymers. To enhance the overall binding affinity of HA-pHLIP to anti-HA antibodies, double headed HA-pHLIP agents were introduced, where two HA epitopes were linked to a single pHLIP peptide via PEG12 polymers. The pHLIP sequence was modified to ensure proper pKs of insertion into cell membranes. HA epitopes were targeted to cancer cells in mouse tumors, and remained exposed to the extracelullar space within tumors for about 24 hours. Double-headed HA-pHLIP treatments of imunized mice (a high titer of anti-HA antibodies was developed in mice after immunization with KLH-HA), bearing 4T1 triple negative or B16F10 MHC-I negative melanoma tumors resulted in a 55% reduction of tumor growth. Further reduction of tumor growth was impossible to achive, since all of the anti-HA antibodies in the blood were captured after 3 injections of HA-pHLIP and additional boosts would be required to restore the level of free anti-HA antibodies to induce a more significant therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Immunotherapy,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
