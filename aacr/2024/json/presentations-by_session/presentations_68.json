We previously applied methods that define chromosome arm aneuploidy to over 10,000 tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cancer subtypes are often characterized by tumor specific patterns of chromosome arm copy number alterations and breakpoints; for example, squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from different tissues of origin are characterized by chromosome 3p (chr3p) loss and chromosome 3q (chr3q) gain. From the TCGA aneuploidy data, we developed an algorithm called BISCUT to distinguish peak regions of aneuploidy breakpoints on each chromosome arm. BISCUT identified loci affected by broad copy number alterations that provide fitness advantages or disadvantages both within individual cancer types and across cancers. Our analyses are consistent with selection being the primary driver of aneuploidy events in cancer.<br \/>We next wanted to validate some BISCUT peaks without a known driver, to identify potential gene deletions that are beneficial in cancer cells. We focused on chromosome 8p (chr8p), as this arm is frequently deleted across cancer types, but no strong tumor suppressors have been identified. Recent advances in genome engineering allow generation of large chromosomal alterations and validation of findings from patient genomic data. For this study, we used our CRISPR-Cas9 arm-deletion system to delete chr8p in human immortalized epithelial cells. Cells with chr8p deletion showed lower amounts of cell death in culture. Knockdown of WRN, one of the two genes in the smallest chr8p BISCUT peak, was sufficient to reproduce this phenotype, suggesting that WRN haploinsufficiency may be beneficial to tumor development.<br \/>As aneuploidy occurs in tissue-specific patterns, we also wanted to explore the role of chr3 arm aneuploidies in squamous cancers. We again used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete one copy of chr3p in a human immortalized lung epithelial cell line similar to the putative cell-of-origin in lung SCC. Consistent with patient data, expression of chr3p genes was decreased upon deletion, as well as increased expression of interferon response genes. Cells with chr3p deletion initially proliferated more slowly than their siblings. Interestingly, after several passages in culture, this proliferation defect was rescued in chr3p deleted cells. Genome sequencing and karyotype analyses suggested that this was partially the result of chr3 duplication, with cells transitioning to a state of chr3q gain. Culturing these cells as organoids also demonstrated that chr3p deletion and chr3q gain can affect basal cell differentiation, consistent with their high frequency in squamous cancers. Our genome engineering approach to model chromosome arm aneuploidies provides a robust model to validate drivers from aneuploidy events, which will be critical to address the gap in our understanding of aneuploidy in cancer. In addition, our methods have identified consequences of individual aneuploidy events, which will lead to new precision oncology targets for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aneuploidy,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alison M.
