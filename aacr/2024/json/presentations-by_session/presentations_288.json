[{"Abstract":"Overview: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, existing immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) yield low response rates in most cancers, highlighting the need for new therapeutic options. Traditional immune-oncology (IO) target discovery relies on preclinical models, which struggle to recapitulate human tumor complexity, limiting translation potential. Attention is thus directed at harnessing multimodal patient molecular data with modern machine learning (ML) techniques to identify new IO targets which may have higher clinical viability.<br \/>Approach: We posed IO target discovery as a binary classification task, training ML systems on known candidate drug targets that have progressed to stage I or higher clinical trials. We constructed a rich knowledge graph database to support model development. Graph nodes (n=11,919) comprised genes with edges linking genes involved in n=99,275 protein-protein interactions (PPIs; PMID: 28936969). Genes were labelled with n=6,387 gene-disease associations alongside bulk exome and transcriptome (RNAseq) features from n=1,317 CPI-treated patients (PMID: 33508232). We considered the role of different immune subsets by incorporating cell type-specific PPIs from single cell RNAseq atlases of n=350 samples (PMID: 31786210). To capture how antigen processing affects immunotherapy response, we also examined the immunopeptidome of n=60 patients (PMID: 30556813). Causal data on immune responses to genetic perturbation stemmed from n=7 publicly available CRISPR tumor-T cell co-cultures and n=15,442 SNP-phenotype links. Lastly, we used interpretability analysis to understand drivers of model predictions and elucidate critical genes that influence multiple IO target pathways.<br \/>Results: Firstly, we developed an ensemble ML approach which achieved test ROC-AUC&#62;0.75. Next, we used a graph-based ML framework which yielded superior performance (test ROC-AUC&#62;0.90). Orthogonal validation confirmed these models can discriminate known targets by trial phase (p&#60;0.001), predict patient response in new CPI trials (p&#60;0.05), and identify genes that rank highly in unseen genome-wide CRISPR screens. Targets from both methods have entered experimental validation in patient-derived explants and organoid-immune co-cultures. Already, we have identified 2 novel targets predicted to relate to macrophage activity. Early data suggest that perturbing them leads to macrophage repolarization. Further validation experiments are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: We will reveal candidate targets, showing that our method is effective at uncovering new IO targets and can identify critical nodes in biological networks that might be attractive hits. In addition, deciphering data types that drive model predictions provides a broader immunobiological understanding of anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, our results endorse using ML and multimodal data for novel IO target discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Target discovery,Immunotherapy,Ex vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Previous studies have demonstrated tumor-promoting activity of deregulated AS isoforms and mutated splicing factors, both of which increase the yield of neoantigen-encoding AS isoforms. Therefore, the identification of AS isoforms has the potential to produce novel therapeutic targets, especially in lung tumors where splicing deregulation is frequent. Envisagenics has developed SpliceIO, a proprietary software platform for AS-derived neoantigen discovery. SpliceIO uses RNA-seq data to uncover extracellular neoantigens encoded by transmembrane proteins. This predictive ensemble maximizes the value of RNA-seq data to predict fundamental aspects of neoantigen activity, such as protein localization, epitope accessibility, and cancer pathway relevance. Here, we summarize the discovery and validation of novel AS-derived neoantigens identified using SpliceIO in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our novel SpliceIO-identified neoantigens in NSCLC were validated following our well-established experimental pipeline. We have confirmed RNA expression of the neoantigen-expressing transcripts in lung cancer cell lines and patient samples using a combination of RT-PCR as well as RNA-ISH. Further, we have validated the membrane-bound extracellular localization of neoantigen-containing isoforms at the protein level using Western blotting, GFP and c-Myc tagged isoform generation, eukaryotic cells transfection, and microscopy. Our top target showed high tumor specificity, heterogeneous distribution in tumor samples, high prevalence, confirmed novel extracellular N-terminal domain, and strong biological relevance in lung cancer. This demonstrates the potential of utilizing RNA splicing for identifying many more membrane associated proteins for tumor specific immunotherapeutic targeting. The combination of computational and experimental approaches to neoantigen identification using SpliceIO allows for novel target discovery amenable for targeted immunotherapeutic development for lung cancer treatment and other indications driven by deregulated AS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Splice variants,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The proteasome functions as an essential component of immunosurveillance by generating peptides from intracellular proteins that are then presented to T-cells. Antigens generated by the proteasome promote the infiltration of immune cells into tumors and improve tumor regression in response to immunotherapy. Cancer cells can evade elimination by the immune system by deregulating the antigen presentation machinery to downregulate the expression of proteins recognized by immune cells as antigens, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. In contrast to constitutive proteasomes, immunoproteasomes are a highly specialized proteasome variant that are highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells. Immunoproteasomes contain distinct catalytic subunits with active site substrate specificities distinct from constitutive proteasomes. Immunoproteasome degrade intracellular proteins to generate antigenic peptides that are the presented by MHC-class I (MHC-I) molecules on tumor cells for recognition by cytotoxic T-cells. We hypothesized that immunoproteasome activation could concomitantly increase the relative abundance and diversity of MHC-I antigens presented on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. High-throughput screening identified a novel small molecule (Compound A) that selectively increased immunoproteasome catalytic activity. Global proteomic integral stability assays determined that Compound A binds the proteasome structural subunit PSMA1 and that treatment with Compound A increased association of the proteasome activator PA28&#945;\/&#946; (PSME1\/2) activator with immunoproteasomes. The effect of Compound A on immunoproteasomes was abolished after the ablation of <i>PSMA1<\/i>, <i>PSME1<\/i>, or <i>PSME2<\/i> or by the treatment of cells with suicide inhibitors that target immunoproteasome-specific catalytic sites. Treatment of MM cells with Compound A doubled the total number of MHC-I-bound peptides and increased the level of specific MHC-bound peptides up to 200-fold. Interestingly, a number of tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens were dramatically unmasked following treatment of MM cells with the immunoproteasome activator. Importantly, the treatment of patient CD138<sup>+<\/sup> cells with Compound A promoted the antimyeloma activity of allogenic and autologous patient-derived CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate the paradigm-shifting translational impact of immunoproteasome activators to expand the myeloma immunopeptidome and have revealed novel, actionable antigenic targets to personalize T-cell-directed immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Proteasome-mediated degradation,T cell,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Aneuploidy and chromosome instability are major contributors to such genomic changes in OV. Genes are pervasively disrupted by copy-number alterations: 39% of all genes in the median solid tumor of all cancer types, and 67% in OV. A common second-line OV chemotherapeutic is peggylated-liposomal doxorubicin, a topoisomerase-II poison. To address which genes in OV contribute to doxorubicin sensitivity and resistance, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen on 19,114 human genes in the presence or absence of doxorubicin. Positive control genes involved in drug-efflux and DNA repair were significant hits. The gene with both the highest significance and greatest magnitude of doxorubicin sensitization upon knockout was the E3 SUMO2\/3 ligase ZNF451. ZNF451 exhibits a copy-number loss in 14% of patients and corresponds to ZNF451 protein reduction. ZNF451 is an attractive target for future combination therapies with doxorubicin to induce conditional lethality. ZNF451 may be valuable to study as a prognostic biomarker for topoisomerase-II inhibitor chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Drug sensitivity,Doxorubicin,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Genetic mechanisms of resistance such as gatekeeper mutations in the primary drug target can be readily identified. However, drug targets responsible for non-genetic resistance mechanisms such as transcriptional reprogramming remain elusive. Here we describe an innovative phenotypic screening approach that led to the development of the clinical candidate TT125-802 and identification of its target CBP\/p300 which we discovered as a novel regulator of transcriptional resistance to a range of targeted therapies. Targeted cancer therapies have been reported to induce profound transcriptional reprogramming leading to drug resistance. For instance, inhibition of oncogenic MAPK signaling using a BRAF\/MEK inhibitor combination in BRAF-V600E mutated melanoma, triggers expression of the pluripotency transcription factor SOX2 along with broader expression of associated stemness and EMT genes. We used this system as a model to screen for small molecules that prevent transcriptional escape mechanisms to targeted cancer therapies. For this, we developed an automated high-throughput immunofluorescence staining and analysis method of SOX2 as a surrogate marker for resistance-conferring transcriptional reprogramming. A hit-like high diversity library of 16&#8217;000 small molecules was screened using an image-based multi-parameter readout with an integrated counter-screen for general cell toxicity. A battery of downstream assessments including patentability, synthetic tractability, physico-chemical properties, and dose-dependent modulation of transcriptional resistance signatures was used to select the chemical scaffold TT125 for further hit to lead optimization. Hit to lead optimization was initially target agnostic. To de-orphan the scaffold, a chemical probe of TT125 was developed in house and used in a chemoproteomics assay. The transcriptional co-activators CBP\/p300 were identified as the target of TT125. Biochemical assays revealed that the TT125 scaffold binds specifically to the bromodomain of CBP\/p300 but not the histone acetyl transferase domain. Moreover, TT125 was confirmed to bind highly selectively to the bromodomain of CBP\/p300 but not other bromodomain-containing proteins such as BRD2 or BRD4. Structure-based drug design along with in vivo PD models using transcriptional short-term readouts were used for lead optimization that resulted in the development of the potent and highly selective clinical candidate TT125-802. Validating our phenotypic approach to drug discovery and development, TT125-802 is currently being evaluated in a phase I oncology trial. The modular setup of our phenotypic screening system has the potential to power the discovery of additional novel modulators of transcriptional drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Transcriptional escape mechanisms,Phenotypic screen,CBP\/p300,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Chemotherapy is the common treatment option for TNBC. However, resistance and tumor relapse remain the major obstacles hindering the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients. Therefore, identifying genes\/factors that sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents could improve treatment outcome in patients. Here we report Signal peptide CUB domain EGF-like 3 (SCUBE3) genes as a novel therapeutic adjuvant that can improve the efficacy of doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in treating breast cancer patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Unbiased high-throughput loss of function genomic screen was performed on breast cancer cells in the presence or absence of doxorubicin. Breast cancer cells lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in standard medium. Breast cancer cells were transfected either with SCUBE3 overexpression plasmid or shRNA specific to SCUBE3. These overexpression\/knockdown breast cancer cells were analyzed for cell viability, migration, invasion, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis assays, western blotting, and in vivo tumor xenograft study.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our finding demonstrated that SCUBE3 promotes breast cancer cell progression as knockdown of SCUBE3 inhibited the ability of breast cancer cells to form colony, migrate, and invade, while overexpression of SCUBE3 promoted tumor growth in preclinical mouse models. Our results revealed that SCUBE3 mediates its protumor effects by regulating genes involved in growth and survival in the MAPK pathway, DNA damage surveillance pathway including RAD51 and FOXM1, and apoptotic pathway including Mcl-1.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), constituting 90% of pancreatic cancers, manifests as a highly malignant solid tumor characterized by insidious onset, strong invasiveness, and a notable propensity for recurrence or metastasis. Consequently, the 5-year survival rate for PDAC remained dismally low at approximately 10% in 2021. Notably, PDAC is distinguished by perineural invasion (PNI), a phenomenon linked to postoperative recurrence and metastasis. A thorough exploration of the interplay between peripheral innervation and PDAC holds promise for identifying novel targets and therapies to enhance outcomes in PDAC. This study unveils a correlation between PDAC patients exhibiting high calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive (CGRP+) sensory innervation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and diminished overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with lower CGRP+ nociceptive innervation. Concurrently, heightened CGRP+ sensory innervation corresponds to increased cancer pain, as assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. Further analysis reveals a negative association between CGRP+ nociceptive nerves and lymphatic metastasis, as well as tumor size in PDAC patients. In a murine PDAC model, the genetic or chemical ablation of CGRP+ sensory neurons significantly impedes disease progression. Additionally, sensory neuron ablation attenuates cancer-induced vesical pain and enhances the locomotor function of mice, suggesting an improvement in overall quality of life. Mechanically, within the TME of PDAC, the secretion of neuropeptides substance P (SP) and CGRP from sensory neurons is elevated, with CGRP exhibiting a more pronounced increase. Furthermore, the expression of the CGRP receptor&#8212;receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1)&#8212;surpasses that of the SP receptor in the TME. Subsequent blockade of the CGRP pathway using the RAMP1 antagonist Rimegepant significantly suppresses PDAC progression and alleviates cancer pain, accompanied by improved locomotor function. In summary, sensory innervation actively participates in the progression of PDAC through the secretion of CGRP. Consequently, the inhibition of the CGRP pathway emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for both PDAC and cancer-induced pain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) plays a critical role in generating tumor-specific neoantigens targetable through an arsenal of immunotherapeutic modalities. Such neoantigens cannot be discovered using conventional DNA-based tools; they require specialized software for AS analysis using RNA-seq data. SpliceIO is Envisagenics&#8217; AI platform for AS-derived neoantigen discovery. SpliceIO uses a &#8220;predictive ensemble&#8221; approach to uncover neoantigens that are both stably expressed and located on the extracellular membrane of cancer cells. Using SpliceIO, we have analyzed more than 10,000 RNA-seq samples from 5 patient cohorts covering 5 breast cancer subtypes as well as 2,647 normal RNA-seq samples from GTEx. Our analysis has identified tumor-specific neoantigens present in AS transmembrane proteins specific for Triple Negative Breast Cancer. SpliceIO target candidates were validated experimentally using our well-established pipeline in which isoform specific transcripts are tested in cancer cell lines by PCR and primary tumor tissues by qPCR to confirm RNA expression. Tumor heterogeneity and prevalence is confirmed by RNA in-situ hybridization in Tissue Microarrays. Extracellular localization of the novel epitope is confirmed by clone generation with GFP and c-Myc tagging followed by microscopy, Western blotting, and proteomic analysis. Our top validated target presents high TNBC tumor specificity and heterogeneous distribution, and contains a novel extracellular N-terminal domain. These results strongly support the role of aberrant AS as a major source of tumor-specific neoantigens. Our combined computational and experimental approach promotes novel target discovery, enabling the development of novel immunotherapeutic for TNBC patients who are in critical need of better treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Splice variants,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

While multiple studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and immunotherapy, clinical synergy may be limited by the destructive effects of DNA-damaging chemotherapy on non-cancer cells, including key constituents of anti-tumor immunity (e.g. mature T cells). Furthermore, when first-line chemotherapy fails, subsequent lines of chemotherapy produce lower response rates. Thus, new approaches that eradicate cancer cells while preserving immune cells may be required to more efficiently induce anti-tumor immunity as monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapy. Neutrophil elastase (ELANE), a neutrophil-derived serine protease, kills a wide range of cancer cells without harming immune cells through a unique mechanism involving histone H1 and the death domain of CD95. Here, we compared N17350, an optimized biologic leveraging the ELANE pathway, and chemotherapies for their ability to kill cancer cells and preserve immune cells from primary tumors of ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and evaluated efficacy in OvCa patient cell-derived xenografts (CDXs) and a 4T1 model of metastatic breast cancer.<br \/>Methods. For in vitro studies, cancer cells and CD45+ immune cells were isolated from primary tumors of chemotherapy na&#239;ve and experienced OvCa patients. Cells were treated with N17350, oxaliplatin, or doxorubicin 24h post-isolation, and viability was quantified by calcein-AM. For in vivo studies, primary OvCa cells were injected into nude mice to create CDX models. Mice were treated with 2 doses of N17350 (400&#956;g\/100mm3, intratumoral) or carboplatin (100mg\/kg, intraperitoneal), and effects on tumor growth were quantified. In 4T1 model, N17350 was compared to oxaliplatin, alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4, and effects on tumor growth and immune profile were assessed.<br \/>Results. N17350 killed primary cancer cells from all OvCa patients tested but was well tolerated by CD45+ tumor immune cells from the same patients. In contrast, doxorubicin and oxaliplatin showed similar toxicity to both cell types. N17350 killed cancer cells from chemotherapy na&#239;ve and experienced patients with equal efficacy, while doxorubicin and oxaliplatin showed less efficacy in patients previously treated with chemotherapy. N17350 rapidly regressed tumors in all OvCa CDX models and exhibited markedly improved efficacy over carboplatin. In the 4T1 model, N17350 outperformed oxaliplatin in terms of regressing tumors, elevating tumor immune cells, and combining with anti-CTLA4.<br \/>Conclusions. Our data demonstrate that N17350 kills OvCa tumors in vitro and in vivo while sparing CD45+ immune cells in both chemotherapy na&#239;ve and experienced patients. Together with previous data showing that N17350 induces immunogenic tumor cell death, these findings suggest that N17350 could improve clinical outcomes compared to chemoimmunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Immunotherapy,Tumor immunity,Carboplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Due to the increased potency, these drugs are more than ever dependent on very clean targets to prevent side effects. We aim to address this major problem through our approach to develop antibodies with improved tumor specificity and reduced on-target\/off-tumor binding utilizing the aberrant O-glycosylation on tumor cells. Altered glycosylation of proteins and lipids is one of the most drastic changes in cancer, giving rise to truncated or highly fucosylated and highly sialylated glycans which are almost absent on normal cells. Thus, developing antibodies against protein\/carbohydrate combined epitopes (GlycoTargets) comprising these tumor-specific glycans enables highly potent therapies with reduced off-tumor toxicity.<br \/>Experimental procedures: A workflow and corresponding database was established to evaluate the O-glycosylation of proteins. The first and most basic criterion is the presence of suitable O-glycosylated peptide stretches in the extracellular domain of a protein based on predictions. For proteins fulfilling this criterion cancer-relevant expression is analyzed in a second step. This is done either using publicly available data or experimentally (immunohistochemistry or protein expression data). During the final major step, the theoretical existence of suitable O-glycosylation is confirmed by our own experimental data. This includes analysis of cellularly expressed proteins by anti-glycan antibodies and mass spectrometric studies.<br \/>Results summary: Case studies will be presented that highlight our workflow to identify suitable GlycoTargets based on publicly available data analysis and experimental confirmation. Additionally, the subsequent development of antibodies against the identified GlycoTargets will be shown.<br \/>Conclusion: A standardized process was developed for the data collection and prioritization of potential GlycoTargets. The obtained information is subsequently used for targeted discovery of antibodies that bind to protein\/carbohydrate combined glycoepitopes (GlycoTargets) offering increased tumor-specificity compared to simple protein targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Glycosylation,Target discovery,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Although localized prostate cancer is curable, recurrence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is almost inevitable and is the major cause of death in human PCa. Recent findings from our lab and others demonstrate that RB1 loss drives lineage plasticity, metastasis, and lethality of prostate tumors initiated by PTEN loss. A downstream target upregulated by RB1 loss is acyl CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a fatty acid ligase with an essential role in utilization of long chain fatty acids. ACSL4 has been reported to be upregulated in cancers of various histological origins, including prostate cancer, and its high expression is correlated with aggressiveness of cancer. We hypothesize that ACSL4 is a critical downstream effector of RB1 loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis and pharmacological inhibition of ACSL4 could represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of lethal RB1 deficient or ACSL4 overexpressing prostate cancer. Here we aim to develop novel ACSL4 inhibitors for preclinical studies. Through a structure based virtual screening that targeted ATP binding domains of ACSL4, we successfully identified 15 potential ACSL4 inhibitors. To validate the result, we performed an in vitro screening using various parental and isogenic human PCa cell lines, and found that 4 out of 15 compounds effectively inhibited PCa cell proliferation in a dose-response manner and their inhibitory effects positively correlated with cellular levels of ACSL4. Next, we will perform isotope-labeling enzyme activity assays to determine the specificity of the 4 candidate drugs, and PDPK analyses followed by characterizing their in vivo efficacies in preclinical studies, with a final goal to develop a well-validated ACSL4 inhibitor. Successful completion of this work will provide great insights into contributions of ACSL4 to prostate tumorigenesis as well as preclinical data of ACSL4 inhibitors to treat lethal prostate cancer.<u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Prostate cancer,Drug-discovery screen,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

To support this unique phenotype, AML cells increase import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins which must be properly folded by mitochondrial chaperones, proteases, and heat shock proteins. Failure to properly fold these precursors leads to protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. To evaluate the reliance of AML cells on maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis, we assessed gene dependency datasets (eg: depmap.org) and identified the mitochondrial protease LONP1, as the top essential gene. LONP1 is a matrix-localized nuclear-encoded AAA+ protease. Proteins are unfolded by its ATPase domain and degraded by its serine-catalyzed proteolytic domain. Compared to hematopoietic cells, LONP1 mRNA was overexpressed in AML across three publicly available datasets. By immunoblotting, LONP1 protein was increased in 16\/30 primary AML samples compared to bulk (n=8) and CD34+ blood cells (n=3). LONP1 genetic depletion reduced the growth and viability of OCI-AML2, OCI-M2, NB4, and TEX leukemia cells as well as primary AML cells. LONP1 depletion increased aggregated mitochondrial proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production while reducing mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential. To determine the domain of LONP1 that was necessary for mitochondrial protein solubility, mitochondrial function, and AML survival, we over-expressed wild type, ATPase dead (E591A), or proteolytically dead (S855A) LONP1 cDNA in OCI-AML2 cells and knocked down endogenous LONP1 with shRNA targeting the 3&#8217;UTR of the endogenous gene. Wild type or proteolytically dead (S855A) but not the ATPase mutant (E591A) rescued mitochondrial protein solubility, mitochondrial respiration, ROS generation, membrane potential, and cell viability. Thus, the ATPase domain but not the proteolytic activity of LONP1 is necessary for mitochondrial proteostasis. Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me) is a synthetic triterpenoid that allosterically inhibits the LONP1 ATPase site. CDDO-Me killed OCI-AML2 and NB4 cells with IC50 values of 178.5&#177;29.7 and 156.5&#177;39.7 nM, respectively. CDDO-Me (200 nM) killed 3 out of 4 primary AML samples with high LONP1 expression but none of the 10 primary AML samples with low LONP1. Likewise, CDDO-Me induced mitochondrial protein aggregation in AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples with high LONP1 expression but not AML cells or primary AML patient samples with low LONP1. In summary, LONP1 is over-expressed in a subset of AML cells and primary samples where it maintains mitochondrial protein solubility. Selective inhibition of the LONP1 ATPase domain leads to mitochondrial protein aggregation and AML cell death, representing a novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Metabolism,Proteostasis,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In laboratory experiments, this compound has exhibited a remarkable preference for targeting prostate cancer cells as opposed to normal cells. Specifically, in vitro cell viability assays using MTT have shown that prostate cancer cells display high sensitivity to Up284 at low nanomolar IC50 values, while primary human prostate epithelial cells and mouse keratinocytes exhibit minimal sensitivity. This establishes a notable therapeutic window between cancerous and non-cancerous cells, with Up284 significantly inhibiting colony formation in PC3 cells. Additional functional assays have confirmed Up284's potential, including the 4UbFL Reporter Gene assay, which has revealed robust, dose-dependent proteasome inhibition. This effect is supported by the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in various prostate cancer cell lines following Up284 treatment, suggesting a distinct mechanism of toxicity compared to bortezomib. Furthermore, Up284 has been found to induce apoptosis in PC3 cells, surpassing the efficacy of bortezomib. Competitive binding assays have shown that Up284 exhibits a stronger binding affinity to the proteasomal receptor RPN13 than the prototype inhibitor RA190B. This is further supported by a Cellular Thermo Stabilization Assay (CETSA), which indicates that Up284 stabilizes RPN13 in cells.<br \/>A preliminary in vivo study utilizing the bone metastatic prostate cancer genetically engineered mouse model(BMPC GEMM) model for metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma has demonstrated that Up284 leads to significant tumor regression and increased levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in residual tumor tissues. Moreover, when Up284 is conjugated with an E3 ligase ligand, it successfully degrades RPN13, resulting in the death of PC3 cells. Up284 has also shown favorable pharmacokinetics\/pharmacodynamics (PK\/PD) profiles and safety in animal models. It is well-tolerated in mice and holds promise for oral administration, demonstrating a proteasome-dependent reporter protein stabilization effect superior to ixazomib. Importantly, Up284 has induced tumor regression and improved survival rates in various cancer models, including ovarian and breast cancers.<br \/>In conclusion, Up284 emerges as a lead candidate for targeted prostate cancer therapy due to its high specificity, substantial therapeutic index, and potent anti-cancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. Further development and clinical investigation of Up284 are warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Proteasome inhibitors,Apoptosis,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Patients with <i>G12D<\/i>-mutated disease experience poor treatment outcomes, representing a significant unmet medical need. <i>G12D<\/i> mutation results in constitutively active signaling, including hyperactivation of the ERK and PI3K pathways, which drive cell proliferation and survival. Here we describe INCB161734, a novel, potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule G12D inhibitor that demonstrates <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in <i>G12D<\/i>-bearing tumor models.<br \/>INCB161734 binds to both the GDP and GTP forms of the G12D mutant at the switch II pocket with picomolar affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub>), and exhibits &#62;80-fold selectivity over wildtype (WT) KRAS. INCB161734 potently inhibits SOS1-dependent GDP\/GTP exchange activity in cell-free assays (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;3 nM), and exhibits &#62;40-fold selectivity for G12D versus WT KRAS. Additionally, INCB161734 demonstrates high selectivity for G12D over WT in various cellular assays using <i>G12D<\/i> mutant versus WT cancer derived cell lines. INCB161734 potently inhibits ERK phosphorylation (a correlate for KRAS activity), with a mean IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 14.3 nM (range: 1.9-45.2 nM) across 7 human and 3 mouse <i>G12D<\/i> cell lines; mean 21.5% inhibition was observed at 1 &#956;M (maximum tested concentration) across 14 WT cell lines. Likewise, INCB161734 inhibits proliferation of <i>G12D<\/i> mutant cell lines, with a mean IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 154 nM (range: 8.3-318 nM) across the same 7 human <i>G12D<\/i> cell lines; &#60;30% inhibition (mean 13%) was observed at 1 &#956;M across the same 14 WT cell lines.

In addition, INCB161734 induced cell cycle arrest (S-phase inhibition) in the <i>G12D<\/i> HPAC cell line, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> 12.8 nM; S-phase inhibition in the WT NCI-H838 cell line only occurred at much higher doses (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;3.3 &#956;M).<br \/>INCB161734 demonstrates excellent oral bioavailability with good absorption, low clearance, and low metabolic turnover. Orally dosed INCB161734 clearly shows target engagement, generating continuous near-maximal KRAS inhibition in <i>G12D<\/i> HPAC mouse xenograft tumors for almost the entire dosing interval. INCB161734 is efficacious against multiple types of <i>G12D<\/i>-mutated tumors and xenografts, resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition, growth arrest and\/or regression in multiple PDAC (HPAC, Panc0403, and 2838c3) and CRC (CT26, GP2D, and LS513) mouse tumor models.<br \/>These preclinical results demonstrate that INCB161734 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable KRAS G12D inhibitor, strongly efficacious against <i>KRAS G12D<\/i> mutant tumors.

AMIGO2 promoted nuclear retention of HIF1a and conversely, its depletion drove the degradation of HIF1a. HIF1a\/hypoxia reporter assay revealed that AMIGO2 depletion led to 300-fold reduction of HIF1a activity. Overexpression of a phosphomimetic construct at HIF1a serine 641 and 643, not a full length HIF1a ORF rescued AMIGO2 mediated HIF1a reporter signal reduction. <b>Therapeutic targeting of NPTX1-AMIGO2 axis in primary and metastatic PDAC: <\/b>Through phage display and mouse immunization campaigns, we identified 6 human IgG1 and 1 murine IgG1 antibodies that exhibited high affinity binding to human NPTX1.

Drugging KRAS and BRAF, the two main oncogenic drivers in the MAPK pathway, has proven successful in the clinic. Inhibition of the downstream effectors, MEK and ERK, can also induce tumor regression. Despite this, many tumors are intrinsically resistant to MAPK pathway inhibitors, or acquire resistance under selective pressure to drug treatment. This creates a need for combination treatments to improve clinical responses. A synthetic lethal (SL) interaction between inhibition of the MAPK pathway and blockade of JNK-JUN signaling has recently been described<sup>1<\/sup>. Specifically, data from yeast genetics and CRISPR knockout experiments in human cells have identified MAP2K4 as a potential therapeutic target that could be combined with MAPK inhibitors. To date, however, no potent MAP2K4 inhibitors with in vitro and cellular selectivity against key anti-targets have been reported. Here, we describe the development of potent covalent inhibitors of MAP2K4 kinase activity. Biochemical and cell-based assays show that the compound(s) are selective for MAP2K4 versus anti-targets including MAP2K7 and ERK kinases. The combination of MAP2K4 and MEK\/ERK inhibitors was effective in cell lines driven by MAPK signaling. These data provide the rationale for further development of MAP2K4 inhibitors to advance our understanding of this novel drug combination.<br \/>References: 1.

However, targeting cell cycle regulators of G2\/M and mitotic checkpoints to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit remains a challenge due to a limited therapeutic index. Here, we identified highly potent and selective oral bioavailable clinical candidate inhibitors to the first-in-class oncology target Microtubule Associated Serine\/Threonine Kinase-Like (MASTL) aimed at expanding therapeutic control of the cell cycle for cancer therapy. Breath of efficacy screening in multiple tumor indications in vitro followed by computational analyses identified the regulatory subunit PPP2R2A as a potential patient selection biomarker that strongly correlates to MASTL inhibitor response irrespective of cancer genetic alterations. Functional genetics studies confirmed that sensitivity to MASTL inhibition is defined by PPP2R2A expression. To identify genetic mediators of MASTL inhibitor resistance, a whole genome CRISPR knockout screen with the MASTL inhibitor was performed and further established that the MASTL inhibitor response is dependent on PPP2R2A containing PP2A complexes. Mechanistic studies (proteomics, resistance, functional genetics, and time-lapse microscopy) demonstrated that MASTL inhibition disrupts mitosis by activating the tumor suppressor PP2A, leading to a switch from CDK1 activity to CDK1 inactivity, mitotic defects, and cancer cell death. MASTL inhibition treatment in tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i> and in patient-derived organoid models results in potent tumor growth inhibition. Our results demonstrate that the first identified highly selective MASTL clinical candidate inhibitors represent a potential new cancer therapeutic strategy to target mitosis and mitotic exit by activating the tumor repressor PP2A to counter CDK1 activity.<br \/><i>All procedures performed on animals were in accordance with regulations and established guidelines and were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or through an ethical review process.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Cell cycle regulation,Cell cycle inhibitors,MASTL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Its hallmark characteristics include early invasion, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and aggressive tumor progression. Evaluating new generation treatments with significant potential in this ongoing battle against cancer is crucial. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), long detected in various metastatic cell lines and tissue samples beyond breast, lung, and prostate cancer, are of particular interest. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of inhibiting NaV1.7 and its neonatal variant, nNaV1.7, in pancreatic cancer cells. The study utilized human normal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2. It investigated the roles and effects of adult and neonatal isoforms of the NaV1.7 channel in pancreatic cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The findings revealed significantly higher adult and neonatal NaV1.7 mRNA expressions in PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines compared to HaCaT cells. Specific siRNAs effectively downregulated channel mRNA and protein expressions. Notably, NaV1.7 siRNA treatments significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony-forming capacity in PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells, without cytotoxic effects on HaCaT cells. Combining gemcitabine with specific NaV1.7 siRNAs enhanced drug efficacy in the PANC-1 cell line. Furthermore, NaV1.7 siRNAs significantly reduced cell invasion, migration, and wound healing in both cell lines. These siRNAs also induced apoptosis and G1 arrest in the cell cycle. They inhibited protein expressions involved in key signaling pathways, including P-Src\/P-Fak\/Integrin &#946;1, EF2K, P-Akt, P-mTOR, PARP, Caspase-3\/9, Cyclin D1\/E1. This study is pioneering, as literature lacks research on the expression and function of NaV1.7 and nNaV1.7 in pancreatic cancer cells or tissue samples. In conclusion, NaV1.7 channel isoforms play a significant role in the development, progression, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer and present as a potential therapeutic target in PaCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Proliferation,Invasion,NaV1.7,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The standard of care for GBM consists of maximal surgical resection, concurrent radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), and adjuvant TMZ. However, this has only led to a modest increase in median patient survival. TROY (TNFRSF19) is an orphan member of the TNF receptor superfamily that is differentially upregulated in GBM with low expression in normal brain tissue. Previously, we have reported that TROY is overexpressed in GBM and signals to mediate cell invasion and therapeutic resistance. Propentofylline (PPF) is a well-studied synthetic methylxanthine derivative that has strong BBB penetrance. We have shown that PPF decreases TROY expression in gliomas, inhibits invasion, and sensitizes GBM to TMZ in vitro. Here we examined the efficacy of PPF in combination with TMZ using in vivo studies of intracranial models of GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in murine. We tested 3 models of GBM PDX cells with various TROY expression levels (GBM8-high TROY; GBM43-moderate TROY; GBM22-low\/no TROY). Our intracranial PDX experiments showed that PPF treatment alone did not increase survival in all PDX cells. The combination of PPF and TMZ treatment did provide a survival benefit (p &#60; 0.039) relative to TMZ alone (only in GBM8-high TROY and GBM43-moderate TROY) that was partially lost when treatment was discontinued. However, continuous PPF administration following a concomitant PPF and TMZ treatment course led to extended survival (p &#60; 0.0015) compared to TMZ alone resulting in increased DNA damage (&#947;H2AX) and apoptotic markers (Cleaved Caspase-3). Immunohistochemical analyses showed that TROY expression was decreased in tumors treated with PPF. In addition, PPF-treated tumors showed a differential myeloid population with well circumscribed tumors as compared to control-treated or TMZ-treated tumors. Thus, our data demonstrates that PPF may provide a pharmacological approach to targeting TROY concomitant with standard-of-care to increase patient survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug sensitivity,DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Unfortunately, most OvCa patients develop chemotherapy-resistant disease that is inevitably fatal. Quiescence is an important yet poorly understood mechanism underlying chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, we aimed to characterize quiescent ovarian cancer (qOvCa) cells to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve OvCa patient outcomes. Primary patient-derived qOvCa cells and proliferating cells were isolated using a single-cell microfluidics culture device and collected for single-cell RNA-seq. scRNA-seq of qOvCa cells identified (i) downregulation of MBD3 and CHD4, which are components of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and (ii) upregulation of proteasome-associated genes. Knockdown of either MBD3 or CHD4 by shRNA, or NuRD complex pharmacologic inhibition with the HDAC inhibitors such as Vorinostat resulted in significant cell growth arrest without cell death. Standard and Fucci reporter-based cell cycle analysis further confirmed that inhibition of the NuRD complex with Vorinostat induced 94.47% cells in the G0 phase (p&#60;0.0001), suggesting a dense quiescent state. Through cell cycle phase maps produced by iterative immunofluorescence of 30 core cell cycle regulators and manifold learning, we found Vorinostat-treated OvCa cells demonstrated a completely different cell cycle structure from control cells, with most of the cells in an extreme G0 phase. Bulk RNA-seq of Vorinostat-treated cells in three OvCa cell lines validated the downregulation of pathways relating to cell cycle, cell division, and DNA replication (LFC&#60;-1, p&#60;0.05), which is consistent with stem cells. Upregulation of several pathways involved in proteostasis were also noted. We therefore performed a targeted drug screen for combinatorial therapy approaches to eradicate qOvCa. We found that Vorinostat combined with the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib demonstrated the most profound synergistic cell death (Loewe index synergy score 23-73). Increased proteasome activity was also found in both primary and Vorinostat-induced qOvCa, suggesting the essential role of the proteasome in qOvCa. Tumor xenograft studies confirmed that Vorinostat alone can delay tumor growth (p&#60;0.05) and combinatorial therapy of Vorinostat and Carfilzomib is more efficacious (p=0.0049). Taken together, NuRD complex inhibition induces quiescence. Combination therapy with Vorinostat to induce quiescence combined with proteasome inhibitors resulted in the profound death of therapy-resistant quiescent cells. Our work suggests this is a novel therapeutic approach to eradicate chemoresistant qOvCa cells and increase cure rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,Cell cycle arrest,Chromatin remodeling,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qi Jiang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle Ertel<sup>2<\/sup>, Santiago Panesso- Gómez<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Sannino<sup>3<\/sup>, April Sagan<sup>4<\/sup>, Alexander  J.

It is highly expressed in ovarian cancer (OC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and papillary thyroid cancer, with limited expression in normal tissue, making it a promising target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) [2,3]. LM-317 is a novel NaPi2b targeted humanized monoclonal antibody LM-117 conjugated to the next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor LDX2 via a cleavable linker, with antibody-drug ratio of 8. Here, we present the preclinical <i>in vivo and in vitro <\/i>results of LM-317.<br \/>Results: LM-317 is highly specific cross-reactive with rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, mouse, and rat NaPi2b. Concentration-dependent cell binding and internalization effects of LM-317 were observed in human NaPi2b-expressing cells, and OC and NSCLC cells expressing NaPi2b, with EC-50 of 0.92 - 9.7 nM and 1.51 - 4.76 nM, respectively. The cytotoxicity effect of LM-317 in NaPi2b -positive tumor cells was superior to LM-117-DXD, with IC-50 of 0.002 - 0.52nM. The <i>in vivo<\/i> studies showed that 1 mg\/kg of LM-317 almost completely eradicated tumors in the OVCAR-3 xenograft mice model of OC, and similar antitumor activity was observed in the NCI-H175-xenograft mice model of NSCLC at the dose of 3 mg\/kg. Single dose of 6 mg\/kg of LM-317 showed sustained tumor eradication in the NSCLC xenograft -mouse model. LM-317 also exhibited potent tumor regression in the PDX model of OC and NSCLC. The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value was 80%-100% in OC and NSCLC PDX models with different expression degree of NaPi2b after treatment with LM-317. The antitumor activity of LM-317 in cell line- and PDX models of OC and NSLCL was comparable to those of LM-117-DXD.<br \/>Conclusion: The novel ADC LM-317 targeting NaPi2b showed robust antitumor activity <i>in vitro<\/i>, and in the OC and NSCLC cell line derived models and PDX models. LM-317 could potentially provide therapeutic benefit to treat NaPi2b-positive tumors including OC and NSCLC in the future.<br \/>Reference: 1.S. Banerjee et al.

Despite what the terminology may suggest, rare cancers collectively are neither very rare, accounting for about a quarter of all cancers, nor less deadly than other forms of cancer. In fact, the comparative lack of research and case studies of rare cancers compared to other forms of cancer provides both an obstacle and a unique opportunity when it comes to drug development. While finding adequate animal models and cell lines to study the disease may be more difficult, the development of innovative treatment options for rare cancers is often incentivized by the Orphan Drug Act, accelerating approval from the FDA and acting as a gateway to approval for other indications. One such rare cancer is angiosarcoma, a rare cancer that originates from the endothelium. Angiosarcoma represents about 1% of total sarcomas and can develop anywhere in the body but occurs mainly in the breast, liver, or skin of the head and neck area. Angiosarcoma is characterized by a high metastasis rate of 16% to 44%, which results in a dismal prognosis, with overall survival ranging from 6 to 16 months. Considering the high reoccurrence rate and high metastatic potential of angiosarcoma, chemotherapeutic options seem to be the obvious choice. However, mainstream chemotherapies have failed to have long-term therapeutic effects. Another approach is the use of anti-angiogenic therapy, which proved effective but was unable to lead to a complete response. Herein, we describe a novel endothelial cell-targeting therapy option for the treatment of angiosarcoma. Previously, we have discovered Doppel, a 23 kDa GPI-anchored protein that is expressed specifically in the endothelium of tumor-associated blood vessels, except for the testis. Considering the fact that angiosarcoma is a rapidly growing tumor of endothelial origin, we hypothesized that Doppel might be a viable target for both the detection and treatment of angiosarcoma. We subsequently developed an antibody-drug conjugate to Doppel by conjugating a human antibody to MMAE using a unique linker, KGDEVD. When tested on xenografts of the angiosarcoma cell lines KU-CAS3 and KU-CAS5, the tumors responded extremely well to anti-Doppel ADC treatment. Most surprisingly, even tumors exceeding 1 cm^3 went into complete remission after 6 doses of the ADC. Thus, we delved deeper into the mechanism of action behind the ADC. ADC internalization was demonstrated using confocal microscopy. Apoptosis assays show that the ADC is capable of inducing apoptosis and caspase 3 expression in angiosarcoma cells, a crucial step in the activation of the KGDEVD linker. In-vitro toxicity assays of the ADC against KU-CAS3 show an IC50 value of 7.94 nM, much lower compared to normal endothelial cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Angiogenesis,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Sulindac exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of COX1\/COX2 pathways and promising anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models of colorectal and endometrial cancer. Thus, we investigated the efficacy of sulindac as an anti-tumorigenic agent in OC pre-clinical cell and mouse models.<br \/>Methods: The human OC cell lines, MES and OVCAR5, and the K18-gT121<sup>+\/-<\/sup>;p53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>;Brca1<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>(KpB) mouse model of high-grade serous OC were used. Cellular proliferation was assessed by MTT and colony count assays. Apoptosis was assessed using cleaved caspase 3, 8, and 9 assays. To measure cellular stress, production of reactive oxygen species was measured by DCFH-DA assay, and the JC1 assay was used to assess changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Cellular adhesion was evaluated by laminin assay, and cellular migration was determined by wound healing assay. Western immunoblotting was used to assess the effects of sulindac on downstream targets related to cellular stress, apoptosis, cellular invasion potential, cell cycle control, and inflammation. The KpB mice were treated with sulindac (7.5 mg\/kg, oral gavage, daily) or placebo for four weeks.<br \/>Results: Sulindac inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the MES and OVCAR5 cells, with IC50s of 75.3 and 75.69 &#956;M, respectively. Sulindac (100 &#956;M) reduced colony formation by 81% in the MES cells and by 49% in the OVCAR5 cells (p&#60;0.01). Treatment of MES and OVCAR5 cells with sulindac increased ROS production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, in a dose-dependent manner (p&#60;0.01). Sulindac induced activity of cleaved caspase 3, 8, and 9, in MES and OVCAR5 cells (p&#60;0.01). In addition, sulindac (100 &#956;M) effectively decreased cellular adhesion by 31% in MES cells and by 23% in OVCAR5 cells (p&#60;0.01). These results were confirmed by Western immunoblotting demonstrating that sulindac downregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 and upregulated the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cellular stress proteins Bip, ATF-4, and PDI, in both cell lines. Sulindac downregulated expression of several epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins in both cell lines, including beta-catenin, snail, and slug. Sulindac also downregulated expression of cell cycle proteins CDK4, CDK5, and Cyclin D1 and inflammatory protein COX-2 in both cell lines. After 4 wks of treatment, sulindac significantly inhibited tumor growth by 71% (1.89 g vs 0.54 g, p&#60;0.01) in KpB mice.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results find that sulindac exhibited anti-tumorigenic effects in OC cell lines and the KpB OC mouse model. Given these promising pre-clinical results, further studies on the repurposing of sulindac for the prevention and treatment of OC is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"COX-2 inhibitor,Ovarian cancer,Antitumor agents,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Our previous study demonstrated that high serum levels of FABP4 increased the risk of breast cancer, indicating that circulating FABP4 could be a potential therapeutic target for this disease. In this study, we generated mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against FABP4 by immunizing C57BL\/6 mice with recombinant human FABP4. After screening over 1300 hybridoma clones, we identified an FABP4 neutralizing mAb, named 12G2, which inhibited breast cancer growth in various mouse models. To facilitate clinical application, we engineered chimeric and humanized variants of the 12G2 mAb. Notably, the humanized variant, 12G2-variant 9 (12G2-vt9), effectively inhibited mammary tumor growth and progression by reducing the activity of FABP4\/ALDH1 in different breast cancer mouse models. Our findings suggest that 12G2-Vt9 is a promising neutralizing mAb targeting FABP4-mediated cancer stemness through ALDH1 signaling, offering potential as a targeted therapeutic antibody for the clinical treatment of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,FABP4,ALDH1,Therapeutic antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

These drugs are designed to achieve more targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor cells with robust clinical activity. ARB-1-6, a sortilin (<i>SORT1<\/i>) targeted peptide conjugated to the cytotoxic agent MMAE, has demonstrated pre-clinical activity and tolerability in cell line xenografts of breast cancer. To further characterize its spectrum of antitumor activity and biomarker correlates we evaluated ARB-1-6 in a collection of clinically and genomically annotated breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX).<br \/>Methods: Breast cancer PDX models were generated and propagated under IRB approved protocols [14-8358]. ARB-1-6 was dosed in tumor-bearing SCID mice by tail vein injection at 3 mg\/kg weekly x 4 doses. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly until day 35 or until models reached humane endpoints, after which tumors were collected. Animals were weighed regularly and assessed for treatment-related toxicity.<br \/>Results: 7 models (5 TN and 2 HR) have completed efficacy assessment to date. 3\/7 models were derived from treatment na&#239;ve patients while 4\/7 were derived from pre-treated patients (Table 1). Complete response (mRECIST) was seen in 5\/7 (71.4%) models with stable disease occurring in 2\/7 (28.6%). ARB-1-6 was well tolerated with no weight loss observed. Complete tumor regression was seen in a PDX derived from a patient with clinical resistance to a TROP2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Antitumor activity was observed in models with low <i>SORT1<\/i> RNA expression; SORT1 IHC and other correlatives studies are underway.<br \/>Conclusion: ARB-1-6 demonstrates substantial preclinical activity in PDX models at doses that are well tolerated in mice. Treatment of additional models is ongoing. Full results and correlative analyses including relationships between antitumor activity and target protein expression will be presented.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{B27E68DC-9A68-4FB4-B59E-AD32195C7913}\"><caption>PDX Model Characteristics and Patient Treatment<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PDX<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Subtype<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Pt.

Ras activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), of which SOS1 is a major player that transduces receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to Ras. In addition to recently devised oncogenic Kras targeting small molecule inhibitors, disrupting the catalytic interaction between Ras and SOS1 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy in working synergistically with Kras inhibitors and overcoming resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated an active &#8220;feed forward&#8221; loop of active Kras binding to the allosteric site of SOS1 that further stimulates SOS1 catalytic activation of wild type H\/N\/Kras, which is required for oncogenic Kras driven tumorigenesis. Here we have developed a rational approach that combines virtual screening with experimental screening to identify small molecule inhibitors that target the allosteric site of SOS1 to suppress oncogenic Kras mediated SOS1-regulated wild-type Ras activities. Unlike SOS1 catalytic site inhibitors which can have significant toxicity due to their ability to inhibit normal Ras signaling function, the lead SOS1 allosteric inhibitors developed in our laboratory binds to the allosteric site of SOS1 and blocks active Ras interaction with SOS1: we found these inhibitors can competitively suppresses SOS1-Ras interaction at the SOS1 allosteric site and dose-dependently inhibits the feed-forward SOS1 GEF activity. Mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies mapped the site of action to the SOS1 allosteric site, and preliminarily defined the chemical moieties in the inhibitor essential for the activity. The inhibitor showed dose-dependent and selective efficacy in inhibiting WT Ras activity, downstream signaling activities, and associated cell proliferation in KRAS mutation cells but not KRAS wild-type cells. Compared to the SOS1 catalytic inhibitor, BI3406, our inhibitors showed better selectivity for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells vs. WT KRAS cells. These studies establish a proof of principle for the rational design of small molecule inhibitors targeting an oncogenic Kras specific allosteric site of SOS1 and provide a novel therapeutic concept to target KRAS-driven tumors more effectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,chemical biology,allosteric site,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

In addition, YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity is emerging as a major resistance mechanism for diverse precision oncology drugs, with the most extensive data for resistance to drugs targeting the MAPK pathway. There is a strong interest in generating inhibitors of YAP\/TEAD transcriptional activity with TEAD palmitic acid site inhibitors having demonstrated encouraging pre-clinical activity and now clinical activity with confirmed objective responses with the TEAD1\/2\/3 inhibitor VT3989. However, the TEAD1-preferential inhibitor IK930 did not yield any objective responses but also showed a more favorable safety profile especially with respect to proteinuria. These contrasting clinical read-outs provide a good lead-in to a critical design challenge\/question of TEAD palmitic acid site inhibitors: the optimization of inhibitory profile against the respective four TEAD paralogs (TEAD1-4). In depth bioinformatic analyses led Sporos investigators to conclude that while TEAD1 inhibition was a minimum requirement for anti-neoplastic activity, inhibition of other paralogs would be necessary for maximizing biological impact and a TEAD1\/4 inhibitor would provide the best balance of anti-neoplastic activity and toxicity. Activity against TEAD2 was identified as counter-productive associated with a context-specific paradoxical stimulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth while activity against TEAD3 was flagged as a major driver of podocyte effacement and kidney toxicity. Here, we provide novel corroborating data supporting this selection of inhibitory profile. We provide an update on the pre-clinical efficacy and toxicology of SPR1, Sporos&#8217;s TEAD1\/4 preferential inhibitor which favorably contrasts with other TEAD inhibitors such as the TEAD1\/3\/4 inhibitor VT3989 and the TEAD1 inhibitor VT103 and IK930 in both the monotherapy and combination setting. We show that 1) SPR1 displays broader and deeper cell-based activity and extends the utility of TEAD inhibitors outside of mesothelioma and NF2 mutants 2) SPR1 shows stronger activity than TEAD1-only inhibitors in combination with MAPK and EGFR inhibitors in vitro and in vivo 3) SPR1 does not cause proteinuria in mice; dogs or rats even above therapeutic doses 4) SPR1 does not show the context-specific stimulation of tumor growth in Lung PDX previously observed with VT3989 and other inhibitors that include TEAD2 in their profile. Taken together - the data suggests SPR1 is positioned to become a best-in-class TEAD palmitic acid site inhibitor with broad utility in both monotherapy and combination setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Hippo pathway,Therapeutic target,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Myosin heavy chain 9 (<i>MYH9<\/i>) gene encodes for the heavy chain of the hexameric protein NMIIA. We have recently identified that NMIIA serves as a binding partner for HER3 following the inhibition of the HER family member compared to the vehicle control treatment, as observed in HER3 immunoprecipitates. We checked the basal protein and mRNA levels of NMIIA in different breast cancer cell lines and found higher levels of NMIIA in both HER2+ and TNBC cell lines compared to ER+ cell lines. These data correlate with clinical data of primary breast cancer patients with high <i>MYH9<\/i> being less likely in ER+ breast cancer patients and more likely in the PAM50 subtypes basal and HER2 enriched breast cancer patients. By employing a pool of four siRNA targeting <i>MYH9<\/i>, our data indicated a reduction in proliferation of HER2+ and TNBC cell lines when compared to the control siRNA. We have previously found that loss of <i>MYH9<\/i> sensitizes to the HER family inhibitor neratinib treatment as assessed by cell proliferation, colony formation on matrigel, cell migration and invasion. We aimed to determine if pharmacological inhibition of the NMIIA pathway would sensitize to neratinib. RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK) serves as a master regulator of NMIIA activity as it directly phosphorylates the regulatory light chain (RLC) of NMIIA. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK-NMIIA pathway using the ROCK inhibitor GSK269962A alone or in combination with neratinib reduced the cell proliferation in HER2+ cell lines BT474 and MDA-MB-453 as indicated by MTT and cell proliferation assay. It is well known that HER2-targeted therapies cause the upregulation of HER3. Given our identification of NMIIA as one of the interacting partners of HER3, our focus will be on investigating the NMIIA-HER3 signaling axis to elucidate its contribution to an adaptive response to HER2 inhibition and potential treatment resistance. Furthermore, we will explore strategies to target NMIIA in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Non-muscle Myosin Type IIa,HER3,HER2+ ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

More than 90% of PDAC cases involve mutations in the GTPase KRAS. Unfortunately, existing drugs targeting the RAS family, like sotorasib, exclusively address the KRAS-G12C mutation, mainly found in NSCLC. In PDAC, most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with unresectable tumors that exhibit various genetic mutations. Approximately 70% of these cases have KRAS-G12D mutations, often co-occurring with KRAS-G12V, KRAS-G12C, and KRAS-G12R mutations. This highlights the urgent need for innovative treatments that effectively address the complex mutation landscape in PDAC and avoid resistance mechanisms associated with mutant-specific or pan-KRAS inhibitors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> KPC-Luc (1 &#215; 10<sup>5<\/sup>) and 2838C3-Luc (1.5 &#215; 10<sup>5<\/sup>) PDAC cells carrying the KRAS-G12D mutation were injected into the pancreas of C57BL\/6J mice. After one week, the mice were randomly divided into treatment groups (n =&#8201;7 per group) and received oral ADT-1004 at a dose of 40mg\/kg body weight five times a week for four weeks. Tumor burden was assessed by bioluminescence signals using the IVIS Xenogen imaging system for patient-derived xenografts from PDAC patients with the KRAS-G12V mutation who were subcutaneously implanted in NSG mice. A week later, mice were randomized (n=7 per group) and treated orally with 40mg\/kg of ADT-1004 five times a week for six weeks. Body weight and tumor size were measured twice weekly.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> ADT-1004, a prodrug of ADT-007 that exhibits potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of both human and murine RAS mutant PDAC cell lines with single-digit nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> values, compared with &#181;M IC<sub>50<\/sub> in PDAC cells with WT RAS, was well tolerated in mice at a dose up to 175 mg\/kg bid orally with sustained plasma levels of ADT-007 that exceeded IC<sub>50<\/sub> values by 50-fold and even higher concentrations in pancreatic tumors. When administered orally at 40mg\/kg body weight, ADT-1004 resulted in substantial growth inhibition of the KRAS-G12D and KRAS-G12V tumors, leading to profound tumor regression without any accompanying loss in body weight. ADT-1004 also displayed a significant inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation. Notably, this inhibition is effective regardless of the specific RAS mutational codon or isozyme, as it specifically targets activated RAS and disrupts downstream KRAS signaling pathways.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These results highlight the promise of ADT-1004 as a potential breakthrough for treating PDAC. This novel pan-RAS inhibitor demonstrates potent inhibition of PDAC growth, irrespective of the specific KRAS mutation. Furthermore, it shows an excellent safety profile, with profound tumor regression and no impact on body weight in animal models. These findings open new possibilities for addressing the complex genetic landscape of PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Prodrugs,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.
