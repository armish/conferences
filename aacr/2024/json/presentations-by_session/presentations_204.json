SMARCA2, a close homologous protein of SMARCA4, is an attractive synthetic lethality target for human cancers with SMARCA4 deficiency. Herein, we report the discovery and biological evaluation of potent, highly selective and efficacious SMARCA2 PROTAC degraders exemplified by UM-SMD-3236. UM-SMD-3236 has a DC<sub>50<\/sub> value of &#60;1 nM in inducing degradation of SMARCA2 in cells and demonstrates &#62;400-fold selectivity over SMARCA4 protein. Of significance, while UM-SMD-3236 achieves a D<sub>max<\/sub> of &#62;95% against SMARCA2, it shows a D<sub>max<\/sub> of 50% against SMARCA4 in cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, a single intravenous dose of UM-SMD-3236 attains 85-93% of SMARCA2 depletion in tumor tissues for 7 days, while showing no reduction of the SMARCA4 protein. Weekly intravenous administration of UM-SMD-3236 is highly effective in inhibition of tumor growth in SMARCA4 deficient xenograft models of human cancer. Importantly, UM-SMD-3236 shows no signs of toxicity in mice at highly efficacious doses. UM-SMD-3236 represents a highly promising SMARCA2 degrader for extensive evaluation as a potential new therapy for the treatment of SMARCA4-deficient human cancers.<br \/>References 1.

Despite treatment advancements, there's a pressing need for more effective strategies to improve survival and quality of life for NSCLC and HNC patients. Carolyn Bertozzi group recently reported in Nature the groundbreaking protein degraders named lysosome-targeted chimeras (LYTACs), which have bispecific binding affinity that drives cell-surface endocytic receptors to drag membrane or extracellular oncogenic proteins to lysosomes for degradation. They have successfully targeted critical oncoproteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and more. However, current degradation demonstration was limited to in vitro cancer cells, LYTACs' impact on immune cell modulation and their therapeutic potentials in preclinical animal models remain unknown and require extensive evaluation before venturing to clinical trials.Our group and others have identified galectin-1 (Gal-1) as a multifaceted immunosuppressive biomarker overexpressed in NSCLC and HNC. By interacting with glycosylated receptors (e.g. CD45) on immune cells, it results in apoptosis of cytotoxic T cells, expansion of regulatory T cells, and intratumoral recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Despite promising as an immune checkpoint target, effective anti-Gal-1 therapies are currently absent in clinical trials.Through histopathological analyses, we have confirmed substantial LYTAC receptor (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, CI-M6PR) expression in ~200 HNC and ~400 NSCLC patient samples. Collaborating with Bertozzi group, we have developed the first Gal-1 targeting LYTAC named G-M6Pn which triggers significant target protein degradation in various human HNC and NSCLC cell lines. Such efficient Gal-1 degradation leads to significant immunosuppression reversal by stimulating CD8+ T cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation while dampening regulatory T cell (Treg) activity in both cell experiments and humanized mouse tumor models, resulting in excellent tumor\/metastases control and survival improvement on both NSCLC and HNC models. When synergized with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, the antitumor immune responses are further amplified and G-M6Pn also mediates &#8216;abscopal effect&#8217; inhibiting non-irradiated tumors. This study thus contributes to expediting clinical translation of LYTACs as novel immune checkpoint degraders to improve personalized radio-immunotherapy of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,LYTAC,Radio-Immunotherapy,Targeted Protein Degradation ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuyan Jiang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Green Ahn<sup>2<\/sup>, Mobeen Rahman<sup>3<\/sup>, Hongbin Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Carolyn Bertozzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Qunh Le<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"032eab6c-5bc0-4460-aebc-2ac32110b2ee","ControlNumber":"5437","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Our work aims to introduce a new paradigm for engaging these clinically relevant proteins using a modular platform we term the HYbrid DegRAding Copolymers (HYDRACs). HYDRACs multiplex targeting warheads with degradation inducers and have long circulation times plus high cell uptake. Preliminary studies on MYC and RAS, targets of immense pharmaceutical interest, highlight the potential of this platform to revolutionize drug design.<br \/>Methods:&nbsp;HYDRACs containing MYC- or RAS- targeting peptides randomly copolymerized with degrons were synthesized using ROMP. Fluorescent and biotin-tags were incorporated for use in uptake and pull-down assays. Viability following treatment with MYC-HYDRACs was performed in multiple cell lines with both cellular (MYC-independent lines) and polymer composition controls. Target engagement was assessed via immunoprecipitation and circular dichroism with protein degradation monitored by WB. Unbiased whole proteome analysis and RNAseq were done to confirm observed effects were selectively on-target. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy and biodistribution was assessed in tumor-bearing mice.<br \/>Results:&nbsp;HYDRACs show high levels of cell uptake and antiproliferative effects at sub-micromolar concentrations in a formulation- and target-dependent manner. Cells treated with MYC-HYDRACs displayed reduced MYC protein levels, which were rescued by proteasome or neddylation inhibition. Swapping out the degron for various validated E3 ligase recruiters maintained MYC degradation, highlighting the &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; nature of this approach. On-target activity was confirmed via RNAseq. Biophysical analysis showed strong HYDRAC-protein interactions, orthogonally supported by the presence of target protein following pull-down of biotin-terminated HYDRACs. Target protein degradation only occurred following treatment with an intact HYDRAC compound. Mice bearing MYC-CaP tumors showed delayed tumor growth following treatment with&#8239;MYC-HYDRACs, with compound accumulation in the tumor for up to 72 h following a single injection. Generalizability was demonstrated against RAS, with RAS-HYDRACs capable of degrading KRAS across multiple different alleles, acting as a pan-KRAS degrader.<br \/>Conclusions:&nbsp;We present a novel platform technology that addresses the challenges inherent to peptide delivery approaches. HYDRACs have the potential to dramatically alter the drug discovery landscape, allowing for the development of cancer-relevant target modulators for which there are no current viable therapies. We envision the HYDRAC platform as a generalizable approach to designing degraders of proteins of interest, greatly expanding the therapeutic armamentarium for TPD.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemistry,Peptides,Myc,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Certain cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are known for the intracellular overexpression of proteins, and are thus susceptible to the inhibition of p97 and resulting proteotoxic stress. A known p97 inhibitor, CB-5083 entered human phase 1 clinical trials in 2015, but trials were terminated due to side effects that were later traced to strong interaction of the compound with the phosphodiesterase PDE6. To address this problem, we devised a subtractive approach that leveraged high resolution structures of CB-5083 bound to PDE6 and p97. Using this information, we designed a p97 inhibitor that no longer displayed significant off-target binding but retained strong on-target binding. The optimization process started when we identified the 7-azaindole core from an <i>in silico<\/i> screen as a suitable hit pharmacophore and confirmed the binding mode of several variants of this scaffold in p97 by cryo-EM. Through a structure-guided medicinal chemistry program, we identified GND-135, a potent, on-target binder through the synthesis of less than 100 compounds. The design was supported with about 50 cryo-EM structures throughout the optimization process. Compared to CB-5083, our compound GND-135 displays greatly reduced PDE6 activity (&#60; 1% inhibition at 10 &#956;M versus 89% inhibition for CB-5083) and more potent p97 ATPase inhibition (3 nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> versus 12 nM for CB-5083). We also evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile of GND-135 in mice; the half-life and clearance of 6.6 h and 15.9 mL\/min\/kg respectively were deemed suitable for daily administration. Based on the initial profiling, we carried out an efficacy study in a cell derived xenograft mouse model of AML using a U937 cell line with subcutaneous implantation. In this model, where GND-135 was administered IP (40 mg\/kg QD) and CB-5083 was administered orally (40 mg\/kg QD) the compounds showed statistically comparable efficacy, which was differentiated from untreated control. Thus, GND-135 is a novel p97 inhibitor lead compound with on-target selectivity powered by cryo-EM driven rational drug design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-06 Lead identification and optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Structure-activity relationships,Acute myeloid leukemia,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Cancer cells, especially those with RAS mutations, can activate the ULK1\/2 (UNC-51-like kinase 1\/2)-initiated autophagy pathway for survival and diminish RAS pathway inhibitors&#8217; efficacy. The combination of RAS pathway and ULK1\/2 kinase inhibitors may provide synergistic or additive effects for RAS mutated solid tumors. We have identified a structurally small molecule, GLX1546, which shows strong inhibition against ULK1\/2, as well as autophagy induced by RAS pathway inhibitors in cells.<br \/>Methods: Multiple dual-target activity predictive models were constructed and trained using extensive protein-ligand interaction data. These models, in conjunction with in-house built physicochemical property predictive models, were integrated into an AI-driven computational pipeline to perform the <i>in silico<\/i> screening on both ULK1\/2 inhibitory activities and drug-like properties. ULK1\/2 <i>in vitro<\/i> activities were assessed by enzymatic assays and cellular assays based on the phosphorylation of ULK substrate. The <i>in vivo <\/i>anti-tumor efficacy of GLX1546 was evaluated in A549 CDX mouse model both as monotherapy and in combination with trametinib.<br \/>Results: An AI-driven high-throughput virtual screening strategy using deep learning models was implemented for the discovery of novel and potent ULK1\/2 small-molecule inhibitors. GLX1546 was developed as a potent ULK1\/2 inhibitor with IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values of 1.13 nM for ULK1 and 4.75 nM for ULK2. Moreover, to address trametinib-induced activation of ULK1\/2 in KRAS and BRAF mutated solid tumors, GLX1546 provided IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 54 nM in A549, 21 nM in HCT 116, 67 nM in MIA PaCa-2, and 76 nM in A375 cells against both basal and trametinib-induced pATG13. Furthermore, GLX1546 exhibited good exposure, sound safety, and high oral bioavailability (~100%) in mice. The combination of trametinib (PO, QD) with GLX1546 (PO, BID) in 21-day cycles also led to inhibition of ATG13 phosphorylation and greater tumor growth inhibition than trametinib alone in A549 CDX mouse model.<br \/>Conclusions: These results indicate that GLX1546 can inhibit ULK-mediated autophagy induced by trametinib. The combination of GLX1546 with RAS pathway inhibitors may offer a novel cancer therapy for RAS mutated cancers, highlighting AI as an effective tool for drug discovery.<br \/>Keywords: AI-driven drug discovery, autophagy, small-molecule inhibitors, ULK","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,AI-driven drug discovery,Small-molecule inhibitors,ULK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

Currently, most studies that characterize the pharmacological effects of protein degraders utilize target-specific assays and global proteomics. However, information on the direct molecular consequence of protein degraders, i.e., induced protein ubiquitylation, is often lacking. Here we report the development of E-STUB (E3-substrate tagging by ubiquitin biotinylation), a ubiquitin-specific proximity labeling method that identifies ubiquitylated substrates in proximity to an E3 ligase of interest. We demonstrated that E-STUB can accurately identify the ubiquitylated targets induced by protein degraders in both CRBN and VHL systems&#8212;two of the most utilized E3 ligases by heterobifunctional degraders&#8212;and is likely generalizable to other E3 ligases. While we observed a high level of consistency between ubiquitylation and degradation for the induced substrates, E-STUB also detected ubiquitylation of non-degraded targets, providing novel and complementary insights to global proteomics. We also envision that E-STUB could be specifically used for the development of chemical inducers of proximity that catalyze non-degradative ubiquitylation events. In summary, we expect that the E-STUB approach can be widely useful for studying the principles of chemically induced ubiquitylation and the advancement of targeted protein degradation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-09 Targeted protein degradation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Mass spectrometry,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-T.
