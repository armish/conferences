While around 20 genes are recurrently mutated in association with CH, and drive their selective advantage, the variant clones are found in different contexts and confer different risks for cancer. However, the mechanisms through which variant stem cells &#8220;win&#8221; in are generally poorly understood. Goodell will describe how mutations in <i>DNMT3A, PPM1D<\/i>, and <i>SRCAP<\/i> are found in CH and offer stark contrasts into the development of CH, and their contrasting implications for health. Given that CH, and somatic evolution more broadly, are ubiquitous with aging and frequently precede cancer, mechanistic insights may have both prognostic and therapeutic value for aging-associated diseases including malignancy development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Margaret A.

We have explored age-related changes in the mammary gland by performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) of different age rats (3, 6, 12, and 22 months). We found an age-related increase in mammary epithelial proliferation, loss of luminal identity, and a decrease in na&#239;ve B and T cells. We discovered a luminal progenitor (LP) population we termed aging LP, unique to old rats with profiles reflecting precancerous changes. Through follow up functional and mechanistic studies we demonstrated that some of the genes upregulated with age induce age-related changes and promote mammary tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal a link between aging and increased susceptibility to tumor initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Cancer,Prevention,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kornelia Polyak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular controls of cellular responses to DNA damage in mammalian cells in the past two decades. Much of what we have learned about these signaling pathways has come from the study of human diseases, particularly cancer predisposition syndromes, representing classic examples of &#8216;bedside to bench&#8217; research. The critical role of the tumor suppressor gene product, p53, in regulating cellular responses to DNA damage and the demonstration that p53 is phosphorylated after DNA breakage by ATM, a protein kinase mutated in the cancer-prone, radiosensitive disorder, Ataxia-telangiectasia, were the first steps identified in the complex mammalian DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway. Once activated by DNA breakage, ATM phosphorylates numerous substrates in the cell that modulate the cell&#8217;s response to the DNA damage. Many of these substrates, including p53, NBS1, BRCA1, CHK2, FANCD2, HDM2, and others, are also known inherited cancer susceptibility genes (e.g. Li-Fraumeni, Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Fanconi Anemia, Breast\/Ovarian Cancer, etc.), or are somatically mutated in cancer, or both. Mutation of these gene products contributes to cancer development by a variety of mechanisms, including alterations of DNA replication, DNA repair, or chromatin structure and transcriptional modulation. The elucidation of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of these proteins is now leading to &#8216;bench to bedside&#8217; opportunities as the field is taking advantage of these insights to develop novel and improved approaches to cancer therapy. I will discuss some of the history of the elucidation of these pathways and provide some examples of how this information is being used to develop new approaches to cancer treatment. I will also discuss the development and characterization of a novel therapeutic which dually inhibits both the ATM and DNA-PK protein kinases. Pre-clinical evaluation of this orally bioavailable compound demonstrates several potential uses as an anti-cancer therapeutic, including as a potent radiosensitizer, and it has recently completed evaluation in a phase I clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Cancer therapy,p53,ATM,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael B.
