[{"Abstract":"PARP inhibitors have been an effective treatment option for cancers deficient in homologous recombination repair, such as ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, particularly those harboring BRCA mutations. However, their severe overlapping hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities have limited their clinical use, especially in the combination therapies with other anti-cancer agents. More recently, studies have shown that inhibiting PARP1 mainly drives anti-tumor activity while inhibiting PARP2 contributes to the hematological toxicity such as anemia due to its essential role in the survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing a selective PARP1 inhibitor. In this study, we report the discovery and characterization of a unique PARP1 inhibitor, ACE-86225106. This molecule is highly selective at inhibiting PARP1 over PARP2 as demonstrated in biochemical (72x) and DNA-trapping (131x) assays. It demonstrates potent anti-proliferative activities against BRCA mutant cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1-9 nM) but not against BRCA wild type cancer cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;30,000 nM). As compared to the BRCA mutant cancer cells, this molecule is much less active at inhibiting the differentiation of CD34<sup>+<\/sup> hematopoietic stem cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#8776; 450-1,400 nM), <i>i.e.<\/i>: erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocyte. The results of these studies show that ACE-86225106 is a highly potent and selective PARP1 inhibitor. This molecule has a unique PK profile characterized by its long half-life and low volume of distribution. As such, it demonstrates robust efficacy at low dose (1 mg\/kg) with a less frequent dosing schedule (once a week). Importantly, there was no significant body weight loss observed in the treatment group even at much higher doses (10 mg\/kg), but there was a significant body weight gain. The GLP toxicology studies have confirmed its superior safety profile as the maximum recommended safe starting first-in-human dose was &#62;5-fold higher than the predicted human efficacious dose. Taken together, ACE-86225106 is a highly potent, selective PARP1 inhibitor with excellent PK and safety profile and expected to have a better safety profile, deeper and more durable clinical responses, and broader utility in the clinic as a preferred combination partner with other anti-cancer therapies. A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate its safety, PK, and clinical utility is to begin in early 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 DNA-reactive agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Chemotherapy,DNA damage response,BRCA1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>y. wei<\/b>, w.

In our previous study we highlighted a novel property of the FDA-approved antimalarial drug amodiaquine, demonstrating its ability to dose-dependently inhibit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis (Espinoza JA, et al Cell Death Diff, 2020). Amodiaquine was found to induce the degradation of the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase I, known as POLR1A (RPA194), and resulting in nucleolar stress and the stabilization of p53. Notably, RNA Pol I shutdown occurred independently of DNA damage. Motivated by these findings, we sought to find additional inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis. Acridine derivatives display anti-cancer properties. The activity of acridines is mainly attributed to the planarity of these structures, which can intercalate within the DNA structure, and inhibition of chromatin associated protein targets including topoisomerases. JP-1302 is an experimental drug, on a 9-aminoacridine structural scaffold, acting as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. It was recently shown that JP-1302 inhibits transcription, blocking RNA Pol&#8201;II phosphorylation and inhibiting p21 expression at a concentration of 10&#8201;&#956;M (Mitchell DC, et al Nat Biotech, 2023). Given JP-1302's structural similarity to other acridine derivatives such as aminacrine, ethacridine, and the experimental compound BMH-21, all known to inhibit RNA Pol I transcription, we hypothesized that JP-1302 might share similar properties. The purpose of our new study was to evaluate JP-1302&#180;s effect on ribosome biogenesis, p53, and cancer cell growth. We show here that JP-1302 acts as an inhibitor of RNA Pol I transcription. Treatment with JP-1302 induced a rapid decrease in the levels of POLR1A, cessation of rRNA synthesis and nucleolar stress already within six hours and at a concentration of 0.5&#8201;&#956;M. JP-1302 treatment stabilized wild type p53 and enhanced p21 expression in the osteosarcoma line U2OS. RNA Pol I shutdown occurred in the absence of DNA damage response, as determined by gH2A.X staining. JP-1302 impaired the growth of both p53 wild type and p53 null HCT116 cells with GI50 values of around 0.6 &#956;M, as well as in U2OS cells at 0.8 &#956;M, as determined after 48 hours. Paradoxically, at very low concentrations JP-1302 appeared to transiently stimulate RNA synthesis, a phenomenon that will require further investigation. In conclusion, we identified JP-1302 as a novel inhibitor of ribosomal RNA synthesis, exerting this effect at concentrations that do not induce DNA damage, and independently of p53. Given that JP-1302 passes the blood-brain barrier in rodents, and accumulating in different brain regions, it is of future interest to evaluate this drug in brain tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 DNA-reactive agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ribosomal RNA transcription,p53,Nucleolus,Acridine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"S.

DNA repair deficiencies and elevated replication stress present targetable vulnerabilities for cancer treatment. Notably, BRCA1\/2 mutant and homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors cannot repair double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and rely on alternative pathways of DNA repair. PARP inhibitors (PARPi), which are a standard of care in many BRCA1\/2 mutant tumors, cause synthetic lethality with BRCA1\/2 mutation by inhibiting the DNA base excision repair pathway. Despite the clinical benefit of PARPi, they are not effective in every HRD tumor and the acquisition of PARPi resistance limits long-term response. TNG348, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1, was specifically designed to target HRD vulnerabilities through an alternative mechanism. We previously showed that the anti-tumor activity of USP1 inhibition results from disruption of the translesion synthesis DNA damage tolerance pathway, a mechanism of action that is functionally distinct from base excision repair targeted by PARPi. Our preclinical studies show that TNG348 is active in HRD models and strongly synergizes with PARP inhibitors to drive strong anti-tumor responses. We have identified replication stress as a predictive biomarker of TNG348 response using cell line profiling and genome-wide CRISPR screens. For example, overexpression of oncogenes known to induce replication stress sensitized to the TNG348 and PARPi combination both in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that cancer-specific elevated DNA replication stress could contribute to tumor sensitivity to TNG348 and provide additional patient stratification strategies and opportunities for indication expansion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-06 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,BRCA,PARP inhibitors,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

However, they lack in tumor specificity, causing severe sides effects, dose-dependent toxicity as well as drug resistance development. Due to their higher tolerability, platinum(IV) prodrugs are currently in the focus of interest. However, comparable to their platinum(II) counterparts, they show insufficient tumor accumulation and are frequently prematurely activated. A promising strategy to improve tumor targeting of anticancer drugs is to exploit the enhanced consumption and accumulation of albumin in the malignant tissue. Thus, we developed a new albumin-targeted maleimide-containing platinum(IV) prodrug, which releases carboplatin in a highly tumor-specific manner. The maleimide moieties enable the drug to selectively bind the endogenous albumin via its free thiol of cysteine 34. The aim of this study was to in-depth characterize the pharmacological behavior and anticancer activity <i>in vivo<\/i> of the new prodrug. To this end, several xenograft and allograft experiments were performed. To investigate tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics serum, urine, tumor and organ samples of mice were collected after drug treatment and were evaluated by (size-exclusion chromatography) inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry (e.g cleaved caspase-3). These experiments revealed that the new prodrug fast and selectively binds to the serum albumin after intravenous injection, leading to an enhanced plasma half-life and an increased tumor accumulation in comparison to its corresponding platinum(II) drug carboplatin. Additionally, the new complex resulted in superior anticancer activity and prolonged overall survival based on the distinctly improved pharmacokinetic profile and enhanced apoptosis induction. In conclusion, these data support that albumin binding is a potent tool to increase the tumor specificity of platinum(IV) drugs and prevent their premature activation in other body compartments. Consequently, this very promising prodrug will be further developed towards clinical phase I testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-08 Platinum complexes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Platinum drugs,Prodrugs,Targeted drug delivery,Carboplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

TNBC patients can, however, benefit from targeted drugs known as Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). PARPi disrupt DNA repair pathways by targeting tumors with germline <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>mutations (<i>BRCA-MUT<\/i>) via synthetic lethality and PARP-DNA trapping mechanisms. Only 15-20% of the TNBC patient population are <i>BRCA-MUT<\/i> and can thus benefit from PARPi. However, preclinical studies and clinical trials have suggested that PARPi can also be effective in <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>wild-type (<i>BRCA-WT<\/i>)<i> <\/i>cancer cells that have genomic phenotypes similar to <i>BRCA-MUT<\/i> cells, a phenomenon known as BRCAness. Previously, we used whole transcriptome analysis in a panel of TNBC cell lines to identify a 63-gene signature for BRCAness. The 63-gene signature was shown to predict response to PARPi with an accuracy of 86% in patient-derived xenografts, and was present in 45% of TNBC patients. We hypothesize that targeting genes in this 63-gene signature can enhance the sensitivity of PARPi in <i>BRCA-WT<\/i> and <i>BRCA-MUT<\/i> TNBC cells. Our aim is to identify and target genes from this signature that are involved in DNA synthesis and repair pathways, to identify effective combination strategies with PARPi.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> Using a PARPi-resistant TNBC cell line, MDAMB231, we carried out an siRNA screen of six genes from the 63-gene signature (<i>BARD1, BUB1, RRM2, FEN1, EXO1, and USP1<\/i>), chosen based on DNA repair functions and small-molecule inhibitor availability. The gene knockdowns were combined with the application of a potent PARPi, talazoparib, to determine the impact on DNA damage and cell death in TNBC cell lines. We then focused on targeting FEN1 function with the inhibitor LNT1. Using the Chou &#38; Talalay combination index, we combined LNT1 with talazoparib to determine drug synergy in TNBC cell lines.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> The individual siRNA knockdowns of <i>BARD1<\/i>, <i>BUB1<\/i>, <i>FEN1<\/i>, <i>EXO1<\/i>, and <i>USP1<\/i>, in combination with talazoparib, led to increased &#947;-H2AX and cleaved-caspase 3 levels, indicating augmentation of DNA damage and apoptosis. In particular, the FEN1 inhibitor, LNT1 demonstrated efficacy as a single-agent and synergy in combination with talazoparib in both <i>BRCA-WT<\/i> and <i>BRCA-MUT<\/i> TNBC cell lines.<br \/><b><u>Conclusions:<\/u><\/b> The siRNA screens, in combination with talazoparib, show that there are indeed targets within the 63-gene signature that can be used with PARPi that enhance DNA damage and cell death.

Earlier we showed that overexpression of nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1) is linked to higher grade and Gleason score in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The network topology computational approach (NTCP) determined a higher synthetic lethal score between XPO1 and poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP1). We showed that selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) could synergized with PARP inhibitors in mCRPC cell lines. Here we evaluated the efficacy of SINE and PARP inhibitor (PARPi) combination in cell line derived as well as patient derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) models and deciphered the mechanism of synergy.<br \/>Methods: For CDX model, the 22rv1 mCRPC cells were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in ICR-SCID male mice. For PDX model, tissue was collected from Champions Oncology (CTG-3581) and grown subcutaneously in CEIA\/NOG male mice. SINE dosed orally at 10-15 mg\/kg twice a week and PARPi dosed orally at 50 mg\/kg daily. For <i>in vitro<\/i> mechanistic study, 22rv1 cells were subjected to RNAseq and proteomic analysis after treatment. Data analysis was performed using iPathwayGuide (advaitabio.com).<br \/>Results: The CDX and PDX showed pronounced anti-cancer efficacy by this combination compared to single agents without any significant weight loss. Survival analysis in CDX model demonstrated enhanced benefits to the mice of combination group. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed apoptotic cell death in the combination group which is evident from cleaved caspase 3 staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). To decipher the mechanism of synergy we performed transcriptomic (RNAseq) and proteomic analysis <i>in vitro<\/i>. We observed downregulation of DNA replication related gene minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) in the combination treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also showed low enrichment scores for DNA replication. Proteomic analysis revealed a down regulation of DNA replication modulators such as HMGB2 and DNAJC9 which work on DNA coiling and histone respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, this study revealed the therapeutic potential of SINE-PARPi combination via targeting DNA damage response pathway in mCRPC.

While effective treatment is limited after a relapse from platinum-based chemotherapy, recent research has identified novel pathway targets including DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been currently evaluated for their efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents, such as immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated the efficacy of combining PARPi and irinotecan in ten SCLC cell lines with diverse genetic backgrounds in the DDR genes. After treating the cells with three different PARPi in combination with irinotecan, we assessed cell viability and the combination effects. Furthermore, we confirmed protein changes in the DDR pathway through western blotting and measured the number of apoptotic cells using Annexin V staining.<br \/>Results: In our experiments, talazoparib had the most potent effect at low concentrations, while olaparib and venadaparib showed more pronounced synergistic effects (average fold change of IC<sub>50<\/sub>: olaparib, 1649&#177;4049; talazoparib, 25&#177;34.21; venadaparib, 336&#177;596.01; see Table). The combination of talazoparib or venadaparib with irinotecan led to a reduction of IC<sub>50<\/sub> values to below 10 nM in 7 out of 10 tested cell lines. Three cell lines carrying <i>BRCA<\/i> mutations displayed a strong sensitivity to PARPi, whereas no significant correlation found with alterations in other DDR genes. The combined use of both drugs increased p-chk1 and p-p53 proteins, along with apoptosis signaling. Additionally, venadaparib alone did not induce cell toxicity but significantly increased apoptosis when combined with irinotecan, even at very low concentrations.<br \/><table border=\"1\"

This vulnerability allows for the targeted disruption of these pathways through synthetic lethality approaches. DNA polymerase theta (Pol&#952;, encoded by <i>POLQ<\/i>) assumes a crucial role in mending DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), one of the principal pathways for repairing DNA DSB. Notably, Pol&#952; expression is minimal in normal tissues but becomes upregulated in HR-deficient cancer cells, positioning Pol&#952; as a prime target for synthetic lethality in HRD cancers. Reversion mutations in HR-related genes frequently employ micro-homology deletion mechanisms. Consequently, the inhibition of Pol&#952; holds the potential to thwart the emergence of PARPi resistance, primarily driven by BRCA reversion mutations. In this context, we introduce DAT-1000A, a novel small-molecule Pol&#952; inhibitor exhibiting potent activity with a single-digital nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> value. Its efficacy in MMEJ functional assays validates its on-target cellular activity. Assessments of cell viability in HR-deficient BRCA2-KO DLD-1 cells, compared to their parental counterparts, reveal a striking synthetic lethality window exceeding 500-fold. Additionally, DAT-1000A displays synergistic anti-proliferative effects when combined with PARP inhibitors in BRCA1\/2-mutated cells. In BRCA1\/2-mutated xenograft models, DAT-1000A demonstrates robust and sustained tumor regression, as evidenced by the level of &#947;H2AX, a common marker for double-strand breaks, which closely correlates with anti-tumor efficacy. Importantly, high-dose DAT-1000A treatment in mice elicits no significant abnormalities, underscoring its excellent tolerability. Collectively, DAT-1000A emerges as a novel Pol&#952; inhibitor, offering both potent activity and a favorable safety profile, and holds promise for advancing therapeutic options in the realm of HRD cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA polymerase,PARP,DNA repair,DNA double-strand break repair genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

This underscores the unmet clinical need to address the challenges in the treatment of HRD patients. Poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) plays a key role in hydrolyzing PAR chains from PARylated protein substrates, such as PARP1, serving as a critical checkpoint in DNA damage repair and the control of DNA replication stress. Therefore, PARG has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy. Cancer cells experiencing replication stress, such as HRD breast cancer cells and those resistant to PARPi, exhibit sensitivity to PARG inhibition. DAT-2000A is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of PARG, which directly binds to the catalytic domain of PARG, inducing the accumulation of poly-PAR chains at DNA lesions, and exhibits notable anti-proliferative activity across a wide range of HRD tumors both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Biochemical assays confirm DAT-2000A's high potency and selectivity as an inhibitor of PAR-chain hydrolysis. In cellular assays, DAT-2000A demonstrates selective sensitivity in HRD cells, distinguishing itself from PARPi across various indications. Preclinical studies involving CDX and PDX xenograft models reveal that DAT-2000A exerts robust anti-tumor effects in both PARPi-sensitive and -resistant settings. Furthermore, it induces a dose and time-dependent accumulation of PAR chains, which may serve as a reliable pharmacodynamic biomarker indicative of PARG target engagement. In conclusion, DAT-2000A represents an innovative targeted therapy that warrants further investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of HRD cancers and beyond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARG,DNA damage response,PARP,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

However, the common side effect of these inhibitors is hematologic toxicity, which limits their therapeutic index and combination potential with first-line chemotherapies. One possible reason is that currently approved PARP inhibitors do not specifically target PARP1, and might also affect other PARP family members. Recent studies have shown that the synthetic lethality caused by PARP trapping with HRD is mainly dependent on PARP1 inhibition, but not other PARP family members. Accordingly, we developed a selective PARP1 inhibitor that effectively inhibits tumor growth with less hematologic toxicity. HSK40495 is a potent PARP1 inhibitor with highly selectivity of PARP2. HSK40495 inhibited PARP1 enzymatic activity with a single digit nanomolar potency and with greater than 5000-fold selectivity against PARP2 in the protein binding assay. In addition, HSK40495 exhibited potent anti-proliferation activity in both DLD1(BRCA KO) cell and MDA-MB-436 cell, while had minimal effects against BRCA-WT DLD1 cell up to 30 &#181;M in an anti-proliferation assay. In a subcutaneous MDA-MB-436 xenograft tumor model, HSK40495 administered orally once daily achieved excellent tumor growth inhibition of 100% at 3mg\/kg. HSK40495 demonstrated significant PARylation inhibition in tumor tissues. Importantly, in CD34+ human bone marrow progenitor cell, HSK40495 showed improved cytotoxicity when compare to first-generation PARP inhibitor, Talazoparib. Meanwhile, in a lineage-specific hematotoxicity assay, HSK40495 exhibited improved cytotoxic safety in the process of differentiation of myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocyte compared with Talazoparib treatment. In summary, HSK40495, a highly selective PARP1inhibitor over other PARP family members, exhibits excellent pharmacological and safety properties, and also has the favorable pharmacokinetics profile in preclinical studies. All these findings suggest that HSK40495 has the great potential to be a promising PARP1 inhibitor for further development in the patients with HRD tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,HRD,Synthetic lethality,PARP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

MTAP deficiency accumulates 5&#8217;-methylthioadenosine (MTA) that subsequently binds protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5) and inhibits its activity. This renders selective targeting of MTAP null tumors with agents (MRTX1719, AMG193, TNG462, TNG908) targeting MTA bound PRMT5 (PRMT5:MTA), while sparing surrounding normal <i>MTAP<\/i> wild-type (WT) tissue.

Currently approved PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, are pan-PARP inhibitors targeting PARP1, PARP2, and other PARP family members. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting PARP1 is sufficient to exert antitumor effect, whereas targeting PARP2 causes hematological toxicity. Consequently, these pan-PARP inhibitors often lead to dose reduction and treatment discontinuation in clinics. Therefore, developing PARP1 selective inhibitors becomes advantageous to improving patient outcomes and broadening the applications of the targeted therapy. To this end, multiple PARP1 selective inhibitors are currently in preclinical or early clinical development worldwide. We report herein preclinical investigation of a novel, potent PARP1 selective inhibitor and durable DNA trapper, VB15010, which demonstrates improved pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) properties, and antitumor activity in comparison with an advanced agent in clinical development. Comparatively, VB15010 exhibited higher selectivity for PARP1 over other PARP family members (30 to 8,000-fold) in enzymatic assays, and superior selectivity for PARP1- over PARP2-DNA trapping (&#62;1700-fold) in DNA trapping assays. Genetic knockout of <i>PARP1<\/i>, but not <i>PARP2<\/i>, abolished inhibition of PARylation by VB15010 in <i>PARP1\/2<\/i> wild type cells, further validating its PARP1 selectivity. Besides, VB15010 induced substantially more durable PARP1-DNA trapping when compared to the reference agent. In addition, VB15010 demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in <i>BRCA<\/i>m or HRD-positive cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 100 nM), as well as induced an increase in DNA damage, cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, and apoptosis in <i>BRCA2<\/i>-deficient cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, VB15010 showed excellent bioavailability in preclinical animal models. Moreover, VB15010 exerted substantial antitumor activity at a dose range from 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg, leading to tumor regression at as low as 0.3 mg\/kg in <i>BRCA<\/i>m human cancer cell line-derived and HRD-positive patient-derived mouse xenograft models with an excellent PK-PD correlation. Tumor-to-plasma ratios of drug exposures indicate that VB15010 displayed a preferable tumor tissue distribution compared with the reference agent. Collectively, with improved PK-PD properties, including durable DNA trapping capability, higher apoptosis-inducing potency, and favorable tumor-to-plasma distribution ratio, as well as potent antitumor activity, VB15010 may achieve enhanced clinical efficacy and reduced hematological toxicity with a higher therapeutic index in patients.

However, the innate and acquired PARPi resistance in HGSOC poses a significant concern, necessitating the exploration of novel treatment options and strategies. Here we investigated the potential of combining brigatinib&#8212;a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor approved for treating lung cancer&#8212;with PARPis as way to enhance PARPi activity in HGSOC. Clonogenic cell survival assays revealed that brigatinib synergizes with PARPis in HR-proficient and -deficient HGSOC cell lines. In subsequent proteomics approaches and cell-based confirmatory studies, we found that brigatnib suppressed tyrosine kinases FAK and EphA2 with reduction in downstream signaling. Follow-up pharmacologic and gene-silencing techniques demonstrated that dual FAK and EphA2 inhibition additively reduces PI3K\/Akt and MAPK\/ERK cell survival signaling to levels conferring PARPi sensitivity. Additionally, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach on tumor size reduction was assessed in HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, with combination treatment inducing tumor regression more effectively than either agent alone.

In the situation of HR deficiency, DNA polymerase theta (Pol&#952;) mediated microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is up-regulated to serve as a backup pathway for DSB repair. Several studies have proved that the inhibition of Pol&#952; causes synthetic lethality with HR deficiency, and Pol&#952; emerges as a potential DNA damage repair (DDR) target for the treatment of HR deficient tumors. In addition, there is evidence showing that the depletion of Pol&#952; improves the sensitivity of some other DDR-related targeted therapies, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Here we identify a novel small molecular Pol&#952; inhibitor, ZM-2311, which inhibits Pol&#952; activity with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 24 nM, and strongly inhibits cellular MMEJ pathway with a single nanomolar IC<sub>50.<\/sub> ZM-2311 illustrates a robust potency against tumor growth in a MDA-MB-436 SHLD2-\/- xenograft model, suggesting potential monotherapy application in BRCA1 mutation patients with TP53BP1\/Shieldin complex deficiency. Besides monotherapy, ZM-2311 elicits strong synergetic anti-proliferation activities in combination with PARP inhibitors on BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> DLD-1 and endogenous HR deficient tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Tumor regression is observed even at a low dosage, indicating a high potency of ZM-2311. As reversion mutation of HR genes such as BRCA1\/2 mediated by the MMEJ pathway is reported to be a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance, ZM-2311 is evaluated and demonstrates its potential to overcome the resistance to PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, the combination of ZM-2311 with other DDR agents, such as ATR inhibitors, induces fatal DNA damage to HR deficient cells. Considering a low risk of hematotoxicity of Pol&#952; inhibition, ZM-2311 may provide a new combination option for DDR agents. Besides, ZM-2311 was assessed in combination with different therapies respectively which functionally induce DNA damage, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. ZM-2311 renders tumor cells more sensitive to radiotherapy in both HR deficient cells and proficient cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, accompanying with the upregulation of Pol&#952; expression after radiotherapy and an enhanced phosphorylation level of H2AX in the combination treatment. Similarly, ZM-2311 also achieves a robust synergetic effect in combination with chemotherapy in cell lines with different HR statuses. These results indicate a potential application expansion of ZM-2311 to HR-proficient tumors, which is expected to bring better efficacy and reduced hematotoxicity. Taken together, ZM-2311 has proved to be a highly potent Pol&#952; inhibitor and has promising combination potential with multiple therapy strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,DNA Polymerase Theta,Synthetic lethality,Homologous Recombination Deficiency,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Here, we identified a highly potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, SY-7021, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 0.242 nM on DNA-PK kinase and high selectivity on ATM and ATR (greater than 400-fold) in biochemical assays. In a reporter assay for NHEJ repair, SY-7021 was able to dose-dependently reduce cellular NHEJ efficiency. Functionally, SY-7021 inhibited cell proliferation in multiple cancer cell lines alone or combined with doxorubicin. Basically, combination of SY-7021 and doxorubicin induced significant G2\/M phase arrest and cell apoptosis, as well as enhanced the phosphorylation on Ser139 of &#947;H2AX, Tyrosine 68 of CHK2 and Serine15 of p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells. In a subcutaneous NCI-H1703 xenograft tumor model, SY-7021 administered orally twice daily achieved dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i>, with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 105.6% at 60 mg\/kg and no significant weight loss was observed. In addition, SY-7021 demonstrates good PK properties and acceptable safety profiles in <i>in vivo <\/i>studies. Collectively, SY-7021, a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, shows significant inhibition on tumor growth in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, providing a rationale treatment for multiple tumors in monotherapy or in combination with other agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA-PK,Nonhomologous end joining,DNA damage response,Small molecular new agent,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"K.
