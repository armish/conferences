[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction<\/b><b><\/b> Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer whose incidence has been rising dramatically over the last few decades. The advent of Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has strongly improved the survival of melanoma patients. However, a high fraction of patients shows primary resistance or will develop secondary resistance during therapy. For these reasons, it is of utmost importance to develop biomarkers that could predict response or resistance to therapies. Among the most promising biomarkers analyzed in peripheral blood there are circulating microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of this study is to identify a miRNA signature able to predict prognosis and clinical relapse in advanced melanoma patients treated with ICIs.<br \/><b>Methodology<\/b> We collected longitudinal blood draws from metastatic melanoma patients treated with ICIs at Bologna University-Hospital (Italy). We separated plasma from whole blood, extracted RNA and determined the absolute levels of miR-155-5p, miR-424-5p and miR-320a using EvaGreen-based droplet digital PCR. Moreover, in the subset of first-line anti-PD-1 treated patients, we performed cytofluorimetric leukocyte analysis.<br \/><b>Results and discussion<\/b> We found that patients with pre-therapy (baseline) high expression of circulating miR-155-5p, miR-320a and mir-424-5p had longer progression-free survival (PFS), and overall-survival (OS). In patients treated with anti PD-1 as first-line treatment, we found that baseline miR-155-5p levels were significantly higher in patients who responded to therapy, and therefore miR-155-5p could have a predictive value. Moreover, using a flow cytometric approach, we noted that baseline miR-155-5p levels correlated with CD4+Na&#239;ve (r:-0.91, p:0.027) and CD4+PD1+ T-cells (r:0.94, p:0.015) in patients treated with first-line anti-PD-1 treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> These preliminary findings propose baseline circulating miRNAs as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers in the setting of advanced melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

There is a desperate need to discover novel ways of treating PC since a large proportion of patients do not benefit from therapy and experience significant toxicity. A major cause of therapy failure is therapy resistance due to tumor heterogeneity. Nowadays, a deeper understanding of tumor heterogeneity could be assisted by the use of patients-derived organoids (PDOs). Furthermore, the use of liquid biopsy may allow for the investigation of circulating factors with predictive value and for disease monitoring over time.<br \/>Methods: Patients were enrolled in the comprehensive, multiomic study of pancreatic cancer CONTAINER. Patients with early stage PC treated with preoperative chemotherapy or undergoing surgery first were selected for the present study. When possible, a surgical specimen was collected to obtain PDOs. Tissue from resected tumors was dissociated by GentleMACS<sup>TM<\/sup> dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), fragments were embedded in Matrigel<sup>TM<\/sup>and cultured in PancreaCult<sup>TM<\/sup> human Organoid Media (stemcell technologies). PDO histological features were investigated by H&#38;E staining and IHC. Blood samples were collected before and one month after surgery. From blood samples circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were enriched and isolated, extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from plasma with size-exclusion chromatography and their concentration and size distribution was evaluated with NanoSight NS300. Then, EV surface antigens were characterized by flow cytometry. A panel of inflammatory cytokines was finally evaluated through Ella Automated Immunoassay System.<br \/>Results: In CONTAINER study 113 patients were enrolled and 30 of them underwent surgery. 21 surgical specimens were received from which 18 PDOs were successfully established. EVs with diameter &#8805; 70nm were isolated from plasma, EV mean size was similar before and after surgery whereas individual variations in particle concentration and in surface antigen exposure were observed. Correlation with clinical and pathological characteristics of patients will be performed once reached an adequate sample size for statistical analyses. A panel of inflammatory cytokines (IL1&#946;-, IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL6, IL8, TGF&#946;1, CRP and Leptin) was assessed in plasma samples obtained before and after surgery. Except for IL1&#946;, a significant individual variation of circulating cytokines before and after surgery was observed. Conclusions: This study will contribute to unveil mechanisms of disease progression and drug resistance in PC. Possible predictive factors and mechanisms of drug resistance will be investigated taking advantage of the information derived from both in vitro models and circulating tumor-related entities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Organoids,Biomarkers,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

We aim to investigate the association of tumor transcriptional identity with clinical outcomes in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We used consensus classification to derive unsupervised transcriptionally distinct clusters in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC from the TCGA (N= 44). Then, we built a predictive model using extreme-gradient boosting to (1) classify an additional 88 surgically resected tumors from the LCCS study and analyzed for overall survival (OS) prediction; (2) classify metastatic <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC from the RELAY trial with available RNAseq data (N = 106) and analyzed for progression-free survival (PFS) with erlotinib treatment.<br \/>Results: Consensus clustering revealed two distinct clusters, one associated with more lineage-preserving features and one with more lineage-independent features that could transcriptionally distinguish <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer. No differences in primary <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations were detected across the two clusters. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed TGFB1 as the most significantly enriched pathway in the lineage-independent cluster which was also significantly more mesenchymal (p = 0.0028). For surgically resectioned <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant NSCLC, OS was consistently shorter in the lineage-independent cluster for TCGA (23.6 vs 58.3 mo; <i>p<\/i> = 0.049; HR = 0.4) and the LCCS cohort (55.7 vs not-reached; <i>p<\/i> = 0.0073; HR = 0.27). In the metastatic setting with erlotinib treatment, there was a trend for PFS to be shorter in the lineage-independent cluster (15.2 vs 19.4 mo; <i>p<\/i> = 0.12; HR = 0.61).<br \/>Conclusions: Transcriptional identity in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer are prognostic of clinical outcome. The lineage-independent tumors have inferior benefit to EGFR TKI as well as inferior OS, indicating that transcriptional biomarkers can be independent of oncogene biomarkers. These transcriptional biomarkers may help identify pts with poor outcome for future intensification of therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,EGFR,Transcription,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, there are currently no molecular biomarkers to guide their use. Septins, a class of small GTPases, interact with both microtubules and actin to functionally link these cytoskeletal components and regulate cell biological processes shown to be critical for the invasion and migration of cancer cells. In particular, septin 9 (SEPT9) directly interacts directly with microtubules through an N-terminal domain on the longest isoform, SEPT9i1, which is sufficient to promote migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We hypothesized that the relative expression of septin9 isoforms in breast tumors could play a role in their response to treatment with microtubule-targeted chemotherapy, particularly in the metastatic setting. A retrospective investigation of the relationship between septin expression and response to taxane chemotherapy was conducted utilizing full transcriptome sequencing data from biopsies of 75 breast cancer patients treated at our NCI-Designated Mays Cancer Center who received molecular profiling through Caris Life Sciences. Levels of total SEPT9 expression as well as the expression of specific variants that encode mechanistically distinct septin9 isoforms, SEPT9v1, v2, and v3, were determined for each sample and correlated with demographic, treatment, and outcome data for these patients. The oncogenic sept9_v1 variant (which produces the septin9_i1 isoform) was detected in over half of tumors and those with the highest total septin9 expression also expressed significantly higher levels of this isoform. Strikingly, the expression of total septin9, as well as the v3 variant, was significantly increased in taxane-treated patients who survived over a year after diagnosis with metastatic breast cancer, suggesting that septin9 expression could be a molecular correlate of response to taxane chemotherapy. We found that the expression of total septin9 and its variants was not significantly correlated with race, ethnicity, or cancer type suggesting that our findings would apply to our patient population as a whole, which is over 50% Hispanic. These data were used to support an ongoing prospective study to determine effect of septin expression on response to taxane chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and determine the effect of taxane treatment on septin expression by comparing samples pre and post treatment. Together this work supports our overall goal of identifying predictive biomarkers to facilitate the use of microtubule targeted chemotherapy in a more personalized manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Breast cancer,Taxanes,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Challenges in NSCLC molecular testing include the need for assessment of multiple variants in both DNA and RNA, samples are often small specimens, cost, and clinical need for rapid turn-around time when patients are deteriorating and require timely treatment initiation. ASPYRE-Lung detects a targeted panel of 114 actionable genomic variants across 11 genes, covering NCCN treatment guideline-recommended biomarkers for samples that are associated with NSCLC. The assay simultaneously analyzes DNA and RNA with inputs of only 20 ng and 6 ng respectively. ASPYRE-Lung is easily adoptable by standard clinical laboratories, requiring only PCR and qPCR thermocyclers, with no specialist bioinformatics skills required for analysis and a run time of 2 days from specimen to result. We established the assay at two external sites and Biofidelity laboratories, with multiple operators at each site. We first determined that the assay had acceptable performance at each site, using a panel of contrived control samples. We then examined 56 matched DNA and RNA samples extracted from clinical FFPE lung tissue specimens. We also tested 29 unmatched samples derived from FFPE tissue (13), fine needle aspirate (FNA, 4), FNA rinse (5), peritoneal fluid (1), pleural effusion (1), pleural fluid (1) and fresh tissue (4), at all 3 sites. Data were analyzed using a simple cloud-based turnkey analysis solution. All samples yielded valid results across all runs. We assessed reproducibility (inter-run precision) using all 85 clinical samples, across new and experienced users, achieving a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 99.99%. We then assessed concordance with NGS results, investigating any discrepancies. The 69 FFPE tissue-derived samples (56 matched DNA\/RNA, 7 unmatched DNA, and 6 TNA) had PPA 96.55% and NPA 99.98%. The 16 cytopathology-derived samples had PPA 100% and NPA 99.96%. Together, these results demonstrate high concordance of ASPYRE-Lung and NGS across different types of clinical samples, alongside ease of adoption of the ASPYRE-Lung assay with simple training and no specialist expertise required.

Its role as a prognostic or predictive marker is cancer-type dependent. Recently, there has been renewed interest in assessing this biomarker since it plays a critical role as a target for radiotherapeutics (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy - PRRT) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Blood-based liquid biopsies are a non-invasive tool with proven effectiveness in characterizing cancer biomarker expression in patients. In this study, we describe the development and validation of a novel assay to analyze circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for expression of SSTR2 using the RareCyte platform.<br \/><i>Experimental Procedures: <\/i>Using AccuCyte&#174;, an unbiased density-based method for collecting nucleated cells from whole blood, we transferred nucleated cells to slides and stained for SSTR2, CD45, and CK\/EpCAM to identify CTCs (CK+\/EpCAM+, CD45-), and evaluate SSTR2 expression. Slides were imaged with CyteFinder&#174;, an automated multiparameter immunofluorescent (IF) microscopy system that applies machine learning algorithms for rare cell identification. Both clinical and spike-in samples were used for assay validation. Single-cell SSTR2 mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) were analyzed to determine protein expression levels. Colorectal cancer with neuroendocrine features and Merkel cell cancer (neuroendocrine tumor of the skin) patient samples were evaluated for CTC enumeration and SSTR2 expression.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>The assay&#8217;s performance metrics for SSTR2 expression were 90+% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, 100% specificity with repeatability and intermediate precision CVs of 14.4% and 16.4%, respectively. A small cohort of colorectal cancer (1) and Merkel cell cancer (2) patient blood samples were tested using the assay. All 3 patients had high CTC levels (300+ per 7.5 mL). The percentage of SSTR2-positive CTCs ranged from 20-60%, reflective of tumor heterogeneity.<br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>SSTR2 is an important target now in the advent of theranostics - PRRT. Prognostic and therapeutic implications of SSTR2 expression is an area of active clinical research. SSTR2 targeted therapeutics like 177Lu-dotatate illustrate the possible utility of SSTR2 as a predictive biomarker of treatment response. To date, most of the work has been focused on assessing SSTR2 on tissue. Herein, we show how a CTC platform can be adapted to assess a clinically relevant cell surface protein biomarker. This is now included as an important correlative in a clinical trial for Merkel Cell Cancer patients called iPRRT that is actively accruing (NCT05583708).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor cells,Neuroendocrine tumors,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

However, nearly 50% of patients exhibit drug resistance. Therefore, biomarkers that predict CDK4\/6i response are needed to spare patients from toxicities and high costs. Resistance to CDK4\/6i [palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib] is associated with the aberrant or loss of Retinoblastoma (Rb). A decline in phospho-Rb (pRb) levels on therapy is also associated with CDK4\/6i response. We aimed to develop a multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) assay to assess Rb and pRb levels that can be used on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to predict tumor response to CDK4\/6i. Here, we report the selection of internal controls for Rb and pRb, assay repeatability and reproducibility, as well as compatibility of the CTC isolation protocol with the assay.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Rb and pRb expression was evaluated by western blotting (WB) and IF in parental (P), estrogen deprivation-resistant (EDR), palbociclib-resistant (PalboR), and EDR\/PalboR derivatives of two HR+\/HER2- cell lines (MCF7 and T47D), Rb1 KO cells of MCF7 and T47D, as well as triple-negative cell lines, BT549 and MDA-MB-468. IF-stained cells were imaged using Leica STED SP8 confocal microscope and Zeiss Axioscan 7. The concordance between IF and WB results was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot. Selectivity and specificity of the assay as well as repeatability and reproducibility between investigators were also assessed. Blood from healthy subjects was used to test the compatibility of the ScreenCell&#174; filtration system to isolate CTC with the IF assay.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Our initial approach utilized indirect IF staining for Rb and pRb using the same primary antibodies as WB. On the Bland-Altman plot, most data points were relatively close to the bias line, suggesting that the difference between the two methods was acceptable. The analytical range for mean Rb and pRb staining intensity was 0.744 - 46.779 and 1.001 - 52.919, respectively. Based on WB and IF data, we nominated T47D PalboR and MDA-MB-468 cells as negative controls for Rb and pRb expression. The selectivity and specificity were 100% and 70%, respectively, for the Rb expression and 99% and 61% for pRb, respectively. The IF assay was repeatable and reproducible between two investigators. The ScreenCell&#174; CTC isolation method was not compatible with the assay, as Rb and pRb expression was either not detected or limited when processed using FC2 or PBTFC buffer, irrespective of the antigen retrieval.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We have selected internal cell line controls for Rb and pRb and are in the process of optimizing signal-to-noise ratio and specificity using conjugated antibodies. We are also testing the compatibility of other CTC isolation methods with the IF assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Predictive biomarkers,Circulating tumor cells,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Physician demographics, practice characteristics, barriers (reimbursement, knowledge, logistics), and approaches to alleviate barriers were collected. Quotas were put in place to ensure a distribution of diverse physician characteristics such as academic affiliations, geography, TMB use, etc. Descriptive analysis was conducted via SASv9.4.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> Three hundred physicians participated (47.6 mean years of age and 15.2 mean years in clinical practice on average; 50% medical oncologists, 31% surgical oncologists, and 19% gynecologic oncologists). Ninety percent of respondents reported using TMB testing. The most common barrier to TMB testing use was test turnaround time (All: 74.3%; TMB users: 72.3%; non-TMB users: 93.1%). Other commonly reported barriers included unawareness of corresponding therapy and\/or clinical trials that may benefit a patient with mutation (All: 68.3%; users: 66.1%; non-users: 89.7%), obtaining prior authorizations (All: 65.7%; users: 62.7%; non-users: 93.1%), and difficulty obtaining a biopsy for testing (All: 57.3%; users: 57.6%, non-users: 55.2%).

We investigated genetic and transcriptional correlates of outcomes in an exploratory biomarker analysis of COLUMBUS Parts 1 and 2.<br \/>Methods: In Part 1, 577 pts were randomized 1:1:1 to enco 450 mg QD + bini 45 mg BID, enco 300 mg QD, or vemu 960 mg BID; in Part 2, 344 pts were randomized 3:1 to enco 300 mg QD + bini 45 mg BID or enco 300 mg QD. Baseline tumor samples were analyzed using the ACE ImmunoID NeXT whole exome sequencing\/whole transcriptome sequencing (WES\/WTS) assays (Personalis). PFS and OS were analyzed (cutoff: Jan 13, 2023) by treatment arm and presence of specific genetic or transcriptomic alterations.<br \/>Results: Among treated pts, 668 had WES or WTS data. K-means clustering identified 3 major transcriptional clusters: (1) microphthalmia-associated transcription factor<i> <\/i>(<i>MITF<\/i>)-low (invasive dedifferentiated tumor cell phenotype), (2) <i>MITF<\/i>-high (proliferative melanocytic phenotype), and (3) immune-high. Cluster assignments were significantly associated with biopsy site (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001), with cluster 1 enriched in skin biopsies and cluster 3 in lymph node metastases; biopsy site-independent characteristics were also captured. Improved PFS with enco + bini vs vemu was most pronounced in cluster 3 (Table 1). <i>ERBB2<\/i> expression and <i>PI3KCA<\/i> pathway mutation, previously found to be associated with reduced survival benefit with enco + bini vs vemu, were enriched in clusters 1 and 2 vs cluster 3.<br \/>Conclusions: Enco + bini showed benefit across molecular subtypes in BRAF V600E\/K-mutant melanoma. The contribution of bini was most pronounced in the immune-high cluster. Improved outcomes in this cluster support ongoing trials of combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as STARBOARD and PORTSIDE.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{37A45665-6C98-44E7-B460-974987E032B8}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\"><b>Table 1.

Recent years have highlighted the role of ANGPTL3, PCSK9, ApoCIII and Lp(a) as key players in lipid metabolism. But circulating levels of these factors in ovarian cancers have not been thoroughly investigated to date.<br \/>Objective: We assessed the profiles of plasma ANGPTL3, PCSK9, ApoCIII and Lp(a) in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC).<br \/>Methods: Plasma samples collected from women diagnosed with an HGSC (n=31) or a benign ovarian lesion (BOL, n=40) were analyzed for plasma lipid profile (ApoB, total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, Lp(a) levels) on a clinical modular platform (Roche). ApoCIII, ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 levels were measured with commercially-available ELISA kits. Differences between HGSC and BOL were assessed by two-group comparisons. Pairwise correlation strength between variables was evaluated with Spearman&#8217;s rank order tests. Logistic regression modelling was used to further examine the associations between selected variables and HGSC diagnoses.<br \/>Results: ANGPTL3 levels increased in HGSC (84.1 ng\/ml, SD=29.2ng\/ml, n=31) compared to BOL (66.9ng\/ml, SD=30.7 ng\/ml, n=40; HGSC <i>vs<\/i> BOL p=0.02). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggested that plasma ANGPTL3 levels were moderately associated with HGSC (AUC=67.7%, p=0.005 1) and did not increase predictive performance of ovarian tumor biomarkers CA125 and HE4 in multivariable model. Associations between ANGPTL3 levels and cholesterol (HDL, non-HDL, LDL and total) could be observed in the control group but not in the HGSC group. The same dissociation was observed for the inverse correlation between HDL and triglycerides in HGSC. Furthermore, moderate associations were observed between PCSK9 &#38; CA19-9 in the entire cohort (rho=0.34, n=53, p=0.013) and Lp(a) &#38; CA125 in HGSC cases (rho=0.51, p= 0.017).<br \/>Conclusion: In this cohort of 71 women, we report increased levels of ANGPTL3 in HGSC with an effect size (Cohen&#8217;s D) of 0.57. Confirmation of this result in larger cohort studies (minimal n&#62;50 in each group) would warrant further investigation into the roles of circulating ANGPTL3. Its inhibition may allow to tackle deregulated lipid metabolic pathways contributing to ovarian cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipids,Ovarian cancer,Biomarkers,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Moreover, there is evidence of patient benefit of carboplatin-based therapy in HR deficient (HRD) tumors. With a growing emphasis on HRD in cancer treatment, efforts have been made to define the HRD phenotype. Nonetheless, the current approaches employed in the clinic, such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), HRD score or RAD51 assays have significant limitations and their interpretation can be unclear.<br \/>To answer the need for a functional HR-specific biomarker, we have recently developed and introduced two new assays, called collectively dSTRIDE-HR. The assays are based on the STRIDE platform technology that enables direct and sensitive detection of single- or double-strand DNA breaks<i> in situ<\/i> in fixed cells. Novel dSTRIDE-HR explicitly detect double-strand DNA breaks localized in close proximity to RPA (dSTRIDE-RPA) or RAD51 (dSTRIDE-RAD51) proteins. The assays have been shown to be reliable reporters of HR activation in cellular models after exogenous DNA damage induction, yet their potential to predict HR status in an <i>in vivo<\/i> setting has not been tested so far.<br \/>To assess the suitability of the dSTRIDE-HR assays for determining the HR status of patients&#8217; tumor cells, we applied these assays in FFPE sections from biopsies derived from breast cancer patients with a different mutational status of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The assays showed low dSTRIDE-RPA and dSTRIDE-RAD51 readouts in BRCA1\/2 mutated tumors in comparison to wild type tumors, as well as a great concordance of readouts within a given genetic background. Additionally, the cell cycle analysis proved nearly twofold increase in foci numbers of dSTRIDE-RPA and dSTRIDE-RAD51 in G2\/S phase.<br \/>Our study unveils a potential of dSTRIDE-HR assays to become predictive biomarkers reporting on the status of HR repair in breast tumors, although more patient samples need to be tested to confirm initial findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Predictive biomarkers,DNA double-strand break repair genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody Mogamulizumab (Moga) has been shown to increase progression-free survival in patients with advanced SS. Here, we longitudinally explored the modulation of the expression of CD39, CD73 and CD38 in circulating CD4+ T cells from SS patients under treatment with Moga. Eight patients with relapsed\/refractory SS were included in the study and prospectively followed up for two years (median duration of treatment 9,5 months, range 5-28 months). Seven out of eight (87,5%) patients showed early complete response in the blood and partial (5\/7, 71,4%) or near complete response (2\/7, 28,6%) in the skin. One patient (12,5%) showed no blood or skin response to the treatment. Flow cytometry analysis highlighted that the clinical response was accompanied by a rapid and remarkable increase in CD38 expression in the residual circulating CD4+ T cells, as well as in CD8+ T cells. Moreover, in six patients carrying the homozygous G\/G or heterozygous A\/G <i>ENTPD1<\/i> SNP rs10748643 genotypes, permissive to CD39 overexpression in T cells, the increased CD38 expression was paralleled by rapid reduction\/loss of CD39. Notably, in one patient carrying the A\/A genotype, characterized by low CD39 and high CD73 expression at the baseline, response to treatment was characterized by reduction of CD73 expression. The only one patient with A\/A genotype who didn&#8217;t respond to Moga showed no modulation of CD38 or CD39 expression, while CD73 expression increased. Noteworthy, Moga increases the expression of CD38 in responding patients, and influences the expression of CD39 only in patients with the permissive CD39 genotypes (G\/G; A\/G), but not in those with the A\/A genotype. Two patients showing initial response to Moga experienced skin progression during treatment, which was associated with a significant increase of CD39 and simultaneous decrease of CD38 in residual circulating CD4+ T cells, although there was no evidence of blood relapse. These preliminary results suggest that partial or complete responses to Moga is paralleled by reduced CD39 and\/or CD73 expression and increased CD38 expression. Instead, an opposite modulation of these markers is associated with disease progression hinting at the potential clinical utility of CD38, CD39 and CD73 as markers to monitor patients' response to Moga therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD38,CD39,CD73,Cutaneous Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yuliya Yakymiv<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sara Marchisio<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Erika Ortolan<sup>1<\/sup>, Verdiana Pullano<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Leso<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Senetta<sup>2<\/sup>, Lorenzo Marega<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriele Roccuzzo<sup>1<\/sup>, Pietro Quaglino<sup>1<\/sup>, Ada Funaro<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"303c3847-5258-4fd3-bd50-5a9e90fd3636","ControlNumber":"4401","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, although the anti-PD1 cemiplimab showed to be a promising treatment option, future research focusing on the use of biomarkers to predict treatment response are needed. Since increasing number of studies has revealed the crucial roles of non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs and lncRNAs in the development of SCC, the present study had the purpose to explore the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks associated with response to anti-PD1. For this purpose the experimental procedure envisaged a preliminary in silico analysis followed by the investigation of identified miRNA and lncDNA in liquid biopsy.<br \/>Methods: For the in silico study, GSE139505 RNA-sequencing raw data have been retrieved from SRA, including 7 Healthy Samples and 9 cSCC biopsies. Two matrices have been prepared, including coding genes and lncRNAs. Normalized coding gene matrix have been used as input to perform GSEA. Coexpression analysis between lncRNAs and Core enrichment genes resulting from GSEA was performed. Biological network including validated miRNA-gene interactions (TarBase) and lncRNA-miRNA interactions (lncBase) has been built-up through Cytoscape. MCODE analysis to identify subnetwork with the closest relationships was performed. The quantification of identified miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-148a, miR-148b) and lnc (AF131217.1, RP11-362F19.1, PVT1, LINC00665) was performed in pre-therapy plasma samples of 34 cSCC patients, categorized according to clinical response to cemiplimab, in responders and non-responders. miRNA-specific RT primers were used for reverse transcription by ddPCR.<br \/>Results: The computational analysis revealed a significant enrichment of two gene sets related to immunotherapy, namely the Reactome_PD1_signaling and WP_Cancer_Immunotherapy_by_PD1_blockade. The coespression analyses highlighted more than 600 correlations gene-miRNA-lncRNA for the two above-mentioned genesets. CD4-miR-125a\/b and AF131217.1\/RP11-362F19.1 are strongly correlated for the first one; whilst, regarding the latter one, CD274\/HLA-A with mir-148a\/b and PVT1\/ LINC00665 and JUN with mir-125a\/b and AF131217.1\/RP11-362F19.1 were found. The validation in cSCC plasma samples evidenced the significant correlation between mir-148a\/b and PVT1\/LINC00665 and an higher expression of all miRNAs in responders respect to non-responders. The longitudinal study assessing the correlation between miRNA expression and response to cemiplimab is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: Preliminary analysis in pre-therapy plasma samples of cSCC validated the in silico data highlighting the inverse correlation between miR-148a\/b and lnc (PVT1 and LINC00665).

Based on their pathological responses to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT), patients were classified into &#8220;responder&#8221; and &#8220;non-responder&#8221; groups. All samples were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. Of note, samples from 14 patients in both groups were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing. We characterized and validated the changes in the immunological landscape of &#8220;responder&#8221; and &#8220;non-responder&#8221; groups using multi-omics sequencing data, multiplex immunofluorescence, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments. External validation cohorts of ESCC treated with NICT were analyzed &#65279;to validate the predictive biomarkers for NICT.<br \/>Results:&#65279; We found that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling was significantly higher in pre-treatment non-responders than in responders, and was inversely correlated with T cell proliferation and TCR expansion. TRAIL was mainly secreted by tumor cells and bound to its specific receptor DR5 in T cells, thereby inhibiting the activation of T cells. Functional co-culture experiments and T cell cytotoxicity assays revealed that TRAIL<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells mediated T cell suppression and caused CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, TRAIL inhibition could improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in &#65279;a xenografted mouse model. In bulk RNA-seq (n=40), TRAIL expression was associated with worse disease-free survival and overall survival, however, these results were not observed &#65279;&#65279;in the ESCC cohort treated with upfront surgery from the TCGA database, suggesting that the predictive value of TRAIL is specific to NICT. In an external validation cohort of ESCC patients treated with NICT (n=81), multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that high TRAIL expression was an independent risk factor for unfavorable outcomes. Importantly, TRAIL expression exhibited a higher accuracy in predicting NICT response compared with PD-L1 expression in ESCC (AUC of ROC curves: 0.886 vs 0.607, respectively P&#60;0.001). Meanwhile, the serum concentrations of TRAIL (measured by ELISA) in pre-NICT ESCC patients were also significantly higher in non-responders (n=58).<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>TRAIL expression in tumor cells is negatively correlated with the response of ESCC to NICT.

There is a clinical need for an effective biomarker to select patients for cancer treatment. A promising biomarker for treatment efficacy is response testing on patient-derived organoids (PDOs). For metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), larger prospective studies are needed to evaluate the predictive value of standardized PDO screens.<br \/>Methods: OPTIC is an ongoing prospective multicenter trial (NL61668.041.17, started 2018) that will evaluate the value of tumor PDOs in therapy response prediction. We establish PDOs for mCRC patients from newly obtained biopsies, prior to the start of treatment. We compare PDO sensitivity (area under drug response curve) with patient response measured by changes in biopsied metastatic lesion size on CT scans. Secondary outcome measures are RECIST response and progression-free survival. We evaluate the feasibility of using PDOs as a biomarker by examining drug screen availability in a clinically relevant timeframe of 4 weeks. From 2020 onwards, we incorporated whole genome sequencing (WGS) on fresh-frozen biopsies to correlate drug response in vitro and in vivo, to genetic tumor characteristics. Additionally, PDO screens with experimental drugs based on genetic alterations identified by WGS could be performed. Trial inclusion will continue until 85 PDOs from clinically evaluable patients for standard of care (SOC) treatment are established, with expected completion in Q1 2024.<br \/>Results: Currently, 206 patients were included in 5 hospitals and 180 biopsies were taken. PDO establishment success gradually increased from 22% in 2018-2020 to 75% in 2023, yielding an overall success rate of 50% (n=84 PDOs and 13 in culture). Critical factors in optimizing culture success were replacement of several growth factors in the culture medium, reducing time to processing and more frequent handling of biopsies. We have established PDOs for comparing with patient response for the following treatment categories: 5-fluorouracil (n=4), CAPOX\/FOLFOX (n=23), irinotecan\/FOLFIRI (n=11), FOLFOXIRI (n=12), trifluridine\/tipiracil (n=14), panitumumab (n=14), encorafenib-cetuximab (n=2), non-SOC drugs (n=4). We have successfully screened the first 8 PDOs in consistent technical triplicates and biological duplicates (R&#60;0.88, p&#60;0.02). WGS succeeded in 76% (n=75), primarily failing when tumor percentage was &#60;20%.<br \/>Conclusion: We improved PDO establishment success to 75% which is essential to facilitate the implementation of PDOs in clinical treatment. OPTIC will enhance the clinical application of PDOs by defining thresholds for PDO sensitivity and analyzing the diagnostic power for different treatments. To enable personalized treatment in clinical practice, PDO screening should guide mCRC treatment and result in enhanced chance of response and reduced over- and mistreatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Biomarkers,Colorectal cancer,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Black African Americans (BAA) have 20% increased incidence of PDAC compared to those with European Ancestry (EA). TIGIT, an immune checkpoint receptor, is a marker of T cell exhaustion and plays a key role in the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. Recent studies have demonstrated that immune checkpoint receptor expression (PD-1 and TIGIT) on specific T cell populations correlates to worse overall survival (OS). TIGIT inhibitors are being explored in clinical trials in pancreatic cancer due to implications of its ligand (CD155) promoting immune evasion. We hypothesize that targeted anti-TIGIT therapy, in conjunction with other therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment, could reverse the immune suppression that is characteristic of PDAC. We performed RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) with a probe specific for human TIGIT mRNA (combined with a nuclear counterstain) on 79 tissue samples. The cohort of tissue samples included 8 biopsies (endoscopic-guided fine needle biopsies at time of diagnosis), 66 primary (from surgical resection), and 5 metastatic (liver core biopsies from patients with a primary PDAC diagnosis) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from patients with histologically confirmed PDAC. After cells were segmented based on nuclear recognition, the presence of TIGIT probe within the cytoplasm of each cell was determined and quantified. Percent positive cell values were then exported for statistical analysis in R. De-identified clinical metadata was obtained from REDCap, a cloud-based HIPAA-compliant database used to compile patient data for research purposes. We tested for associations between %TIGIT present and clinical covariates, using linear regression for continuous outcomes, and logistic regression for binary outcomes. ScRNAseq revealed that TIGIT mRNA is enriched in, but not exclusive to the T\/NK cellular compartments in PDAC. Staining analysis showed that TIGIT expression did not differ significantly between racial groups (comparing BAA to non-BAA). The mean percentage of TIGIT positive cells was 64.0%. High expression of TIGIT was associated with clinical stage, where an increase in stage was associated with increasing %TIGIT (p &#60; 0.05).The TIGIT biomarker assay can be conducted at time of diagnosis, time of surgical resection, and time of metastatic biopsy. If patients&#8217; samples contain high levels of TIGIT expression, these patients may be candidates for anti-TIGIT drug therapy. Considering that TIGIT expression correlates with advancing clinical stage, patients with more advanced staging at diagnosis (stage IIB, III, IV) especially may benefit from anti-TIGIT therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,TIGIT,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

While genomics-based biomarkers have demonstrated significant progress, they are not universally applicable, with most patients still treated using clinical guidelines.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures<\/b>: We have previously demonstrated broad clinical applicability of a functional precision medicine (FPM) workflow that incorporates high-resolution measurements of single-cell mass changes in response to drugs. As a highly integrative biomarker of cellular state, mass change serves as a rapid and mechanism agnostic readout of drug response, demonstrating an ability to detect signal from over 100 different cytotoxic and targeted therapies within 24 hours of treatment <i>ex vivo<\/i>. As a single-cell assay that requires as few as 10,000 cells to assess drug response, this method does not require any <i>ex vivo<\/i> culture for cell expansion and is compatible with a range of clinically relevant tissue specimen formats. Together, these features have enabled this mass response framework to be implemented in a CLIA-certified laboratory with a reporting turnaround time of just two days.<br \/><b>Summary of the new, unpublished data<\/b>: Having previously shown that mass response testing is compatible with various solid tumor specimen formats such as malignant fluids, core biopsies and fine needle aspirates, here we present preliminary results that demonstrate compatibility with surgically resected tissue specimens. Specifically, we demonstrate that mass response testing results correlate with clinical response across of broad array of solid tumors. In our cohort of 24 patients, we found that mass response measurements correlated with clinical response to therapy with an accuracy of 83% (OR=19.66, P=0.003). Within this group, we also found clear examples of how mass response testing can serve as a valuable complement to existing genomic approaches to guide therapy. Importantly, we demonstrate both concordant and discrepant results using small molecule inhibitors in the setting of known biomarkers of response, highlighting the need for functional testing in precision cancer medicine.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: These results support that mass response testing is feasible and broadly applicable to solid tumor malignancies and may serve as a valuable complementary readout for informing therapeutic selection for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Predictive biomarkers,Microfluidics,Functional precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

However, its development was halted due in part to toxicity in a Phase 3 study. We have built a flow cytometry-based, high-throughput predictive precision medicine platform to forecast clinical responses to various treatments. Here, we present our design plan for a Phase 2a clinical trial with volasertib in relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) AML using a modified protocol to reduce toxicity and the development of a companion diagnostic to predict responders in a follow-up Phase 2b study.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>We will initiate an open-label clinical trial in AML with volasertib in venetoclax-hypomethylating agent (HMA) R\/R patients while co-developing a companion diagnostic to selectively enroll predicted responders in a follow-up, Phase 2b, study. Primary and secondary objectives will focus on efficacy\/safety of intravenous volasertib and <i>ex vivo<\/i> responses, respectively. To reduce the toxicity seen in the Phase 3 study, specific strategies like tailored dosing will be implemented. To develop the clinical trial assay, peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were collected from AML patients and treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> with volasertib for 3 days. Surviving blast cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. Using a dynamic separation model restricted to the 35% most sensitive samples, we estimated optimal blast cutoffs for volasertib sensitivity.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> In single-agent experiments with 41 primary AML samples (31 de novo, 9 R\/R, 1 with disease status unclear), we observed dose-response profiles consistent with volasertib&#8217;s role as a cell cycle inhibitor. Irrespective of the disease status, median and mean EC<sub>50<\/sub> values were about 10 nM (1<sup>st<\/sup>-3<sup>rd<\/sup> quartile from 7-12 nM). To identify an optimal concentration of volasertib for patient stratification, we compared the <i>ex vivo<\/i> resistant blast fractions at each concentration with the areas under the dose-response curves (AUCs), assuming that in our case, AUCs most accurately reflect clinical responses. At 31.6 and 100 nM, the Pearson correlation coefficients were highest (r &#62; 0.8), suggesting that these are optimal stratifying doses. With these concentrations and corresponding blast cutoff values, 32-33% of the de novo and 25% of the R\/R patients would have been predicted to be responders were they given volasertib, assuming a positive predictive value of 100%.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>Volasertib&#8217;s EC<sub>50<\/sub> values clustered within a narrow range, suggesting that EC<sub>50<\/sub> may not be a suitable metric to stratify patients into responders and nonresponders, in contrast to AUCs and residual blast fractions at 31.6 and 100 nM of volasertib, which displayed more heterogeneous distributions.

SKYSCRAPER-04 (NCT04300647) explored the clinical activity of Tiragolumab (T, anti-TIGIT) plus atezolizumab (A, anti-PD-L1) dual blockade (T+A) in patients (pts) with PD-L1+ cervical cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the histological, transcriptomic and genomic TME biomarkers associated with both immune checkpoint blockade (ICB: combined A and A+T arms) and predictive of T clinical outcome.<br \/>Methods: FFPE tumor biopsies were collected from patients with recurrent\/persistent PD-L1+ cervical cancer (n=171). Samples were tested for PD-L1 (high [TAP &#8805;10%] vs low [TAP 5-9%]), stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL by H&#38;E, n=168), immune phenotypes (inflamed, excluded, desert) and total CD8 T cells by CD8\/PanCK dual IHC (n=163), TIGIT IHC (n=166), tumor DNA NGS panel (FoundationOne CDx, n=95), and RNA sequencing (RNA Access, n=168) for biological pathways. Biomarker association with outcome was performed with chi-squared test for ORR and Cox-regression analysis for PFS and OS. Analyses are not adjusted for multiple testing.<br \/>Results: Biomarkers associated with PD-L1 and TIGIT biology were evaluated for association to clinical outcome in ICB or T analysis. Pts with PD-L1 high tumors had higher ORR and longer PFS and OS, while IFNg\/IFNa pathways (RNA) were associated with higher ORR and TIGIT IHC was only associated with longer ICB OS. In contrast, RNA signatures of highly proliferative tumors were negatively associated with ICB ORR. sTILs (IHC) and PVR (RNA) were numerically linked to higher ORR, PFS and OS in T+A vs A arms. The subgroup of patients analyzed for genomic profile (55% of randomized population) showed that TMB high (&#8805;10 mut\/Mb; 26% of pts) had higher ORR for ICB and numerically longer PFS and OS than TMB low (&#60;10 mut\/Mb). Mutations (mut) of activated <i>PTEN\/PIK3CA\/AKT<\/i> pathway was the most prevalent feature (52%) and pts with <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mut had higher ICB ORR, PFS and OS.<br \/>Conclusions: This exploratory analysis suggests that increased tumor immunity and mutation burden (TMB and <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mut) correlates with improved ICB clinical outcomes. No biomarkers were clearly associated with tiragolumab outcome.

These include inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of the immune system. At AACR 2017 we presented a small, proof-of-concept, multiplex analysis of 14 cytokines specifically chosen by their association with activation of the immune system. The 14 cytokines were evaluated in 31 out of 38 patients with advanced refractory gastrointestinal tumors, enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of metronomic UFT (a 5-fluorouracil prodrug; 100 mg\/twice per day p.o.) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg\/mq2 i.v. bolus on day 1 and then 50 mg\/day p.o.) plus celecoxib (200 mg\/twice a day p.o.); the Italian COMET trial (Clinical Trial ID NCT02926911; Allegrini et al. Angiogenesis 2012: 15(2):275-86). We evaluated baseline (day 0) plasma levels with levels at days 28 and 56, and tested for correlations with observed Progression Free Survival, which we then reported (Valenzuela et al. Clin Exp Med. 2021: 21(1):149-159). We now present a comprehensive analysis of 75 cytokines in 34 of the 38 patients. Furthermore we extend the analysis to include baseline (day 0), days 28 and 56, and days 84 and 112 of the COMET trial, and we also correlated specific cytokines levels with Overall Survival. After an estimation of optimal cut-off points of plasma levels of the cytokines, survival analysis was performed, and log-rank tests and cox regression analyses were applied. We show that pre-treatment plasma level &#60;435.46pg\/ml of macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), was a predictive marker for those patients with better progression-free survival at 3 and 6 months (log-rank test p=0.0046; Cox regression analysis p=0.016). Moreover, baseline plasma levels of three cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (MCP-4) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), were associated with an improved overall survival. MCP-2 values &#62;26.21pg\/ml (log-rank test p=0.0012; Cox regression analysis p=0.007), MCP-4 &#62;72.97pg\/ml (log-rank test p=0.012; Cox regression analysis p=0.019) and TRAIL &#62;60.73pg\/ml (log-rank test p=0.0059; Cox regression analysis p=0.011) were predictive markers for subjects with a better overall survival at 6 and 9 months. These results indicate that a methodology based on the detection of optimal cut-off points and survival analysis allowed the selection of potential biomarkers, such as MDC or MCPs. We propose that the systematic use of these statistical strategies, aimed at detecting potential biomarkers, could help to identify those patients that are likely to benefit from metronomic chemotherapy schedules. This would allow the stratification of such patients for future metronomic chemotherapy trials, and the potential identification of patients that should instead be offered alternative therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: other,Biomarkers,Cytokines,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

These two major oncogenic targets in the tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME) play a key role in drug resistance, particularly to EGFR inhibitors. Previously, we demonstrated synergistic effect of NT219 and cetuximab in multiple SCCHN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. HPV-negative R\/M SCCHN patients have poor survival and demonstrate IGF1R\/IRS and STAT3 upregulation. We report biomarker results from dose escalation of NT219 in combination with cetuximab in patients (pts) with immunotherapy-refractory R\/M SCCHN (NCT04474470).<br \/><b>Method<\/b><b>. <\/b>Biopsies from 11 enrolled SCCHN patients treated with different dose levels of NT219 (6, 12, 24 and 50 mg\/kg) were obtained and evaluated using Immunohistochemistry and pathological analysis. Evaluation of potential biomarkers included measurements of IRS1\/2 levels, as well as IGF1R and STAT3 phosphorylation (pIGF1R, pSTAT3) in tissue biopsies, and H-score was defined for tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells, and fibroblasts in the TME. Membrane completeness (mc) parameter was included in pIGF1R scoring.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> NT219 Cmax and AUC demonstrated a dose dependent increase, with 50mg\/kg dose mean human AUC reaching Human Equivalent Dose efficacy of animal models. Indeed, at this dose, anti-tumor activity in humans was also demonstrated with 2 confirmed partial responses (PR) reported. At the 50 mg\/kg NT219 dose, out of 4 SCCHN pts, for whom pre-treatment biopsies were available, 3 were HPV negative and 2 of them achieved PR. Pretreatment biopsies of these 2 pts demonstrated high activated IGF1R membranal staining (Avg. mcH-score: 285, p-value:) and high activated STAT3 nuclear staining (Avg. H-score: 285), in contrast to the non-responding SCCHN pts (30 and 33, with p-value 0.017, 0.004 respectively). Inhibition of intratumoral IGF1R\/IRS and STAT3 was demonstrated in on-treatment biopsies. Analysis will be presented at the conference.<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>NT219 in combination with cetuximab demonstrated safety and early activity with 2 confirmed PRs at 50mg\/kg dose level in R\/M SCCHN pts. This dose level was the first dose at which the observed NT219 exposure was within the range of the efficacious dose levels in pre-clinical models. Detection of activated IGF1R and STAT3 in responding pts, compared to the non-responding pts, suggests a potential use of these targets as biomarkers for future patient selection. This notion is further substantiated by the demonstration of NT219 on-target effects in on-treatment tumor biopsies. Upregulation of NT219 targets, IGF1R and STAT3, in HPV-negative SCCHN pts and their response to the NT219+cetuximab treatment, support further evaluation of this patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to this treatment and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events varies widely. There is an urgent need for robust predictive biomarkers for ICI response to identify patients with likely clinical benefit from this costly treatment. Several biomarkers, aimed at predicting response to ICI, have been proposed, including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells in the tumor, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and expression of various immune gene signatures. However, these individual biomarkers have suboptimal performance and multiple complementary omics technologies are required to properly quantify them. Integration of these multi-omic biomarkers has proven valuable in increasing the accuracy and robustness of ICI response prediction.We have developed a computational pipeline that determines the expressed mutation burden (eTMB), MSI status, fraction of infiltrating immune cells and various immune gene expression signatures directly from the RNA-sequencing profile of the tumor. Each biomarker is quantified using a dedicated algorithm that applies machine learning (eTMB and MSI) or computational deconvolution (infiltrating immune cells) and integrates external data sources to maximize performance. Algorithm performance has been validated on large cohorts of tumor RNA-sequencing data with matching gold standard quantification of said biomarkers.<br \/>As a proof of concept, we applied our pipeline to tumor RNA-sequencing data of 45 gastric cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab. Responders showed significantly higher eTMB scores and were enriched among the MSI-H patients. Fractions of CD8 T-cells and M1 Macrophages, together with interferon gamma and cytotoxic T-cell gene expression signatures, were significantly increased in responders. Notably, integrating these biomarkers into a single prediction model improved prediction of response to checkpoint inhibition therapy compared to predictions based on eTMB or MSI alone.<br \/>Taken together, our approach enables the quantification of various ICI response biomarkers from a single omics layer (RNA-sequencing) and can contribute to ICI response prediction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Therefore, it is important to identify patients who might respond favorably to DRG-101 gene therapy. Previously, we reported that CCNG1 expression is enhanced in sarcoma tumors (Ann Oncol 34, 1980P, 2023). In this report, we have expanded the analysis to 137 patients with all cancer types and describe patients with known CCNG1 expression levels who have been treated with DRG-101.<br \/>Methods: Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens (n=137) from patients who were followed at the Sarcoma Oncology Research Center were collected, processed, and subjected to RNA sequencing. Briefly, RNA-seq libraries were sequenced to generate 50 million reads, aligned using Kallisto v0.42.4 to GENCODE v23 transcripts with default parameters. Only protein-coding, IGH\/K\/L- and TCR-related transcripts were retained for downstream processing, resulting in 20,062 protein-coding genes. Gene expression levels in patients of the reference cohorts are categorized as low\/medium\/high, defined by Low = &#60; 17%; Medium-high = 50%-83%; Medium-low = 17%-49%; High = &#62;83%.<br \/>Results: Seventy women and sixty-seven men, ranging in age from 16 to 87 years, were studied. All tumors showed enhanced CCNG1 expression. Thirty (22%) tumors exhibited high CCNG1 expression, 53 (39%) showed medium-high CCNG1 expression, 48 (35%) displayed medium-low CCNG1 expression, and six (4%) had low CCNG1 expression. One hundred (73%) patients had metastatic disease, and 37 (27%) had localized disease. There was no correlation between CCNG1 expression and disease stage. As a result of these findings, the FDA-CBER authorized the use of DRG-101 in an Expanded Access program as platform therapy upon which one or more FDA approved cancer drugs\/immunotherapies may be added. Historically, one patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer, one with early stage, HR+ HER2+ invasive breast cancer and one with early stage triple negative breast cancer are alive 15, 3 and 2.5 years in sustained remission with DRG-101 therapy, and had 24%, 23% and 74% CCNG1 tumor expression levels respectively. Five patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, sarcoma and breast cancer and known CCNG1 expression levels are currently being treated with DRG-101.<br \/>Conclusions:(1) 100% of tumors tested showed enhanced CCNG1 expression at varying levels, and (2) the use of DRG-101 in combination with FDA approved cancer drugs\/immunotherapies is on-going for an intermediate size population of advanced pancreatic cancer, sarcoma and carcinoma of breast.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cancer genomics,Cyclin,Gene therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

VIALE-A, a phase-3 trial with venetoclax (ven) and azacitidine (aza) established this combination as a new standard of care (SOC) for this patient population. The addition of pevonedistat (pevo) to this combination was evaluated in the same patient population in the current trial (NCT04266795). Here we present results of biomarker analyses from baseline and on-treatment bone marrow samples.<br \/>Methods: Molecular mutational analysis was performed using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel on baseline bone marrow samples. Combining this data with cytogenetics allowed centralized assignment of risk category based on ELN2017 guidelines. Longitudinal bone marrow aspirate samples were also examined by multi-color flow cytometry for expression of select surface antigen expression and to identify AML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) from the blast population.<br \/>Results: Eleven genes were selected for analyses based on prevalence and scientific interest, including DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2, FLT3, and IDH1\/2. In contrast to other genes and ELN risk categories, we observed a statistically significant increase (p-value 0.013) in CR+CRi rates for IDH1\/2 mutant patients when treated with pevo + ven + aza (95%, n=21) compared to ven+aza control arm (62%, n=21). In addition, we evaluated the prevalence of CD33, CD123 and CLEC12a, targets of current AML developmental therapeutics, in both the blast and LSC populations at baseline. The median (n=120 pts) % blast cells expressing CD33, CD123, or CLEC12a were 89.8%, 63.2%, and 66.0%, respectively. The median (n=78 pts) % LSCs expressing CD33, CD123, or CLEC12a were 48.2%, 90.9%, and 32.0%, respectively. Importantly, we did not see any significant difference in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) or % expression in any of the three proteins after treatment with ven and aza (+\/- pevo). Finally, no strong associations were observed between expression levels and either mutations or ELN risk categories.<br \/>Conclusions: Analyses of biomarker samples as part of the PEVENAZA trial resulted in several insights for not only the pevonedistat program but also for other AML therapeutics in development. The observation that newly diagnosed patients with IDH1\/2 mutations may benefit from the addition of pevo to ven+aza is certainly hypothesis-generating but would require further follow-up with higher patient numbers. In addition, baseline CD33, CD123, and CLEC12a expression levels were in line with published studies. Here we have also shown they remain similar after SOC treatment (ven+aza) supporting the development of agents that target these proteins in both first and second line settings for AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Biomarkers,IDH1,Pevonedistat,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Recently, it has become clear that mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment in solid tumors play a key role in driving outcome, mediating immune infiltration and activation, and response to therapy. Moreover, a growing body of evidence supports the understanding that mechanical changes induced by a plethora of therapeutic regimens should be leveraged to elicit favorable outcome.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this work we propose a dual approach to reveal mechanical biomarkers predictive of long-term outcome in solid cancers. Our first approach is based on a newly developed, 60 channel, biomechanical imaging mass cytometry panel to elucidate biomechanical cues that drive tumor aggressiveness and immune infiltration. Our second approach utilizes the AFM-based Automated and Reliable Tissue Diagnostics (ARTIDIS) investigational device to measure mechanical properties of fresh clinical biopsy samples at a nanoscale resolution. Our analysis was performed on over 300 clinical samples, from routine baseline clinical biopsies collected from both the Breast Clinic, University Hospital Basel, and the University of Dundee, in the UK. Patients in these two cohorts were treated with either adjuvant or neoadjuvant approaches, including radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal, and surgical treatment regimens, with individual patient follow up as long as 20 years.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We demonstrated with two complimentary technologies that biomechanical spatial patterns drive outcome in breast cancer. Our results include a multi-platform elucidation of the biomechanical phenotypes of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions driven by hypoxic environments. Furthermore, we identified several biomechanical subpopulations of cancer associated fibroblasts, and their role in mediating cancer outcome, in relationship with survival time and several clinical variables (e.g. metastasis, nodes, grade). We mechanistically corroborated these results by evaluating the immune modulatory effect of the identified biomechanical microenvironments in breast cancer. Lastly, we correlated the identified biomechanical microenvironments with the ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature as a clinically integrated, rapid, single biomechanics signature at the nanoscale.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our results further validate the importance of biomechanics in driving tumor response and immune infiltration across a variety of clinical treatment setting. These result support the integration of ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature in clinical settings as a single predictive biomarker able to rapidly and accurately capture biomechanical alterations that drive cancer outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Breast cancer,Hypoxia,Stroma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Patients with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM) have altered immune cell composition in the bone marrow (BM). However, little is known about the role of BM spatial immune profiling in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in MM.<br \/>Methods: We performed spatial profiling with imaging mass cytometry of trephine biopsies of the BM (n=15; pre-treatment n=7 and post-treatment n=8) from patients with high-risk SMM enrolled in a phase II trial of nivolumab in combination with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (NCT02903381). Patients received 6 cycles of induction therapy of nivolumab (240mg) at days 1 and 15, in combination with lenalidomide (25mg) at days 1-21 and dexamethasone at days 1, 8, and 15. The induction phase was followed by nivolumab (240mg) and lenalidomide (25mg) maintenance for another 6 cycles. A treatment cycle was defined as 28 consecutive days for a total of 12 months period. Event monitoring was performed up to 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was progression-free survival 2 years after treatment.<br \/>Results: Eight patients were enrolled on this study from January 2017 to June 2017. The study was put on hold due to the toxicity of checkpoint inhibitors observed in other trials of MM. The median age for all patients at enrolment was 60 years (range 49 to 81), with 5 males (62%) and 3 females (38%). All patients met criteria for high risk SMM disease. Median follow-up for all 8 patients was 38.7 months. Median overall survival was not reached; median progression-free survival was 33.8 months. Seven total patients had a response of Minimal Response (MR) or better, and 4 patients who initially responded eventually progressed. The total number of patients who were followed for at least two years and remained progression-free was 4 of 8 evaluable patients (50%; 90% CI: 19 - 81%).Spatial profiling with a panel of 37 markers on the pre-treatment samples allowed us to assess the states and abundances of multiple immune subpopulations, including rare regulatory NK cells. To assess the accuracy of our cell type annotation, we correlated the proportion of malignant plasma cells identified per patient with the value determined by pathologists for clinical diagnosis. These measures were significantly positively correlated (R=0.92, p&#60;0.01). Spatial neighborhood analysis revealed statistically significant interactions enriched in the responders, even with our small sample size (t-test; p &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Conclusions and future directions: This pilot study suggests that BM spatial immune profiling before receiving immune check point inhibitors can be a biomarker for response in patients with SMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Bone marrow,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

The initial effort and cost required to develop high-plex mIF panels is significant and poses a considerable hurdle for adoption of spatial biology. To streamline high-plex assay development, we developed a process for creating and validating multiplex antibody panels for use in immuno-oncology applications that leverage CellScape&#8482;, an automated end-to-end platform for Precise Spatial Multiplexing. Our multiplex assay development was a rigorous, multi-stage, iterative process to evaluate antibodies for suitability, specificity, and reproducibility. These assay panels are formulated as ready-to-use VistaPlex&#8482; assay kits and are intended to enable rapid, reliable spatial phenotyping of key immune populations.<br \/>To confirm the utility of VistaPlex, we deployed the Human FFPE Spatial Immune Profiling Panel to stain and image various FFPE tissue samples on the CellScape platform. With CellScape, tissues are mounted in enclosed fluidic chambers while on-instrument staining, imaging and signal erasure are conducted in iterative rounds. The panel presented here contains antibodies against 16 common biomarkers used in immune-oncology applications. Among these are CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and CD45 to detect cell lineages, PD-1 and PD-L1, to interrogate immune checkpoints, and markers that inform about cell state and activation. Spatial immune profiling data were obtained from human tonsil, colon, breast, and lung tissue samples. Deep immune phenotyping was performed using unsupervised clustering analysis and AI-assisted cluster labelling, and biomarker distributions were studied in the context of cellular neighborhoods and other proximity analyses. Overall, we identified more than 19 cell phenotypes with varying frequencies and spatial arrangements across tissue samples.<br \/>Our data are robust and demonstrate that VistaPlex Assay kits for spatial profiling present an efficient and cost-effective solution for users that want to break into spatial biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Multiplex automation,Immunohistochemistry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

With the emerging successes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in the metastatic and recurrent setting, there is a need for predictive biomarkers to identify patients likely to achieve clinical benefit. Whilst PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and PD-1 on immune cells have been investigated, these remain inconclusive biomarkers. To better understand and map the PD-L1\/PD-1 receptor-ligand interactions, we evaluated a novel in situ proximity ligation assay (is PLA) across whole tissue sections of pre-treatment HNSCC patients to received ICB therapy. Pre-treatment FFPE whole tissue samples were collected from n=25 advanced stage HNSCC patients across two major Queensland Hospitals (Royal Brisbane and Women&#8217;s Hospital and the Princess Alexandra Hospital). Tissues were stained with multiplex immunofluorescence and the Navinci Diagnostics fluorescent is PLA assay for PD-1\/PD-L1. Tissues were incubated with the PD1\/PD-L1 antibodies and subsequent incubation with oligonucleotide-tagged secondary probes enabled PLA, which highlights PD1 and PD-L1 interactions. Following the application of secondary probes, the sections underwent a ligation step, then a post-blocking, and an amplification process to enhance the detection of protein interactions. Next, the sections were treated with a detection solution to visualize the amplification product. The PLA assay findings were measured against clinical endpoints (PFS\/OS criteria). In n=5\/25 HNSCC tissues, positive PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions were measured across the tumour microenvironment (TME), specifically in the immune rivers on the immediate tumour periphery. These cells showed highly specific binding of the PLA product. These areas positive by the PLA assay were in stark contrast to the tumour bulk\/nests which were absent in PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions. Notably, the PLA PD-1\/PD-L1 do not correlate with tumour PD-L1 expression or tumour proportion scores (TPS). Rather, our study highlighted the difference in spatially mapping PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions which may better recapitulate the tumour-immune recognition and activity in the TME. Taken together, these data provide a novel approach for determining clinically relevant receptor\/ligand interactions in the HNSCC TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,PD-1,PD-L1,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"H.

Here we sought to investigate the guiding potential of MRD in informing adjuvant therapy (AT) decisions.<br \/>Methods: Patients with stage IA-IIIB NSCLC who had undergone confirmed R0 resection were enrolled. Blood samples were collected prospectively one month after surgery before initiation of AT (landmark) and longitudinally every 3-6 months since surgery. Postoperative AT was conducted according to the guideline recommendations and regular radiographical examinations were recommended for relapse surveillance. MRD detection was conducted via the MinerVa platform (Genecast Biotechnology Co., Ltd) using a tumor-informed strategy based on a fixed next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel spanning 769 cancer-related genes.<br \/>Results: 168 patients were included in this study, with 11 (6.5%) experiencing confirmed relapse. Positive MRD was detected in 10.2% (16\/157) of patients at landmark and was associated with a significantly higher risk of shorter disease-free survival (DFS)(HR: 26.2[6.7-102.7], <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001), irrespective of disease stage or gene alteration. Dynamic changes in ctDNA status further stratified patients into three subgroups with different prognosis. Consistent negative MRD detected at the landmark and all longitudinal timepoints represented the group with the best prognosis, while positive MRD detected at either the landmark or one subsequent timepoint showed a worse prognosis (Neg-Pos vs. Neg-Neg, HR: 37[3.2-438], <i>P<\/i>=0.004; Pos-Neg vs. Neg-Neg, HR: 14[1.2-172], <i>P<\/i>=0.035). The group with the worst prognosis occurred with consistent positive MRD (Pos-Pos vs. Neg-Neg, HR: 50[5.3-473], <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). For patients with negative landmark MRD, there was no significant difference between the DFS of patients who received AT and those who didn&#8217;t(<i>P<\/i>=0.241), and the result was replicated in a highly controversial subgroup: stage I patients with high-risk factors (<i>P<\/i>=0.130). Besides, whether chemotherapy was applied before targeted therapy in the <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant subgroup showed no influence on DFS provided that landmark MRD was negative (<i>P<\/i>=0.197). In multivariate analysis considering pathological high-risk factors, poor differentiation was identified as an independent risk factor for landmark MRD positivity (HR: 10.6[1.96-168.01], <i>P<\/i>=0.030).<br \/>Conclusions: MRD is a strong and steady prognostic factor in post-operative NSCLC. AT may be waved for stage I patients with high-risk factors given that they had negative landmark MRD, same as the adjuvant chemotherapy before targeted therapy for patients with sensitive <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation. More attention should be paid to poorly differentiated tumors, indicative of a high-risk subgroup with potential residual diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Minimal residual disease,Adjuvant therapy,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
