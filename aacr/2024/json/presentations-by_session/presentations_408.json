Tobacco, either alone or combined with alcohol, is the predominant cause of HNC, while the potential of alcohol as an independent carcinogen is uncertain. Moreover, the etiology remains unknown for ~28% of cases. In this study, we used mutational signature analysis to 1) track the exposure to known and putative risk factors for HNC across multiple geographical regions and subsites, 2) evaluate whether an alcohol signature is present in HNC, and 3) assess its interaction with tobacco or other risk factors.<br \/>Whole-genome sequencing data was generated from 265 HNC cases from retrospective HNC studies in Europe and South America with available lifestyle and environmental exposure data. Mutational and copy number (CN) signatures were extracted with SigProfilerExtractor and decomposed into COSMIC reference signatures. Associations between the mutational signatures and epidemiological or molecular data were assessed using multivariate regression analysis.<br \/>The analysis revealed known and previously unreported signatures of endogenous and exogenous exposures. APOBEC-driven signatures (SBS2, SBS13) were identified in 97% (258\/265) of cases. We observed differences in tobacco-related mutagenesis across anatomical subsites. While known tobacco signatures (SBS4, SBS92, DBS2, and ID3) were found in larynx cases, the novel signature SBS1536I was enriched in oral cavity cases from ever-smokers, which suggests a site-specific mutagenic effect from different tobacco carcinogens. Furthermore, we demonstrate that signatures associated with alcohol consumption (SBS16, DBS4, and ID11) were enriched in cases exposed to both tobacco and alcohol, indicating an interaction between the two. We also extracted signatures indicative of ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (SBS7a-c, DBS1, and ID13) in cases from the inner lip, tongue, and floor of the mouth, implying a role of UV exposure in oral cavity carcinogenesis. Finally, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three distinct CN profiles in HNC, each linked to different risk factors and driver mutations: 1) A CN-rich polyploid cluster associated with tobacco smoking and CN signatures of chromosomal instability, including one novel signature (CN48G) enriched in samples from South America, 2) a CN-rich diploid cluster comprising cases related to both tobacco and human papillomavirus infection; and 3) a CN-neutral cluster enriched in samples with unknown etiology.<br \/>This study uncovers APOBEC signaling, tobacco, alcohol, and potentially UV light exposure, as potent mutagenic agents in HNC. Our findings suggest that the mutational impact of tobacco in HNC is tissue-specific, and that tobacco may enhance the oncogenic effects of alcohol. Finally, the CN profile in HNC is strongly influenced by exposure to risk factors and driver mutations in the tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Risk factors,Whole genome sequencing,Genomic Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Recently, integrating scRNA-seq and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data has shown promise in identifying cell-of-origin populations in human diseases. Colorectal cancer (CRC) progresses through a phenotypic continuum from normal colon to adenoma, and ultimately CRC. However, the specific disease cell-of-origin populations underlying each stage of CRC development at a single-cell resolution have not been well studied. Additionally, while transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have identified more than 200 putative risk genes in CRC, the precise disease cell-of-origin populations associated with these genes remain elusive.<br \/><b>Materials and methods: <\/b>We analyzed scRNA-seq datasets from 31 normal colon, 8 colon serrated polyps, and 15 conventional adenoma tissues of individuals participated the Colorectal Molecular Atlas Project (COLON MAP). We next conducted an integrative analysis of the aforementioned scRNA-seq data, with extensive epigenomics data and summary statistics from a large CRC GWAS conducted among European ancestry populations (78,473 CRC cases and 107,143 controls) using single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), to investigate cell-of-origin populations underlying the CRC development. We conducted correlation analysis between gene expression and individual cell risk scores derived from scDRS. Additionally, we performed differential expression analysis comparing disease cell-of-origin populations with other cell populations at each stage.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified multiple cell-of-origin populations associated with CRC, including absorptive cells (ABS) (P &#60; 1 &#215; 10-4) and goblet cells (GOB) (P &#60; 7 &#215; 10-3) in the normal colon, ABS (P &#60; 2 &#215; 10-3), enteroendocrine cells (EE) (P &#60; 0.04), and serrated-specific cells (SSC) (P &#60; 1 &#215; 10-4) in serrated polyps, and ABS (P &#60; 9 &#215; 10-3) and SSC (P &#60; 6 &#215; 10-4) in adenomas. Among the previously reported 205 risk genes from TWAS, a majority show high correlations of their expressions with the risk scores of the single cells (median value R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.07, 0.14, 0.137 at normal colon, serrated polyps, adenoma, respectively). Moreover, 57 of these TWAS-reported genes (27.8% of 205 genes) exhibited evidence of differential expression in disease cell-of-origin populations compared to other cell populations at a nominal p-value &#60; 0.05 in at least one stage (Binomial test, P &#60; 0.01 for all).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study reveals the cell-of-origin populations that influence the development of CRC, and provides evidence of the role of risk genes in these populations. These findings are crucial for identifying causal genes and understanding the cellular mechanisms that drive the biology and etiology of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Single cell,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Susceptibility,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Prior studies have suggested the existence of reduced penetrance pathogenic variants (RPPVs), which<i> <\/i>pose challenges for identification, reporting, patient counseling and care. Through the current study, we sought to establish RPPVs as a new category of variants, with efforts focused specifically on <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> (<i>BRCA<\/i>).<br \/>We compiled, compared, and assessed data for <i>BRCA<\/i> RPPVs from two large clinical diagnostic laboratories to establish an initial set of reduced penetrance pathogenic variants. Specifically, candidate <i>BRCA<\/i> RPPVs provided by clinical diagnostic laboratories were compiled to identify those with the highest prior likelihood of being a RPPV, based on concordant interpretations. Evidence of reduced penetrance included: 1) the identification of biallelic Fanconi Anemia-affected carriers; 2) splicing, missense, and nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD)-escaping variants; 3) laboratory-validated cancer history weighting models; 4) published variant-specific risk estimation data; 5) extrapolation of a reduced-risk interpretation onto close match variants that are expected to have the same effect; and 6) functional data.<br \/>Sixteen candidate <i>BRCA<\/i> RPPV present in both lists from both laboratories were systematically assessed. For <i>BRCA1, <\/i>variants included c.5096G&#62;A p.(Arg1699Gln) and variants impacting the canonical c.671 splice acceptor site. For <i>BRCA2, <\/i>variants included<i> <\/i>three frameshift (c.658_658delGT, c.9672dupA, c.9699_9702delTATG), two spliceogenic (c.8488-1G&#62;A and c.8488-1G&#62;T), and three missense (c.7878G&#62;C, T, p.(Trp2626Cys); and c.9302T&#62;G p.(Leu3101Arg)) variants.<br \/>Our study is the first to clearly evaluate and establish <i>BRCA <\/i>RPPVs as a new class of variants, based on consistency in results across 16 variants using different interpretation strategies between laboratories. These variants impart a moderately increased risk of breast cancer, often considered to be between 2-4 fold, which should be considered when determining risk-informed cancer prevention strategies. Furthermore, our study establishes a framework to harmonize interpretation and standardize reporting of <i>BRCA<\/i> RPPV, by providing evidence to support this new classification for 16 variants. Further work to define clinically meaningful risk thresholds and categories for reporting <i>BRCA<\/i> RPPV are needed to personalize cancer risks in conjunction with other risk factors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,BRCA2,Risk factors,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

However, AS requires frequent and costly healthcare visits. In a case-only study of AS patients, we investigated whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) could identify patients who may benefit from intensive vs passive surveillance to reduce these burdens.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>This study included 1,220 PCa patients on AS in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS). A previously developed multi-ancestry PRS of 451 PCa risk variants (PRS<sub>451<\/sub>) was constructed in PASS, along with a PRS of 400 variants, excluding 51 PSA-associated variants (PRS<sub>400<\/sub>). Outcomes included upgrading and extreme upgrading at follow up and prostate volume, PSA, percent of biopsy cores with cancer, and Gleason grade at diagnosis. We investigated PRS associations with risk of upgrading with Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for age at diagnosis and 10 principal components (PCs) of ancestry. Associations with risk of extreme upgrading were performed similarly but with a competing risk analysis, where the competing event was treatment. Discriminative ability was evaluated with Harrell&#8217;s C-index. To better account for population structure, we also fit mixed models with fixed effects for PRS, age at diagnosis, and 10 PCs, with a random effect for a genetic relationship matrix.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Of the 1,220 AS patients, 38.5% (n=470) upgraded during the median 4.2 years of follow up and 85% (n=1041) self-reported as non-Hispanic White. In time-to-event analyses, each SD unit increase in PRS<sub>451 <\/sub>was associated with a 23% increased risk of upgrading (P=4.2x10<sup>-5<\/sup>), while PRS<sub>400<\/sub> was associated with a 27% increased risk (P=1.6x10<sup>-6<\/sup>). PRS were similarly associated with 21% (95% CI=1.02-1.44, P=0.03) and 27% (95% CI=1.06-1.52, P=0.01) increased risk of extreme upgrading, respectively. Compared to a model with age at diagnosis, PCs, and clinical risk factors (C-index=0.617, 95% CI=0.590-0.644), including PRS<sub>400<\/sub> slightly improved the ability to detect risk of upgrading (C-index=0.632, 95% CI=0.604&#173;-0.659). Mixed model results were highly consistent. Each SD unit increase in PRS<sub>400<\/sub> was associated with 1.38 higher percentage points of biopsy cores with cancer (95% CI=0.76-2.00, P=1.1x10<sup>-5<\/sup>), 1.48 cc smaller prostate volume (95% CI=-2.82, -0.14, P=0.03), and 0.18 ng\/mL higher PSA (95% CI=0.01-0.35, P=0.05) at diagnosis.

We tested whether any oral bacteria and\/or fungi influence the subsequent risk of HNSCC development.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within three epidemiological cohorts: the ACS-Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort (ACS-CPS-II), the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO), and the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Among 159,840 cohort participants, 236 individuals developed HNSCC during an average of 5.1 years of follow-up, and 485 controls who remained HNSCC-free were selected by 2:1 frequency matching, by cohort, age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. All participants provided mouthwash samples and were cancer-free at baseline. We characterized the oral bacterial microbiome, using whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the oral fungal microbiome, using ITS sequencing. We assessed relative abundance of microbiome-wide bacterial and fungal taxa for association with HNSCC by ANCOM-BC analysis. We also evaluated selected oral pathogen complexes for association with HNSCC by logistic regression. A microbial risk score (MRS) for HNSCC risk was calculated from all risk-associated microbes.<br \/>Results: Overall microbiome diversity at baseline was not related to the subsequent risk of HNSCC; however, we found that 13 oral bacterial species were differentially associated with development of this disease (P&#60;0.05), including newly identified <i>Prevotella salivae<\/i>, <i>Streptococcus sanguinis<\/i>, <i>Leptotrichia sp<\/i>, and several species belonging to <i>Beta-<\/i> and <i>Gamma-proteobacteria<\/i>. Furthermore, <i>a priori<\/i> periodontal pathogen complexes were associated with a higher risk of HNSCC (&#8220;red\/orange&#8221; complex, OR=1.06, 95% CI=1.00-1.12). We did not identify any fungal taxa associated with HNSCC risk. Together, an MRS constructed for risk-associated bacteria and bacterial periodontal complexes conferred a 50% increase in HNSCC risk, per standard deviation increase in the MRS (multivariate OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.21-1.85).<br \/>Conclusions: Our research yields compelling evidence that oral bacteria are a risk factor for the development of HNSCC. The identified bacteria and bacterial complexes hold promise for identifying high-risk individuals and may further lead to personalized prevention approaches for HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Oral microbiome,Whole genome sequencing,Incidence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Our recently published childhood Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) study identified a genome-wide significant association for another genetic variant (rs3781093) in high linkage disequilibrium (D&#8217;=1.0, R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.91) with rs3824662. We hypothesize that <i>GATA3<\/i> is a pleiotropic locus associated with multiple childhood cancers.<br \/>Methods: The study was performed by combining 3 cohorts of childhood cancer survivors: the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), the original and expansion cohorts of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). The CCSS original cohort had SNP array genotyping and imputation, and the SJLIFE and CCSS expansion cohort underwent whole-genome sequencing. Associations between the variants mapped to <i>GATA3<\/i> and risks of different cancer types were analyzed (a specific cancer type was selected as the case group and all other unselected cancer types served as controls, then repeated for 13 cancer types). Summary statistics were subsequently analyzed with the ASSET (Association analysis for SubSETs) method which is powerful for pooling association signals across multiple cancer types when true effects may exist only in a subset and be in opposite directions across cancer types.<br \/>Results: Genotype data were available for 11623 childhood cancer survivors (5325 from the CCSS original cohort, 2428 from the CCSS expansion cohort, and 3870 from the SJLIFE, all European ancestry) were initially considered. After excluding individuals with dual enrollment or as outliers in the principal components analysis (n=667), a total of 10956 individuals remained for genetic association analysis. We identified a bi-directional association for a subset of childhood cancers with rs3781093 (2-sided P value of 6.22&#215;10<sup>-19<\/sup>): the same effect allele (C) was associated with increased risk of ALL or soft tissue sarcoma [STS] (OR=1.21; 95% CI=1.13-1.29; P=7.4&#215;10<sup>-9<\/sup>), and was associated with decreased risk of HL (OR=0.66; 95% CI=0.59-074; P=1.80&#215;10<sup>-12<\/sup>). The frequencies of the effect allele (C) for rs3781093 in ALL cases (17.9%), STS cases (17.8%) and HL cases (12.5%) relative to non-cancer community controls in the SJLIFE (15.6%) and non-cancer gnomAD samples (14.9%) corroborate this finding. In our combined dataset, there were 1380 Hodgkin lymphoma cases, 2961 ALL cases and 692 STS cases.<br \/>Conclusion: We discovered a novel variant in the <i>GATA3<\/i> locus exhibiting pleiotropy with both tumor-promoting and protective effects, suggesting a shared mechanistic pathway involving <i>GATA3<\/i> may underlie the carcinogenesis for ALL, STS and HL.

Current prediction models use a single mammogram measure, usually breast density, at one point in time, to add to prediction models based on established risk factors. Our previous work has shown that change in each breast over time is related to risk of diagnosis with breast cancer.<b><\/b><b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We apply a dynamic prediction model that includes full field digital mammogram in each breast to predict future 5-year risk. Data from Joanne Knight Breast Health Cohort (JKBHC) serve as training population with 290 pathology-confirmed breast cancer cases and 658 controls sampled with a total number of 8,712 craniocaudal (CC) view mammograms for analysis. Nurses&#8217; Health Study 2 (NHS2) serves as the external validation with 188 cases and 462 controls sampled with a total number of 3,712 CC-views. The dynamic risk prediction model aims to estimate the probability of future breast cancer risk conditional on the past history of the longitudinal mammograms. We train the model on the JKBH cohort, retaining 20% for testing and 15% for validation. We report a time dependent AUC when evaluating model performance.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The<b> <\/b>mean age of women was 56.6 years at entry to cohort; 81.3% were white. Adding trajectory of mammogram images in each breast to a model improved performance. The mean number of mammograms conditional on 5 years of observation in JKBHC was 3.36 (1.49) and in NHS2 2.36 (1.53). We obtained a 5-year dynamic AUC of 0.81 (0.05) in the JKBHC internal validation and 0.77 (0.06) in the NHS2 external validation. Model performance was comparable in pre- and postmenopausal women. Because breasts with high mammographic density hinder detection of tumors we stratify analyses by dense and non-dense at baseline. Among women with dense breasts at baseline (BIRADS C and D), we observe a dynamic 5-year risk AUC = 0.77. In the subgroup with less dense breasts (BIRADS A and B) we observe AUC = 0.74.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>Conclusions: <\/b>With this approach<b> <\/b>we can accommodate the irregularly observed time-varying images and project only partial information prior to doing the prediction.
