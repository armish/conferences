[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized melanoma treatment, significantly improving outcomes. Nevertheless, too many melanoma patients undergoing ICI treatment experience severe and often debilitating immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In a retrospective melanoma cohort treated with ICIs, we previously found that elevated baseline levels of circulating CD4 effector memory T (TEM) cells were associated with the development of severe irAEs, irrespective of the affected organ system (Lozano et al., Nature Medicine, 2022). Here, we present data from an extended prospective validation cohort from 47 patients across two academic medical centers.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Of 47 patients, 26 received combination anti-PD1\/anti-CTLA4 ICIs, 3 combination anti-PD1\/anti-LAG3 ICIs, 17 anti-PD1 ICI, and 1 anti-CTLA4 ICI. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from pretreatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) blood samples obtained from all patients. We performed mass cytometry (CyTOF) on PBMCs using a 38-marker panel to deeply profile immune subsets. We further leveraged bulk RNA-seq from 24 patients to (i) deconvolve CD4 memory T cell abundance using CIBERSORTx and (ii) determine T cell receptor (TCR) diversity using Shannon entropy following MiXCR clonotype assembly. irAEs were graded on a 5-point scale using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>After treatment initiation, 14 patients experienced severe irAEs (grade 3+) at a median of 12.1 weeks (range 4-54), including 4 with life-threatening (grade 4) irAEs. CyTOF revealed elevated circulating CD4 TEM cells in patients that developed severe irAEs (P&#60;0.0001; AUC=0.87), including those treated with combination ICIs (P=0.0001; AUC=0.89). We further observed a continuous relationship between increasing CD4 TEM levels and irAE grade (P=3e-6, Jonckheere-Terpstra test). We then combined CD4 memory T cell abundance and TCR diversity derived from bulk RNA-seq on 24 of these patients using logistic regression (trained on data from Lozano et al.) to yield a composite model score. The pretreatment composite model score was strongly associated with severe irAE development (P=0.0009, AUC=0.88), and in a median split, identified patients with shorter time to severe irAE development (3 months vs. not reached; P=0.006; HR=10.5). Notably, composite model features and the overall score had no significant association with immunotherapy benefit.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this prospective study, both circulating CD4 TEM levels determined by CyTOF and a composite model score measured by RNA-seq were strongly associated with severe irAE development, independent of response status. These findings hold promise for future pretreatment risk stratification of ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Microscopic minimal residual disease (MRD) detected in patients by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may remain radiographically undetectable and persist following therapeutic intervention, resulting in recurrence. Preclinical models are urgently needed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby MRD escapes anti-tumor immune surveillance. We have developed and characterized a preclinical liver MRD model that recapitulates immune response, with the goal to discover novel strategies to improve outcomes for patients with ctDNA+ MRD.<br \/>Methods: We generated genetically engineered mouse colonic organoids CDX2 CRE; Rosa26 LSL-CAS9-GFP with APC and TP53 mutation and performed intrasplenic injection in syngeneic C57BL\/6 mice to recapitulate microsatellite stable CRC metastasis to the liver. Mice were monitored for radiographically detectable disease using MRI. Tumors were resected at various timepoints, with comparison between metastases at various sizes of development (dichotomized as micro- and macro-metastases). We performed multiplex immunofluorescence staining, single cell RNA seq, and spatial transcriptomic analysis to delineate the immune compartments of micro- and macro-metastasis in untreated mice. After identifying colony stimulating factor -1 receptor (CSF1R) as a target, we performed a vehicle controlled anti-CSF1R monotherapy study for 4 weeks. Treatment began at either 7 days before metastasis is radiographically detectable to mimic treatment of MRD, or 21 days post tumor engraftment.<br \/>Results: Immune exclusion was confirmed through intratumoral CD45+ leukocyte densities, with transition to an immune excluded phenotype occurring above 0.5mm in size (defined as macro-metastases). In our preclinical model, immunosuppressive populations of macrophages (IBA1+CD163+) dominated in the micro-metastases. This observation was confirmed in 13 patients with paired micro- and macro-metastases to the liver (p=0.0065). Strikingly, anti-CSF1R treatment in the murine model eradicated IBA1+CD163+ macrophages (p&#60;0.0001) and induced complete remission of liver micro-metastasis (0\/7 mice with residual disease), in contrast to limited efficacy for macro-metastases (5\/5 mice with progressed radiographically disease). Additionally, a long-term study confirmed 100% survival (5\/5 mice) and no evidence of disease via MRI at 6 months upon anti-CSF1R treatment compared to vehicle (0\/5 mice).<br \/>Conclusions: We established a reproducible preclinical model of MRD with similar immunopathological features of MRD in patients. Our data further identified infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophage populations as an early determinant of MRD progression and indicated CSF1R as a potential new clinical therapeutic target for ctDNA+-defined MRD patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Micrometastases,Cancer immunotherapy,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

We assessed the association between damaging mutations in the IFN-&#947; pathway and clinical outcomes after immune checkpoint inhibition in the Stand Up to Cancer-Mark Foundation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort.<br \/>Methods: The sensitizing IFN-&#947; pathway genes were defined as <i>IFNGR1<\/i>, <i>IFNGR2<\/i>, <i>JAK1<\/i>, <i>JAK2<\/i>, <i>STAT1<\/i>, <i>IRF1<\/i> &#38; <i>IRF9<\/i>. Damaging mutations (including missense mutations) in any of these genes was considered as loss of pathway activity. We used the best observed response (measured by RECIST v1.1 criteria across time points) to define outcome. Complete and partial response were categorized as responses (R), while stable and progressive disease were categorized as non-responses (NR). The percentage change in target lesions (CTL) was also assessed. Response data was analyzed using additive logistic (LogR) and linear regression (LinR). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Three predictor variable groups were established; the final models comprised IFN-&#947; pathway loss, tumor mutational burden (TMB), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS), prior platinum chemotherapy, age, sex, histological subtype, initial tumor stage, and smoking pack years.<br \/>Results: 309 patients had evaluable whole-exome sequencing data, treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitor regimens, and matched radiological responses (121 R [39%], 188 NR [61%]); 306 had matched OS data; 297 had matched PFS data; and 227 had matched CTL data. 27 (7%) patients had damaging mutations in the IFN-&#947; pathway [<i>IFNGR1<\/i> (3); <i>IFNGR2<\/i> (1); <i>JAK1<\/i> (6); <i>JAK2<\/i> (8); <i>STAT1<\/i> (3); <i>IRF1<\/i> (1); <i>IRF9<\/i> (3); and <i>JAK2<\/i> &#38; <i>IRF9<\/i> (1)]. Significant relationships were observed in univariable models between IFN-&#947; pathway loss and both response (LogR: OR 0.17, p=2x10<sup>-4<\/sup>*; LinR: OR 0.70, p=4.8x10<sup>-4<\/sup>*) and survival (PFS: HR 0.45, p=0.0067*; OS: HR 0.51, p=0.037*). IFN-&#947; pathway loss is significantly associated with TMB (p=9.7x10<sup>-8<\/sup>*, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Multivariable models incorporating TMB and PD-L1 TPS confirmed the significance of IFN-&#947; pathway loss in both response (LogR: OR 0.29, p=0.050*; LinR: OR 0.71, p=0.0052*) and survival (PFS: HR 0.37, p=0.036*; OS: HR 0.27, p=0.030*).

Random gene sets, of similar total protein coding sequence length, significantly associated with TMB but not with multivariable models of response or survival.<br \/>Conclusion: In this NSCLC cohort, damaging IFN-&#947; pathway mutations associate with increased immunotherapy sensitivity, independently of TMB and other co-variates, as evidenced by multiple clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Immune checkpoint blockade,Signal transduction pathways,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexander Azizi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arvind Ravi<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalie Vokes<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephen-John Sammut<sup>3<\/sup>, Justin Gainor<sup>4<\/sup>, Gad Getz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Thoracic\/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>Henri and Belinda Termeer Center for Targeted Therapies, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"799d8eb2-8684-4c94-aebc-fc3e8a2188b6","ControlNumber":"2811","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

We developed a pooled mKRAS peptide vaccine targeting the 6 most common mutations in PDAC: G12V, G12A, G12C, G12R, G12D, or G13D (NCT04117087). In a phase I study, we evaluated mKRAS-specific T cell responses raised by the vaccine when given in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to PDAC patients following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Patients received the pooled mKRAS peptide vaccine (0.3mg\/peptide and 0.5mg poly-ICLC weekly for 4 doses in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by boosters every 8 weeks with nivolumab. To detect vaccine-induced mKRAS-specific T cells, pre- and post-vaccine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were restimulated with control or individual mKRAS peptides and IFN&#947; release was measured by ELISPOT. mKRAS-specific T cell activation, proliferation, memory, and exhaustion profiles were assessed by CyTOF and cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA. For a subset of patients, mKRAS-specific T cells were expanded <i>in vitro<\/i> and T cell receptor (TCR) &#946; chain sequencing and scRNA\/TCRseq were used to identify the KRAS mutation-specific TCR repertoires and define their phenotypes in circulation.<br \/>Results: mKRAS-specific T cells were detected by IFN&#947; ELISPOT post-vaccination for all patients, although magnitude and mutation-specific responses varied between patients. CyTOF analysis identified mKRAS-specific Th1 CD4+ central memory (cm, CCR7+IFN&#947;+) and effector memory (em, CCR7-IFN&#947; +IL2+ TNF&#593;+) responses as well as CD8+ effector (eff, CD137+GZMBhiKi67hi) and effector memory (CCR7-CD137+GZMB+) responses. mKRAS-specific T cells were also detectable in the extended booster phase of treatment (&#62;1 year post initial vaccination). <i>In vitro<\/i> expanded mKRAS-specific T cells mapped to CD4+ Tcm\/em and CD8+ Tem populations within single cell datasets of unstimulated PBMCs collected post-vaccine. 5-25% of the mKRAS-specific T cells significantly expanded to more than one mKRAS antigen suggesting potential cross-reactive T cell clonotypes. In addition, shared public mKRAS-specific T cell clonotypes were identified across patients.<br \/>Conclusions: This study demonstrates mKRAS vaccine induction of <i>de novo<\/i>, high quality mKRAS-specific polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. mKRAS-specific TCR analysis identified shared public TCRs across vaccinated patients that have important implications for future &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; adoptive therapy approaches. Ongoing studies are aimed to validate antigen specificity and map HLA-restriction of mKRAS-specific T cells. Overall, this study demonstrates a positive immunogenic signal of this pooled mutant KRAS vaccine that may be amenable for interception vaccination strategies against PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Pancreatic cancer,Immunotherapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In oncology studies, biomarker measurement requires robust and reliable flow cytometric assays. A crucial element of these assays is to understand the lower limits of measurable surface biomarkers.<br \/>Methods: We incorporated into the development and validation of flow cytometry assays the measurement of the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). The LLOQ is the lowest number of a reportable parameter in a blood or bone marrow study sample that can be quantitatively determined with acceptable precision and accuracy. Two steps are necessary to determine the LLOQ. First in these assessments a measurable range of lower limits of a particular cell type or receptor is estimated. That is, in validating an assay LLOQ, there are three options to select cells expressing target surface biomarkers of interest: using cultured or bioengineered cells, using samples of known high expression of a biomarker, or using pre-titered positive samples. Then decreasing concentrations of the target cell or receptor may be used to precisely determine the LLOQ of a specific assay reportable parameter.<br \/>Results: By acquiring at least ten negative control sample results, the limit of the blank (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD) of a biomarker is determined. LOB is calculated as mean +1.645 SD, and LOD as mean +3 SD. The negative control samples either lack the fluorescent monoclonal antibodies against the markers of interest or lack the target cell population. Different reportable parameters, detected by one or more biomarkers have varying LLOQ. The LLOQ for a reportable parameter is a precise measurement of a parameter above or equal to the LOD. We found that typical LLOQ values are from 4 to 145 positive cells, with a frequency of 0.01 to 0.1% among a parent population. For example, in the case of tetramer assays, flow cytometry can reliably detect as few as 25 CD8+ antigen-specific cells among three million lymphocytes.<br \/>Conclusions: LLOQ determinations for exploratory flow cytometry biomarkers are required for clinical research in cancer immunotherapy and cancer vaccine development. This valuable information allows for interpretation of data at the low end of a measurable range.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,Flow cytometry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

As a mechanism of tumor immunity, CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been shown to express PD-1 in response to clonal neoantigens of tumors. We hypothesized that high levels of CD8+ PD-1+ T cell infiltration prior to treatment initiation may correlate with improved response to total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).<br \/>Methods: We analyzed untreated endoscopic biopsies from 159 patients diagnosed with stage II (n=25) or III (n=134), mismatch-repair proficient rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients were treated with TNT, consisting of either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation (n=108) or chemoradiation followed by consolidative chemotherapy (n=51). FFPE blocks from each biopsy were sectioned into slides for H&#38;E and immunohistochemistry staining with antibodies for CD8 and PD-1 in a CLIA certified lab. CD8+ and PD-1+ cells were quantified using established protocols from the College of American Pathologists. We evaluated associations between response to TNT and tertiles of intratumoral CD8 and PD-1 expression (low\/mid\/high). Disease free survival (DFS) from the start of TNT and rate of sustained complete response (CR, either clinical or pathologic) were used as primary endpoints.<br \/>Results: Median follow-up was 40.3 months. The overall CR rate was 42% and the 5-year DFS rate was 77%. Intratumoral CD8 levels were significantly correlated with improved response rates (56% in the top tertile vs. 27% in the bottom tertile, p=0.003, Fisher&#8217;s test) and improved 5-year DFS (92% vs. 67% for the top vs. bottom tertiles, respectively; p=0.006, log-rank test). Patients in the highest tertile of intratumoral PD-1 expression also had improved response (56% vs. 25%, p=0.002) and DFS (88% vs. 67%, p=0.034). CD8 and PD-1 levels were strongly correlated with each other (R=0.72, p&#60;0.001, Spearman correlation). Finally, the 41 patients who met criteria for top tertiles of CD8 and PD-1 expression had higher CR rates (66% vs. 32%, p&#60;0.001) and better 5-year DFS (97% vs. 70%, p=0.002) than the other patients.<br \/>Conclusions: Higher levels of CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on pre-treatment biopsies are associated with improved response to TNT and disease free survival in LARC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Immune response,PD-1,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Unfortunately, this success has only been replicated in a subset of patients (pts) with gynecological cancers. In ovarian cancer (OC), response rates to ICI monotherapy were low and in breast cancer (BC), only the subgroup of triple-negative BC (TNBC) pts showed an improved outcome by the addition of ICI. One reason for limited success of immunotherapy might be an impaired immune system. In this regard, monitoring the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire could provide key insights into adaptive immune responses to ultimately understand disease initiation, progression and treatment response. Here we elucidated TCR alpha, beta, gamma and delta in buffy coats of pts with non-metastatic OC as well as non-metastatic and metastatic TNBC and compared the results with healthy donors (HDs).<br \/>Methods: RNA was isolated from buffy coat samples of 20 HDs, 10 treatment-na&#239;ve primary OC pts, 14 treatment-na&#239;ve, non-metastatic TNBC pts (participating in the phase II neomono trial) and 19 pts with metastatic TNBC by a modified QIAamp RNA Blood Mini protocol. A survey of the TCR diversity and mapping of common and unique TCRs was done using the QIAseq Targeted RNA Panel Human TCR panel for all known T-cell receptors (alpha, beta, gamma, delta).<br \/>Results: Regardless of the cancer entity, a significant reduction in TCR diversity was observed compared to HDs with the greatest differences observed in the delta receptors. When OC samples were compared with HDs, the difference in diversity was highly significant for all TCR subtypes (TCRalpha: p=0.013; TCRbeta: p=0.008; TCRgamma: 0.008; TCRdelta: 0.006). Similar results were obtained for non-metastatic TNBC (TCRalpha: p=0.0002; TCRbeta: p=0.0001; TCRgamma: p=0.002; TCRdelta: p=0.002) as well as metastatic TNBC patients (TCRalpha: p=0.001; TCRbeta: p=0.001; TCRgamma: p=0.005; TCRdelta: p=0.003) when their TCR diversity was compared to HDs. Interestingly, no significant differences in diversity were obtained when treatment-na&#239;ve non-metastatic TNBC pts were compared with heavily pretreated metastatic TNBC pts. The lowest diversity was found in BC pts compared to the OC pts.<br \/>Conclusion: We have initiated a survey of the TCR diversity in TNBC and OC patients. Further evaluations will include the correlation of these findings with clinical characteristics and outcome. Whether the reduced TCR diversity represents T cell exhaustion or T cell specialization cannot yet be deduced from the results. Nevertheless, the addition of a TCR diversity score could provide an additional metric which may help provide patient guidance when integrated into a multi-modal molecular test.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Immuno-oncology,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Corinna Keup<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cornelia Kolberg-Liedtke<sup>1<\/sup>, Song Tian<sup>2<\/sup>, Samuel  J.

Despite multimodality treatment including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, patients with GBM have a median survival of less than 2 years. Recent clinical trials have reported promising results using cancer vaccines to stimulate a tumor-directed immune response in several histologies. The majority of trials targeted tumor neoantigens derived from a single tumor sample, which limits the antigen pool in spatially heterogeneous cancers like GBM. Our group previously implemented multisector sequencing into the design of personalized peptide vaccines to increase the candidate pool of targetable neoantigens (NCT03422094). Although the peptide vaccine treatment was successful in stimulating an effector T cell response, it was limited by a long turnaround time from vaccine design to administration and a low peptide production rate. Therefore, we incorporated multisector sampling into the design of a personalized DNA-based GBM vaccine (NCT04015700). An average of 33% of the candidate targetable neoantigens were spatially restricted to a single sampled region, which would have been missed without multisector sequencing. DNA-based vaccines are potentially advantageous over peptide-based vaccines because they enable a higher neoantigen payload and faster manufacturing time with potent immunogenicity. Here, we report the results from 9 subjects enrolled onto the study. Spatially distinct tumor regions were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), data from which were used to identify neoantigens through the pVACseq algorithm (http:\/\/pvactools.org). An average of 32 neoantigens were included in each DNA vaccine, compared to an average of only 9 for the peptide vaccine, and the turnaround time from date of surgery to administration of the DNA vaccine was about half the time. Three subjects had radiographic evidence of tumor progression prior to vaccination, highlighting the aggressive nature of GBM and the need for short manufacturing timeframes. PBMCs pre- and post-DNA vaccination were collected from 7\/9 subjects. All subjects presented detectable responses and 6\/7 tested revealed a sustained increment in T cell reactivity against tumor neoantigens post-treatment by IFN-&#947; ELISpot. Intracellular staining showed a neoantigen-specific antitumor CD8\/CD4 T cell cytolytic (CD69+, CD107a+) and proliferative (Ki67+) profile. Post-vaccination tumor resections were performed for 2 subjects who also were treated with PD1 blockade upon progression, providing an opportunity to explore vaccine-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we demonstrate the advantages of incorporating multisector sequencing into the development of DNA-based GBM vaccines and provide insights into the resulting immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

In this study we aimed to evaluate TIME signatures of treatment response and resistance utilizing a novel, integrated technological tool to identify response patterns and enable precision sampling for comparative cellular and molecular analysis.<br \/>30 patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced, high-risk, primary prostate cancer underwent <sup>18<\/sup>F-DCFPyL PSMA PET\/MRI with multiparametric MRI scans followed by 3 cycles of chemohormonal therapy (NCT03358563). Repeat PSMA PET\/MRI was performed prior to prostatectomy and scans were used to categorize lesions as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no response (NR) or normal tissue. MRI scans were used to print a 3D mold of the prostate to allow microdissection of regions of interest from the resected prostate. Cellular infiltrates were analyzed by flow cytometry in 3 to 5 tissue specimens per patient. Statistical analysis was performed with One-way ANOVA with Tukey-correction.<br \/>The frequency of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the total CD45<sup>+<\/sup> infiltrate was highest in normal and CR areas and was significantly reduced in PR vs CR (p&#60;0.01).

The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, has started to revolutionize TNBC treatment, showing encouraging effects in improving survival outcomes regardless of treatment settings. In neoadjuvant setting, pembrolizumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy achieved 13.6 % of pathologic complete response rate improvement and 36% of three-year event reduction. Therefore, pembrolizumab has highlighted new dimensions of TNBC's immunogenic characteristics. However, no immunogenic characteristics to predict the response of pembrolizumab have not been revealed.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This study was designed as prospective, translational research for stage II or III TNBC patients scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab followed by curative surgery. Tissue and blood samples were collected at baseline, 1 or 3 weeks after the first treatment initiation and curative surgery. We employed various single-cell and bulk RNA techniques for our multiomic analysis, including peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR), high-resolution single-cell spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) targeting 380 genes, and bulk PBMC and tissue TCR analysis<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: From March 2023 to October 2023, 37 patients were enrolled in this study. Of 37 patients, we collected 36 blood and BC tissue samples at baseline, as well as 35 blood and 14 BC tissues at follow-up. These samples were analyzed and also compared with sex and age-matched healthy controls (n = 65). Of 37 patients, two patients were treated with only cytotoxic chemotherapy without pembrolizumab. We observed substantial increases in both systemic and localized immune responses, primarily marked by an upsurge in activated T cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells. A notable rise in TCR diversity post one week of treatment was followed by clonal expansion of activated T cells after three weeks in both blood and tissue. In addition, we observed a significant enrichment of pathways related to inflammatory response in classical monocytes following treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The findings from this study significantly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of circulating and local immune cells in TNBC, analyzed at a single-cell level with spatial information. These insights reveal how pembrolizumab alters the immune landscape and correlates these changes with treatment responses. Importantly, the data provide valuable indicators for predicting which TNBC patients are more likely to respond to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Single cell,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

To recognize these unusual Txs, the term irAEs was popularized in clinical trials. Most organs have been involved by irAEs and autoimmunity has been implicated commonly by practicing oncologists. The onset of irAEs has not been studied well, however. We reasoned that autoimmune phenomena would be expected early after IO, since this is the timeframe within which T-cells expand to exert their effects on tumor and other &#8216;self&#8217; tissues. It follows that if autoimmunity is the sole mechanism of irAEs, such toxicities should be reported early. Mechanism(s) of irARs may prove important for IO duration discussions. In some cases, tumor antigenic epitopes may mimic self-tissues, and in such cases irAEs develop early after initiation of IO. We <i>hypothesized <\/i>that irAEs have distinct chronology: earlier events representing autoimmunity (unavoidable); later events reflecting an intercurrent exposure to an antigen (e.g., virus) and therefore are avoidable by limiting duration of IO. Methods: We reviewed published IO monotherapy trials if individual patient data (swimmers&#8217; plot) were reported. We derived the timing and frequency of Tx. We used therapy discontinuation without progressive disease as a surrogate for Tx if reported before the planned 24 months IO therapy.Results: Table depicts the data on included clinical trialsConclusion: The emergence of irAEs after IO extends over a protracted periods with 86% of events occurring beyond 4 months of IO. Though responses occasionally develop late after IO, for Tx consideration, T-cell expansion starts within days of IO initiation, and if autoimmunity is the mediator of Tx, irAEs would emerge only early. Our results suggest dual mechanisms and provide one more impetus to consider shortening IO duration.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{3F47CF52-8AFB-48A3-8436-551FD10E2F49}\"><caption

The most promising of such efforts include the use of low dose radiation (LD-XRT) to prime the tumor microenvironment and enhance the T cell infiltration and activation [Barsoumian HB, et al., 2020; Patel RR, et al., 2021; He K, et al., 2023]. With these advancements, there is an urgent need to develop clinical biomarkers to predict response and optimize treatment decisions. Recent evidence underscores the importance of nanomechanical alterations within the tumor microenvironment as mechanistic indicators of aggressiveness [Plodinec M, et al., 2012]. This study aims to demonstrate the value of ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature as early predictor of elucidate of response to combination LD-XRT\/immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Our measurement protocol in mice follows the same settings for biopsies acquired in routine biopsy collection protocol, thus supporting prompt clinical translation and integration.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We established a mouse model of 344SQ lung adenocarcinoma tumors that exhibited resistance to anti-PD1 treatment in 129Sv\/Ev mice. These mice underwent treatment protocols involving a combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies, both with and without LD-XRT pre-treatment. Throughout the study, we closely monitored survival rates and tumor growth across diverse experimental groups. Employing the ARTIDIS platform, a cutting-edge technology that integrates atomic force microscopy with proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms, we extracted a multiparametric nanomechanical signature and we evaluated its outcome prediction value. This signature was then complemented by histopathology, multiplex immunofluorescence, and Nanostring assays to elucidate mechanisms of stroma remodulation and immune infiltration.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> This study identifies the unique nanomechanical signature predictive of response to immunotherapy alone or in combination with radiation. Using the tissue nanomechanical signature as a predictive biomarker, we achieved precise differentiation between responders and non-responders, boasting a 90% sensitivity, 99.1% specificity, and a 96% AUC. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the response-predicting power of a tissue derived nanomechanical signature for immune checkpoint inhibitors administered in combination with LD-XRT. These findings support clinical translation of the ARTIDIS nanomechanical signature as a pivotal tool for clinically predicting and evaluating responses to integrated radiation and immunotherapy approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Preclinical,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has a profound impact on the therapeutic responses to ICI.

Integrated with public GC scRNA-seq datasets, we construct the largest multi-omic atlas of GC cell states to date that captures the full trajectory of GC malignancy and comprises &#62;320,000 cells derived from 73 samples. We demonstrate the rejuvenation of exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells into a proliferative state marked by the loss of <i>LAYN<\/i> expression as a major mediator of ICI response in the TME.

Both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis are upregulated to meet the high energy demands. However, the impact of amino acid metabolism on T cell activation remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that asparagine deprivation enhances the antitumor activity of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and increases the flux of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mechanistically, asparagine deprivation induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondrial complex I deficiency and leads to nuclear localization of NFAT, subsequently affecting cytokine production and T cell activation. In the animal model, we found that the clinical drug leunase exhibits antitumor activity that relies on the immune response of T cells. Leunase treatment promotes the activation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vivo. Furthermore, the combination therapy of leunase and anti-PD1 demonstrates a synergistic effect. In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), leunase therapy enhances the cytokines production and activation of CD8+ T cell. In summary, our findings offer valuable insights into how T cells adapt to changes in their nutritional environment.<b> <\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Reactive oxygen species,Immunotherapy,Metabolism,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Hsuan Chia Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kwang-Huei Lin<sup><\/sup>, Huang Yu Yang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d7086825-166d-441f-83d7-bf96a2629706","ControlNumber":"972","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

This PDC*lung01 product based on an irradiated plasmacytoid dendritic cell line loaded with HLA-A*02:01 restricted peptides (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, Multi-MAGE-A, MUC1, Survivin and Melan-A) is able to prime and expand peptide-specific CD8+ T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, and is synergistic with anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 (Plumas et al, 2022; Hannani et al, 2023, NCT03970746). In study PDC-LUNG-101 with EudraCT number 2018-002382-19, PDC*lung01 is injected intravenously and subcutaneously for 6 times at two dose levels, 14 million, or 140 million cells in stage II\/IIIA (cohort A1 &#38; A2, monotherapy) or stage IV with TPS&#8805;50% (cohort B1 &#38; B2; in combination with pembrolizumab) patients. We report here the analysis of immune response of 3 cohorts (A1, A2, B1) of patients and the first 19 patients out of 42 (cohort B2) treated with high dose of PDC*lung01 in combination with Pembrolizumab at baseline and 3 timepoints post injection. Several circulating immune parameters have been evaluated at different times before and after vaccination using different assays we have developed: leukocyte count and determination of circulation peptide specific CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry using multimer tools without prior <i>in vitro<\/i> culture. The assay made on purified CD8+ T-cells allowed us to define a limit of quantification (LOQ) to accurately assess the fold changes of the cell expansion. In addition, tumor microenvironment (TME) was analyzed by multiplex fluorescence immunochemistry. The data of 42 patients for who an immune response has been evaluated (cohorts A and B) will be presented. No major changes in circulating main lymphocyte frequencies (B cells, NK cells, CD4+, CD8+, or Treg T cells) were observed during treatment. In addition, no major cell activation (CD25+, CD54, or DR+) was noted. In contrast, in a significant number of patients, PDC*lung01 induced circulating peptide-specific CD8+ T cell expansion in all 4 cohorts at different levels and time points against at least one out of seven peptides used. The percentages of patients for who an expansion of antigen-specific T-cell were observed were 50%, 64%, 66.7% and 68.4% in A1, A2, B1 and B2 cohorts respectively. The intensity of the immune response was proportional to the dose of PDC*lung01 and to the combination with pembrolizumab. When possible, total and peptide-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted for analysis of TCR repertoire, illustrating the modelling and dynamics of the immune response. The TME features will also be illustrated. To conclude, treatment with PDC*lung01 induces an anti-tumor immune response in a significant number of patients which appears to be enhanced by the combination with pembrolizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Therapeutic cancer vaccine,Immune checkpoint (Pembrolizumab),Allogeneic Plasmacytoid Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Previously, we showed that inhibition of the phosphatase activity of SHP1 by a novel SHP1 allosteric inhibitor, SB6299, results in the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells and enhanced anti-tumor immune responses<sup>2<\/sup>. Here, we report SB8091, an advanced SHP1 allosteric inhibitor with a promising initial safety profile and improved pharmacokinetic properties.<br \/>Methods: SHP1 inhibitors were developed through a structure-based drug design approach, and optimized for cellular activity on target, in vitro ADME, and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary toxicity studies were performed with mice. The lead series was assessed in in-vitro studies with mouse or human primary immune cells. <i>In-vivo<\/i> efficacy and pharmacodynamic data were generated using mouse syngeneic tumor models.<br \/>Results: Structurally, SB8091 seemed to stabilize the autoinhibitory form of SHP1 as an allosteric inhibitor, in a nanomolar range and which can explain the outstanding selectivity compared to other PTP enzymes, including SHP2. In several human primary immune cell types, SB8091 significantly increased cytokine responses and demonstrated significantly enhanced activity in NK cells and macrophages against various cancer target cells. As a single agent, this compound exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor growth when administered orally, and the efficacy was further enhanced when co-administered with anti-PD1 antibodies in various syngeneic tumor models. Notably, this effect was associated with a pharmacodynamic response marked by increased levels of phosphorylated substrates regulated by SHP1. SB8091 exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties for oral administration, and SafetyScreen data showed a very low potential for off-target activity and drug-drug interactions. Additionally, during a 2-week repeat pilot toxicity study in mice, SB8091 demonstrated excellent tolerability even at high doses, indicating a high therapeutic index (TI &#62; 100).<br \/>Conclusion: Our advanced compound, SB8091, is a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable allosteric inhibitor of SHP1. It has demonstrated excellent efficacy as a monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint blockers, with favorable drug properties and safety profiles.

Radiation has the potential to sensitize tumors to ICI through extra-tumoral T cell activation in response to tumor antigens released from irradiated cancer cells (abscopal effect). Here, we investigate tumor microenvironment and T cell repertoire reshaping leveraging serial biospecimens from a phase 2 randomized clinical trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy followed by pembrolizumab (SBRT arm) vs. pembrolizumab alone (control arm) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; NCT02492568).<br \/>Methods: We employed whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to analyze 293 serial tumor and peripheral blood samples collected at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment from 72 patients in the control (n=35) and SBRT (n=37) arms. Immunologically-cold tumors were defined as low TMB (&#60;300 mutations per exome, n=43), PD-L1 null (0% expression on immunohistochemistry, n=41), or WNT-activated (presence of mutations affecting genes in the WNT pathway, n=10). TCR clonotypic differential abundance analyses and RNA sequencing deconvolution and gene set enrichment analyses were performed on baseline and on-therapy blood and tumor samples from the control and SBRT arms.<br \/>Results: Patients with immunologically-cold tumors in the SBRT arm had significantly longer progression free survival compared to the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm (log rank p=0.029 for TMB-low, p=0.022 for PD-L1-null, p=0.037 for the WNT-activated subsets). Induction of interferon-gamma, interferon-alpha, antigen processing and presentation, and inflammatory response gene sets was significantly enriched on-therapy in the SBRT arm (FDR adjusted p&#60;0.01 for TMB-low, PD-L1-null, and WNT-activated tumors). We observed greater enrichment in newly expanded TCR clones on-therapy intratumorally and in peripheral blood in the SBRT arm compared to the control arm (mean 16.17 vs 7.54 clonotypes, p=0.022 in tumor; mean 4.56 vs 1.00, p=0.039 in blood; Mann-Whitney U test). Similarly, we noted greater expansion of pre-existing TCR clones in the SBRT arm than within the control arm (mean 34.83 vs 18.69, p=0.021 in tumor; mean 21.61 vs 8.15, p=0.009 in blood; Mann-Whitney U test). Within the SBRT arm, there was no significant difference in T cell expansion between TMB-stratified (&#60;300 mutations vs &#62;=300 mutations) or PD-L1-stratified (0% vs &#62;= 1% expression) groups.<br \/>Conclusions: SBRT followed by pembrolizumab was associated with priming and augmenting anti-tumor immune responses in immunologically-cold NSCLC, which opens a therapeutic window of opportunity for radiotherapy to overcome primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Radioimmunotherapy,Multiomics,Tumor microenvironment reshaping,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Although ICI treatments confer survival benefit, they frequently induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which are a substantial clinical problem, particularly in AT\/NAT, where ICI is used in less advanced disease to prevent recurrence. As such, the biomarkers predicting irAE risk, in particular in AT\/NAT, are urgently needed to improve patient outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We assessed RNA from pre-treatment peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from adjuvant clinical trial patients (CheckMate-915; n=212 patients) treated with Nivolumab (n=130) or Ipilimumab\/Nivolumab (Combo) (n=82). We performed RNA-seq differential expression analysis to identify baseline differences in the immune profiles of patients with no\/mild toxicity (grade 0-2) versus severe toxicity (grade 3-5).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among those with severe toxicity reveals significant enrichment of immune-related pathways (IL-2, IFN-gamma, T-cell receptors, Toll-like receptors). These are shared among cell types (CD4+\/CD8+) and between treatments (Nivo\/Combo). From predicted DEG protein-protein interactions, we identified a treatment- and cell-type-specific expression signature associated with irAE development in CD4+ cells from Combo-treated patients. This signature, involving genes in the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) pathway, correctly predicts severe irAE patients with 73% accuracy (chi-squared p-value=0.001). The signature also identifies patients with mild to moderate irAEs in organ systems previously found in autoimmune traits to be associated with SYK upregulation (including skin, GI, liver, and pancreas), with 96% of all predicted patients experiencing at least one of these SYK-related toxicities, and 79% experiencing two or more. Importantly, the signature is not associated with disease recurrence (p=0.79).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We have identified baseline expression differences in key immune pathways in peripheral T cells from ICI-treated patients with severe irAEs, and defined an SYK-related gene signature correctly identifying over half of severe irAE patients in the Combo-treated cohort. This finding aligns with our previous work linking anti-CTLA-4 irAEs with a germline variant associated with high SYK expression. This gene signature may not only serve as a baseline biomarker of severe irAEs, but it may also help guide treatment decisions, reducing toxicity while retaining efficacy, which will be particularly important in the adjuvant setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Toxicity,Predictive biomarkers,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Conventional autoimmune thyroiditis autoantibodies (AutoAbs) (thyroglobulin (TG); thyroid peroxidase (TPO)) do not predict these TEAEs. We previously reported that pretreatment serum AutoAb profiles were associated with all severe TEAEs for melanoma patients treated with ICIs. Herein, we test if pre-existing AutoAbs could predict ICI induced hypothyroidism (TEAE ThyDis).<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b><br \/>NYU Melanoma Program patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma treated with ICIs (Ipilumumab, Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab, or Combination) who had TEAE ThyDis (N = 14) or No TEAE (N = 11) were included. The HuProt<sup>TM<\/sup> human proteome microarray was used to profile proteins on cell surfaces or preferentially in extracellular spaces (N = 1061) in pretreatment and posttreatment (within ~4 months of ICI start) serum. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to determine statistical significance (p &#60; 0.05).<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b><br \/>17 pretreatment pre-existing AutoAbs were detected (<b>Table<\/b>).

In order to sensitize it, preclinical data show the value of adding chemotherapy treatment for its ability to induce immunogenic cancer cell death (Kroemer et al, 2013). This would enable the recruitment of cytotoxic T-CD8<sup>+<\/sup> lymphocytes (CTL) and thus initiate an antitumor immune response to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the results of clinical trials using chemo-immunotherapy combinations are divergent (IMpassion 130 and 131). The IMpassion 130 trial demonstrated the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) in PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> patients, but unfortunately, IMpassion 131 with paclitaxel did not replicate these results. The choice of chemotherapy to combine with immunotherapy appears to be crucial for inducing an antitumor immune response. Optimizing chemo-immunotherapy combinations is a major challenge in the management of TNBC.<br \/>The initial aim of this project was to evaluate the immune effects of an experimental chemotherapy doublet, based on two drugs used in mTNBC: cisplatin (CDDP) and eribulin. The idea was to find an alternative to the use of taxanes in combination with anti-PD-(L)1.The effect of the two molecules, alone or in combination, was evaluated on immunogenic death stigmata, modulation of effector or immunosuppressive immune populations and stromal populations, and sensitization to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in the immunologically \"cold\" model: 4T1. The <i>in vivo<\/i> studies has been realized by generation of orthotopic 4T1 tumors, the analysis of the immune infiltration was performed by RT-qPCR, IHC and flow cytometry.<br \/><i>In vitro<\/i>, our results indicate that CDDP, and more intensely in combination with eribulin, significantly induces the various immunogenic death stigmas. <i>In vivo,<\/i> the therapeutic effect of chemotherapies is limited, with a superior effect of CDDP and the combination. Nevertheless, CTL recruitment and functionality induced by CDDP are significantly enhanced by eribulin. Despite these data pointing to a potential therapeutic synergy with anti PD-L1 immunotherapy, chemo-immunotherapy treatment fails to induce a superior treatment effect. The significant increase in a TGF-&#946; signature induced by the combination in parallel with CTL recruitment explains this resistance. The results show that inhibition of TGF-&#946;, combined with chemo-immunotherapy in the 4T1 model, leads to a reduction in tumor immunosuppression and intratumoral fibrosis, as well as an increase in CTL infiltration and cytotoxicity, enabling tumor sensitization.<br \/>Overall, this project highlights the benefits of using an experimental doublet of CDDP and eribulin-based chemotherapies. This project demonstrates that management of chemo-induced immunosuppression mechanisms is necessary to overcome tumor resistance to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemotherapy,TGF-&#946;,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura Kalfeist<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fanny Ledys<sup>1<\/sup>, Stacy Petit<sup>1<\/sup>, Samia Kada-Mohammed<sup>1<\/sup>, Mickael Rialland<sup>2<\/sup>, François Ghiringhelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Emeric Limagne<sup>1<\/sup>, Sylvain Ladoire<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre Georges-François Leclerc, Dijon, France,<sup>2<\/sup>U1231 INSERM University of Burgundy, Dijon, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5e38a3d3-2eb2-4150-b7f7-8841d33edfc0","ControlNumber":"4833","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Immunotherapy, specifically anti-PD-(L)1 (ICIs), has revolutionized certain cancer treatments, but its efficacy in mTNBC has been disappointing. To enhance tumor responses to ICIs, combining them with immunogenic chemotherapy has been explored. Studies like IMpassion130 and KEYNOTE 522 indicate benefits of chemo-immunotherapy based on taxanes, especially in PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumors. PD-L1 expression often correlates with TILs infiltration, particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), indicating an activated immune response in the tumor. However, tumors with poor CTL infiltration, known as \"Cold\" phenotype, are often associated with a lack of induction of CXCR3-associated chemokines (CXCL9, 10, and 11), crucial for CTLs recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. The limited efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in PD-L1-negative tumors may stem from chemotherapy's inability to induce immunogenic cancer cell death, CXCR3-associated chemokines, and CTL recruitment. Internal data from a 4T1 TNBC murine model demonstrated that the taxane paclitaxel failed to induce CXCL10, CTL recruitment, and sensitization to PD-L1 blockade. The preclinical research project aimed to identify a combination therapy, inspired by current clinical practices, capable of inducing CXCL10 expression and restoring CTL recruitment in the 4T1 \"cold\" mTNBC model. We initially screened standard TNBC chemotherapies and selected carboplatin for its <i>in vitro<\/i> potential to induce CXCL10 production and its clinical use in association with ICIs in the TNBC. Combining carboplatin with a library of over 400 targeted therapies, we identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as significantly enhancing CXCL10 secretion. <i>In vivo<\/i>, this combination demonstrated therapeutic additivity, increasing immune recruitment, particularly CD8+ T lymphocytes, with the therapeutic effect reduced by CXCR3 blockade. Mechanistic exploration in vitro revealed that the combination activated the type I interferon pathway, inducing CXCL10 secretion. <i>In vivo <\/i>confirmation validated the role of the type I interferon pathway and CXCL10 in the combination's efficacy. This data outlines a chemotherapy and HDAC inhibitor combination capable of inducing CTL recruitment via increased CXCL10 production. Future project phases will focus on understanding HDACi's mechanism of action on CXCL10 production and the combination's potential to sensitize tumors to ICIs. Overall, this project underscores the role of epigenetic modifications in amplifying carboplatin-induced CXCL10 secretion, potentially converting \"cold\" ICI-resistant tumors into a \"hot\" phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Carboplatin,HDAC inhibitor,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

Most patients receive 5-FU (F) and folinic acid (FOL) combined with oxaliplatin (OX), irinotecan (IRI), or both (OXIRI). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective against microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors, but 95% of mCRC tumors are microsatellite stable (MSS) and ICI-resistant. Though the primary targets of 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin are well-understood, their effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain incompletely characterized. Chemotherapy-mediated immune stimulation in MSS CRC has been observed in preclinical models and clinical trials. We hypothesize that combination chemotherapy treatment modulates the immune microenvironment of CRC -\/+ ICI, with differences across subtype and treatment regimen. Chemotherapy-dependent changes in cancer cell gene expression, PD-L1 levels, cytokine secretion, and T cell activation were measured using <i>in vitro <\/i>models of MSS and MSI CRC. A preliminary evaluation of spleen and tumor T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in murine models of MSS and MSI CRC after immunotherapy -\/+ chemotherapy was conducted. CD8+ T cells, DCs, PD-L1, CD69, and GM-CSF expression were measured in clinical specimens of chemotherapy-treated MSS mCRC patients. In MSS CRC, FOX increased GM-CSF and activated CD8+ T cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and activated splenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. FOX and FIRI suppressed an anti-PD-1-mediated enhancement of type 1 cDCs in the tumor <i>in vivo<\/i>. FOLFOX was associated with increased tumor CD8+ T cells and decreased GM-CSF in MSS mCRC biopsies. FIRI treatment increased PD-L1 <i>in vitro<\/i>. FOLFIRI was not associated with increased tumor CD8+ T cells in MSS mCRC biopsies. In MSI CRC, FOX increased tumor CD8+ T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Here, we elucidate novel effects of clinically relevant chemotherapy combinations on the TME in MSS and MSI CRC. These data point to a FOX-specific mechanism by which CD8+ T cell infiltration into MSS mCRC tumors is enhanced, but their activation is halted potentially by GM-CSF suppression and\/or type 1 cDC depletion in the TME. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of chemotherapy-dependent immune modulation and bring the field closer to harnessing these effects for therapeutic gain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemotherapy,Immunotherapy,Colorectal cancer,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"L.

Survival rates for patients with locally advanced disease are poor and variable after standard of care (SOC) chemoradiation treatment (CRT). Identifying the antitumor host immune mediators important for treatment response and designing strategies to promote them are essential for improving clinical outcome. Antitumor immunity comprises of adaptive and innate immune effectors. The immediate innate immune response by natural killer (NK) cells is a critical component for antitumor efficacy. The effector function of NK cells is modulated by various receptors via a wide array of activation or inhibitory signals. Among these receptors is HLA-DR, a recognized activation marker on CD8 T and NK cells. Literature studies refer to HLA-DR+ NK cells as pre-mNK. Preclinical data demonstrated therapeutic vaccine mediated induction of pre-mNK equivalent to contribute to tumor-free long-term survival. In our studies with clinical samples from HPV+ cancer patients, we&#8217;ve observed a dysfunctional phenotype of circulating pre-mNK when compared to healthy donors, demonstrated by flow cytometry methods. The correlates for dysfunction include increased PD-1 expression, a known inhibitory receptor, and reduced CD16, an NK receptor for Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). Further, we observed circulating pre-mNK cells in HPV+ head and neck patients gain functionality post-treatment, as shown by significant increases in granzyme B and CD16, both known contributors for NK cytotoxicity. In cervical cancer patients, we had the opportunity to analyze the tumor microenvironment (TME). Interestingly, we found a significant increased frequency of cytotoxic pre-mNK cells, shown by granzyme B, in the TME that was not present in circulation.

A personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine (PTCV) tailored against neoantigens identified in an individual&#8217;s tumor may enhance responses to PD-1 inhibitors through the induction of tumor-specific immunity. Here, we present results from a single-arm Phase Ib\/2a trial evaluating a DNA plasmid (GNOS-PV02) encoding up to 40 neoantigens co-administered with plasmid-encoded IL-12 (pIL12) in combination with pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) in patients (pts) with advanced HCC.<b>Methods<\/b>: Pts were eligible for study therapy upon progression or intolerance with a 1L tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The PTCV [GNOS-PV02 (1mg) and pIL12 (0.34mg)] was administered intradermally via in vivo electroporation Q3w x 4 doses, and Q9w thereafter. PEMBRO was administered at 200mg IV Q3w. The primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. To evaluate the secondary endpoint of ORR per RECIST 1.1 by investigator review with a null hypothesis of an ORR of 16.9% (KN-240, <i>Finn et al ASCO 2019<\/i>), 36 pts were included to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis at the one-sided 0.10 level, assuming the true ORR rate of 33.1%. The data cut date was August 18, 2023.<b>Results<\/b>: Among the 36 enrolled pts who received at least one dose of treatment, there were no DLTs or treatment-related grade &#8805;3 events. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection site reactions, observed in 41.6% of pts. ORR (mITT) per RECIST 1.1 was 30.6% (11\/36; 9 confirmed and 2 unconfirmed) with 8.3% (3\/36) of pts achieving a CR. This achieved statistical significance with a one-sided p-value = 0.031 (1-sided 90% CI 20.4%-100%) The mOS was 19.9 months. ctDNA changes correlated with radiographic responses and preceded them. A complete molecular response (100% ctDNA clearance) was detected in 7 pts including the 3 radiographic CRs, and 4 additional pts who continue to show durable tumor control (3PR, 1 SD). Immunological analyses confirmed the induction of neoantigen-specific T cell responses by IFN&#947;-ELISpot in 19\/22 (86.4%) evaluable pts, and pts with a larger ELISpot response showed a trend towards longer OS. Multi-parametric cellular profiling and single-cell analysis revealed active, proliferative, and cytolytic vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells in the blood of immunized pts. In 14\/14 (100%) of pts with paired pre- and on-treatment blood and tumor biopsies, we identified by TCR&#946; bulk sequencing expanded T cell clones in the peripheral blood that also trafficked into the tumor. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our results show that a PTCV plus PEMBRO is well tolerated and has clinical activity in pts with advanced HCC, and support the PTCV mechanism of action based on the induction of anti-tumor T cells in peripheral blood and tumor.

This study aimed to evaluate how CRT changes TCR repertoire on peripheral CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, and the change affects the clinical outcomes of CRT followed by durvalumab treatment.<br \/>Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted from November 2019 to May 2021 in three institutes (National Cancer Center Hospital, Kansai Medical University Hospital, and Aichi Cancer Center Hospital) in Japan. We revealed the diversity of TCR repertoire (diversity evenness 50 [DE50]) on PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell phenotype in PBMCs before and after CRT treatment.<br \/>Results: A total of 40 patients treated with CRT were included. Of these patients, 32 patients received durvalumab consolidation treatment after CRT (Durva cohort). The diversity and usage of T cell Receptor Beta Variable (TRBV) and T-cell receptor beta joining gene (TRBJ) usage were significantly positively correlated before and after CRT (TRBV usage: r=0.62, p&#60;0.001, TRBJ usage: r=0.55, p&#60;0.001). Regarding the association of TCR repertoire diversity with CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell phenotype, DE50 and frequencies of CD8 naive were significantly positively correlated before CRT (p=0.049), while there was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and TCR repertoire before CRT (r=0.03, p=0.89) In Durva cohort, DE50 in patients with non-recurrence was higher than those with recurrence both before and after CRT (Before CRT: 0.0032 vs. 0.0019, p=0.13, After CRT: 0.0026 vs. 0.0014, p=0.06). The progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with DE50<sub>High<\/sub> before CRT was significantly greater than those with DE50<sub>Low<\/sub> (NR vs. 14.3 months; p=0.01). Moreover, when the patients were exploratory classified based on the PD-L1 expression status and the diversity of TCR repertoire, the PFS of the CRT followed by durvalumab apparently differed (DE50<sub>High<\/sub>, PD-L1 TPS&#8805;1%, NR, and DE50<sub>Low<\/sub>, PD-L1 TPS&#60;1%, 5.9 (4.6-7.3) months, p=0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: TCR diversity of peripheral CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell predicted the recurrence in unresectable locally advanced NSCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab maintenance. Additionally, the TCR diversity combined with PD-L1 expression status could more accurately predict the efficacy of the CRT followed by durvalumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,chemoradiotherapy,T cell repertoire,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Patients with pretreated advanced HPV-associated malignancies received PRGN-2009 vaccine (5x10<sup>11<\/sup> particle units, subcutaneous administration) q2 weeks for 3 administrations and biweekly 1200mg BA followed by q4 weeks vaccine and biweekly BA (NCT04432597), with an overall response rate of 30%. We report here correlative analyses from this first-in-human Phase I study using peripheral blood from 10 patients with HPV16+ (n=8), HPV18+ (n=1), or HPV45+ (n=1) disease to identify immune correlates associated with clinical response.<br \/>Methods: Peripheral HPV-specific T cell responses, HPV circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma, serum cytokines and soluble factors, and peripheral immune cell subsets were assessed to evaluate changes induced with treatment and peripheral correlates associated with clinical activity. Patients with complete response (CR, n=1), partial response (PR, n=2; 1 confirmed) or stable disease (SD, n=1) (n=4 total) were compared to patients with progressive disease (PD, n=6).<br \/>Results: Eighty percent (8\/10) of patients developed either HPV16 or HPV18-specific T-cell responses after repeat administration of PRGN-2009 with BA. Eight of 10 patients had detectable HPV16 or 18 ctDNA at baseline and changes in ctDNA load with treatment generally correlated with outcomes. Early transient increases in IL-8, TNF&#945;, and IFN&#947; occurred, with greater increases in IL-8 at 2 weeks and TNF&#945; at 4 weeks in patients with PD compared to CR\/PR\/SD. The patient who achieved a durable CR had HPV45+ disease, and had a) a 50% increase in CD8+ T cell frequency at 2 weeks, b) increases in frequencies of CD8+ na&#239;ve T cells expressing Ki67+ and central and effector memory T cells expressing 4-1BB, PD-1, or TIM-3, and c) considerable increases in HPV18-specific T cell responses through 484 days after treatment start, indicating durable antigen-specific T cell activity.<br \/>Conclusions: The majority of patients developed HPV16\/18 specific T-cell responses after repeat administration of PRGN-2009 in combination with BA. Transient increases in IL-8 and TNF&#945; 2-4 weeks after start of treatment were associated with worse outcomes, suggesting that early changes in cytokines may reflect disease course. Furthermore, the early expansion of CD8+ T cell subsets in the patient developing a CR with HPV45+ disease after receiving a vaccine targeting HPV16 and HPV18 epitopes suggest a broadening and boosting of T cell responses that enabled potent anti-tumor activity. A high degree of homology between HPV18 and HPV45 may have contributed to the expansion of HPV18 specific T cells in the patient with CR. These data highlight the importance of assessing peripheral blood in immunotherapy trials to reveal important immunological phenomena.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Vaccines,Immune response,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

It is characterized by a highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment and a paucity of dendritic cells, leading to low immune cell infiltration and poor outcomes with immunotherapy treatments that are highly effective in other cancers. In a recent pilot study, metastatic PDAC patients who had progressed on chemotherapy were treated with a combination of dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy and radiation which resulted in an 18% overall response rate (ORR) and 29% disease control rate (DCR). This led to a phase 2 study in order to further test this combination with the goal of deep correlative analysis to understand the determinants of immunotherapy response and resistance. In this follow up there was a 3.6% ORR, 10.7% DCR, progression free survival (PFS) of 2.3 months, and a single patient with complete response. We collected 36 samples from 23 patients including primary pancreas tumor tissue and liver metastases, and 13 pairs of pre and on treatment biopsies. We performed single-nucleus and paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing on these samples to provide comprehensive insight into the cell types and biology present in this unique tumor microenvironment. Using supervised non-negative matrix factorization we have identified both previously established and novel gene programs that co-vary between cell types. Within the various tissue sites we have identified differing proportions of basal to classical tumor cell types and a distinct shift towards the classical state post-radiation. Of particular interest is a group of interferon related gene programs present within epithelial cell subtypes, C1QC+ and MHCII+ macrophages, and CD14+\/CD16+ monocytes that indicate cell type specific responses to treatment. Focusing on the T cells, we found a distinct shift towards exhausted or proliferating states on treatment and using TCR sequencing data we have identified novel and expanding clones on treatment, largely consisting of those same cell subtypes. We also collected spatial transcriptomics data on a subset of patient samples, and analysis is ongoing to further confirm the cell type relationships identified in single-cell resolution data, along with spatial localization of basal to classical tumor states. This vast multimodal dataset allows us novel insight into the radiation and dual ICB induced cellular state shifts in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Single cell,T cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, the limited rates of long-term survivors (&#60; 20%) demand a robust prognostic biomarker. This nationwide multi-centric prospective study aimed to identify a plasma exosome (PEX) mRNA signature, which serves as a companion diagnostic of nivolumab and as well provides a biological clue to develop effective therapies for a majority of non-survivors. Pre-treatment plasmas (<i>N <\/i>= 104) were subjected to comprehensive PEX mRNA analyses for prognostic marker discovery and validation. In parallel, paired treatment na&#239;ve tumor and plasma samples (<i>N<\/i> = 20) were assayed to elucidate biological implications of the PEX mRNA signature. A combination of 6 candidate PEX mRNAs plus neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio precisely (<i>P <\/i>= 0.000124) distinguished non-survivors from &#62;2-yr survivor (0% vs 57.7%) with a high hazard ratio (2.878; 95% confidence interval 1.639-5.055; <i>P <\/i>= 0.0002348). In paired samples, high PEX<i> HLA-E<\/i> mRNA (a non-survivor-predicting marker) reflected the increased HLA-E protein expression (<i>P <\/i>= 0.0191) and the dense population of tumor-infiltrating NK cells (<i>P <\/i>= 0.024) in the corresponding tumor. It is estimated that the effects of PD-1blockade is canceled by the HLA-E-NKG2A immune checkpoint in patients with high PEX <i>HLA-E <\/i>mRNA. The combination of NKG2A antibody (i.e., monalizumab) and nivolumab may be a promising strategy for non-survivors predicted by a RT-qPCR-based pre-treatment measurement of PEX mRNAs. A candidate companion diagnostic of nivolumab that indicates a possible treatment option is identified.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Here, we report on immune correlates from the OXEL study (NCT03487666), an open label randomized phase II trial in TNBC patients with residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, who were treated with post-neoadjuvant nivolumab (360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, Arm A), capecitabine (1,250 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> orally twice daily on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle, Arm B), or the combination of nivolumab and capecitabine (Arm C). The primary endpoint was to assess the immunologic effects of nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination.<br \/>Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy in patients from Arm A (n=15), B (n=14), and C (n=13) by flow cytometry to identify 158 immune cell subsets. Peripheral immunoscores reflective of enhanced immune cell function were calculated to evaluate changes in the immune profile induced by each therapy, and the association between the immune profile at baseline and disease recurrence.<br \/>Results: At 6 weeks versus baseline, an increase in immune cell function was seen in patients on Arms A+C compared to Arm B. Additional distinct immune subsets showed statistical changes after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy that were specific to each arm. At baseline, a higher peripheral immunoscore was associated with a lack of eventual disease recurrence in patients on Arm A or Arms A+C, but not for patients on Arm B. Patients on Arm A (p=0.0003) or Arms A+C (p=0.0085) with a peripheral immunoscore above the median also had a longer interval of disease-free survival than patients at or below the median; this association was not seen in Arm B. Distinct immune subsets at baseline also associated with development of recurrence in each arm; higher levels of na&#239;ve CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs and lower levels of NKp30<sup>+<\/sup> NK and PD1<sup>+<\/sup> NKT cells associated with recurrence in Arm A, while in Arm B, greater levels of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes associated with recurrence. In Arm C, higher frequencies of multiple Treg subsets were associated with recurrence.<br \/>Conclusions: Patients receiving nivolumab, with or without capecitabine, showed enhanced immune cell function. A peripheral immunoscore based on the immune profile at baseline was associated with disease recurrence only in patients receiving immunotherapy. These data highlight the importance of assessing peripheral blood to reveal important immunologic phenomenon and potential associations with clinical outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Combination studies,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.
