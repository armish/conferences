[{"Abstract":"Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options, due to a paucity of actionable mutations and low response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, its extreme heterogeneity prevents identification of actionable dependencies from bulk-tissue profiles, such that transformed cells themselves represent as little as 10% of cells comprising the complex micro-environment of these tumors. To address these challenges, we introduce a highly generalizable, single-cell framework for the mechanism-based prioritization of drugs to treat rare, heterogeneous tumors. Analysis of tumor cells isolated by single-cell RNA-Sequencing across six patients and two independent data sources using protein activity inference has revealed three molecularly distinct subphenotypes of cholangiocarcinoma cells, present to varying degrees across patients but with highly conserved proteomic signatures, and predicted to be sensitive to four drugs by regulatory network analysis. A seventh independent patient recapitulated these phenotypes, and drug sensitivity predictions at single-cell level for this patient were validated in low-passage, patient-derived xenografts from the same patient, which confirmed tumor growth rate control by two of these drugs (plicamycin and dacinostat) and further validated predicted subpopulation-specific effects, such that dacinostat alone inhibited tumor growth across all three tumor subphenotypes, while plicamycin preferentially inhibited some but not all, allowing the remaining phenotypes to reconstitute a treatment-resistant tumor. This approach suggests dacinostat as a promising candidate for follow-up clinical trials in cholangiocarcinoma, either alone or in combination with current standard-of-care chemotherapies, and is highly generalizable to elucidate complementary dependencies of other aggressive, heterogeneous tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Systems biology,Cholangiocarcinoma,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Prior work demonstrates that human pancreatic tumors comprise malignant cells in a mixture of multiple cell states with distinct genetic dependencies, leading to a reservoir of chemoresistance across the tumor; targeting just one or two malignant cell states is insufficient to achieve durable therapeutic responses. One approach to overcome this challenge is to identify agents with efficacy against malignant cells in multiple cell states. However, in the absence of genetic distinctions between cell states, identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities for each malignant cell state present in a patient&#8217;s tumor in real time remains a challenge. OncoTreat is a CLIA certified algorithm that matches drugs to patients based on tumor gene expression profiles. The approach utilizes regulatory network analysis, a systems biology framework that transforms gene expression data into regulatory protein activity profiles, in a manner that facilitates the identification of master transcriptional regulators of cell state. We carried out a Phase 1 clinical trial of the OncoTreat framework to examine feasibility for implementing RNA-based precision medicine in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (2<sup>nd<\/sup> line and beyond). Patient-derived xenografts were established from subjects prior to 1<sup>st<\/sup> line therapy, and selected agents matched by OncoTreat were assessed co-clinically while subjects received standard of care regimens, with the potential for subsequent treatment with successful agents upon progression. Two subjects in the study matched to selenexor, an XPO1 inhibitor that is FDA approved for multiple myeloma. Co-clinical studies of selinexor in patient-derived xenograft models generated from the matched subjects showed prolonged survival compared to control regimens. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of these tumors found that the activity of master regulators confirmed that the activity of selinexor-responsive master regulators were inverted in response to treatment <i>in vivo<\/i>, reducing the fraction of malignant cells in the tumors. Strikingly, selenexor treatment was associated with significant inhibition of RAS\/MAPK signaling, suggesting a potential novel role for selinexor targeting Ras. Together, these data indicate a potential therapeutic vulnerability for a subset of PDAC patients that can be predicted by a CLIA-certified RNA-based precision medicine platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Pancreatic cancer,Systems biology,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Uterine serous cancer (USC) and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) are high grade ECs characterized by <i>TP53<\/i> mutation and molecular alterations suggesting high replication stress (RS) and cell cycle dysregulation. These molecular alterations could engender sensitivity to RS-targeting strategies such as WEE1 inhibition. In a single arm phase 2 of 35 patients, the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib demonstrated clinical activity in recurrent USC, with an overall response rate of 29.4%. To support the development of predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to RS targeting agents, we report on the establishment of co-clinical EC PDOs from pre- and on-treatment biopsies from patients with USC or UCS enrolled to a translational trial of adavosertib.<br \/>Methods: Patients with USC or UCS consented for trial participation underwent pre- and on-treatment biopsies while receiving adavosertib monotherapy. Biopsies were dissociated and passaged as 3D organoid cultures in Matrigel in an optimized media. Established PDOs were seeded in 3D microfluidic devices, treated with adavosertib in a dose-dependent manner and assessed for viability after 6 days of treatment by dual labeling live\/dead imaging. IC50 values were calculated using log(inhibitor) vs response - variable slope (four parameters) model in GraphPad Prism. To assess the effect of adavosertib on replication fork speed, DNA fiber assays were conducted with PDOs treated with adavosertib for 72 hours. Finally, FFPE blocks were created from PDOs for assessment of DNA damage repair biomarkers by IHC.<br \/>Results: 19 biopsies were obtained from 11 participating patients. 6 biopsies did not yield sufficient tumor cells for PDO generation. From the remaining 13 samples, 5 PDOs were successfully established (3 USC and 2 UCS), with a higher success rate when 3 biopsy cores were received (3 of 4; 75%) compared to when 2 biopsy cores were received (2 of 9; 22 %). Dual labeling live\/dead imaging of PDOs treated with adavosertib resulted in IC50 values ranging from 113nM to 856nM. DNA fiber assays revealed consistent decrease in fork speed with adavosertib exposure, consistent with the hypothesized effect of adavosertib in increasing RS in these cells. A dose dependent effect on replication fork speed was observed, with greater decreases in fork speed with increasing concentrations of adavosertib. Due to the limited number of samples and the number of PDOs generated from on-treatment as opposed to pre-treatment biopsies, clinical correlation between PDO adavosertib sensitivity and clinical activity was not formally assessed. IHC analysis of potential DNA damage biomarkers is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: We describe the successful establishment of co-clinical EC PDOs for functional evaluation of sensitivity to RS targeting agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Organoids,Cell cycle regulation,WEE1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Here we introduce the use of targeted proteomics coupled with NGS as tools to assess oncogenic alterations along with quantitative protein expression in patients with mCRC. Our proteomics panel included proteins that are antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) targets (ERBB 1-4, TROP2, CEACAM5 etc.) as well as proteins involved in sensitivity to ADC payload (SLFN11, drug efflux pump, TOP1 etc.).<br \/>Methods: The HORIZON III trial (NCT00384176) evaluated FOLFOX + bevacizumab or cediranib as first-line treatment in patients with mCRC (Schmoll <i>J Clin Oncol<\/i> 2012). In the current analysis, a subset of samples from the HORIZON III trial were assessed for molecular alterations using NGS and proteomics. Pre-existing HER2 IHC scores were used as previously referenced (Cecchi <i>J Clin Oncol<\/i> 2023). Samples were processed (n=135) with an automated extraction and library preparation method, then sequenced with both a Whole Exome and targeted-custom gene panel. NGS analysis had a success rate of 116\/135 samples (87.3%). Absolute quantitation of protein targets was performed using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry after collecting tumor epithelial cells by laser microdissection and punch biopsies (n=60) followed by trypsin digestion.<br \/>Results: The NGS analysis showed that patients had mutated <i>RAS<\/i> (50%), <i>BRAF<\/i> (10%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (16%), and TMB-H (18%) and MSI-H (5%) status. A distinguished pattern of mutual exclusivity among <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations is evident. The HER2-positive patients were wildtype <i>RAS<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, and <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, MSS and TMB-L. Samples that were IHC HER2-positive matched those with NGS <i>ERBB2<\/i> amplification. Using PRM, nearly all the evaluable samples had detectable HER2. HER2 IHC 3+ sample showed the highest protein expression at 30,000 amol\/ug (equivalent to 1M receptors\/cell). Within the HER2-negative patients, HER2 protein expression showed broad dynamic range. CEACAM5 and HER2 are the only ADC targets that reached the level of 1M receptors\/cell. Highest TROP2 protein expression is 5 times lower than the highest HER2 value.<br \/>Conclusions: Our preliminary findings for this cohort indicate the benefit of the use of multi-modal methodologies to inform better strategies for patient stratification and precision medicine, though further assessment of proteogenomic characteristics is needed. This data may inform future clinical development and guide patient eligibility to clinical trials and possible treatment sequencing for ADCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Cancer markers,Colorectal cancer,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>William  J.

Identifying therapeutic targets at the protein and pathway level and demonstrating treatment response in personalized models hold great promise, particularly for combination therapies, but may be considered complex and time consuming. Here, we present the case of an adolescent with metastatic, progressive spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation (SETTLE) and evaluate how proteomics combined with rapid patient-derived models can identify treatment options not apparent at the genome or transcript level.<br \/>Mass spectrometric proteome analysis of macro-dissected tumor and adjacent normal from formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections was completed within two weeks of biopsy and identified key proteins involved in one-carbon metabolism, including SHMT2 and DHFR as possible targets for single or combination therapy. Elevated SHMT2 levels were validated by immunohistochemistry and compared to levels across AYA tumors. Based on the suitability for an innovative therapy trial, we prioritized single-agent sertraline, a commercially available anti-depressant medication that inhibits SHMT2, and confirmed a positive drug response in both chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and larval zebrafish xenografts generated from the patient. Retrospective expansion in a murine xenograft enabled metabolic tracing on isolated SETTLE- patient-derived xenograft cells using <sup>13<\/sup>C<sub>6<\/sub>-glucose confirming SHMT2 activity and response to <i>in vitro <\/i>treatment. Following failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy and second-line sorafenib treatment, a monotherapy trial of sertraline was initiated by the patient but stopped after 8 weeks after evidence of progressive disease. Possible combination therapies were evaluated further in the patient-derived models. Combining sertraline with the common antibiotic trimethoprim, resulted in enhanced growth inhibition of SETTLE cells in the larval zebrafish xenografts.<br \/><i><\/i>Significance: Overall, we demonstrate that proteomics and personalized xenograft models may provide supportive pre-clinical data in a clinically meaningful timeframe to support medical decision-making and impact clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Personalized medicine,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

Virtually every drug examined exhibits polypharmacology inhibiting many kinases. Rarely does the intended target represent the greatest inhibition observed from a drug. Furthermore, most drugs inhibit a select group of mutant kinases, including especially mutants of kinases distinct from the intended target. Within a given kinase, each cancer-identified mutation is often as distinct as the different wild-type kinases are from each other, in terms of inhibition profile. Considering mutants, then, the cancer-relevant druggable kinome is many thousand distinct targets, not 518 &#8220;plus a few&#8221;. Exposing this reality is a first step towards developing all the therapeutic tools necessary to ultimately defeat cancer. Here, we reveal vast and specific repurposing opportunities among the existing pharmacopeia for tumors that are driven by kinases not previously recognized as targets for certain drugs, and for tumors that have become chemotherapy-resistant through mutation of specific kinases.

While most approaches focus on DNA aberrancies on targeted panels, not all patients&#8217; tumors show targetable genomic alterations in these limited gene sets, indicating a need for more comprehensive methodologies combining whole exome (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) to direct a larger fraction of patients to therapies. Here, we aimed to compare the feasibility and utility of BostonGene&#8217;s (BG) analytical platform with WES and RNAseq to two targeted exome panels in identifying actionable alterations and therapy selection for patients with metastatic solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Study enrolled patients with solid tumors who have had next-generation-sequencing (NGS) testing with one of two tissue-based targeted exome sequencing panels, Oncomine (ThermoFisher, 148 genes), or MDA-MAPP (615 genes) with identification of no College of American Pathologists Tier-1 actionable DNA alterations between August 2022 and November 2023. Patients&#8217; tissue and blood\/saliva samples were subjected to BG&#8217;s NGS platform. An alteration-level actionability analysis was done upon receipt of WES results to inform treatment decision making, based on functional and therapeutic effects of the alterations detected.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 64 patients were enrolled; testing was cancelled for 7 patients (10.9%) with samples showing &#60;10% tumor content, while 5 patients&#8217; reports were pending at the time of data analysis. Median turn-around time from consent to sample acquisition (SA) and from SA to available genomic profile were 8 and 15.5 days, respectively. 52 patients had NGS results representing a diverse group of tumor types, including sarcoma (<i>n=<\/i>11, 21.2%), head and neck (<i>n=9<\/i>, 17.3%) and mesothelioma (<i>n=5<\/i>, 9.6%). BG reported DNA alterations (mean: 3.75; median: 4) not shown by prior testing for 94.2% (49\/52) of patients, whereby the most common alteration types included SNVs (43.1%), deletions (23.6%) and amplifications (11.8%). BG identified additional actionable DNA alterations (referred to as &#8220;AAs&#8221;; mean: 1.9, median: 2) in 32 (61.5%) patients, whereby majority of AAs were deletions (59.7%) and amplifications (27.4%). BG detected AAs in 58.8% (10\/17) vs 62.9% (22\/35) of patients for whom the same vs different samples were used across different tests compared (<i>P=<\/i>0.8). Of 32 patients with AAs, 7 (21.9%) were directed to DNA-informed treatments within 6 months based upon the new genomic findings reported by BG, 14 (43.8%) are being followed for treatment matching, while 11 (34.4%) were deceased.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> Our results show the feasibility and utility of comprehensive molecular testing to match patients to WES-informed treatments within a clinically relevant time frame.

We conducted a comprehensive profiling of cfDNA fragmentomics, whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), and genome-wide DNA methylation on two metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) samples to systematically investigate molecular aberrations in mCRPC.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Two mCRPC patient plasma samples were extensively profiled using high-depth 150x whole-genome sequencing (WGS), 30x whole-genome methylation, and cfRNA WTS. CfDNA fragmentomics analysis was performed to assess androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity. We calculated fragment coverage around AR binding sites (ARBS) and quantified ARBS nucleosome profiling abnormality scores (ARBS scores) by comparing centric fragment coverage with normal plasma background. Additionally, we calculated fragment size entropy around AR promoter and enhancer regions to reflect AR gene expression activity. Fragmentomics-inferred gene activity was validated through promoter-targeted panels and WTS profiling of matched mCRPC samples.<br \/><b>Results <\/b> Both mCRPC plasma samples exhibited significant ARBS nucleosome depletion. Sample A showed a higher ARBS score compared to Sample B. Interestingly, AR enhancer activity inferred from high-depth WGS and targeted panels was high in both samples, while AR promoter activity was high only in Sample A. Genome-wide DNA methylation revealed hypo-methylation in AR enhancer and ARBS regions in both samples, with Sample A showing more pronounced hypo-methylation. Copy number variation analysis indicated AR amplification in Sample A and RB1 loss in Sample B. Collectively, these findings suggest that Sample A may represent androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer (ARPC), while Sample B may have developed resistance to androgen therapy, possibly indicating neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>This study, to our knowledge, is the first to combine high-depth WGS, promoter-targeted panels, WTS, and genome-wide DNA methylation to systematically study epigenomic and transcriptional dysregulation in mCRPC. The integration of mutation, copy number variation, fragmentomics, and DNA methylation profiling holds potential clinical utility for inferring prostate cancer subtypes, facilitating patient stratification, and guiding treatment selection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,cfDNA fragmentomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The survival rate lags behind four decades ago (81% vs 87%), underscoring the critical need for more effective treatment strategies. The heterogeneous nature of EC contributes to varied outcomes with current treatments. This project aims to establish reliable EC models for characterizing each individual tumor, distinguish optimal drug treatment, and determine specific drug effect mechanisms for personalized therapy.<br \/>Methods: Freshly collected tumors were used for patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) and patient-derived primary cancer cells (PDCs). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to confirm the tumors grown in mice faithfully replicate the characteristics of patient tumor tissues. FDA-approved anticancer drugs were used to screen the optimal drugs to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and further utilized to inhibit tumor growth using PDXs.<br \/>Results: We have collected 26 EC tumors and characterize them by DNA mutation and RNA-seq analysis. We implanted them in NSG mice, and 16 tumor samples have successfully grown in mice with a success rate of 61%. Most PDXs can be faithfully passaged to three generations. From the 16 PDXs, we created six novel PDCs. Using 2D and 3D spheroid cell culture, we screened 133 FDA-approved oncology drugs in the EC-PDC models. The drug screening results clearly highlighted several standout drugs, including CUDC-907 (a dual PI3K\/HDAC inhibitor), two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors including romidepsin and panobinostat, four topoisomerase II (TOP II) inhibitors including mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and epirubicin, two proteasome inhibitors including carfilzomib and bortezomib, 2 DNA-directed RNA synthesis inhibitor dactinomycin and plicamycin, omacetaxine mepesuccinate (protein synthesis inhibitor), and valrubicin (DNA synthesis inhibitor). These drugs have demonstrated a significant capacity to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Our pilot studies using single drugs, CUDC-907, romidepsin and mitoxantrone, achieved moderate drug effects. Combine mitoxantrone with romidepsin or CUDC-907 show surprisingly synergistic effects in multiple PDC models. The combination strategy will be tested in PDXs in the near future.<br \/>Conclusion: Our unique PDXs and PDCs are excellent models for representing various characteristics of EC and testing novel therapeutics. This current study presents a promising direction for developing personalized therapy options for EC patients and provides a platform for further investigation of drug mechanisms and tumor development. Future studies will also involve etiology, such as chronic psychological stress, DNAm age and intratumoral microbiome. This information will help with endometrial cancer prevention, diagnosis, and prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Drug sensitivity,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

However, the probability of complete resection decreases after multiple recurrences, in which case systemic treatment is an alternative option. Response rates of systemic therapy are variable, resistance is a problem and it is difficult to predict which therapy will work in which patient. Drug screen testing on patient-derived aGCT cell lines may offer a solution.<br \/>Methods: In a national prospective study on aGCT, fresh tissue was collected immediately after surgery. Tumor tissue was cultured and developed into 2D cell lines. Both clinically applicable and experimental drugs were tested on the patient-derived cell lines and two control cell lines. Dose-response curves and synergy were calculated using GraphPad Prism and Compusyn software.<br \/>Results: We cultured 34 patient-derived cell lines from tissue of seven patients with primary aGCT and from 13 patients with recurrence. In eight patients multiple sites were cultured. A total of 27 drugs were tested, including 10 monotherapies and 17 combinations. Carboplatin\/gemcitabine showed efficacy and synergy 33 of 34 patient-derived cell lines (97%), in contrast to the regular carboplatin\/paclitaxel and carboplatin\/etoposide combinations (50% and 74%, respectively). The experimental combinations alpelisib\/fulvestrant and alpelisib\/gemcitabine showed efficacy of more than 75%. Testing of anti-hormonal therapy was not sufficiently reliable with this technique.<br \/>Conclusion: Drug screening on patient-derived tumor cell lines adequately reflects the reality of the variable response to systemic therapy in aGCT. In future research, this technique could be used to personalize the systemic treatment of aGCT patients. The response to carboplatin\/gemcitabine in our patient-derived cell lines is striking.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Drug synergy,Chemotherapy response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

When applied in a clinical setting, synergistic combinations can have significant benefits including improved patient response and avoiding or overcoming drug resistance. Although multiple strategies have been successfully implemented to identify rational drug combinations, extensive validation is initially required to confirm a combination as synergistic. The existence and growing use of web-based repositories containing comprehensive drug combination data is a key resource and can be a valuable starting point for identifying synergistic combinations. However, are synergistic combinations from these datasets expected or rational and can they be validated experimentally? By mining available drug combinations from the DrugCombo database, we wanted to identify unusual drug combinations reported as synergistic and experimentally validate these with dose-response assays. In addition, we set out to establish if cytokines could be used as an inhibition biomarker to easily assess synergy. We found multiple unexpected synergies including a predicted synergy between the JAK1\/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib with Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, or Levetiracetam, an SV2A binding anti-epileptic reported in the lymphoma cell line, L-1236. Experimentally, these predicted synergies could not be validated. In the context of synergistic drug combinations, this work shows that experimental validation is crucial, particularly for combinations with uncertain biological mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug synergy,Combination studies,Lymphoma,JAK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"R.

Wnt pathway activation is common in GI cancers, with the pathogenic upstream Wnt pathway variant sub-population (RNF43 loss of function \/ RSPO gain of function) showing a combined prevalence of 4.7% in GI cancer patients; pre-clinically this sub-population shows exquisite sensitivity to RXC004, a small molecule Porcupine inhibitor. A striking co-occurrence of upstream Wnt pathway variants with MAPK pathway driver mutations (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS) was detected in 77% of Microsatellite stable (MSS) GI cancers, suggesting co-inhibiting these pathways could enhance clinical activity in these patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: <i>In vitro<\/i> proliferation assays were performed in pre-clinical models of upstream Wnt pathway mutated MSS GI cancer (SNU-1411, HPAF-II and AsPC-1) using Wnt (RXC004) or MAPK (Trametinib) pathway inhibitors at multiple concentrations as single agents or in combination. Control cells with downstream Wnt pathway mutations (WiDr and HCT116) were also tested. Synergistic combination effects were detected by BLISS scores. RXC004 (1.5mg\/kg QD) and Trametinib (0.3mg\/kg QD) were evaluated in an RSPO-fusion xenograft model (SNU-1411) as single agents or in combination. Efficacy was measured by tumour volume and weight; PD markers were assessed in end of study tumour samples. Relative<i> AXIN2<\/i> and <i>DUSP6<\/i> gene expression changes were determined upon inhibitor treatment by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RXC004 in combination with Trametinib demonstrated strong anti-proliferative synergy in SNU-1411 cells and moderate synergy\/additivity in HPAF-II and AsPC-1 cells; no synergy was observed in control cells. <i>In vivo<\/i>, RXC004 and Trametinib monotherapy led to significant moderate tumour growth control (p&#60;0.05) at the doses tested, whereas their combination led to significantly enhanced efficacy (p&#60;0.05). Gene expression analysis demonstrated a reciprocal Wnt\/MAPK signaling mechanism; RXC004 strongly suppressed Wnt signaling (AXIN2) but increased MAPK signaling (DUSP6), whilst Trametinib strongly suppressed MAPK signaling (DUSP6) but increased Wnt signaling (AXIN2). Combination of RXC004 and Trametinib sustained inhibition of both Wnt and MAPK signalling. Similar effects were observed with inhibitors of other MAPK pathway components.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Wnt and MAPK pathways are frequently co-activated in GI cancers, particularly in the upstream Wnt pathway mutated sub-population.

Despite an initial high rate of complete remission, most of the patients relapse with a platinum resistant disease. Patients with resistant tumors have few options, including monotherapy with gemcitabine, and new effective therapeutic alternatives are needed. The Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a master regulator of mitosis and recent evidences suggest its role in interfering with several DNA repair mechanisms. We investigated the effect of onvansertib (ONVA), a highly selective ATP-competitor PLK1 inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin (CARBO) and gemcitabine (GEM) in platinum-resistant HGOC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).<br \/>Methods: The combination of ONVA with either CARBO or GEM was investigated in two platinum-resistant HGOC PDXs, one intrinsically resistant to platinum (MNHOC#315), the other made resistant after repeated <i>in vivo<\/i> treatments with cisplatin (MNHOC#266R). Tumors were subcutaneously (s.c.; MNHOC#315) or orthotopically (i.p.; MNHOC#266R) transplanted in nude mice, mice were treated for 4 weeks with vehicle, single agents or drug combinations and followed for tumor growth (s.c. model) and survival.<br \/>Results: CARBO- and GEM-ONVA combinations were well tolerated, with a maximum body weight loss of 6.6%. Both combinations showed strong anti-tumor activities in the two tested models. In MNHOC#315 PDX, CARBO- and GEM-ONVA combinations caused a tumor stabilization that extended beyond the dosing period and resulted in a higher tumor growth inhibition as compared to vehicle and single agents treated mice. In i.p.

Current data is insufficient in establishing the role of PARP inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the setting of third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use. Preclinical investigation suggests heightened PARP inhibitor sensitivity of TKI-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC cells compared to TKI-sensitive cells.<br \/>Methods: We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the prevalence of HRD gene mutations in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. We also present a case demonstrating a favorable response to the dual therapy of olaparib and osimertinib in NSCLC harboring EGFR, RAD50, and ARID1A mutations that progressed on osimertinib.<br \/>Results: There were 2298 patients in the NSCLC cohort (MSKCC database). Among 687 patients with EGFR mutations, 24 patients (3.5%) exhibited ARID1A mutations, 8 patients (1.2%) had BRCA1 mutations, 11 patients (1.6%) had BRCA2 mutations, and 5 (0.7%) had RAD50 mutations. A 71-year-old female presented with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. She had recurrent malignant pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis for previous cardiac tamponade. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a 3cm irregular left hilar mass with bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Tissue next generation sequencing (NGS) at baseline identified EGFR exon19 deletion along with RAD50 R726H which is a HRD pathway gene. Circulating tumor DNA (ct-DNA) NGS (Guardant360) showed EGFR E746_A750del 4.8%. The patient achieved partial response to osimertinib for 28 months. Follow-up CT showed disease progression. Olaparib 200mg twice daily was added to osimertinib based on repeat ct-DNA NGS indicating a new ARID1A alteration (splice site SNV) along with the known BRCA1 mutation. Follow up scans currently have consistently demonstrated ongoing partial response for 19 months. Combining olaparib with osimertinib can be effective in an osimertinib-resistant NSCLC patient with EGFR mutation and HRD aberration. The favorable response could be attributed not only to pre-existing RAD50 mutation but also to acquired mutations in ARID1A HRD genes.<br \/>Conclusion: HRD aberrations are uncommon in EGFR mutated lung cancer patients. Further investigation on the role of PARP inhibitor in EGFR mutated lung cancer is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,NSCLC,Homologous recombination,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

It is characterized by extreme heterogeneity and high-risk tumors often resulting in poor prognosis. Currently, chemotherapy is a prevailing standard treatment for neuroblastoma. However, it is plagued by multiple challenges such as drug resistance and debilitating side effects. Synergistic drug combination is proposed as an innovative approach to potentially improve clinical outcomes of single-agent chemotherapy. We propose a novel approach to screen for effective chemo-synergistic drug combinations using Bioinspired nanodroplet processing (BioNDP) screening platform. This platform overcomes the limitations of conventional drug screening approaches, including the requirement for large cell numbers and the low translation rate from bench to bedside. In this study, we utilize TH-MYCN transgenic mice, a well-known genetically engineered mouse model of neuroblastoma that recapitulates critical genetic and clinical aspects of high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. With its genetically homogeneous background and spontaneous tumor development, TH-MYCN mice offer a valuable comparison to traditional xenograft mouse models. We have also developed an optimal procedure of primary murine tumor isolation using both negative and positive selection approaches. The purity of the isolated cells was verified with GD2 expression, one of well-known marker of neuroblastoma. In addition, we have successfully identified an effective drug combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, using primary neuroblastoma tumor samples derived from TH-MYCN transgenic mice as a target. The <i>in vitro<\/i> synergistic effect of primary mouse tumor cell cytotoxicity was confirmed by using luminescent cell viability assay. Further <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of this selected drug combination in suppressing tumor growth and improving survival rate in all TH-MYCN transgenic mice treated. To sum up, we aim to establish a future patient-centric paradigm by which minimal primary cell samples from a personalized biopsy of patients may undergo drug screening, leading to the identification of a tailored drug combination. The BioNDP platform we developed may become a pivotal resource for personalized therapy to ensure a faster and more efficient treatment strategy for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Neuroblastoma,Synergism,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.-T.

Current treatment options for NEPC are only palliative, and most patients die within several months. Additionally, single-agent clinical trials targeting NEPC so far have only produced disappointing results, highlighting the clear need to develop effective combinatorial therapies for NEPC. <i>RB1<\/i> loss, a pivotal event in the development of NEPC, can sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis in multiple cancer cell types, including prostate cancer. Here, we aim to identify an optimal combinatorial therapy for NEPC based on targeting ferroptosis.<br \/>Methods: We determined the cell-killing efficacy of ferroptosis inducers and several current and emerging treatment regimens for NEPC as single agents, then performed drug synergism analyses of the above two potent treatments. Lastly, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of drug synergism by examining the major types of cell death induced by combinatorial treatment through molecular and biochemical assays.<br \/>Results: Our results demonstrated that both ferroptosis inducers and BCL2 inhibitors as single agents led to robust cell death in NEPC cell lines tested. In contrast, cisplatin, the standard of care for NEPC, and Aurora kinase A inhibitor showed modest to no cell-killing effect. Furthermore, suboptimal doses of ferroptosis inducers and BCL-2 inhibitors synergistically induced cell death in NEPC cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found that low-dose ferroptosis inducer led to increased production of mitochondria ROS, which in turn exacerbated BCL-2 suppression-induced apoptosis.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel combinatorial therapy for NEPC. Based on our in vitro data, we will further test the <i>in vivo<\/i> therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis inducers combined with BCL-2 inhibitors against NEPC growth.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine tumors,Prostate cancer,Combination therapy,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.-E.

For well-understood mutations, this has created the opportunity for individualized therapeutic intervention in a wide range of malignancies. Beyond these well-characterized mutations, there exists a wide range of alterations that remain poorly understood and which require some kind of functional genomics analysis to determine whether such patients are eligible for the targeted therapy used for more typical mutations in that gene, whether these alterations are passenger mutations that don&#8217;t affect throughput on the associated signaling pathway, or reflect another more nuanced phenomenon.<br \/>Whether using ectopic overexpression in cell lines or generation of genetically modified mice, addressing this problem at scale using functional genomics approaches is challenging. A key limitation is the absence of the original tissue context in which that variant co-evolved with other genetic alterations as well as data on the clinical response of the patient to successive lines of therapy. This can be addressed, in part, by the banking of tissue from patient cohorts who have had comprehensive genomic profiling as part of their routine clinical care.<br \/>The Gundersen Precision Oncology Cohort is a growing dataset of FFPE specimens and longitudinal clinical data from more than 750 patients who have had comprehensive cancer genome profiling using assays from a wide range of diagnostic companies. We use this resource for biomarker discovery and functional classification of many atypical cancer variants. Current subgroups include atypical point mutations in BRAF, ERBB2 and ERBB3, as well as fusions affecting BRAF, PIK3CA and ROS1.

Samples were obtained from multiple cancer centers across the US and abroad. Patients were at all stages in their clinical journey ranging from treatment na&#239;ve to late stage, recurrent\/refractory disease settings. Fresh specimens obtained from surgical resections, core biopsies, or body fluids arrived at our CLIA laboratory within 48 hrs from collection. Tumor origin and driver mutations were confirmed by IHC or DNA sequence in 88% of the cases.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: PDTCs derived from 403 patients diagnosed with 42 different solid tumor types, including both common and rare tumors, were subjected to the PARIS<sup>&#174;<\/sup> assay. An average of 67 oncology drugs (ranging from 6-307), including chemotherapies and targeted agents, were tested for each patient sample. A report ranking drug sensitivities was provided to the oncologist with an average turnaround time of less than 3 weeks. Drug sensitivity was classified as exceptional\/good, moderate\/low and no responses. Remarkably, 94.2% of the PDTCs exhibited selective exceptional\/good responses to at least one, and typically several drugs, despite the majority of PDTCs being derived from patients with drug resistant, metastatic disease. The drug sensitivity profiles showed highly individualized responses as well as tumor type specificity. While known biomarkers\/drug sensitivity associations were confirmed, many samples exhibited sensitivity to targeted agents in the absence of known biomarkers. For example, HER2+ breast cancers demonstrated sensitivity to HER2\/EGFR inhibitor and a subset of luminal B and triple negative breast cancers demonstrated HER2\/EGFRi responses without underlying genetic alterations. Functional testing was also useful in the rare tumor types. For example, low grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) cells, differentiated from high grade by their response to specific receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and estrogen antagonists, but a poor response to standard of care, as is observed in the clinic. Three patients with LGSOC that were treated with the PARIS test top scoring drugs had a positive clinical response and cases from other tumor types will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Functional testing of PDTCs from both common and rare tumor types is feasible, even for those that have failed standard of care. We provide an unprecedented view of patient-specific, actionable vulnerabilities to current oncology drugs.

Recurrent HGG pose even greater therapeutic challenge. The integration of functional precision medicine (FPM), in which drugs screens are performed on live tissue, into clinical routine practice presents a promising alternative by offering personalized treatments based on the unique characteristics of the patient&#8217;s tumor. Here, we present our institutional experience of integrating a spheroid-based drug screening assay (3D Predict<sup>TM<\/sup> Glioma) in the treatment management of HGG patients to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy as a therapeutic tool in a clinical setting. We also sought to determine factors that related to assay success.<i> <\/i>Tissue from intracranial lesions of patients with presumed HGG and planned surgical resection at our institution were collected for ex vivo 3D cell culture and challenged with 12 drug agents to determine patient-specific response parameters. The impact of potential variables, such as ki67, tumor pathology, and shipment timing, on the assay&#8217;s success was evaluated. Clinical correlation was established between ex vivo response and clinical response in HGG patients. 57 samples, including 24 upfront HGGs, 32 recurrent HGGs, and one medulloblastoma, were sent for spheroid formation and drug testing. In total, 57.9% (33\/57) or 23% (13\/57) of the assays were successful and resulted in complete or partial functional profiling data, respectively. We conducted a multivariable analysis of our cohort to determine which variables (i.e. tumor volume sent, ki-67 proliferation index, tumor percentage determined by DNA sequencing by Tempus Lab, recurrent status, sample shipment time) were predictive of assay success. The only variable significantly associated with assay success was tumor percentage with samples comprised of &#62;70% tumor leading to assay success, 40%-70% leading to 60% chance of success, and &#60;40% having 0% success.<i> <\/i>Among 46 patients with partial or complete assay success, 26 patients (56.5%) had a targetable mutation and 17\/26 yielded a moderate or full response to one or more of their corresponding targeted drugs in the assay. Treatments were newly administered or altered from prior treatments in 40\/57 patients (70%) based on FPM results. Our study demonstrates the technical feasibility of incorporating FPM approaches in the development of treatment regimens for patients with HGG. Success was correlated to tumor percentage present in the sample which indicates intraoperative communication between surgeon and pathologist can lead to improved assay results. Our institutional protocol demonstrates that Integrating FPM into routine clinical practice is possible and can serve as a valuable guide in the refinement of therapeutic recommendations for HGG patients.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Precision medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

This high mortality rate is linked to the development of resistance to first-line chemotherapy with platinum compounds which has been attributed in part to increased activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The anti-diabetic drug Metformin was previously shown to inhibit the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells and thus, the combination of a FAK inhibitor, Y15, and Metformin may be a promising treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the combination of Y15 and Metformin on PROC cell viability and the mechanism of cell death. An MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability in PROC OVCAR3 cells after 48 h of treatment by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate reader. Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP and the autophagy marker LC3B-II. The exposure of OVCAR3 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells to Metformin (4.5 mM) + Y15 (5.5 &#181;M) resulted in a significantly enhanced cytotoxicity (32.6 &#177; 1.8%) compared to single drug treatment with either Metformin (4.5 mM) (65.0 &#177; 4.2%) or Y15 (5.5 &#181;M) (66.0 &#177; 4.8%). A combination of Metformin (7.8 mM) + Y15 (5.5 &#181;M) also resulted in a significantly enhanced cytotoxicity (22.8 &#177; 1.5%) compared to single drug treatment with either Metformin (7.8 mM) (50.7 &#177; 3.7%) or Y15 (5.5 &#181;M) (66.0 &#177; 4.8%). Cells treated with the combination of Metformin and Y15 for 24, 48, and 72-hours showed an increase in cleaved PARP compared to the control, Metformin alone and Y15 alone. For Metformin alone, there was an increase in cleaved PARP compared to the control at all timepoints and increased from 24 hours to 72 hours. For Y15 alone, the amount of cleaved PARP was also higher compared to the control at all time points, however, decreased over time from 24 hours to 72 hours. Cells treated with Metformin, Y15, and a combination of Metformin and Y15 showed no conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II, which occurs during autophagy. Thus, it is concluded that the mechanism of cell death for both Metformin and Y15 is through apoptosis and not autophagy and apoptosis is enhanced with the combination of the drugs. The delivery of Metformin and Y15 can result in an additive effect on cell viability through apoptosis and can be further explored as a promising approach for the treatment of PROC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metformin,Y15,FAK Inhibitor,apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Consequently, the development of effective therapeutic strategies holds significant importance in enhancing patient outcomes. In contrast to single-drug treatments, combination therapies offer the potential for improved results by addressing multiple pathways. This approach not only reduces the likelihood of drug resistance but also encourages synergistic effects, all while permitting the use of lower individual drug doses, thus minimizing potential side effects. In this study, we subjected a panel of PDAC cell lines with varying degrees of sensitivity to a high-throughput combinatorial drug screen. Mitochondrial complex 1\/p97 inhibitor NMS-873 was tested in combination with 95 other compounds, revealing remarkable synergy when paired with Glut1 inhibitor BAY-876. In order to affirm the validity of these findings, we conducted further experiments involving multi-dose drug combinations within long-term clonogenic assays. These supplementary investigations also demonstrated significant synergistic effects between BAY-876 and NMS-873, as quantified through the calculation of Bliss and Zip scores. Notably, this combination exhibited superior efficacy when confronting PDAC cell lines that are more resistant to NMS-873, highlighting the potential of this combination to overcome therapy resistance. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these outcomes, we performed a gene enrichment analysis which revealed that the more sensitive cell lines exhibited elevated rates of cell division, while the more resistant ones demonstrated heightened cRNA processing and increased metabolic activity, particularly in protein, phospholipid, and lipid synthesis. The combination of BAY-876 and NMS-873 presents a promising avenue for the targeted treatment of PDAC. This study underscores the remarkable synergy observed in mouse PDAC cell lines with a particular emphasis on the heightened efficacy against cell populations that are more resistant to NMS-873. These results warrant further investigation to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and validate these findings in clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Combination therapy,Synergism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

The strategy of combination drug therapy has gradually become a valuable choice for treating various cancer types, addressing the heterogeneity within tumors, and surpassing the constraints of existing treatment methods. In our previous work, when we combined two drugs NCX 4040 (an oxidative stress inducer) and napabucasin (a STAT3 signaling inhibitor), we discovered that the combination treatment synergistically works to inhibit the malignant characteristics of human PCa cells. Also, the combination upregulated the cGAS-STING immunogenic pathway in PCa cells which could potentially activate the cancer-targeting cytotoxic T-cells. In the current study, we aimed at investigating the anti-stemness properties of the drug duo which can not only inhibit cancer cell differentiation but also can be effective in preventing cancer relapse. We used two cell lines i.e., BPH-Cd which served as a model of cadmium induced PCa and DU145 as a model of advanced PCa to examine the anti-stemness properties of the drug combination. Based on western-blot analysis, we found the downregulation of transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, &#946;-catenin and cell surface markers like CD44, CD133 and ALDHA1, which are responsible for stem-cell like properties. In addition, we have tested the combinatory anticancer effects in transgenic mouse derived PCa cell line (Myc-Cap) as a prelude to conduct future studies in FVB mouse syngeneic model to evaluate the tumor suppressive and the antitumor immunogenic responses of combination treatment as it activated cGAS-STING pathway. By performing the cell viability assay, we found that the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of NCX 4040 is ~10&#181;M and that of napabucasin is ~1&#956;M, however when used in combination, ~90% inhibition is seen at 10&#181;M of NCX and 250nM of napabucasin dual treatment. The drug combination also showed synergy in inhibiting tumorigenicity in clonogenic assay and migratory potential in wound-healing assay. By investigating the ROS production, cell death and cell cycle mechanism using flow cytometric analysis, it was observed that the combination therapy synergistically induces cellular oxidative stress which causes cancer cells to undergo late apoptosis and halts the growth of Myc-Cap cells in G2M phase of cell cycle. In conclusion, our data suggests that combination therapy of NCX 4040 and napabucasin can be potential treatment strategy for PCa warranting further evaluation in <i>in vivo<\/i> models<i>.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD133,Prostate cancer,Cadmium,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
