[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Carcinomas in childhood are rare, limiting our understanding of their epidemiology. While congenital anomalies are one of the strongest risk factors for childhood cancer overall, their association with carcinomas is understudied. We evaluated the associations between chromosomal and non-chromosomal congenital anomalies and risk of carcinoma through age 18 years.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We leveraged the Genetic Overlap Between Anomalies and Cancer in Kids (GOBACK) Cohort, which includes linked data from population-based birth defects and cancer registries for 21 million births between 1990-2018 in nine U.S. states. We used Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the hazard of carcinomas among children with major congenital anomalies relative to children without these conditions, adjusting for sex, state of birth, and maternal age. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding cases diagnosed with carcinomas during the first 2 years of life to assess the potential impact of incidental discovery of anomalies during cancer diagnosis or treatment on our findings.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our study population numbered 21,829,628 children, including 635,632 with major anomalies and 879 with carcinomas (incidence rate: 4.2 per million person-years). Mean follow-up time was 9.6 years. The most common diagnoses were thyroid (N=600 cases) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; N=68 cases). Prevalence of major anomalies was 4.0% in children with carcinomas and 2.9% in children without carcinomas. The hazard of carcinomas was increased for both children with chromosomal or genetic syndromes (HR 5.3, CI 2.6-10.6; N=8) and children with non-syndromic anomalies (HR 1.6, CI 1.2-2.4; N=31). When we evaluated carcinomas by type, we observed associations between 1) chromosomal or genetic syndromes and renal cell carcinoma (HR 57.8, CI 20.7-161.3; N&#60;5), 2) non-syndromic congenital anomalies and HCC (HR 3.8, CI 1.6-8.8; N=6), and to a lesser degree, 3) non-syndromic congenital anomalies and thyroid carcinoma (HR 1.4, CI 0.9-2.2; N=17). Notably, sensitivity analyses suggested associations were not attributable to incidental discovery of anomalies during cancer diagnosis or treatment.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> In this comprehensive assessment of congenital anomalies and carcinomas in children, we report novel associations. The observed associations between congenital anomalies and carcinoma could be due to factors including: 1) common genetic pathways; 2) <i>in utero<\/i> exposures that lead to both conditions; or 3) postnatal exposures among children with congenital anomalies. Ultimately, our findings could yield new insights into the etiologies of carcinomas in childhood and inform clinical surveillance practices for children with congenital anomalies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Incidence,Pediatric cancers,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

However, the majority of drugs examined in previous observational studies have shown inconsistent results with the risk of childhood cancer, and these findings have not been consolidated in drug-specific meta-analyses. To address this gap, a systematic search was conducted in the databases PubMed and Science Citation Index for studies on medication use during pregnancy and the risk of childhood cancer. Studies with exposure to diethylstilbestrol as a known teratogen were excluded. Meta-analyses with estimates for random effects models with 95% confidence intervals were conducted, if at least three studies on the same research question were available. The I&#178; statistic was calculated to quantify between-study heterogeneity. Statistical significance of I<sup>2<\/sup> was analyzed with the Q statistic (<i>P<\/i> value for heterogeneity (<i>P<\/i>)). Study quality was summarized based on a self-developed scoring system with five items. The systematic literature search yielded 2,373 studies, of which 62 were included in the systematic review. We conducted a total of 37 analyses including exposure to 12 different types of medications during pregnancy and 13 different outcomes of childhood cancer. Pooled odds ratios (OR) showed an increased risk of acute leukemia (AL) and its subtype acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after prenatal exposure to antiemetics (AL: OR= 1.47 (95 % confidence interval 1.02; 2.14) I&#178;= 0.0 % <i>P<\/i>= 0.44; ALL: OR= 1.27 (1.01;1.59) I&#178;= 0.0 % <i>P<\/i>= 0.93) and any kind of antibiotics (AL: OR= 1.13 (1.01; 1.27)<i> <\/i>I&#178;= 0.0 % <i>P<\/i>= 0.53; ALL: OR= 1.12 (1.01; 1.24)<i> <\/i>I&#178;= 19.7 % <i>P<\/i>= 0.26). In addition, an increased risk of childhood cancer in general was observed when mothers took nitrosatable antibiotics (OR= 1.32 (1.14; 1.53) I&#178;= 0.0 % <i> P<\/i>= 0.97). Finally, the use of analgesics (OR= 1.40 (1.00; 1.95) I&#178;= 43.8 % <i>P<\/i>= 0.15) during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of neuroblastoma in the offspring. All these analyses did not reveal any indications of heterogeneity between the analyzed studies. The remaining 31 analyses showed no association. Our results suggest that the use of nitrosatable antibiotics during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer. Maternal intake of antibiotics and antiemetics may increase the risk of AL and ALL in their children. An increased risk of childhood neuroblastoma could be associated with prenatal exposure to analgesics. However, the underlying disease of the mother, which is treated with the investigated medication, could be the actual reason for the development of childhood cancer in the offspring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pooled analysis,Pediatric cancers,,Leukemias,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

We sought to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and clinical significance of pathogenic germline variation in cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) in 838 patients profiled in the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA) by whole genome sequencing (n=821) or whole exome sequencing (n=17). Rare variants in 214 CPGs were annotated as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) consistent with American College of Medical Genetics criteria using AutoGVP, our open-source automated pathogenicity assessment tool. To assess enrichment of P\/LP variants in the PBTA, we compared the frequency of CPG P\/LP variants in cases to a tumor-free control cohort from Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB; n=6,295). Somatic alterations, mutational signatures, and gene set enrichment analyses from matched tumor sequencing were integrated to characterize functional consequences associated with germline pathogenic variation. We observed 215 germline P\/LP variants within 76 distinct CPGs in 189 (22.6%) PBTA patients. CPG P\/LP variants were most prevalent among patients with a plexiform neurofibroma diagnosis (9\/14, 64.3%), and least prevalent among patients with craniopharyngioma (3\/39, 7.8%). We detected syndrome-associated P\/LP variants in 45\/58 (77.6%) patients with a clinically reported cancer predisposition syndrome and incidentally in another 37 patients. CPG P\/LP variants were significantly enriched in the PBTA cohort relative to the PMBB control cohort (OR=2.0, p=1.0E-12, CI=1.6-2.4), and <i>NF1<\/i> harbored the most significant excess P\/LP variant burden (OR=30.7, p=4.57E-13, CI=11.2-105.1). We observed a significant enrichment of mismatch repair (MMR) gene P\/LP variants in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) and tumors from MMR P\/LP carriers exhibited significantly higher MMR-deficiency mutational signature exposures relative to tumors from non-carrier HGG patients (SBS14: W=478, p=1.71E-05). Overall, 90\/215 (41.9%) of identified germline P\/LP variants co-occurred with at least one corresponding somatic alteration in matched tumors, including oncogenic SNV (n=5), copy number variation (n=28), loss of heterozygosity (n=54), differential gene expression (n=23), and proximal alternative splicing (n=19). In summary, rare germline P\/LP variants are enriched in PBTA patients and are associated with somatic events in the same gene, resulting in gene- and pathway-specific functional consequences. Our work emphasizes a role for pathogenic germline variation in pediatric CNS tumor development and frequent under-identification of cancer predisposition syndromes, underscoring the importance of germline sequencing in personalized patient care strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma were excluded as surveillance was completed by a separate team. The cohort included 139 patients (50.7%) with a prior tumor history while 135 (49.3%) had no prior cancer. This study reviewed tumors diagnosed, method of detection, clinical course, and patient outcomes. Individual reports from 1,533 surveillance tests including diagnostic imaging, colonoscopy, and upper endoscopy, were assessed and classified for accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for selected surveillance methods, and themes of common strengths or weaknesses of specific imaging modalities were identified.<br \/><b><u>Results<\/u><\/b><b>: <\/b>During the study period from January 1, 2009 - September 31, 2021<b>, <\/b>35 asymptomatic tumors were detected in 27 patients through surveillance (9.9% of the cohort), while five symptomatic tumors were detected in five patients (1.8%) outside of surveillance.

Yet, disparities persist that may influence enrollment patterns. In neuroblastoma, the impact of ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), distance to care, and age at diagnosis on enrollment in therapeutic trials remains underexplored. We aimed to investigate these factors in neuroblastoma patients to identify potential disparities in clinical trial participation. We utilized the Childhood Cancer Research Network data, selecting neuroblastoma cases from 2008-2015, excluding those &#62;21 years old or with incomplete data. We focused on factors influencing enrollment in therapeutic trials (ANBL0032, ANBL0421, ANBL0531, ANBL0532, ANBL0621, ANBL0931, ANBL1021, ANBL1221, ANBL1232). Key predictors examined were ethnicity, age at diagnosis, SES (via Yost Index), and distance to care from home to treatment hospital. We employed Poisson regression to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals for trial participation. Analyzing 3,148 neuroblastoma cases from the CCRN registry, the ethnic composition was as follows: 68% were non-Hispanic White, 14% Hispanic, and 10% NH Black and SES distribution was even across quintiles. Age at diagnosis was a significant factor in trial enrollment: children &#62;2 years were 94% more likely to enroll than those under 2 years (p &#60; 0.001). Race, ethnicity, SES, and distance to care showed no significant effect on enrollment, all with non-significant p-values. In CCRN, neuroblastoma patient's age at diagnosis was a determinant in therapeutic trial enrollment, providing insight into design strategies to encourage trial participation. While common barriers like race, ethnicity, SES, and distance to care did not impact enrollment in our cohort, the significant role of age highlights an area where focused efforts can ensure that all age groups have equitable access to the potential benefits of therapeutic trials.<br \/><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{C345788A-60FE-4690-AF63-AE1E3A55CBA4}\"><caption

Limited access to genetic testing, pre-test counseling and multidisciplinary care have been shown to disproportionately affect patients with limited resources. This represents a critical unmet need in pediatric oncology. Genetic testing station (GTS) is a pre-test counseling video tool that reviews what genetic testing is, why it might be indicated, and explains potential results. Similar video tools have been successfully used in other settings to increase rates of genetic testing, but there are no published reports on the effectiveness of a video education intervention to increase genetic testing in pediatric oncology patients. To test the effectiveness of GTS on genetic testing knowledge and feelings about genetic testing compared to in-person counseling, we use 5 previously validated tools pre- and post-intervention. The initial surveys measure genetic testing knowledge, decisional conflict, healthy literacy, evaluation of GTS and demographics. If participants complete genetic testing, we use the MICRA to assess the impact on their cancer risk assessment. Our GTS arm is recruited from UCLA Pediatric Sarcoma patients, and the in-person counseling arm is recruited from the UCLA Cancer Predisposition clinic. We have recruited 28 participants in the GTS arm and seven in the in-person counseling arm, of which 10 are patients over 18 years old, two are patients between 12-17 years old, and 23 are parents. In our GTS arm, there are 20 female and eight male participants. A majority identify as white or Latino. For the in-person counseling arm, there are four male and three female participants who identify as white, Middle Eastern, or Latino. A similar percentage score with high health literacy, 68% in the GTS arm and 71% for the in-person counseling arm. The majority of patients have no decisional conflict pre- or post-intervention for the GTS group, while the in-person counseling arm shows high initial decision conflict that is fully resolved with counseling. There is a statistically significant increase in genetic testing knowledge for five out of 10 questions comparing pre- and post-GTS. For GTS participants who have completed genetic testing and the MICRA, there is overall low distress and uncertainty, but higher scores for parents than adult or minor patients. In conclusion, there has been high interest in germline genetic testing in pediatric oncology patients with all families deciding to pursue genetic testing after viewing GTS. GTS is an effective tool in increasing genetic testing knowledge in participants. Therefore, GTS is a promising approach to increase access to genetic testing, while providing adequate pre-test counseling and no decisional conflict.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,Pediatric cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

This creates a unique opportunity to develop improved methods to identify children at increased risk for cancer, enable early detection or prevention of tumors, and improve cure rates with decreased morbidity. However, several challenges have impeded successful research and systematic approaches to the care of children with cancer predisposition.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We established the Consortium for Childhood Cancer Predisposition (C<sup>3<\/sup>P), currently comprised of seven large pediatric institutions in North America. The long-term goal of C<sup>3<\/sup>P is to improve outcomes for children with genetic susceptibility to cancer through collaborative research and data sharing. To this end, we have developed the Childhood Cancer Predisposition Study (CCPS), a multicenter registry and biorepository, to achieve three main aims: 1) Establish and maintain the infrastructure for recruitment, participation, collection and sharing of clinical data and biological samples for children with cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS); 2) Define the spectrum of disease in children with CPS and explore the unique characteristics and management approaches of CPS-related tumors compared to their sporadic counterparts; and 3) Evaluate the clinical impact and effectiveness of standard and emerging tumor surveillance strategies.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The CCPS opened to enrollment in May, 2021 and is currently recruiting at 3 member sites. To date, 276 primary subjects and 44 family members have been enrolled, 211 in the last year. In total, 37 different cancer predisposition diagnoses are represented among participants, including those that are more prevalent, e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome (n=42), DICER1 syndrome (n=27), and PTEN Hamartoma Syndrome (n=21), and those which are very rare, e.g., Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (n=2). There is excellent uptake on obtaining samples, with the CCPS Biorepository at Emory University receiving biospecimens from 261 subjects to date, including constitutional DNA (n=261), frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n=32), and plasma samples for ctDNA analysis (n= 26).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>C<sup>3<\/sup>P<b> <\/b>has established the infrastructure to facilitate comprehensive collaborative work to improve outcomes for children with cancer predisposition, which represent a wide variety of disorders. Future efforts will include the development of innovative strategies to promote recruitment beyond the primary C<sup>3<\/sup>P sites and the support of additional clinical and biological studies of specific CPS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,Pediatric cancers,Cancer genetics,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

National groups have called for the development of AYA-specific programs, yet how these programs influence outcomes remains largely unexplored. With a dedicated AYA Cancer Program at the University of North Carolina (UNC) since 2015, we conducted a retrospective study to describe the AYA population and compare outcomes between those receiving program support and those who did not.<br \/><b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b><br \/>Linking electronic health records and NC Cancer Registry data, we defined a cohort of AYA patients who received cancer treatment at UNC from 2014-2022. We compared sociodemographic, clinical, utilization, and supportive care measures for those who received AYA Program contact and those who did not. Chi-square and two-group t-tests were used for comparison.<br \/><b><u>Results<\/u><\/b><br \/>Of 4044 AYAs receiving care at UNC, 670 engaged with our AYA Program (<b>Table 1<\/b>). Program-contacted patients were younger at diagnosis, more likely to be Black, have metastatic disease or hematologic malignancies, and more likely to receive systemic therapy. Program patients had increased clinical trial enrollment, more palliative care and fertility counseling.<br \/><b><u>Conclusions<\/u><\/b><br \/>Our findings suggest AYAs contacted by our program represent a distinct population with higher clinical and social needs. Despite higher rates of acute care events and no-shows, they were more likely to receive guideline-recommended care - clinical trial enrollment, fertility counseling, and palliative care. Future analyses will compare outcomes using adjusted modeling, and track trends over time. Results will inform next steps for the UNC AYA Cancer Program and other centers aiming to improve care delivery for AYAs.<br \/><b>Table 1. <\/b>Notable results for AYAs with and without program

Curing cancer requires cytostatic drugs and radiation, as well as systemic immune responses to clear malignant cells. Determinants of such responses in children of different ages and with different tumors are unknown. Novel immunotherapies can potentiate anti-tumor immune responses, but so far, very few children with solid tumors have benefitted and markers of productive anti-tumor immune responses in children are lacking.<br \/>Methods: 119 children at the Section for Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children&#8217;s Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, diagnosed with solid tumors were recruited to Immune Systems Against Cancer in Children (ISAC) cohort from March 2018 to April 2021. Whole blood samples were collected for immune cell composition (Mass cytometry), plasma protein abundances (Olink assays), transcriptomics, and clonality analysis. Whole genome sequencing data from tumor tissue of children included in the ISAC cohort was obtained from the Swedish Childhood Tumor Biobank and was used for mutational load and signatures analysis.<br \/>Results: We find that the variation among systemic immune system states is determined predominantly by tumor type, and not age or sex as is the case among healthy children. We also show that specific groups of tumors elicit similar immune response states, which could inspire future updates to treatment protocols for such cancers. This illustrates the potential of this unbiased approach and inclusion of children with diverse solid tumors, whereby shared patterns can lead to novel hypotheses regarding underlying mechanisms among groups of patients, rarely considered together in more reductionist studies of individual tumor types. We also report that general, as well as specific, mutational profiles of neuroblastomas are associated with specific differences in immune responses and finally, we show that clonally expanded T cell responses are rarely observed at baseline in children but can be elicited by successful treatments and monitored as biosensors of therapeutic responses enabling precision oncology in the future. Such monitoring should be considered a complement to the already established precision medicine approaches based on tumor genetics.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest the importance of systemic immunity in coordinating and sustaining immune responses against tumors, but also that the developmental changes in human immune systems must be considered when developing and applying new immunotherapeutic interventions for children of different ages with various tumors. Our findings could also inspire the development of future strategies to trigger more productive immune responses against tumors in children.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-04 Pediatric cancer predisposition and surveillance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Neuroblastoma,Immuno-oncology,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Q.

This study aimed to compare the lipid profiles between children with cancer receiving chemo and healthy children.<br \/>Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted in 21 children with solid tumors enrolled from Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) and 16 controls. Children with solid tumors were consented precycle 2 chemo (T<sub>1<\/sub>) and followed at the end of chemo (T<sub>2<\/sub>). Controls completed one timepoint of data collection. At T<sub>1<\/sub> (n=21) and T<sub>2<\/sub> (n=13), fecal samples were collected for lipidomics analysis. Fecal lipids were processed using a high-resolution, untargeted lipidomics LC-MS approach. MetaboAnalyst and linear mixed models were used to analyze the data with false discovery rate correction (FDR 0.2).<br \/>Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, race, and body mass index between the groups. In total 241 lipid features were identified with high confidence and analyzed. A comparison between children with solid tumors at T<sub>2<\/sub> (n=12) vs. controls (n=16) detected 8 differential lipids, which can be clustered into 4 classes, including 4 triglycerides (TG), 2 phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1 sphingomyelin (SM), and 1 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Additionally, 24 differential lipids were detected for children with solid tumors from T<sub>1<\/sub> to T<sub>2<\/sub> (n=12), including 6 classes: 9 SM, 7 PC, 3 diacylglycerols (DG), 2 TG, 2 monoacylglycerols (MG), and 1 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Compared with controls, children with solid tumors at T<sub>2<\/sub> had higher levels of SM (e.g., SM(d36:1)) and lower levels of TG (e.g., TG(18:0\/18:0\/20:0)), LPC (e.g., LPC(20:4)), and PC (e.g., PC(33:4). Compared with children at T<sub>1<\/sub>, those at T<sub>2<\/sub> had higher levels of SM (e.g., SM(d36:1)), PE (e.g., PE(16:0p\/20:4), PC (e.g., PC(30:0), and PC(36:1)), and lower levels of TG (e.g., TG(18:0\/18:0\/20:0) and TG(18:0\/16:0\/18:0)), LPC (e.g., LPC(20:4)), DG (e.g., DG(18:0\/16:0) and DG(18:0\/18:0)), and MG (e.g., MG(18:0)).<br \/>Conclusion: Children with cancer chemo had alterations in fecal lipid profiles impacting the metabolism of PC, SM, TG, PE, MG, and DG. The increased PC and the dysregulation of LPC in comparison with controls suggest the decreased activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), primarily reported in inflammatory disease. Altered activity of lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPCAT), diacylglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT), and phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) could also explain changes in PC and glycerolipids. Combined, these suggest dysregulation of the Kennedy or Lands pathways towards PC synthesis. Future work is needed to study whether the disturbed lipid metabolisms were associated with treatment toxicities and outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction based on literature.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Pediatric cancers,Chemotherapy,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Identifying individuals at risk at an early stage provides an opportunity for tailored prevention approaches.<br \/>Methods: Long-term childhood cancer survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort, (SJLIFE, n=2,559; median age 41 years, range 20-77 years) were directly assessed for dyslipidemia. Risk factors under consideration included demographic characteristics, cancer treatment exposures (cumulative doses of anthracyclines, platinum agents, glucocorticoids, and radiation therapy), comorbid conditions at the time of assessment (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease), and externally validated multi-ancestry general-population polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides). Multivariable logistic regression predicted a 15-year risk of dyslipidemia (CTCAE grade &#8805;2 hypercholesterolemia and\/or hypertriglyceridemia) including variables selected by the stepwise approach. Performance of the model was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).<br \/>Results: Dyslipidemia was clinically identified in 543 (25.1%) SJLIFE survivors. AUC of a clinical model with sex, race, age at prediction, and comorbid conditions (diabetes, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and hypertension) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.82). Inclusion of cancer treatment exposures (cumulative doses of anthracyclines, cisplatin, carboplatin, glucocorticoids, abdominal and cranial radiation therapy) significantly increased AUC to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84; P=2.1&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>). Addition of two PRSs for LDL-C (one included only genome-wide significant variants adjusted for statins and another consisted of all genome-wide variants) and the PRS for triglycerides provided further significant improvement in AUC to 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.88; P=4.2&#215;10<sup>-12<\/sup>).<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a prediction model with good performance for identifying the risk of dyslipidemia in childhood cancer survivors. In addition to demographics and comorbidities, cancer treatments and inherited genetic factors contributed significantly to improving the risk prediction of dyslipidemia. Results may refine risk stratification for dyslipidemia in survivors and present opportunities for more precise and personalized preventive strategies to address cardiovascular health.

RF affects about 60% of those undergoing radiation, leading to painful scarring from excessive collagen accumulation. In head and neck cancer patients, as an example, RF reduces tissue flexibility, causing limited neck mobility and impaired swallowing. Furthermore, approximately 30% of patients also face disease recurrence post-radiation, with RF increasing surgical complications. Our laboratory previously identified the role of reduced fatty acid oxidation in RF (Zhao <i>et al; Nat Metab<\/i>;1(1):147 2019), offering a promising avenue for future drug development. We described the potential therapeutic benefit of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in countering pro-fibrotic metabolic changes. Our current objective is to develop more effective lead compounds to mitigate RF.<br \/>Methods: Collagen expression, utilized as a surrogate marker for fibrosis, was quantified using ELISA, Western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR. Metabolic changes were assessed by examining the expression levels of PPARG and CD36. CAPE-like analogs were derived from an in-house collection, a commercially available library, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses. <i>In vivo<\/i>, RF was induced in the hindlimbs of mice through exposure to 40 Gy, followed by weekly X-ray evaluations of hindlimb angles for 16 weeks. During X-ray assessments, both hindlimbs were subjected to a 5 g weight to enable measurement of the joint angle between the femur and tibia (wherein higher acute angles were a measure of worsening fibrosis). Skin samples from irradiated and unirradiated limbs were collected for the evaluation of collagen deposition, utilizing Picro Sirius staining followed by polarized microscopy.<br \/>Results: Amongst 200 newly synthesized analogs, approximately one-third successfully reduced collagen secretion in human primary dermal fibroblasts. The most promising compounds exhibited a half-maximum inhibition concentration (IC50) for collagen secretion from 1 to 5&#181;M. They also decreased intracellular collagen production and gene expression, associated with upregulation of PPARG and CD36 transcripts. The joint angle measurements <i>in vivo<\/i> revealed three distinct phases in the development of dermal fibrosis: 1) inflammatory; 2) recovery; and 3) fibrotic phases.<br \/>Conclusions: We have successfully synthesized novel and potent analogs of CAPE which were able to reduce secretion of collagen. Furthermore, a novel method for the <i>in vivo<\/i> assessment of fibrosis was also developed. This innovative approach will facilitate the detailed assessments of future compounds capable of reducing collagen deposition <i>in vivo<\/i>, thereby providing an innovative avenue to mitigate one of the most pressing late normal tissue toxicities of radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Survivorship, late effects, and second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Mouse models,Radiation,Fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.-A.

Both are established to increase the risk for late-mortality (&#62;5 years from cancer diagnosis). We aim to investigate if accelerated molecular aging mediates the association between symptoms and all-cause late-mortality.<br \/>Methods: DNA methylation (DNAm)-based aging biomarkers were derived from the DNAm Age Calculator, including epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) using multiple clocks (e.g., GrimAge and PhenoAge) and other DNAm-predicted biomarkers (e.g., DNAmB2M: beta-2-microglobulin, DNAmTL: telomere length) adjusted for age and standardized. Survivors self-reported the presence of 10 symptom domains (cardiac, pulmonary, sensory, motor\/movement, nausea, pain, fatigue, memory, anxiety, and depression) that were aggregated into a total symptom burden score. Multiple linear regression tested the association between each aging biomarker and symptom prevalence, adjusting for the age of symptom survey, sex, and cancer treatment exposures. Cox regression tested the association of each aging biomarker or symptom domain with mortality. Aging biomarkers mediation for the symptom-mortality association was assessed by using the Accelerated Failure Time model and the mediation R package. False discovery rate was controlled for multiple testing.<br \/>Results: Among 2,206 survivors (47% males) who had DNAm measured on (52%) or after the survey, the median duration from the symptom survey to DNA sampling were 0.48 years (IQR: 0.09-4.27 years).

Cancer survivorship research relies on large-scale, longitudinal studies that generate a wide range of demographic, clinical, and genetic data on cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the absence of cancer survivorship data portals has made it challenging to broadly share cancer survivorship data. We have created the St. Jude Survivorship Portal (https:\/\/survivorship.stjude.cloud), the first data portal for sharing, analyzing, and visualizing childhood cancer survivorship data. The portal hosts data from two large cohorts of pediatric cancer survivors: the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) and the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Over 1,600 clinical variables and over 400 million genetic variants from over 7,700 childhood cancer survivors are stored on the portal. The data can be explored using an interactive data dictionary and a genome browser specialized for population genetics analysis. Summary statistics of variables and genetic variants are computed on-the-fly and visualized through interactive and customizable charts. Survivor cohorts can be filtered or customized and may also be divided into groups for comparative analysis. Tools for performing cumulative incidence and regression analyses have been integrated into portal environment, allowing users to perform real-time statistical analyses on the stored survivorship data. Finally, users may also download individual-level clinical and genotype data from the portal using the controlled-access data download feature. Through various use-cases of survivorship research, we used the portal to explore the ototoxic effects of platinum-based chemotherapy, uncover a novel association between limb amputation, age, and long-term mental health, and identify a novel haplotype in <i>MAGI3<\/i> strongly associated with cardiomyopathy specifically in survivors of African ancestry. The St. Jude Survivorship Portal provides a comprehensive, powerful, and easy-to-use interface for sharing and analyzing childhood cancer survivorship data that will serve as a valuable research tool for the broader survivorship research community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Survivorship, late effects, and second cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.
