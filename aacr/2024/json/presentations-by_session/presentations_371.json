Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 within KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) enhances tumor progression and results in a pulmonary-to-gastric lineage switch that is dependent upon the activity of pioneer factors FoxA1 and FoxA2; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we perform transcriptional and epigenetic assays to show that FoxA1\/2 reprogram the chromatin landscape of NKX2-1-negative LUAD to facilitate a gastric differentiation program. Using sequential recombination models, we find that FoxA1\/2 are required for demethylation of gastric-defining genes after <i>Nkx2-1<\/i> deletion. FoxA1 colocalizes with TET3, an enzyme that mediates DNA demethylation, in NKX2-1-negative tumors. Deletion of <i>Foxa1\/2<\/i> results in loss of TET3 occupancy at key gastric marker genes, indicating that FoxA1\/2 recruit TET3 to lineage-specific sites. H3K27ac ChIP-seq and HiChIP show that FoxA1\/2 also control the activity of enhancers and promoters as well as their 3D interactions at gastric target genes following NKX2-1 loss. Furthermore, oncogenic KRAS is required for the FoxA1\/2-dependent epigenetic reprogramming in NKX2-1-negative LUAD. This work demonstrates the role of FoxA1\/2 in rewiring the methylation and histone landscape and cis-regulatory dynamics of NKX2-1-negative LUAD to drive cancer cell lineage switching.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Epigenetics,Methylation,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

ARID1A and ARID1B are paralog subunits that specifically nucleate the assembly of cBAF complexes and are the most frequently mutated mSWI\/SNF components in human cancer, including in endometrial cancer. However, the biochemical and functional impacts of ARID1A\/B loss, and hence cBAF complex disruption, on remaining PBAF and ncBAF complex activities, chromatin architecture, and gene expression remain poorly understood. Here, we define the molecular consequences of complete cBAF loss in models of aggressive de-differentiated endometrial carcinoma (DEC) harboring dual ARID1A\/ARID1B mutations. Notably, re-expression of ARID1A in DEC cellular model systems biochemically restores cBAF complex assembly while reducing that of PBAF and ncBAF complexes, implicating functional contributions of differential mSWI\/SNF family stoichiometry. We observe genome-wide increases in DNA accessibility at distal enhancer regions following ARID1A rescue, coupled with transcriptional changes at nearest genes including those associated with epithelial lineage differentiation, estrogen receptor signaling, and PI3K\/AKT pathway signaling. Importantly, differential gene regulatory changes aligned with simultaneous cBAF restoration and reduction in ncBAF, and PBAF complex function mirror signatures derived from well-differentiated (WEC) and dedifferentiated (DEC) compartments of a collection of n= 15 primary human DEC cases profiled. Reduced ncBAF- and PBAF-mediated chromatin regulation resulting from either ARID1A rescue or ncBAF\/PBAF genetic disruption attenuated oncogenic gene signature features such as MYC target genes, cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair pathways and significantly reduced proliferative capacity. Finally, treatment of ARID1A\/1B-mutant and ARID1A-mutant endometrial cell lines in culture and PDX models in vivo with a clinical-grade SMARCA4\/2 ATPase inhibitor, FHD-286, markedly attenuated both cell proliferation and tumor growth. Further, FHD-286 synergized with carboplatin, leading to significant reduction in tumor burden in ARID1A- and ARID1A\/B-mutant PDX models. Taken together, these findings reveal the oncogenic contributions of shifted of mSWI\/SNF family complex abundance and chromatin-level gene regulatory function and suggest therapeutic utility of mSWI\/SNF complex small molecule inhibitors in endometrial carcinoma and other cBAF-disrupted cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ARID1A,Chromatin remodeling,Epigenetics,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica Diane St. Laurent<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Grace Xu<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Ying<sup>2<\/sup>, Bengul Gokbayrak<sup>3<\/sup>, Ajinkya Patil<sup>2<\/sup>, Akshay Sankar<sup>2<\/sup>, Chae Young Shin<sup>4<\/sup>, Daniel Same Guerra<sup>2<\/sup>, David Kolin<sup>5<\/sup>, David Huntsman<sup>6<\/sup>, Yemin Wang<sup>4<\/sup>, Cigall Kadoch<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Brigham and Women's Hospital\/ Dana Farber Cancer Institute\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Dana Farber Cancer Institute\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, BC, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>5<\/sup>Brigham and Women's Hospital\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>6<\/sup>University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b05ebb34-963c-480c-94ba-9db4c287cf26","ControlNumber":"4962","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Mostly domesticated as host regulome, retrotransposons shape lineage gene expressions or donate coding functions. A few rare evolutionarily young species remain virally active, leading to germline mutations and modulating immune functions. Aberrant retrotransposon activities have been widely observed in adult diseases, although the extent to which they ensue active viral form and function under those contexts is unclear. Their molecular trigger in adult pathophysiology is poorly defined. To address these questions, we use murine skin as our model, given its well-characterized, abundant and highly accessible adult stem cells, not only mediating postnatal remodeling and homeostatic regeneration, but also responding to stress by driving tissue repair and adaptations. By analyzing a genetic model lacking a known retrotransposon suppressor, histone methyltransferase Setdb1, which we found to be essential in the adult skin, we saw hair loss and hair follicle stem cell exhaustion phenotype, accompanied by a robust and selective surge of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). When combined with squamous cell carcinoma drivers, Setdb1 loss significantly blocked tumor progression in vivo. Interestingly, compared to relatively mild or no induction of commonly observed evolutionarily young ERVs, the most induced species in our model is a class I ERV, murine leukemia virus (MuLV). We detected abundant retroviral peptides originated from its full-length copies through mass spectrometry and viral-like particles through transmission electron microscopy that are immunoreactive to a monoclonal MuLV <i>env<\/i> antibody. Similar viral-like particles were broadly evident across several epithelial tissues beyond skin, implicating its conserved function across squamous cancers. Epithelial originated ERVs elicit tissue wide inflammatory response, and can be ameliorated by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of retroviral activity. Physiologically, viral-coding ERVs arise as the epigenetic machinery declines in response to age-associated stress, and plummet when host safeguard prevails in UV induced skin hyperplasia. As an evolutionary conundrum, viral-coding ERVs pose a threat to host fitness and yet, they&#8217;ve resisted extinction persisting in the mammalian genome. Our findings suggest viral-coding ERVs wrestle with the host surveillance programs to regulate adult tissue physiology and pathology, thus providing a key target in eliciting innate immunity and tackling squamous cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Skin,Stem cells,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

PI3K\/AKT pathway inhibitors are in late-stage clinical development in combination with anti-AR therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy is a cornerstone of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, but the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually occurs. CRPC remains largely dependent on AR for growth with a subset of CRPC that lose AR dependence. There is an urgent need to study the molecular pathways leading to AR activation and the loss of AR reliance in order to identify therapeutic targets. KMT2D is a histone methyltransferase and an important regulator of gene expression. Here we found that KMT2D establishes the chromatin competence necessary for the recruitment of AR and FOXA1 transcription factors (TFs) to activate AR-dependent transcription in AR-high prostate models. In AR-low models such as the stem cell-like (SCL) subtype, KMT2D controls residual AR-FOXA1 gene expression programs and AP-1 TFs such as FOSL1, a driver of the SCL subtype. In SCL, single cell RNA-seq and single cell chromatin assays confirm a key role for KMT2D in the maintenance of a mixed lineage cell state through the regulation of AP-1 and FOXA1 TFs. Combined suppression of PI3K\/AKT and KMT2D reduces cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells and patient derived organoids, providing a rationale for epigenetically informed combination therapies with PI3K\/AKT inhibitors in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. Together, these data establish KMT2D as a major mediator of subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscape in CRPC, required for prostate cancer growth and therapeutic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Epigenetics,Resistance,Stemness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

To gain insight into how ERG translocations cause prostate cancer, we performed both transcriptional profiling (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility via Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) in single cells of an autochthonous mouse model at an early stage of disease initiation.

Adaptation to a Western diet is strongly associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC) and obesity prevalence. This study demonstrates the epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) induced by a pro-obesity high-fat Western diet (HFD) and the heightened risk of oncogenic transformation. A HFD induces a phenotype characterized by increased ISC frequency, proliferation, regenerative capacity, and ability to initiate adenomas. We hypothesized that a HFD generates lasting epigenetic alterations in ISCs thereby enhancing oncogenic susceptibility. We evaluated the chromatin landscape of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the reversibility of the epigenetic changes. Mice carrying a fluorescent reporter of the ISC marker Lgr5, were subjected to a control diet, HFD, or HFD with a return to control. We isolated ISCs by flow cytometry and used an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) to identify differentially accessible genomic regions correlated with the ISC phenotype. We found that a HFD induces distinct changes in the chromatin landscape that persist after removal from the HFD. These accessible regions are associated with genes involved in lipid metabolism and are enriched with PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor) binding motifs. We demonstrate that these lipid metabolism regulators, PPAR-delta and PPAR-alpha, are necessary for the majority of significant accessible regions. We further show that HFD-induced accessibility significantly correlates with early chromatin alterations seen by loss of tumor suppressor APC. Our data supports a mechanistic pathway for diet-induced epigenetic reprogramming due to PPAR activity and suggests that the HFD imposes a preneoplastic stem cell chromatin state that stokes the risk of oncogenic change.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Stem cells,Diet,Mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

Median survival is just 12-14 months, with only about 5% of GBM patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis. This picture has not substantially improved over decades and there is an urgent need to discover more specific and effective treatments for this deadly malignancy. We discovered the bromodomain-containing chromatin regulator BRD8 as essential to GBM lacking p53 mutations <i>(TP53<sup>WT<\/sup>)<\/i>, which make up ~71% of cases (1). BRD8 maintains malignancy by crippling p53-mediated tumor suppression in a way distinct from previously described mechanisms: it reprograms the p53 network through the EP400 histone acetyltransferase complex and by bromodomain-directed occupancy of the histone variant H2AZ at p53-induced targets, enforcing a repressive chromatin state that prevents p53-mediated transactivation. Importantly, targeting BRD8 in <i>TP53<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> GBM remodels chromatin by evicting H2AZ and enhancing chromatin accessibility, enabling p53 to bind and transactivate its targets. This chromatin remodeling cascade (referred to as the &#8220;BRD8\/p53 epigenetic switch&#8221;) re-establishes p53 activity in <i>TP53<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> GBM, normalizing gene expression, evoking cell cycle arrest, inhibiting gliomagenesis, and prolonging survival in xenograft models of <i>TP53<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> GBM. Our recent work: (i) reveals that BRD8 opposes p53 function in non-malignant brain cells; (ii) shows that the bromodomain of BRD8 is unique amongst the bromodomain-containing protein family, as it is the only one that selectively reprograms the p53 network; and (iii) demonstrates that targeting BRD8 works synergistically with MDM2 inhibition. Our findings present a previously unappreciated mechanism by which cancer cells side-step p53, indicate that targeting BRD8 re-establishes p53-mediated tumor suppression in <i>TP53<sup>WT<\/sup><\/i> GBM, highlight unique features of the bromodomain of BRD8, and propose therapies using co-inhibition of BRD8 and MDM2 as a dual-level tactic for boosting up p53. Thus, our work sheds light on new principles of chromatin biology and offers new promise for treating patients with this devastating malignancy.<br \/>(1)Sun <i>et al., <\/i>2023 <i>Nature<\/i> 613 (7942):195-202.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-05 Gene silencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Chromatin remodeling,Bromodomain,p53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Xueqin Sherine Sun<sup><\/sup>, <b>Alea A.
