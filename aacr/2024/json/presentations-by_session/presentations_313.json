However, most patients exhibit progression on monotherapy treatment in months, underlining the need for combination therapeutic approaches that improve the durability of the anti-tumor activity seen with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors.<br \/>RMC-6291 is a mutant-selective covalent inhibitor of the GTP-bound RAS(ON) form of RAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, while RMC-6236 is a non-covalent RAS<sup>MULTI<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor of both mutant and wild-type variants of canonical RAS isoforms. In models harboring diverse alterations driving resistance mechanisms to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors -- including reactivation of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and wild-type RAS by increased RTK signaling, acquired secondary oncogenic RAS mutations, and KRAS amplification -- both RMC-6291 and RMC-6236 exhibited superior anti-cancer activity as single agents when compared to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesized that a combination of RMC-6291 and RMC-6236 could address a broad spectrum of observed clinically relevant resistance mechanisms to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitors that reactivate RAS signaling via mutant and wild-type RAS isoforms and compromise the depth and durability of anti-tumor response.<br \/>In a mouse clinical trial with KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>xenograft models, daily oral administration of RMC-6291 induced objective responses in 18 out of 25 NSCLC PDX and CDX models as assessed by mRECIST. In a subpanel of 7 NSCLC models that are relatively refractory to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF) inhibitor monotherapy, RMC-6236 alone somewhat prolonged the durability of response, while the combination of RMC-6291 with RMC-6236 improved the depth of response and significantly extended the durability thereof. In contrast to NSCLC, in models of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CRC tumors a more heterogeneous response to RMC-6291 monotherapy was observed with objective responses in 4 out of 15 CRC models. The addition of RMC-6236 to RMC-6291 substantially improved the depth and duration of anti-tumor response in the resistant models to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor alone. The combination of RMC-6291 with RMC-6236 at preclinical target doses did not affect the systemic or tumor exposures of each compound and was well tolerated in tumor-bearing immune-deficient animals.<br \/>Both investigational agents RMC-6236 and RMC-6291 have shown promising anti-tumor activity as monotherapies in preclinical models and, more recently, showed preliminary clinical activity in patients with RAS-driven tumors at exposures that were well tolerated. The addition of RMC-6236 to RMC-6291 shows combinatorial activity in preclinical models that are relatively less responsive to either inhibitor alone. A clinical trial combining RMC-6291 with RMC-6236 in patients with mutant KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> tumors is currently enrolling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Tri-complex RAS(ON) inhibitors,KRAS G12C,Combination strategy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

In patients treated with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI), emergence of tumor cell plasticity is associated with resistance to therapy. Dysregulation of epigenetic reprogramming factors, including PRC2, creates an environment that is permissive for such lineage plasticity. Inhibition of the PRC2 complex therefore may provide an opportunity to overcome or prevent the emergence of plasticity in prostate cancer. Notably, emerging clinical trial data has demonstrated the potential of ARPI and PRC2 inhibitor combination therapy to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.<br \/>PRC2 tri-methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), leading to long-term transcriptional silencing, a key mechanism regulating cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation. Three core subunits comprise PRC2: the catalytic subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED). EED is essential for the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2. First-generation PRC2 inhibitors, which target EZH2, exhibit poor drug properties, drug-drug interaction liabilities and short half-life requiring twice daily dosing at high doses in patients.<br \/>We developed a second generation PRC2 inhibitor, ORIC-944, an allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 that binds the EED subunit. ORIC-944 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor with best-in-class properties. ORIC-944 demonstrated single agent tumor growth inhibition in a spectrum of in vivo prostate cancer models, including AR-positive, AR-mutant, ARv7, ARPI-responsive and ARPI-resistant models. In vitro analysis of the combination of ARPIs and ORIC-944 showed synergy in multiple prostate cancer cells, utilizing BLISS and other quantitative methods. In vivo studies revealed that ORIC-944 demonstrated increased efficacy in combination with ARPI, consistent with the in vitro synergy. RNA-seq analysis of transcriptional changes induced by ORIC-944 provided mechanistic insight into the role of PRC2 in prostate cancer lineage plasticity and combination response.<br \/>These results position ORIC-944 as a best-in-class PRC2 inhibitor for evaluation in combination with ARPI in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. A phase 1b trial of ORIC-944 is ongoing (NCT05413421).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,EED,PRC2,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Yet, despite its importance in cancer progression, MYC is considered &#8220;undruggable&#8221; by small molecules due to its disordered conformation. Therefore, interfering with its interactions with protein partners to modulate MYC activity appears viable. FBXW7 is an E3 ligase, which serves as a constituent of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F box) ubiquitin ligase complex. It mediates the degradation of both c-Myc and Cyclin E through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. FBXW7 mutations are found in various human tumor types, establishing its role as a general human tumor suppressor. Specifically, FBXW7 down-regulation increases MYC level, and its expression correlates to lethal outcomes of breast epithelial cells, poor prognosis in glioblastoma, and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remission. Therefore, our project aims to discover potent small molecule glues that would enhance the interaction between FBXW7 and MYC, leading to MYC degradation through proteolysis and eventually suppression of various cancers. Taking advantage of our high throughput screening technology, Small Molecule Microarrays (SMMs), we successfully identified 29 compounds that potently bind to both c-Myc and FBXW7 after screening our 65,000 &#8216;drug-like&#8217; small molecule library. We then performed secondary assays using a mCherry-GFP MYC reporter cell line to identify our lead compound, KI-FBX-001, which decreases MYC&#8217;s expression:transcription ratio by over 50% compared to control. Additionally, this down-regulation can be rescued by protease inhibitor MG132, indicating that the effect is achieved via proteolysis. <i>In vitro<\/i> dose-response and time-course treatment revealed an optimal drugging concentration at 15uM in K562 cells, with inhibition reaching its peak at the 4-hour time point at over 60%. Using the Qiagen MYC reporter assay, the in vitro IC50 of KI-FBX-001 is found at 7.42uM. Beyond the protein level, the qPCR result also reveals a decrease in MYC mRNA level at over 70%. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is used to confirm direct binding between FBXW7 and KI-FBX-001, which showed promising binding with kd=0.17&#181;M. Proximity Ligation Assay further confirms KI-FBX-001&#8217;s effect in enhancing FBXW7:MYC interaction in the cell. In summary, our findings proved that KI-FBX-001 is a promising molecular glue in the FBXW7:MYC interaction, and can effectively modulate the MYC level for future therapeutic purposes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Molecular glues,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,High-throughput assay,Molecular glue,FBXW7,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction in tumors carrying wild-type p53 prevents its degradation and can reactivate p53 to elicit an anti-cancer effect. Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction therefore remains a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, development of first generation MDM2 antagonists has been challenged by dose-limiting, on-target bone marrow toxicities. Understanding of differential effects of p53 pathway activation in normal hematopoietic versus cancer cells (to be presented in a separate abstract) together with our expertise in structure-based drug design have led to the discovery of ASTX295, a potent MDM2 antagonist with differentiated pharmacokinetic profile aimed at sparing bone marrow toxicities and increasing the therapeutic index. Here, we present the first disclosure of the structure and pre-clinical characterisation of ASTX295. ASTX295 exhibits potent activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#60;1 nM) against MDM2 in an ELISA-based <i>in vitro<\/i> assay and induces significant growth reduction in p53 wild-type, MDM2-amplified SJSA-1 cells (GI<sub>50<\/sub>=27 nM). Antiproliferative activity of ASTX295 was further demonstrated in a panel of 219 p53 wild-type cell lines, with 143 cell lines showing GI<sub>50 <\/sub>values less than 1 &#956;M and 50 showing values less than 0.1 &#956;M. Effects of ASTX295 are shown in cell lines carrying functional p53 as confirmed in three p53 wild-type and mutant cell line pairs (SJSA1 and SN40R2, A2780 and A2780CP, HCT116 and HCT116 p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>). In addition to inhibiting cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, ASTX295 also potently induces apoptosis following 24-48 hour treatment. Further in vitro analyses of ASTX295 demonstrated an increase in the levels of p53 (EC<sub>50<\/sub>=10 nM after 2 hours) and its transcriptional targets such as p21 and MDM2. In vivo, ASTX295 shows robust induction of p53 and its target genes at 3 and 6 hours after oral administration together with dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth in the SJSA-1 xenograft model. Importantly, ASTX295 exhibits optimised pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with relatively short duration of pathway modulation and a desired predicted human half-life of 2-8 hours. Based on our pre-clinical hypothesis on differential time-dependent sensitivities of normal versus cancer cells to p53 activation, achieving such a profile while maintaining potency may increase the therapeutic index. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of ASTX295, which is currently being tested in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors with wild-type p53 (NCT03975387).

TEAD-dependent transcription is activated in many tumor types through a variety of mechanisms including LOF Hippo pathway mutations (e.g. NF2, LATS) and YAP\/TAZ amplification, and also as an adaptive resistance mechanism, for example in response to EGFR TKI and KRAS inhibition. Here, we report the initial characterization of a novel pan-TEAD inhibitor, AZ4331, which was identified following a structure-guided drug design campaign. AZ4331 disrupts the post-translational palmitoylation of TEAD proteins through covalent binding to a conserved cysteine residue resulting in inhibition of TEAD-dependent transcriptional output. AZ4331 inhibited the proliferation of NF2m NCI-H226 cells (GI50: 92 nM) while having no effect on Hippo-wild type NCI-H2452 (GI50: undetermined). Cell-based metabolic labeling studies demonstrated the ability of AZ4331 to inhibit palmitoylation of all four TEAD paralogs and led to disruption of the YAP\/TEAD complex assessed by immunoprecipitation resulting in reduced TEAD transcriptional output as assessed by qPCR. Furthermore, in vivo profiling showed AZ4331 achieved sufficient exposures (plasma free Cmax: 2.7 &#181;M) and robust target engagement as measured through reduction of multiple canonical TEAD target genes (CTGF [IC50: 0.127 &#181;M] , ANKRD1, AMOTL2 and CYR61) in Hippo-altered mesothelioma xenograft tumors. This target engagement in turn drove inhibition of tumor proliferation in xenograft models representing common Hippo-alterations. AZ4331 treatment of NF2m NCI-H226 and LATS1\/2 loss MSTO-211H mesothelioma xenografts drove 50% and 93% regression of tumors, respectively. While treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma FAT1m FaDu and YAP1amp Detroit562 xenografts lead to 58% tumor growth inhibition and 35% tumor regression, respectively. These findings identify AZ4331 as a potent inhibitor of the TEAD transcription factor family and further validate the inhibition of TEAD in Hippo-altered cancers as a potential therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hippo pathway,TEAD,Mesothelioma,Yap,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

WRN is a promising synthetic lethal target for MSI tumours and WRN inhibitors are being developed. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 base editing to map WRN residues critical for MSI synthetic lethality, validating the helicase domain as the primary target and guiding inhibitor discovery. Fragment-based screening led to the discovery of potent and highly selective WRN helicase covalent inhibitors from the same chemical series. These compounds strikingly and selectively suppressed MSI model growth in vitro and in vivo by mimicking genetic WRN loss, inducing DNA double-strand breaks at expanded TA repeats and DNA damage response. We characterized WRN inhibition across cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumour organoids, enabling biomarker assessment of TA-repeat expansions and MMR status to refine patient selection, with compound efficacy correlating with TA-repeat expansions in MSI cells. Efficacy was also confirmed in patient-derived organoids and PDX models refractory to immunotherapy. The discovery of potent and selective covalent WRN inhibitors provides proof-of-concept for targeting MSI cancers and provides tools to unlock the molecular dissection of the WRN biology and MSI synthetic lethality.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair deficiency,Synthetic lethality,WRN helicase,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.
