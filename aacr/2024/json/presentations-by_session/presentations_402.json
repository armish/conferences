[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b>: <i>ERBB2<\/i> (HER2) targeted therapy is an important therapeutic class used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) but has been associated with a risk of cardiotoxicity. Identifying pts likely to experience this AE could allow for early intervention and\/or a change in treatment plan. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to detect changes in methylation patterns of pts who had cardiotoxicity from anti-HER2 therapy. Here, we report a retrospective study assessing the feasibility of using the Guardant Infinity platform (genomic and epigenomic NGS analysis) to predict severe cardiac AE in pts treated with trastuzumab.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Samples (n=46) from female pts with BC undergoing treatment with trastuzumab without prior record of heart failure and with a blood sampling <u>&#60;<\/u>300 days prior to a documented heart failure event defined a positive case cohort. 70 blood samples were matched to the positive case cohort in all above attributes but without record of patient heart failure to comprise a negative cohort. The &#62;20K differentially methylated regions on Guardant Infinity platform may be useful for detection of specific disease attributes such as treatment-associated AE. To explore this, mixture models were first trained using 880 BC samples unrelated to heart failure to distinguish methylation signals coming from tumor versus non-tumor cfDNA. The resulting normalized methylation signals represent the posterior probabilities of the region molecules to be derived from tumor cells. A subset of methylation regions were selected based on significance of association between heart failure status and normalized methylation signals in the positive and negative AE cohorts. A penalized logistic regression model was then trained on the normalized signals of the selected methylation regions to predict whether a patient would have future cardiac AE.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: A 10-fold cross validation of the penalized logistic regression models trained on normalized methylation signals produced an area under the curve of 0.78 for predicting heart failure status, suggesting feasibility of using blood-based methylation signals to predict cardiac AE on this platform. The differentially methylated regions selected as model predictors show a clear separation in hypermethylation status between positive versus negative cohorts.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our results show the prediction of cardiac AE in BC pts undergoing trastuzumab treatment in advance of documented heart failure using a blood-based assay designed for simultaneous comprehensive genomic and epigenomic profiling. Given the relatively small sample size within this study, further refinement and validation of the classification models is warranted and ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Cardiotoxicity,Genomics,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Nonetheless, significant clinical challenges persist including relapse and treatment resistance, to which our understanding remains incomplete. Previous studies have revealed genetic (RAS\/RTK pathway mutations and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations) and phenotypic (monocytic differentiation) resistance mechanisms. In this context, we hypothesized that integrative assessment of both genetic and phenotypic factors could further unveil the contributors of HMA+Ven resistance. To determine the predictors of treatment response, we first analyzed the baseline characteristics of 208 newly diagnosed, secondary, and relapse\/refractory AML patients treated with Decitabine and Venetoclax (Dec+Ven). While complex cytogenetics, KRAS and TP53 mutations were significantly associated with treatment resistance, phenotypic factors such as bone marrow cell compositions or French-American-British (FAB) classifications were not. To identify the factors of resistance at the cellular level, we performed a single-cell targeted DNA-antibody sequencing (DAb-seq) on a subset of 33 patients. In total, 60 multi-timepoint bone marrow samples were analyzed, which included five patients with paired baseline-relapse timepoints. From all five patients, we identified that stem-like cells were largely eradicated and replaced by more differentiated cells such as monocyte-like or erythroid-like cells. At relapse, we identified three patterns of phenotypic shifts: monocytic shift, erythroid shift, and mixed monocytic\/erythroid shift. The phenotypic shifts were not always associated with the expansion of new genetic mutations, except for in two cases: one patient had monocytic shift accompanied by the expansion of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, and another patient had erythroid shift accompanied by the expansion of <i>NRAS<\/i> mutation. To examine the mechanisms behind the phenotypic shifts, we performed a single-cell RNA sequencing on three of the relapsed patients. As a result, we confirmed the upregulation of BCL2L1 in the patient with erythroid shift (N=1), and MCL1 in the patients with monocytic shifts (N=2), but not BCL2 in both. These findings are consistent with known dependency of these cells on non-BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins such as MCL-1 and BCL-xL. To summarize, we conclude both genetic and phenotypic factors play a role in Dec+Ven resistance. Most importantly, we report that divergent phenotypic transitions, from stem-like toward more differentiated phenotypes (monocytic or erythroid), were frequently observed in AML relapse following Dec+Ven therapy. Close monitoring of phenotypic alterations during HMA+Ven treatment may facilitate the precise identification of AML patients predisposed to relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-06 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Leukemias: acute myeloid,Venetoclax,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

However, extensive analyses of tumor genome and transcriptome datasets have identified numerous additional virus types, the functional implications of which remain largely unknown. Viral infection often dysregulates unique molecular processes within tumor cells and alters the composition of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. For instance, HPV-positive tumors have been shown to exhibit a significantly elevated expression of the DNA editing enzyme APOBEC3B compared to HPV-negative tumors. Furthermore, HPV positive tumors display and increased number of C-to-T mutations induced by this protein. The genome and transcriptome of tumor tissue biopsies contain a wealth of information about these virus-associated signatures. However, advanced signal processing approaches are needed to extract these viral signatures from complex tumor datasets, and elucidate their specific roles in cancer. Here, we developed a quantitative approach to investigate the link between viral infection and dysregulation of a seven-membered A3 enzyme family (A3A\/B\/C\/D\/F\/G\/H). The primary role of these enzymes is to restrict viral infections by inducing C-to-U mutations in viral genomes. However, at least three members of this enzyme family (A3A\/B\/H) can also induce mutations in cellular DNA, and drive tumor formation and evolution. We used NMF (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) to deconvolute the expression profiles of A3 enzymes in &#62;10,000 bulk RNAseq datasets from diverse TCGA tumors. This analysis revealed the expression profiles of A3 enzymes within tumor and tumor microenvironment cells including various immune cells. Next, we conducted an association analysis to identify the link between the presence of viral infection and the proportion of each of these tumor and tumor microenvironment expression profiles. As expected, our analyses revealed strong associations between tumor-specific A3 expression profiles and infections by oncolytic viruses such as HPV. Notably, and somewhat unexpectedly, our analyses also revealed associations with viruses about which little is known in the field of cancer. For example, in certain tumors, we identified a robust association between bacteriophages and a tumor-specific A3 expression profile characterized by A3B upregulation. Taken together, our analyses provide evidence for the link between A3 dysregulation and infection by viruses including bacteriophages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression profiling,Bioinformatics,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Dysregulation of miRNA function has been associated with numerous diseases, particularly cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). During the progression of HCV-HCC, the function of miRNAs may be altered thereby altering gene expression to favor HCC. Therefore, the involved miRNA-mRNA interaction needs to be further studied. In addition, there are many clinical studies have shown that HCV patients who do not adequately control their diet which are prone to fatty liver accumulation (steatosis), it may increase the possibility of liver cirrhosis. In the current study, we aim to investigate the function and effects of persistent HCV-induced miRNAs expression in liver hepatocellular carcinoma progression and gene expression and to explore the mechanisms and regulatory genes of liver steatosis caused by HCV patients in a high-fat environment. We used the Huh751 cell line and the infected with the HCV JFH1 replicon of low-viral load S2 cells. We used an HCV miRNA array for initial identification of potential candidates. These miRNAs were analyzed for KEGG pathways via DIANA. Next, we identified miRNA-mRNA targets in 3 databases (miRDB; miRPathDB; TargetScan) and analyzed the targets for KEGG pathways using ShinyGO. The target miRNA-mRNA candidate genes were then compared with long-term JFH1 replicon infectious cell (L-HCV) NGS mRNA data to integrate miRNA-mRNA. The identified genes were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for survival, biological process, and expression in LIHC Big Data. Hsa-miR-215, hsa-mir-10b, and hsa-let-7a of L-HCV miRNAs group showed high significance for LIHC overall survival with a hazard ratio &#62;1.0. Moreover, miRNAs associated with L-HCV survival were LIHC-specific but not in other cancers. Through systematic integration of these findings, we identified HMOX1 and BMF genes as being specifically associated with HCC and regulated by hsa-miR-215-5p, hsa-miR-10b-5p, and hsa-miR-7a-5p. In addition, we also found that the expression of the adipogenesis genes, FABP4 and adipogenesis gene, SREBP1, as well as the viral non-structural protein, NS3, was significantly increased in the HCV-high-fat group; and the expression of the gene IRS1, which is involved in hyperinsulinemia, showed a decreasing trend. The main cause of HCC is that HCV inhibits the expression of hsa-miR-215-5p, hsa-miR-10b-5p, and hsa-miR-7a-5p, leading to alter the expression of target genes, these have a significant effect on survival, suggesting that an essential role in virus-related liver cancer. In the future, we will further explore the regulatory mechanisms between these genes and HCV in a high-fat environment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Infections and virus-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Lipids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.-H.

However, prior studies did not jointly consider skeletal muscle, a key prognostic factor in cancer. Addressing this gap, our study examines the combined effects of adiposity and muscle phenotypes on mortality in high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC), offering novel insights into the role of body composition in patient outcomes.<br \/>Methods: 343 HGSOC patients from the Body Composition and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (BComES) Cohort at Roswell Park were included in this analysis. Body composition was derived from sliceOmatic software using computed tomography images obtained prior to chemotherapy. Body composition was quantified as surface area (cm<sup>2<\/sup>) at L3 for intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), total adipose tissue (TAT), and skeletal muscle index (SMI). SMI&#60;38.5 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/m<sup>2<\/sup> was defined as low SMI, a proxy for sarcopenia. For each adipose depot, phenotypes were categorized as: 1) low adiposity\/high SMI (optimal\/referent); 2) high adiposity\/high SMI; 3) high adiposity\/low SMI (e.g., sarcopenic obesity); and 4) low adiposity\/low SMI (e.g., cancer cachexia). Multivariable Cox models adjusted for age, tumor stage, and surgical debulking status were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) representing associations of each body composition phenotype with mortality.<br \/>Results: High IMAT and VAT were associated with increased mortality in patients with high SMI (HR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.18-2.74 and HR=1.96, 95% CI: 1.27-3.04, respectively) and low SMI (HR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.05-2.61 and HR=1.70, 95% CI: 1.04-2.80). High SAT and TAT were also associated with increased mortality in patients with high SMI (HR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.14-2.67 and HR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.31-3.18), but associations were shy of significance for patients with low SMI (HR=1.37, 95% CI: 0.85-2.23 and HR=1.58, 95% CI: 0.95-2.61). Lastly, low SMI and low adiposity was associated with increased mortality for VAT (HR= 1.65, 95% CI: 1.01-2.70), SAT (HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.14-3.10), TAT (HR=1.97, 95% CI:1.19-3.26) and IMAT (HR=1.46, 95% CI: 0.85-2.53).<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we observed no support for an obesity paradox. Rather, we observed compelling evidence linking high adiposity phenotypes with striking increases in HGSOC mortality, regardless of SMI. Notably, as the cachectic phenotype was also linked to substantial increases in mortality, unwittingly assigning patients with low adiposity and low muscle to a reference group in adiposity research could falsely induce an &#8216;obesity paradox&#8217;. Importantly, as body composition can be modified through diet and exercise, our data establishes it as a potential therapeutic target alongside chemotherapy to improve outcomes in this deadly disease<b>.<\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Obesity paradox,Body composition,Sarcopenia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

As immunotherapy involves toxicities, body weight may be affected during the treatment course. The objective of this study is to examine the trajectory of weight changes at 180 and 365 days after the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) among patients with NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Retrospective chart review and data extraction were performed among patients receiving ICIs at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center between 2015 and 2021. Patients with NSCLC were included in this study if their initial treatment entailed a PD-1\/PD-L1 ICI), either alone or in combination with chemotherapy\/targeted cancer drugs, and if they also had their body weights recorded on ICI initiation and 180 days after (&#177; 30 days) treatment initiation. A subset of these patients who had body weight data on day 365 of ICI initiation were included in additional analysis. Percentages of change in body weight relative to pre-ICI were calculated ([weight at 180 or 360 days minus pre-ICI weight] divided by pre-ICI weight x 100%) and examined by treatment regimen and pre-ICI body mass index (BMI) using t-tests. A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding 11 patients with cachexia defined by the presence of ICD-9 (799.4) or 10 (R64) codes in their medical records.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: A total of 554 patients with NSCLC received any ICI; 139 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 96 had body weight data on day 365. The mean age of diagnosis was 63.8 (SD=10.1); 80% were White and 18.7% were Black. The median time on ICI was 195 days (inter-quartile range, 55-392 days) among patients with ICI only and 255 days (inter-quartile range, 126-479 days) among patients with ICI combined with chemotherapy or targeted cancer drugs. Among patients receiving ICI only, body weight increased among those with normal weight (BMI &#60;25.0; mean change = +7.57%, P=0.013) but decreased among those classified as overweight (BMI = 25.0 to 29.9; &#8722;5.2%, P=0.037) or obese (BMI &#8805;30; &#8722;6.5%, P=0.025). Decreases in weight were also observed for patients with obesity and receiving a combined treatment (&#8722;9.65%, P=0.043). After one year of treatment, weight changes among patients receiving ICI only remained significant in the normal weight group (+15.6%, P=0.007), but not among patients with other BMIs and treatment regimens. These associations remained similar after excluding the patients with cachexia.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Body weight change during ICI therapy may vary by treatment regimen and pre-ICI BMI among patients with NSCLC. Whether the weight changes are related to toxicities and survival warrants further research to shed light on weight management, ICI efficacy, and prevention of treatment-related adverse events.

We conducted a discovery scale study to assess the association of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue areas annotated on computed tomography (CT) scan images with selected tumor immunologic characteristics among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: We analyzed publicly available data from 102 patients (mean age = 67.2, 47.1% female, and 70.6% stage I-II) who had diagnostic CT images in The Cancer Image Archive. All patients had the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12) image, and a subset (62 patients) had the 3rd lumber vertebra (L3) image. Paravertebral muscle areas on T12 and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue areas on L3 were annotated using Slice-O-Matic. RNA-seq data were provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium; percentages of CD8, regulatory T cells, and activated NK cells were identified using the CIBERSORT. ESTIMATE algorithm was used to derive the stromal score and the immune score. Differences in the immune markers were examined using ANOVA adjusting for stage, histology, and study.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: Patients with higher paravertebral muscle area (3rd tertile) had the lowest stromal scores, compared to the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 1<sup>st<\/sup> tertile (P&#60;0.05).

However, few studies have explored this relationship in non-Caucasian women. We analyzed data from 74,177 post-menopausal African American, Caucasian, Japanese American, Latina, and Native Hawaiian women in the Multiethnic Cohort in Hawaii and California. Data on physical activity (hours and metabolic equivalents (METs)) was based on a self-administered questionnaire at baseline (1993&#8211;1996). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models provided estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for risk factors. We observed no associations between breast cancer risk and hours of moderate\/vigorous activity per week (HR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.91-1.10, Ptrend=0.71), MET-hours of moderate\/vigorous activity per week (HR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.94-1.13, Ptrend=0.92), and total METs-measured as average MET level per day multiplied by 7 (HR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.86-1.03, Ptrend=0.37) when comparing the highest quartile to the lowest. When examining the data across race\/ethnicity, we observed a reduction in risk of breast cancer for total METs (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.94, Ptrend=0.05) among Latina women. Analysis across strata of BMI showed no differences across subgroups. In this study, we did not observe any consistent protective association between physical activity and breast cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-09 Obesity, diet, physical activity, and energy balance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Physical activity,Cohort study,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Semi-structured telephone interviews began with an inquiry into perceptions of the term &#8216;cancer survivor.&#8217; Eligible participants were age 18 or older, self-identified as Black, and were living beyond a cancer diagnosis. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Applying directed content analysis, 5 researchers independently applied a codebook generated from the interview guide to a subset of transcripts. The codebook was refined through iterative discussions to address coding discrepancies and achieve replicability. Remaining transcripts were then coded and a report of grouped narrative summaries was generated. Themes and subthemes were organized to present the meaning and significance of &#8216;cancer survivorship&#8217; among the sample. The partnering community advisory board aided in and reviewed the interpretation of study findings.<br \/>Results: Participants were 19 survivors of nine different types of cancer. Most participants were women (89.5%), 68.4% held a bachelor&#8217;s degree or greater, and the mean age was 56 (SD=12). Emergent themes describing perceptions of &#8216;cancer survivorship&#8217; included 1) cancer &#8216;survivor&#8217; terminology preferences, 2) outset of cancer &#8216;survivorship,&#8217; 3) &#8216;survivor mentality&#8217; and mental fortitude, and 4) advocacy for those affected by cancer. Many participants identified as &#8216;cancer survivors&#8217; and preferred this to &#8216;in remission,&#8217; but some preferred different terms or identities (e.g., warrior or thriver). Many believed survivorship began once an individual completed cancer treatment, but some felt survivorship began at cancer diagnosis. Survivor mentality was raised as a mindset providing some individuals the mental fortitude to complete cancer treatment, especially among those embracing a survivor identity during treatment. Some participants raised advocacy, providing support to others diagnosed with cancer, and sharing cancer information and their experience as part of what it means to be a survivor.<br \/>Conclusions: Acceptance of the term &#8220;cancer survivor&#8221; and what it means to be a &#8220;survivor&#8221; vary among Black individuals living past a cancer diagnosis. The identities held by those diagnosed with cancer may have implications for their cancer experiences and outcomes. Many Black cancer survivors may perceive working to improve the lives of others with cancer as part of what it means to be a survivor. Partnering with Black cancer survivors in cancer prevention and control efforts may be mutually appealing and beneficial to improve the lives of individuals living past a cancer diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Cancer,African American,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

There is a need to unite research across the cancer continuum to address the needs of cancer survivors to ensure optimal quality of life and improve mortality outcomes. Health constructs that influence cancer survivorship are multifactorial, highly dynamic, and vary across the lifespan. This makes assigning their impact on the well-being and future outcomes of cancer survivors challenging. As a pathophysiological process that lies at the intersection between societal, environmental, and biological constructs, it is proposed that the irreversible accumulation of metabolites called <u>a<\/u>dvanced <u>g<\/u>lycation <u>e<\/u>nd products (AGEs) can inform on quality of life and mortality outcomes for cancer survivors. It is proposed that AGE accumulation as a result of societal, environmental, and biological constructs overwhelm the fragile equilibrium that maintains AGE homoeostasis to impact tumor biology and cancer outcomes. The relationships between health constructs and AGE exposure are epitomized by nutritional behavior. The consumption of cheaper unhealthier often ultra-processed foods are inherently AGE laden and the excessive consumption of foods high in fats and sugars that promote obesity and increase cancer risk readily provide reactive intermediates that fuel AGE formation in cells and tissues. Our collaborative epidemiological studies assign high levels of AGE consumption with increased breast cancer risk, aggressiveness, and mortality, which is supported by translational studies showing that circulating AGE levels in breast cancer patients correlate with worse disease-free survival and other poor prognosis indicators. Critically, this group has also shown that chronic AGE consumption by mice increases prostate tumor growth (p&#60;0.001), and causes a rapid progression through prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia (p=0.049), adenocarcinoma (p=0.042) and metastasis (p=0.001). Consumption of the high AGE diet caused a regulatory program of stromal activation conducive for tumor growth. As a bio-social determinant of health AGE accumulation and its pathogenic effects serve as informative and\/or functional markers indicative of the current health status and well-being of cancer survivors and may inform of potential future outcomes. Our studies show that physical activity and dietary intervention (cardiac rehabilitation) reduced systemic AGE levels in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, prevention and control interventions aimed at reducing AGE exposure represent viable strategies for improving quality of life and disease recurrence for cancer survivors.

Newer and aggressive treatments are leading to increasing lifespans in this population. As such, studying quality of life could have a large impact on the survivorship experience. An important component of quality of life is financial toxicity, defined as the financial burden and distress that can arise for patients and their families because of cancer treatment.<br \/>Objectives: To understand the prevalence and predictors of financial toxicity in advanced prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: IRONMAN (International Registry of Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer) is a prospective cohort of patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC or CRPC enrolling in 15 countries. Financial toxicity was collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (&#8220;has your physical condition or medical treatment caused you financial difficulties?&#8221;) at enrollment and every three months thereafter. For this analysis, we studied 997 patients cared for at 37 US sites enrolled from 7\/2017 to 7\/2023. We examined baseline and longitudinal reports of financial toxicity across clinical and demographic factors: age at enrollment, race and ethnicity, disease state, marital status, education, employment, military status, and type of health center. We conducted adjusted risk difference analysis and multivariable regression modeling to identify predictors of financial toxicity using a generalized estimating equations approach to calculate odds ratios (OR and 95% confidence intervals, CI).<br \/>Results: At enrollment, 125 (13%) patients reported experiencing &#8220;quite a bit&#8221; or &#8220;very much&#8221; financial toxicity. 21% of Black patients experienced toxicity compared to 10% of White patients. Even after incorporating all other predictors, Black patients experienced 5% (95% CI: 0, 11) greater toxicity than White patients. Independently of other predictors, patients &#62;75 experienced 11% (CI: -17, -4) lower toxicity compared to those &#60;65 years (while patients in the 65-74 group experienced 6% less, CI: -12, 1). Toxicity was 6% greater in patients with mHSPC (CI: 2, 10) than in patients with CRPC, and disabled or unemployed patients were at substantially higher risk. In the multivariable longitudinal analyses, older age (&#62; 75) remained associated with significantly lower odds for financial toxicity (OR: 0.30, 0.15-0.61) while mHSPC (OR: 1.91, 1.14-3.20) and being unemployed (OR: 2.69, 1.03-6.99) or disabled (OR: 5.14, 2.29-11.6) were associated with higher odds.<br \/>Conclusions: Financial toxicity is prevalent in advanced prostate cancer, especially in patients who are Black, younger than 75, diagnosed with mHSPC, or unemployed\/disabled. These results may inform identification of patients at high risk for financial toxicity to support delivery of patient-situation-informed care by clinicians and targeted aid for patients at highest risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Advanced cancer,Metastatic tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

It was summarized into two summary scores (Physical Component Summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS]) and eight domain scores (physical functioning [PF], role limitation due to physical health [RP], bodily pain [BP], general health [GH], vitality [VT], social functioning [SF], mental health [MH], and role limitation due to emotional problem [RE]). Hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to assess the main effects of time and group and the interaction effect between time and group on HRQOL trajectory.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> At diagnosis, cases fared worse than controls for all HRQOL domains and summary scores. Over the ten years, PCS, PF, GH, RP, SF, and VT worsened over time (all <i>P<\/i> for time &#60; 0.05), while MCS, MH, and RE remained relatively constant over time (all <i>P<\/i> for time &#8805; 0.05). Older women with breast cancer had lower HRQL over time than controls in PCS, GH, and RP domains, while they showed higher HRQOL than controls post 4 - 7 years in PF, SF, RE, and VT domains (all <i>P<\/i> for group &#60; 0.05). However, only RE showed a statistically significant interaction effect (<i>P<\/i> =0.035), improving over time in cases but worsening in controls.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: This research shows both older women with breast cancer and propensity-matched controls experiencing deterioration of HRQOL, particularly physical health domains, over ten years after baseline, with cases&#8217; HRQOL kept lower than controls over time. Needs assessment and more efficient interventions to improve physical health HRQOL among older women are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,health-related quality of life,older women,SEER-MHOS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

While systemic corticosteroids are effective, their use is limited by additional toxicities and high recurrence. Benralizumab is an anti-IL-5R&#945; monoclonal antibody that induces eosinophil depletion via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and is FDA-approved for severe eosinophilic asthma but has not been studied for ercAEs.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a single-center, single-arm, Phase 2 trial (NCT04552288) of benralizumab in cancer patients with Grade 2\/3 ercAEs from PI3K inhibitors, ADCs, CPIs or targeted therapies. Patients received benralizumab 30 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 3 doses, then every 8 weeks for 3 doses. The primary endpoint was clinical response, defined as reduction in ercAE Grade to 0\/1 at Week 4. Secondary endpoints included changes in quality of life, rash body surface area (BSA), cytokines and eosinophil biomarkers, as well as adverse events (AEs).<br \/>Results: Forty-seven patients were enrolled, predominantly with breast (55.3%), bladder (10.6%), melanoma (10.6%), or kidney (6.4%) cancer. Baseline ercAEs were Grade 2 (48.9%) and Grade 3 (51.1%), most often from PI3K inhibitors (46.8%), CPIs (21.3%), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (8.5%) or ADCs (8.5%). Overall, 32 of 42 evaluable patients (76.2%) had clinical response by Week 4, with decreased ercAE grade (mean 2.4 to 0.9, p&#60;0.0001), improved quality of life, reduced rash BSA, decreased peripheral and skin eosinophils (all p&#60;0.0001), and cytokine changes. Clinical response by Week 4 was seen in all patients with ercAEs from alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor; n=18) or enfortumab vedotin (ADC; n=4); p-value for both: p&#60;0.05. Mild-to-moderate mucositis, diarrhea, and xerosis were the most common AEs, all unrelated to benralizumab.<br \/>Conclusions: Benralizumab demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy for Grade 2\/3 ercAEs from cancer therapies, especially alpelisib and enfortumab vedotin. Larger placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Benralizumab,Eosinophilia,Rash,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

As cancer death rates continue to decrease, the population of cancer survivors is expected to grow, therefore making it important to study their health behaviors. Research has been conducted on prevalence of physical activity and sedentary behaviors of survivors of certain cancers, however, little research has been conducted comparing cancer survivors to individuals without cancer. The purpose of this study was to update previously published results from earlier National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (2007-2010) with more recent data comparing physical activity and sedentary behavior among cancer survivors and individuals without cancer.<br \/>METHODS: Using the NHANES 2011-2018, we identified 1320 cancer survivors and 19,109 participants without cancer who provided data on recreational, work-related, and transportation-related physical activity and sedentary behavior. The included participants were over 20 years of age, not pregnant at the time of the survey, and were more than three years from their cancer diagnosis, if applicable. Comparisons between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer were conducted for duration of total physical activity (min\/day) and sedentary time per day. To account for the complex sampling design, weighted multivariable analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<br \/>RESULTS: Compared to individuals without cancer, cancer survivors reported less average &#177; standard error physical activity minutes per day (190.06 &#177; 5.24 and 147.29 &#177; 13.14, respectively), and slightly more sedentary hours per day (6.95 &#177; 0.09 and 7.56 &#177; 0.36, respectively). However, after adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, educational status, body mass index, and smoking status, there was no association between physical activity duration or sedentary time and cancer survivor status. The OR (95%CI) for more than 60 minutes per day of physical activity was 1.00 (0.83, 1.20) compared to no physical activity, and for more than 8 hours of sedentary time per day was 1.00 (0.82, 1.21) compared to less than 5 hours per day.<br \/>DISCUSSION: In a previous publication of earlier cycles of NHANES (2007-2010), cancer survivors reported higher physical activity but also higher sedentary time per day compared to individuals without cancer. However, these results were not supported in this updated analysis using more recent NHANES cycles (2011-2018). After adjustment for important covariates, we did not find differences between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer in reported physical activity or sedentary time. Further research in other populations is needed to corroborate these findings and document whether they reflect a growing awareness of the negative impact of sedentary behavior in cancer survivorship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-12 Quality of life\/late effects\/survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survival,Physical activity,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
