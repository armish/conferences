[{"Abstract":"<b>Objectives <\/b><br \/>Gliomas (GBM), are exceptionally hard to treat, aggressive and genetically heterogeneous tumors.<br \/>This study reports the control of tumor recurrence and improved survival in male and female rats by combining a single intra-cranial dose of MTL-004 (5-(aziridine-1- yl)-4 hydroxylamino-2-nitrobenzamide), in a bioresorbable paste (a blend of poly DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid; (PLGA) and poly ethylene glycol; (PEG)) to surgical resection of primary glioma tumors. Comparison is made with oral temozolomide (TMZ), the current standard of care (SOC), following resection.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures <\/b><br \/>On day 0, 2 mm<sup>3<\/sup> tumor fragments were implanted into the brains of healthy female and male Fischer rats.<br \/>On day 5 rats the growing tumors were removed using microsurgery. Treatments started as follows:<br \/>&#8226;Group 1 (Placebo) received a single intracranial dose of excipient powder in PGLA\/PEG paste;<br \/>&#8226;Group 2 (SOC) received 5 daily oral doses of TMZ at 50 mg\/kg;<br \/>&#8226;Group 3 (MTL-004) received a single intracranial dose of excipient powder containing 1 mg\/kg MTL-004 in PGLA\/PEG paste.<br \/><b>Results <\/b><br \/>Body Weight<br \/>Between day 0 and 5, no groups had statistically significant body weight changes.<br \/>Between days 5 to 9, mean body weight of rats receiving TMZ was significantly reduced.<br \/>Tumor Volumes<br \/>Tumor volumes from MRI were evaluated when at least 80% of rats were still alive in each group (day 14 post tumor resection \/ treatment initiation). Mean tumor volume was significantly higher in the placebo groups compared to MTL-004 and TMZ treatments.<br \/>Survival<br \/>Rats were studied for 58-days post tumor resection\/treatment. At this time out of twelve rats per group, none or one survived on TMZ, two or no animals were still alive on placebo, and seven or ten rats treated with MTL-004 were still alive (male or female respectively).<br \/>Post resection median survival time was between 20.5 to 27.5 days for rats treated with oral placebo or TMZ. Rats treated with MTL-004 had a significantly higher survival compared to both placebo and TMZ groups and remained in apparent good health for the 58 days of the study.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b><br \/>Consistent trends were observed in each group of male and female rats following tumor resection.<br \/>&#8226;PGLA\/PEG paste with MTL-004 or without (placebo) or were both well tolerated.<br \/>&#8226;Treatment with MTL-004 in PGLA\/PEG paste provided good tumor control, was better tolerated and led to significantly greater survival than oral TMZ or placebo.<br \/>&#8226;Oral TMZ (SOC) provided control of tumor volume but was associated with significant, transient body weight losses and no significant survival gain compared to placebo.<br \/>Our data highlight significant survival benefits associated with a single intracranial dose of MTL-004 with PLGA\/PEG paste post-surgery. In conclusion, surgery followed by MTL-004 in PGLA\/PEG paste is a well-tolerated and promising treatment for glioblastoma, suitable for clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 DNA-reactive agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Survival,Chemotherapy,MTL-004,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Mike Hudson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sylvie Maubant<sup>2<\/sup>, Elisabeth Bertrand<sup>2<\/sup>, Marie Lux<sup>2<\/sup>, Jordan Longin<sup>2<\/sup>, Elodie Marie Dit Chatel<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxime Ramelet<sup>2<\/sup>, Olivier Duchamp<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gordian Pharma Ltd., Pentre-bach, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncodesign Services, Dijon, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a114041-731b-4c38-afcf-fb62e13a7a88","ControlNumber":"10365","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Oral cancer presents primarily as HPV-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whose etiology is associated with tobacco and alcohol use and for which there are limited treatments. Whereas immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, have become a promising therapeutic option, only ~20% of head neck cancer patients benefit from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.<br \/>We and others have shown that non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming mediated by the &#946;-catenin\/CBP complex promotes aggressive cell phenotypes in OSCC by establishing open chromatin at the transcription start sites of genes associated with cancer stemness. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of this complex dramatically inhibits OSCC evolution in a syngeneic mouse model of OSCC. Here, we evaluated whether the inhibition of &#946;-catenin\/CBP epigenetic activity would enhance the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.<br \/>We adapted a syngeneic mouse model of tobacco-associated oral carcinogenesis that utilizes a mouse cell line, 4MOSC1, derived from 4-nitroquinoline-1 oxide- (4NQO)-induced tongue tumors of C57BL\/6J mice. After tumors developed for 7 days, mice were blindly separated into treatment cohorts (n=13, each) to receive vehicle control (PBS), monotherapy (either 10 mg\/kg anti-PD-1 EOD IP, or 100 mg\/kg E7386, a Wnt signaling pathway modulator, QD oral gavage) or combination therapy (anti-PD-1 + E7386). Tumor isografts were harvested 11 days post initiation of treatments and processed for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analyses.<br \/>Measurements of tumor volumes showed that combination therapy resulted in a statistically significant reduction by ~80% compared to control mice and that it surpassed tumor decrease by either monotherapy. These results were confirmed by histopathology analyses. Evaluation of tumor tissues by immunofluorescence revealed statistically significant decreases in Cbp, H3K4me3, Keratin 14, and Podoplanin expression in response to E7386 alone and in combination with anti PD-1. Collectively our results suggest that a combination therapy comprising anti PD-1 treatment with E7386-targeting &#946;-catenin\/CBP epigenetic signaling is likely to impede OSCC evolution to advanced disease.<br \/><i>Supported by Eisai, Co Ltd Research Award (MAK), NIH 5R01 DE030350 (MAK, SM, XV) and 5R01 DE031413 (MVB).<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Solid tumors,&#946;-catenin,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Thus, p300\/CBP inhibition is a highly potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and leukemia. We have discovered HP537 that competitively inhibits an acetylated peptide substrate to bind BRD of p300\/CBP with IC50 &#60; 5 nM. HP537 does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of HAT domain of p300\/CBP and HAT1, nor has binding affinity for other BRD containing proteins including BRD4 and BRD9. HP537 inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell lines derived from MM, leukemia and lymphoma with IC50 values ranged from 0.01 &#956;M to 0.4 &#956;M. Protein expression levels of acetylated H3K27, c-Myc and IRF4 are significantly decreased by HP537 in MM, NHL and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. HP537 robustly and dose-dependently inhibits tumor growth in OPM-2 (MM), MOLM-16 (AML), and KARPAS-422 (NHL) cell line derived tumor xenograft (CDX) mouse models. Down-regulation of c-Myc and IRF4 are also observed in the tumor samples. In conclusion, HP537 is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of p300\/CBP BRD. The pre-clinical data supports the clinical development of HP537 for the treatment of hematological malignancies. A FIH study of HP537 in cancer patients is planned to start in 2024.

Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have a direct effect on protein poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation, which is important for DNA repair. Decitabine is a nucleoside cytidine analogue, which when phosphorylated gets incorporated into the growing DNA strand, inhibiting methylation and inducing DNA damage by inactivating and trapping DNA methyltransferase on the DNA, thereby activating transcriptionally silenced DNA loci. We explored various combinations of HDACi and PARPi +\/- decitabine (hypomethylating agent) in pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PL45 (wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2) and Capan-1 (mutated BRCA2). Colony formation and drug-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cell lines and comparison of the effects of each drug combination with the effect of the individual drugs are shown in <b>Table.<\/b> The combination of HDACi (panobinostat or vorinostat) with PARPi (talazoparib or olaparib) resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested. The addition of decitabine further increased the synergistic cytotoxicity noted with HDACi and PARPi, triggering apoptosis (evidenced by increased cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP1). The 3-drug combination treatments (vorinostat, talazoparib, and decitabine; vorinostat, olaparib, and decitabine; panobinostat, talazoparib, and decitabine; panobinostat, olaparib, and decitabine) induced more DNA damage (increased phosphorylation of histone 2AX) than the individual drugs and impaired the DNA repair pathways (decreased levels of ATM, BRCA1, and ATRX proteins). The 3-drug combinations also altered the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (NuRD complex subunits, reduced levels). This is the first study to demonstrate synergistic interactions between the aforementioned agents in pancreatic cancer cell lines and provides preclinical data to design individualized therapeutic approaches with the potential to improve pancreatic cancer treatment outcomes.<br \/><table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{D43333F4-30C5-43EB-BCB0-EDF5E35D093B}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"16\">Table.

Inhibitors targeting JAKs (Janus kinases) have revolutionized the treatment of MF, but are limited by modest efficacy or acquired resistance after prolonged treatment. Here, we report a novel inhibitor, HP560 that targets BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) proteins and shows promising therapeutic activities against MF and AML. Through engaging the bromodomain pocket of BET proteins in a competitive manner with acetylated histones, HP560 causes the disruption of BET proteins from chromatin. HP560 has high binding affinities for all BET proteins and strong anti-proliferative activity as well as synergistic anti-proliferative effect in combination with ruxolitinib, a JAK1\/2 inhibitor. In an MF cell line derived tumor xenograft (CDX) mouse model, HP560 prolongs survival and improves splenomegaly and anemia, and these effects are enhanced when combined with ruxolitinib. HP560 also significantly and dose-dependently inhibits tumor growth in an AML CDX mouse model. Together, HP560 is a potent pan-BET inhibitor and can be developed as a monotherapy or in combination with a JAK inhibitor for the treatment of MF. HP560 structure will not be disclosed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,Epigenetics,Cancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We investigated the potential involvement of endogenous MMTV and the mouse IFN-&#946; in the pharmacodynamics of decitabine using stable knockdown cell lines and MMTV hyper-infection. For the first time, we show that knockdown of MMTV or IFN-&#946; in a mouse mammary cancer cell line (4T1) both rendered the cancer cells more resistant to decitabine in mice bearing 4T1-derived mammary cancer. Mechanistically, decitabine enhanced MMTV expression on the RNA level in both control tumors and tumors with MMTV knockdown, although the degree of enhancement was limited in knockdown tumors. Conversely, infection of a mouse colon cancer cell line (MC38) with MMTV released from 4T1 cells rendered the colon cancer cells more sensitive to decitabine. These data confirm the viral mimicry hypothesis as the mechanism of DNA demethylating agents. Practically, our research suggests the possibility of combining the use of an exogenous virus and a DNA demethylating agent as a new approach to cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Decitabine,Mouse,Retrovirus,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

FGFR inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in several cancers with FGFR alterations. Tinengotinib is a novel kinase inhibitor with high potency to a variety of FGFR 1\/2\/3 kinase domain mutations and has shown promising efficacy in several ongoing clinical studies. Here, we present pooled data of tinengotinib in previously treated solid tumor patients (pts) with actionable FGFR1-3 mutations from four trials (NCT03654547, NCT04742959, NCT04919642, NCT05253053).<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts received tinengotinib orally once daily (daily dose ranging from 5-12mg) until disease progression. Analyses of best overall response (BOR) rate, disease control rate (DCR), median progression-free survival (mPFS), median duration of response (mDOR) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were performed.<br \/>Results: As of 3-Aug-2023, 53 solid tumor pts with actionable FGFR1-3 mutations were enrolled between Dec-2019 to Aug-2023 in the US and China. The median follow-up time was 14.5 (range, 3.3-43.8) months. Median age was 58 years (range, 29-83). Most pts were female (62%), had ECOG of 1 (68%) and were heavily pretreated with 55% having <u>&#62;<\/u>3 lines of prior antitumor therapy. The most frequent FGFR mutation enrolled was in FGFR2 (77%) followed by FGFR1 (19%) and FGFR3 (11%). 25 pts (47%) had received prior therapy with FGFR inhibitor. A total of 45 pts were efficacy-evaluable, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, n=25), colon cancer (n=5), breast cancer (n=3), prostate cancer (n=3), head and neck cancer (n=3), urothelial cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=1), gastric cancer (n=1) and leiomyosarcoma (n=1). mPFS reached 6.83 (95% CI, 4.90-8.34) months. Partial responses were observed in 16\/45 (35.6%) pts across 6 distinct tumor types, including CCA, breast, prostate, urothelium, colon and head and neck cancer. mDOR was 6.74 (95% CI, 3.52-9.46) months. For 44 pts with measurable target lesions per RECISTv1.1, the BOR rate and DCR were 36.4% and 86.4%, respectively. For 22 pts with prior FGFR inhibitor, mPFS was 5.98 (95% CI, 3.75-9.10) months and their BOR rate and DCR were 40.9% and 86.4%. TRAEs were reported in 46 (86.8%) pts, with 13 (24.5%) Grade (G) 1-2, 30 (56.6%) G3, 2 (3.8%) G4, and no G5. The most common TRAEs (<u>&#62;<\/u>20%) were hypertension, stomatitis, diarrhea, nausea, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, fatigue and anemia. Side effects were manageable and reversible with dose hold and\/or dose reduction.<br \/>Conclusions: We observed promising clinical benefit with tinengotinib in heavily pretreated solid tumor pts with FGFR1-3 mutations. The side effects profile was manageable and no new safety signals have been identified. Further research is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tinengotinib in pts with FGFR1-3 mutations across a wider variety of tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Mutations,Solid tumors,Tinengotinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, despite these advancements, many patients do not benefit from immunotherapy because of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Consequently, there is a need for new strategies to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy by stimulating inflammatory immunogenic cell death in tumors. Ferroptosis is a recently-described form of non-apoptotic cell death that induces a uniquely inflammatory immunogenic cell death. Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is the cell&#8217;s major defense system against ferroptosis as it is the only known enzyme capable of reducing toxic lipid hydroperoxides to inert lipid alcohols. Here we describe the discovery of a series of potent and selective small molecule GPX4 inhibitors that result in significant tumor growth inhibition in several aggressive tumor CDX models. We verified induction of ferroptosis in tumors using known biomarkers of ferroptosis such as HMOX1 mRNA induction as well as with 4-HNE staining. GPX4 target engagement and degradation was confirmed by mass spectrometry and western blot in tumors. GPX4 inhibition, when combined with PDL-1 blockade in a syngeneic sarcoma model, resulted in sustained significant tumor growth inhibition throughout the course of a 28-day study at well-tolerated doses when compared to either monotherapy alone. Current studies are underway to more carefully define the unique immunogenic cell death imparted by GPX4 inhibition and resulting ferroptosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

However, current SIIP-based KRAS inhibitors preferentially target the inactive, GDP-bound KRAS and thus are susceptible to adaptive resistance due to MAPK pathway reactivation. Furthermore, RTK pathway alterations frequently emerge to cause acquired resistance. These drawbacks limit the rate and duration of anti-tumor response. Developing more robust small molecule RAS (on) inhibitors that target active, GTP-bound RAS proteins is a promising new approach to enhance clinical benefits. Here we report preclinical characterization of a novel RAS (on) inhibitor - GFH547, designed to treat cancers carrying multiple RAS mutations. In biochemical assays, GFH547 disrupted the binding of GMPPNP-bound G12V, G12D or wild type KRAS to RAF1 in a CypA-dependent manner, as the inhibitory effect was significantly abolished in the absence of CypA. GFH547 suppressed phosphor-ERK1\/2 (p-ERK) levels in KRAS G12V- and G12D-mutated cells with IC50s &#60; 1 nM, and demonstrated potent tumor-suppressive effect in 29 cancer cell lines carrying diverse KRAS (G12A, G12C, G12V, G12R, G12S or G13D), NRAS (G12D or Q61L) or HRAS (Q61H) mutations, with IC50s of 0.04-1.9 nM. In addition, GFH547 was also cytotoxic in 9 cancer cell lines carrying EGFR or FGFR2\/3 amplification, mutation or fusion, with IC50s of 0.12-198 nM. Conversely, GFH547 was inactive against 4 BRAF V600E-mutated, RAS-independent cancer cell lines. In KRAS-mutated xenograft models, oral administration of GFH547 elicited rapid and potent inhibition of intratumoral p-ERK levels, and led to tumor regression at dose levels as low as 1 mg\/kg QD. In contrast to sotorasib and adagrasib, GFH547 was not susceptible to RTK-reactivation following EGF stimulation, and remained effective against cell lines carrying KRAS mutations that confer acquired resistance to SIIP-based KRAS inhibitors. At 10 &#956;M, GFH547 showed no off-target activity in 72-kinase selectivity and SafetyScreen44 panels. GFH547 has a bioavailability of 76% and was well tolerated in mice, with an estimated therapeutic index &#62;20. Taken together, by hijacking CypA to block oncogenic RAS proteins broadly in their active forms, GFH547 represents a new generation of RAS inhibitors that are superior to the mainstream SIIP-based KRAS inhibitors in overcoming adaptive and acquired resistance. The compound demonstrated strong therapeutic activities in tumors with activating RAS and RTK mutations\/alterations. Based on these promising results, we are advancing a CypA-binding panRAS(on) inhibitor into the clinic as targeted therapy for cancers addicted to RAS pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,cyclophilin A,GFH547,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

Adenosine activates G-protein coupled receptors expressed on immune cells to achieve immune suppression, with a mechanism of action involving 1) dampening antitumor effector cells (T<i><sub>eff<\/sub><\/i> and NK cells) via adenosine engagement on A2a receptor, (2) reducing dendritic cell antigen presentation and promoting MDSC differentiation by activating A2b and A2a receptors, and (3) inducing chemotactic migration of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells to infiltrate tumor tissue via A1 receptor. Furthermore, A1 receptor expression in certain tumors mediates an adenosine-driven tumor cell proliferation, likely through A1 receptor Gi coupling to the Hippo-YAP signal transduction pathway. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of A2a, A2b, and A1 receptors by a triple antagonist in the context of adenosine-rich TME may represent an attractive strategy to achieve a better outcome in treating solid tumors. We discovered and characterized a novel adenosine receptor antagonist CT3021. CT3021 exhibits high binding affinity to A2a, A2b, and A1, with a <i>K<sub>i<\/sub><\/i> value of 0.37 nM, 1.76 nM, and 1.26 nM, respectively, and is selective against the A3 receptor and other 84 pharmacologically and\/or toxicologically relevant targets. Schild analysis demonstrated that CT3021 is a competitive antagonist with a calculated <i>K<sub>B<\/sub><\/i> value of 0.18 nM on A2a receptor in a whole cell cAMP assay in transfected HEK293 cells. In functional antagonist assays, CT3021 maintains its high potency full antagonism under an adenosine-rich TME-like condition (10-100 &#181;M adenosine) both in transfected HEK293 cells and in isolated human T lymphocytes. CT3021 has a high oral bioavailability, a limited CNS exposure, and a favorable ADME profile. CT3021 is well tolerated in rats after repeat dosing. Further toxicology and efficacy studies are underway to explore the potential of CT3021 as a best-in-class adenosine receptor antagonist immunotherapy for the treatment of CD73 positive and A1 receptor positive solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Antitumor agents,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Oxyphenisatin acetate, called Acetalax, which was used as a laxative in the 1950&#8217;s, has recently been reported to have anticancer activity in several murine cancer models. In this study we demonstrate that Acetalax and its structural analog laxative analog bisacodyl (Dulcolax) exhibit potent antiproliferative activity in TNBC cell lines. We show that both cause oncosis, a non-apoptotic cell death characterized by cellular and nuclear swelling and cell membrane blebbing that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion. Acetalax was further shown to enhance immune and inflammatory responses and inhibit protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that TRPM4 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin member 4) is poisoned by Acetalax and bisacodyl. By blocking TRPM4, a monovalent cation channel, Acetalax and Bisacodyl cause oncosis, and TNBC cells without endogenous TRPM4 expression as well as TRPM 4 knockout TNBC cells were found to be Acetalax- and Bisacodyl resistant. TRPM4 was also lost in cells with acquired Acetalax resistance. Moreover TRPM4 is rapidly degraded the ubiquitin-proteasome system upon acute exposure to Acetalax and bisacodyl. Together, these results demonstrate that TRPM4 is a previously unknown target of Acetalax and Bisacodyl and that TRPM4 expression in cancer cells is a predictor of Acetalax and Bisacodyl efficacy, and could be used for the clinical development of these drugs as anticancer agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Target discovery,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

The success of CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib underscores the promising role of targeting cell cycle regulators in anti-cancer therapy. On the other hand, a robust correlation has been established between the overexpression of oncogenes and super-enhancer (SE). The genes associated with SE show increased vulnerability to transcription factor disruption compared to genes with typical enhancers. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that inhibiting transcription factors can effectively decrease the expression of SE-associated oncogenes, including c-MYC, thereby highlighting potential anticancer effects for oncogene-addicted cancers. Currently, agents targeting transcription factors are undergoing clinical trials, offering promising therapeutic options for patients with various types of cancers.<br \/>CDK7 plays a crucial role in orchestrating cell cycle progression and transcription by phosphorylating CDKs, the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and hormone receptors like estrogen and androgen receptors. The inhibition of CDK7 has been shown to effectively inhibit tumor growth through various mechanisms, including inducing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting transcription, thereby leading to the death of cancer cells. Notably, ongoing clinical studies have demonstrated that small-molecule CDK7 inhibitors effectively control cancer progression as a stand-alone and in combination with other anti-cancer agents.<br \/>C-16661, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable, and reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor of CDK7, displayed a single-digit nanomolar IC50 value in both biochemical and cellular assays. It exhibited excellent selectivity in a kinase panel assay, and remarkable potency in a human cancer cell line panel assay. C-16661 treatment resulted in strong inhibition of both its direct and indirect downstream targets including pS5-POLII, pT161-CDK1, c-MYC, and MCL1 in HCT116, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line. While C-16661 exhibited good PK profiles in animals, it demonstrated excellent tumor growth inhibition without any tolerability issues in a colorectal cancer CDX mouse efficacy model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK7,CDK inhibitor,Cell cycle,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Heuijoon Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kyoungwan Seo<sup><\/sup>, Jihyun Yu<sup><\/sup>, Jieun Kim<sup><\/sup>, Min Sung Joo<sup><\/sup>, Sungeun Kim<sup><\/sup>, Joonhyung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jeonghyeon Lee<sup><\/sup>, Eun-Jung Kim<sup><\/sup>, Joonwoo Nam<sup><\/sup>, Wooseok Han<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cyrus Therapeutics, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b45a2f2-c6ea-4ba7-a75f-6c092e53e533","ControlNumber":"10881","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

Such mutations activate the transcription factor Nrf2, leading to aberrant expression of chemoprotective genes and rendering cells resistant to chemotherapy. We used our chemo-transcriptomic platform, termed GRETA, for Global Reporter on Transcript Abundance, to identify compounds that inhibit Nrf2 transcription factor activity in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cell lines. After defining the transcriptomic signature imparted by constitutive activation of Nrf2 in a KEAP1 KO NCI-H1975 cell line, we generated over 10,000 transcriptomes to identify compounds that dampen the Nrf2-overactive transcriptional signature. One such compound, ARP-4316, displays selectivity for KEAP1-mutant cell lines, reduces nuclear Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces Nrf2 transcriptional activity in an ARE reporter assay. Furthermore, ARP-4316 synergizes with 5-fluorouracil in two KEAP1-mutant cell models, A549 and NCI-H2122, suggesting that ARP-4316 may sensitize KEAP1 mutant cell lines to chemotherapy by inhibiting Nrf2 transcriptional activity.

Although antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) offer improved targeting, they face limitations in drug payload capacity. Therefore, a potent chemotherapy without off-tissue effects or payload limitations is in crucial need. To address the demand, we developed an AND-gate-based dual-targeting approach that minimizes off-tissue cytotoxicity with tune-able payload, exploiting a pair of split human simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), which converts the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) into a cytotoxic form with high specificity. We first successfully split a pair of HSV-TK (Split TK) to exhibit the possibility of an AND-gate drug activation system. HSV-TK was split into N-fragment (nTK) and C-fragment (cTK) with a 20 amino acid overlap, transduced into HEK293T cells, and treated with ganciclovir for 72 hours. Cells expressing one TK half showed IC50 &#62;1000 &#181;M, while co-expression of cTK and nTK reduced IC50 to ~3 &#181;M, which is comparable to full-length TK. Successful splitting of HSV-TK demonstrated the feasibility of dual-targeting. We then validated this AND-gate targeting in cancer treatment. Split TK[HH1] was assessed in treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC lacks the overexpression of common breast cancer targets, which poses a significant challenge in treatment strategies. We designed a specific split TK pair to treat MDA-MD-231 TNBC, with MCF-7 cells as a control. MDA-MB-231 has upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) expression, while MCF-7 is high in EGFR but low in PD-L1. To enable a split TK pairs that selectively reconstituted HSV-TK activity in MDA-MB-231 cell, we choose epidermal growth factor (EGF) as the targeting ligand for EGFR, and PD-1 extracellular domain for PD-L1. We fused nTK to EGF (nTK-EGF), and the extracellular domain of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to cTK (PD-1-cTK). Fusion proteins were expressed in SHuffle E. coli, purified, and introduced into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, together with 100 &#181;M GCV. After 7 days of treatment, individual nTK-EGF and PD-1-cTK treatments with GCV showed minimal cytotoxicity. However, combined treatment of nTK-EGF and PD-1-cTK significantly decreased cell viability in MDA-MB-231 by ~20%, while MCF-7 remained healthy. In summary, we have successfully constructed and validated an AND-gate-based dual-targeting approach that minimizes off-tissue cytotoxicity with tune-able payload for cancer treatment. This versatile AND-gate dual-targeting system has the great potential of a paradigm-shifting strategy of cancer treatment, particularly for the cancers that cannot be treated by targeting a single antigen. The distinct cytotoxicity based on differential antigen expression introduces a novel cancer therapy category to overcome the targeting difficulties of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and is potentially generalizable to other cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prodrugs,Cancer therapy,Drug design,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

These tRNAs are stabilized by m<sup>7<\/sup>G46, and this increases the translation of mRNAs containing the cognate codons. METTL1 is often over-expressed in cancer tissue, and its gene locus is frequently amplified in specific tumor types. Recent studies have shown that reducing METTL1 expression leads to tumor growth inhibition highlighting this enzyme as a potential novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We optimized small molecule inhibitors of METTL1 from a HTS hit using structure-guided medicinal chemistry. Representative compounds of two distinct chemical series exhibit potent <i>in vitro<\/i> METTL1 inhibition at low nanomolar concentrations while displaying exquisite selectivity over other RNA and protein methyltransferases. The effects of inhibiting METTL1 were measured by cellular mechanistic assays and modification-induced misincorporation tRNA sequencing (mim-tRNAseq). As expected, pharmacological inhibition led to decreased m<sup>7<\/sup>G46 methylation, lower levels of a subgroup of tRNAs and reduced cancer cell proliferation.The efficacy of METTL1 inhibition in a panel of cancer cell lines representing a wide range of solid and hematologic tumor types was determined. Cell proliferation was impaired in a subset of cell lines originating from various cancer types, including lymphoma, sarcoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, colorectal and lung adenocarcinoma. Importantly, viability was not affected in non-transformed cell lines, indicating a highly selective mechanism of action. The phenotypic consequences of METTL1 inhibition in selected cell lines were further investigated by flow cytometry and western blotting. Cell lines sensitive to METTL1 inhibition displayed reduced cell cycle progression and lowered expression of cell cycle regulators. RNA sequencing and proteome analyses identified molecular changes at both transcript and protein level. METTL1 inhibition led to induction of ATF4 expression and activation of the integrated stress response, as well as global changes to the translation machinery. Studies on cell-line derived xenograft or syngeneic <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse models were conducted to assess tumor growth inhibition after oral or intraperitoneal administration of the potent METTL1 small molecule inhibitor STM9005. Inhibition of METTL1 by this compound reduced tumor growth in both immune-deficient and immune-competent mouse models, effects accompanied by dose-dependent changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Here, we describe the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of METTL1 tRNA methyltransferase.

Although nucleic acid-based evaluations have unveiled some druggable targets, limited options are available for the majority of patients with this disease. We therefore evaluated biliary exosomes by mass spectrometry from 16 patients with CCA, which revealed a 17-fold enhancement of the nuclear export protein XPO7 in CCA-derived biliary exosomes. IHC analysis of XPO7 expression in CCA tumors from 170 patients unexpectedly demonstrated intense cytoplasmic staining in 30% of the samples, which correlated with abbreviated survival. Within the cytosol, we demonstrate that XPO7 exists in a molecular complex with the serine\/threonine kinase SLK. shRNA-mediated knockdown of either XPO7 or SLK abrogated tumor organoid formation <i>in vitro<\/i>, and reduced orthotopic tumor formation and substantially altered tumor morphology using athymic mice. A kinome screen of FDA-approved drugs revealed tivozanib inhibits SLK (IC<sub>50<\/sub>= 81.8 nM), which we confirmed using crystallography. Tivozanib treatment reduced tumor organoid formation <i>in vitro<\/i> and induced tumor regression <i>in vivo<\/i> using murine xenografts with resulting morphology similar to XPO7 and SLK knockdown tumors. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of SLK was used to confirm the observed phenotypic alterations secondary to SLK inhibition. Signal transduction studies with SLK knockdown in CCA cell lines demonstrated downregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling with further effects on DNA damage resulting in G2 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, tivozanib demonstrated anti-tumor activity and increased apoptosis in established CCA patient-derived xenografts with cytoplasmic XPO7 expression. Using <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor slice cultures, tivozanib significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis in XPO7\/SLK-expressing tumors (N=3) but not in tumors without this expression pattern (N=6). Further evaluation of these tivozanib-treated tumor slice cultures demonstrated a reduction in the expression of phosphorylated mTOR (S2448), AKT (T308), S6 (S235\/236) in the high XPO7\/SLK-expressing tumors but not in tumors without this expression pattern.

Over half of AKT1 E17K mutant breast and gynecologic cancers are homozygous for the mutant oncogene with loss of the wildtype (WT) AKT1 allele via copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH), suggesting uniquely potent oncogene addiction in these tumor types. While inhibitors of WT PI3K or AKT have demonstrated clinical efficacy in HR+\/HER2- metastatic breast cancers with PI3K\/AKT pathway mutations, on-target adverse events - most commonly hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and rash - have hindered the tolerability and durability of these agents. We aimed to exploit the mutant lysine of the E17K variant to develop a covalent, highly mutant-selective inhibitor that would avoid the toxicities associated with WT AKT inhibition.<br \/><b>METHODS:<br \/><\/b>Structure-based design was guided by proprietary co-crystal structures, enabling a refined pharmacophore consensus model, which fueled novel small molecule covalent design iterations using an in-house computational chemistry cluster. Lead molecules were identified from cellular signaling assays assessing pAKT S473 suppression and selectivity over WT AKT1 and AKT2. Rapid PK assessments were performed in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Molecules with low clearance and high oral bioavailability were advanced directly to breast and endometrial PDX models driven by AKT1 E17K mutations.<br \/><b><br \/>RESULTS:<br \/><\/b>We identified ALTA-2618, a potent (7nM EC50) inhibitor of AKT1 E17K with 22x selectivity over WT AKT1 and 140x selectivity over WT AKT2. ALTA-2618 and related analogues demonstrated covalent attachment to the AKT1 E17K protein via intact mass spectrometry, and electron density analysis of co-crystal structures of highly similar family members of ALTA-2618 reveals unambiguous covalent attachment to the K17 side chain. Based on favorable exposure-response relationships and ideal cross-species PK, ALTA-2618 was tested in once daily oral dosing and induced tumor regressions in AKT1 E17K mutant HR+\/HER2low breast cancer, TNBC, and endometrial cancer PDXs at doses as low as 10 mg\/kg\/d. Complete responses were observed with 30 mg\/kg\/d in the HR+\/HER2low breast PDX model that were sustained for 60 days of dosing without significant body weight loss or hyperglycemia.<br \/><b><br \/>CONCLUSIONS:<br \/><\/b>ALTA-2618 is a potent, highly mutant-selective AKT1 E17K inhibitor that demonstrates favorable PK and tolerability with oral once-daily dosing that enables prolonged tumor regressions in multiple AKT1 E17K-mutant PDX models. These data support a mid-2024 IND submission to investigate ALTA-2618 in patients with AKT1 E17K mutant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Akt,Breast cancer,Endometrial cancer,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Because many cancers, including breast and lung cancers, can metastasize to the CNS, brain penetration should be a key feature of new therapies. The FDA-approved PI3K inhibitor alpelisib lacks CNS activity, and brain-penetrant alternatives such as buparlisib and paxalasib were not approved due to toxicity associated with a lack of mutant selectivity. OKI-219 is a potent, highly selective PI3K&#945;<sup>H1047R<\/sup> inhibitor that has shown preclinical anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer models, both as a monotherapy and in combination with HER2- and ER-mediated therapeutics.

H1047R increases kinase activity and is the most common PI3K&#945; mutation with a mutation rate of 7.8% in all cancers, and 21%, 5% and 3% in breast cancer, endometrium, and ovarian cancer, respectively. Alpelisib is an FDA approved PI3K&#945; inhibitor targeting both wild-type (WT) and mutant PI3K&#945;, yet its clinical benefit is limited by the toxicities including hyperglycemia and rash (which are considered on target effects of WT- PI3K&#945; inhibition). Here, we report an allosteric and brain-penetrating PI3K&#945; inhibitor, HP567 that is 14-fold selective for PI3K&#945; H1047R over PI3K&#945; WT and is 80-fold selective over other PI3K isoforms. HP567 strongly inhibits proliferation and p-AKT (S473) in H1047R mutant cell lines with an average IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 138 nM and 8 nM, respectively, and has no activity against PI3K&#945; WT cell lines.

Most studies are still focused on 2D, completely ignoring cell-to-cell interactions, <i>in vivo<\/i> tissue architecture and the surrounding microenvironment. To address this void in cancer research, we aimed to develop a biomimetic 3D lung cancer spheroid model that can be used as a more reliable tool for pharmacological studies. Therefore, 3D spheroids of A549 (adenocarcinoma), H460 (large cell carcinoma) and H520 (squamous cell carcinoma) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were optimized and consequently submitted to AZD2014 treatment, a dual mTOR inhibitor targeting mTORC1 and mTORC2, members of the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway, which is commonly deregulated in lung cancer. Each cell line was seeded at 2000, 5000 or 10000 cells\/spheroid in agarose micro-molds for eight days. The 3D NSCLC spheroids were further characterized for their tumor features, namely 3D dynamics and morphology, including diameter, circularity and compactness, viability properties, as well as proliferative and necrotic areas. Based on this characterization, the 2000 cells\/spheroid condition was selected for further treatments and spheroid treatment time-points were selected. For each cell line, spheroids were treated with AZD2014, using concentrations based on the IC<sub>30<\/sub> values (sensitization concentration) defined under 2D conditions: 10 &#956;M, 10 &#956;M and 0.2 &#956;M for A549, H460 and H520 spheroids, respectively. Treated and untreated spheroids were followed during six days post-treatment, and their morphological characteristics, cell viability, necrotic core formation and proliferative areas, as well as ATP production, were assessed. Spheroids of all cell lines exhibited a significant inhibition of spheroid growth with AZD2014 treatment, which was maintained over the six days. Moreover, a reduction in spheroid intracellular ATP was observed at days three and six post-treatment. An additional treatment regimen was studied by re-treating spheroids with the same concentration of AZD2014 after 48hrs from the first treatment. Spheroids exposed to this dual treatment regimen exhibited a significant inhibition of spheroid growth, while the respective controls exhibited intensified growth. While AZD2014 did not induce significant reductions in 3D cell viability, a clear inhibition of spheroid growth was observed. Having a more intricate cellular organization, this study alleviates the increased complexity of pharmacological responses in 3D spheroids when compared to 2D models. Further studies are being carried out to define the enhanced biomimetic ability of these NSCLC spheroids and the underlying mechanisms involved when targeting the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway using AZD2014 as mono-therapy or in combination with two novel anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-07 PI3K\/AKT inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,Lung cancer: non-small cell,mTOR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Androgens play an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancers and targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis over decades has remained a mainstay of prostate cancer therapy. Next generation hormonal agents (NHAs) enzalutamide and abiraterone have brought clinical benefits for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, AR axis-targeted therapy resistance is inevitable due to AR gene amplification or mutations. AR-V7 is the most clinically relevant AR splice variant associated with endocrine resistance and poor prognosis. AR-V7 constitutively activates AR signaling and lacks the ligand binding domain (LBD) where hormones and AR antagonists interact, resulting in resistance to AR signaling inhibitors (ARSi). Thus, AR-V7 is a promising therapeutic target to address ARSi resistance in mCRPC. We have discovered a highly potent AR-V7 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), HC-4955 that degrades both the wild-type AR (WT-AR) and AR-V7 mutant. HC-4955 degrades AR-V7 with DC50 &#60; 5 nM. In silico molecular docking analysis predicts the binding of HC-4955 to the N-terminal domain of AR and then the essential amino acids contributed to HC-4955 binding are validated by mutational analysis studies. HC-4955 also potently degrades mutants of AR-LBD mutations including L702H and T878A and these mutations are also associated with ARSi resistance. HC-4955 strongly inhibits proliferation of ARSi-resistant prostate cancer cell lines with IC50 &#60; 10 nM. HC-4955 shows a robust anti-tumor activity in the AR-V7-bearing 22Rv1 cell line derived tumor xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, with majority of the tumors completely regressed and &#62; 90% AR-V7 expression decreased at 1-5 mg\/kg (QD, PO) in these models.

Chemotherapy is the mainstay treatment for TNBC patients, yet with limited clinical benefit. Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in approximately 50% of TNBC tumors and thus the anti-androgen therapy could be a promising solution for the treatment of AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC. Nevertheless, AR inhibitors including enzalutamide and bicalutamide or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone have failed to demonstrate satisfying anti-tumor activity in clinical trials. We have discovered HP518, an AR-targeting PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) that induces potent degradation of both the wild-type AR and AR mutants. HP518 is currently under the clinical development for the treatment of mCRPC. Here we report the preclinical data on HP518 for the treatment of AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC. HP518 robustly degrades AR in multiple TNBC cell lines with a half-maximal degradation concentration (DC<sub>50<\/sub>) &#60; 1 nM. HP518 strongly inhibits AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC cell growth, whereas the AR inhibitor enzalutamide does not show significant anti-proliferative effect on these cells in the presence or absence of androgen. Consistent with the <i>in vitro<\/i> results, HP518 significantly and dose-dependently inhibits tumor growth in MDA-MB-453 cell line derived tumor xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. <i>PI3KCA <\/i>activating mutations are frequently expressed in AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC. HP518 in combination with alpelisib, a PI3K&#945; inhibitor shows a synergistic anti-tumor activity. Mechanistically, HP518, but not AR inhibitor enzalutamide downregulates the mRNA expression levels of a set of DNA replication-related genes in AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC cells, indicating a novel and ligand-independent role for AR in regulating growth of AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC cells. Therefore, HP518, an AR-targeting PROTAC degrader holds great potential to fulfill the unmet clinical needs for the AR<sup>+<\/sup> TNBC therapy. Selected pre-clinical data will be presented.

DOX targets topoisomerase II alpha (Top2&#945;) and beta (Top2&#946;), two enzymes that regulate DNA topology. Top2&#946; is present in cardiomyocytes and has been proposed as a major contributor to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Annamycin (ANN), a novel clinically evaluated DOX analog, displays suppressed or no cardiotoxic properties in preclinical in vivo experiments. The objective of this study was to directly assess and compare the potency of DOX and ANN against Top2&#945; and Top2&#946; and determine their impact on physiology of human cardiomyocytes and mice hearts following chronic exposure. Our initial data are clearly aligned with lack of drug-related cardiotoxic events in ANN-treated patients in ongoing clinical trials.<br \/><b>Methods.<\/b> The potency of ANN and DOX to inhibit Top2 was tested in DNA relaxation assays using recombinant Top2&#945; and Top2&#946; with kinetoplast as the DNA substrate. ANN and DOX cytotoxicity was assessed in a panel of cancer cell lines cardiomyocytes (murine and human). In addition, the effects on cardiomyocyte physiology (beating rate, contraction, electric potential,) were assessed in human cardiomyocytes using the xCELLigence RTCA CardioECR. The pathophysiology of the heart after chronic exposure to the drugs was also evaluated in mice models. Cardiotoxicity of liposome formulated ANN (L-ANN) is currently being examined in ongoing clinical studies of subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (NCT05319587) or soft tissue sarcoma with metastases to the lungs (NCT04887298).<br \/><b>Results. <\/b> The<b> <\/b>nanomolar range potency of ANN in tested cancer cell lines was 2-10 times greater than that of DOX. The DNA relaxation assay demonstrated high potency of ANN against recombinant Top2&#945; and Top&#946; with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values 0.23&#177;0.06 and 0.22&#177; 0.06 &#181;M, respectively, whereas the IC<sub>50<\/sub> for DOX was 0.65&#177; 0.22 and 0.34&#177; 0.31&#181;M, respectively. Importantly, ANN did not significantly affect electric potential, contractility, and viability of human cardiomyocytes up to highest tested dose of 1,500 nM (72h exposure). In contrast, DOX caused a dramatic change in heart beating rate and decreased in contractility and field potential amplitude. In rat cardiomyocyte culture (H92C), ANN was 14-fold less cytotoxic than DOX (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1,264 nM for ANN vs. 88 nM for DOX). No cardiotoxicity of L-ANN was detected in myocardium of nude mice exposed weekly for 12 weeks to therapeutic doses of L-ANN (4 mg\/kg, 40% of LD<sub>10<\/sub>). Finally, data from ongoing clinical trials revealed no drug related cardiac events in patients receiving L-ANN (confirmed by an independent review of the Duke&#8217;s ECHO core laboratory, USA).<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Conclusions.<\/b> Our preclinical studies demonstrate non-cardiotoxic properties of ANN. These data are clearly aligned with lack of drug-related cardiotoxic events in ANN-treated patients in ongoing clinical trials. Interestingly, ANN appeared to be a significantly more potent inhibitor of Top2&#946; than DOX, suggesting that Top2&#946; may not be a universal mediator of cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. Additional studies are needed to reevaluate the role of Top2&#946; in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-11 Topoisomerases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Topoisomerase II inhibitor,Doxorubicin,Annamycin,Cardiotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

While often effective, RT may not be efficacious for some tumors while exerting significant short-term and long-term toxicities. Thus, enhancing therapeutic effectiveness of radiation therapy remains an important goal. ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia, mutated) and DNA-PKcs (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit) are related protein kinases and both are critical regulators of cellular responses to ionizing radiation. We report here the identification and initial characterization of XRD-0394, a potent, specific dual inhibitor of both ATM and DNA-PKcs, whose chemical structure will be disclosed. A dual ATM\/DNA-PK inhibitor has practical and theoretical advantages over compounds which inhibit just one of these kinases: 1) blunting both DNA damage response (DDR) pathways enhances radiation-induced tumor cell kill compared to single target inhibition; and 2) simultaneous inhibition of two DDR pathways should overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumor cells to either target alone. Notably, transient inhibition of both kinases by XRD-0394 has little adverse effects on cells in the absence of irradiation. XRD-0394 is orally bioavailable, with excellent pharmacological profiles, demonstrating significant in vitro and in vivo sensitizing activity in combination with ionizing radiation and in combination with immunotherapy and radiation. In addition, a CRISPR screen identified alterations in the Fanconi A\/BRCA pathway as an opportunity for synthetic lethality in tumor cells exposed to XRD-0394, an insight that was validated in multiple tumor cell types. In vitro studies demonstrated synergy of XRD-0394 in combination with PARP inhibitors, particularly in BRCA-mutant cells. XRD-0394 also potentiates the effectiveness of topoisomerase inhibitors in vitro. Single doses of XRD-0394 were well-tolerated in combination with palliative RT in subjects with advanced cancer in a Phase Ia clinical trial (NCT05002140). No DLTs were observed. At a dose of 160 mg, plasma concentrations were well above the preclinical target plasma level of 530 ng\/mL (1 &#181;M) for up to 15 h and inhibition of ATM kinase activity was demonstrated by inhibition of radiation-induced pKAP1 in tumor tissue. Importantly, this concentration of drug is sufficient to induce potent radiosensitization in numerous preclinical models. The median t<sub>max<\/sub> (2.3 h) and mean terminal t&#189; (11.1 h) at the 160 mg dose in subjects support coadministration of XRD-0394 and RT within a clinically feasible time frame. These results provide a rationale for future clinical trials with XRD-0394 in combination with RT, RT and immunotherapy, PARP inhibitors and targeted delivery of topoisomerase inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATM,DNA-PK,DNA damage response,Radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Tona M.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) crizotinib, entrectinib, and repotrectinib have been approved for the treatment of <i>ROS1<\/i>-positive NSCLC. Response to these TKIs can be limited by emergence of drug resistance, with ~40% of patients acquiring on-target <i>ROS1<\/i> mutations at progression on crizotinib. NVL-520 is an investigational, brain-penetrant, and TRK-sparing ROS1 TKI designed to maintain activity for ROS1 mutations that confer resistance to approved therapies. To investigate suppression of resistance by NVL-520, we performed two <i>N<\/i>-ethyl-<i>N<\/i>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screens and determined the frequency and identity of resistance mutations following treatment with NVL-520 versus earlier-generation ROS1 TKIs.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>Cells were treated with ENU for 1 day followed by crizotinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, or NVL-520 for 28 days.

Resistant clones harboring <i>ROS1<\/i> kinase-domain mutations were expanded and used to profile the inhibitory activity of ROS1 TKIs.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>The first ENU screen was performed on Ba\/F3 CD74-ROS1, simulating a first-line treatment setting. NVL-520 at an unbound drug concentration (C<sub>unbound<\/sub>) of 8.2 nM yielded 1 resistant clone among 480 replicate wells (frequency of resistance = 0.2%). The second screen was performed on Ba\/F3 CD74-ROS1 G2032R, which is the most common point mutation after progression on previous-generation therapies, simulating a later-line treatment setting. NVL-520 at C<sub>unbound<\/sub> of 41 nM yielded 6 resistant clones among 480 replicate wells (frequency of resistance = 1.3%). These NVL-520 concentrations (8.2 - 41 nM) were well within its average C<sub>unbound<\/sub> of 166 nM at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100 mg once daily. None of the 7 resistant clones harbored ROS1 kinase-domain mutations, suggesting an off-target resistance mechanism. Crizotinib, entrectinib, and repotrectinib at their respective average human C<sub>unbound<\/sub> yielded frequencies of resistance ranging from &#62;33% to 100% in at least one of the screens, indicating that they were less effective than NVL-520 at suppressing resistance in these screens.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> NVL-520 was highly effective at suppressing resistance in ENU mutagenesis screens simulating first-line (CD74-ROS1) and later-line (CD74-ROS1 G2032R) treatment. The screens did not reveal any novel <i>ROS1<\/i> mutations that could confer resistance to NVL-520 at the RP2D. The broad preclinical activity against ROS1 and diverse ROS1 mutations, together with its brain penetrance and TRK-sparing design, suggests NVL-520 as a potential best-in-class ROS1 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-13 Tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ROS1,Resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Mutagenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
