[{"Abstract":"Somatic driver mutations in <i>KRAS<\/i> are found in ~40% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and are associated with worse outcomes. In the US, individuals of African ancestry with CRC are more likely to have tumors with <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations than individuals of European ancestry, even after considering differences in socioeconomic status and other risk factors. Germline variants can influence somatic mutation events and may provide a selective advantage such that a mutated cell is more likely to progress to a cancer. Germline variants have been found to associate with somatic mutations in a variety of tumors. Based on ancestry differences in <i>KRAS<\/i> tumor mutation frequency, we hypothesized that<b> <\/b>germline variants altering molecular pathways that support <i>KRAS<\/i> tumorigenesis will associate with <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant status. To test this, we performed a two-step association study using <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation status as our phenotype in individuals with microsatellite stable CRC. First, we conducted a discovery analysis using genome-wide germline genotypes and somatic mutation data from 6,386 non-Hispanic White CRC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the GECCO consortium, considering sex and tumor location as covariates. To select variants for additional study, we used <i>in-silico<\/i> tools, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), to predict how associated variants may alter gene expression and chromatin. After reviewing relevant genomic features, excluding SNVs with minor allele frequency &#60;10% and pruning SNVs in linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2<\/sup>&#62;0.75), we identified candidate loci for a multi-ancestry independent validation analysis. In the discovery analysis, no variants met genome-wide significance thresholds (<i>p<\/i>-value &#60;5x10<sup>-8<\/sup>), though 3 SNVs associated with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation status with <i>p<\/i>-values &#60;1x10<sup>-6<\/sup> and 50 with <i>p<\/i>-values &#60;1x10<sup>-5<\/sup>. Of these 50 SNVs, 21 met criteria for validation. We chose 80 additional SNVs (<i>p<\/i>-value &#60;1x10<sup>-4<\/sup>) with predicted functional effect, for a total of 101 SNVs for analyses. In our preliminary validation analysis of 1,487 individuals grouped by self-reported race, no variants had a significant association in all populations. The rs726800 variant showed nominal association with <i>KRAS <\/i>mutation status (<i>p<\/i>-value=0.028) in self-reported non-Hispanic White individuals. This variant is within potential cis-regulatory distance of <i>HS3ST3A1<\/i> and<i> COX10-DT<\/i>, both of which have been reported as cancer biomarkers. Nominal associations were identified in self-reported Black (n=7 SNVs) and Hispanic or Latino (n=3 SNVs) individuals, though both groups had limited sample sizes. Additional validation samples are being analyzed, as well as analysis with adjustment for genetic ancestry. Future functional studies of top candidate variants will add mechanistic insight. In summary, we identified germline SNVs that associate with <i>KRAS<\/i> somatic mutations in CRC and may inform the cellular context that supports development of colorectal tumors with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Somatic mutations,KRAS,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

We conducted a gene-environment interaction (GxE) study to characterize lifetime arsenic exposure from drinking water, inherited susceptibility, and bladder cancer risk in the New England Bladder Cancer Study. Exposures were estimated from arsenic measured in water samples collected at home and workplace. We evaluated common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) i) from the latest bladder cancer genome-wide association study (n= 28), ii) from candidate gene studies of arsenic or bladder cancer (n= 16 SNPs), and iii) SNPs from a large genome-wide association study of arsenic metabolism (n = 4 SNPs) as potential effect modifiers of the arsenic-bladder cancer relationship. We coded SNPs as the absence or presence of a risk\/effect allele for bladder cancer or arsenic metabolism in 2,019 adults (928 bladder cancer cases and 1,091 controls) and arsenic exposures as tertiles. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, high-risk occupation, and principal components of genetic ancestry were estimated using logistic regression models. P-values for multiplicative interaction were calculated. Out of 48 SNPs, we found evidence of interaction for 7 SNPs at the statistical significance level of <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05. Most SNPs involved in GxE interactions are mapped to genomic regions known or suspected to function in arsenic metabolism. For the association between cumulative lifetime water arsenic (mg) and bladder cancer, the strongest evidence of an interaction was with rs1046428 (near <i>GSTZ1<\/i> on 14q23); among those with one or two copies of the T risk allele, OR<sub>T2vsT1<\/sub>: 1.52, CI: 1.11 - 2.07; OR<sub>T3 vsT1<\/sub>: 1.44, CI: 1.05 - 1.98, <i>P<sub>interaction<\/sub><\/i><sub> <\/sub>= 0.01; among those with no risk allele copy, OR<sub>T2vsT1<\/sub>: 0.91, CI: 0.62 - 1.35; OR<sub>T3 vsT1<\/sub>: 0.97, CI: 0.65 - 1.44.

Its rising incidence is a global concern. The associations between genetic risk, lifestyle, and the risk of early-onset cancer may inform preventive strategies.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> We studied the association between genetic risk, lifestyle and early-onset cancers among 66308 white British participants enrolled in the UK Biobank before age 50. Genetic risk was assessed using sex-specific composite total cancer polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We calculated composite PRSs as weighted sums of previously-developed cancer site-specific PRSs using weights obtained from lasso regression. We considered a breast cancer-specific PRS for analyses on breast cancer among women. A health-associated lifestyle score (HLS) was calculated based on baseline smoking, BMI (men only), physical activity, alcohol intake, and diet. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of early-onset total cancer and breast cancer across genetic risk and HLS groups in women and men.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> A total of 1247 incident invasive early-onset cancer cases (820 in women, 427 in men) were documented, including 386 cases of early-onset breast cancer. In multivariable-adjusted analyses with 2-year latency, higher genetic risk (highest vs. lowest tertile of PRS) was associated with significantly increased risks of early-onset total cancer in women (composite PRS HR=1.85; 95% CI, 1.50-2.29), early onset total cancer in men (composite PRS HR=1.94; 95% CI, 1.45-2.59), and early-onset breast cancer in women (breast-cancer PRS HR=3.06; 95% CI, 2.20-4.25). The HRs (95% CI) of early-onset total cancer in women and men, and early-onset breast cancer in women associated with adopting an unfavorable lifestyle (highest vs. lowest tertile of HLS) were 1.49 (0.99, 2.25), 1.14 (0.67, 1.95), and 1.78 (0.97, 3.24), respectively, in the total study population; 1.85 (1.02, 3.36), 3.27 (0.78, 13.72), and 1.67 (0.71, 3.90), respectively, in those with high genetic risk; 1.25 (0.60, 2.57), 1.11 (0.42, 2.89), and 1.66 (0.54, 5.11), respectively, in those with intermediate genetic risk; and 1.15 (0.44, 2.98), 1.16 (0.39, 3.40), and 2.10 (0.57, 7.75), respectively, in those with low genetic risk.

Established CRC risk factors (E) include high red meat and processed meat intake. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported over 200 genetic variants associated with CRC risk. We used functional annotation data to identify subsets of GWAS variants within known pathways and constructed corresponding pathway Polygenic Risk Scores (pPRS). We evaluated pPRS by E interactions to determine whether genes within specific pathways interacted with meat intake to impact CRC risk.<br \/>Methods: A pooled sample of 54,531 CRC controls and 48,260 cases of European ancestry from 27 studies were analyzed. Study-specific quartiles for red and processed meat intake were generated through in-person interviews and structured self-administered questionnaires. Variants were imported to AnnoQ for annotation (n=203) and analyzed for overrepresentation in PANTHER-reported pathways with Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Standard approaches were used to compute polygenic risk score weights relating the 203 variants to CRC. The subset of weights corresponding to each of five pathways were then used to compute the corresponding pPRS. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated pPRSxE interactions with red meat and processed meat intake.<br \/>Results: A total of 34 unique variants were overrepresented in five pathways: Apoptosis signaling, Alzheimer disease-presenilin, Wnt-signaling, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and TGF-beta signaling. We found a statistically significant interaction between TGF-beta-pPRS and red meat intake (p = 0.0012). Stratified analyses reported a dose-response trend in the red meat and CRC risk association, with decreasing estimates of red meat and CRC risk association, comparing first to fourth quartiles of meat intake, with increasing quartiles of TGF-beta-pPRS: 13% (Q1), 12% (Q2), 7% (Q3), and 6% (Q4). This association remained significant after adjustment for all other variants (p = 0.0013), and all other pPRS with variants that did not overlap with the TGF-beta-pPRS (p = 0.0012). Independent GxE interaction models for individual variants that were included in the TGF-beta pathway showed significant interactions with red meat for rs2337113 (intron <i>SMAD7<\/i> gene, Chr18), and rs2208603 (intergenic region <i>BMP5<\/i>, Chr6) (p = 0.013 &#38; 0.0108, respectively). We did not find significant pPRS x red meat interactions for the other four pathways or with any pPRS x processed meat.<br \/>Conclusion: This pathway-based interaction analysis revealed a statistical interaction between SNPs in the TGF-beta pathway and red meat consumption that impacts CRC risk. These findings shed light into the possible mechanistic link between CRC risk and red meat consumption.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Polygenic Risk Scores,Genome-Wide GxE Analysis,Meat Consumption,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

The PRS was constructed with 451 risk variants identified from prior PCa GWAS, measured on DNA from blood or buccal, standardized by adjusting for mean and standard deviation (SD) based on men without PCa with array-based genotyping data in HPFS\/PHS. Prostate tumor biomarkers of molecular subtypes (<i>TMPRSS2:ERG<\/i> fusion, PTEN loss, and <i>TP53<\/i> missense mutations from validated immunohistochemistry assays), insulin\/lipid signaling pathways (FASN, IR, and IGF1-R), and cellular proliferation and tumor microenvironment (Ki-67, apoptosis rates, and angiogenesis) were measured on tumor tissue from radical prostatectomy or TURMP. Sample sizes varied by tumor biomarkers, ranging from 214 for angiogenesis markers to 598 for ERG protein expression. We first used either logistic or negative binomial regression to evaluate the association between the PRS and the protein expression (levels) of each individual biomarker, and then evaluated the addition of multiplicative interaction terms between PRS and biomarkers to logistic regression models for lethal PCa, defined as metastases or death from PCa. Lastly, we evaluated the predictive performance for lethal PCa by area under the curve (AUC). All models adjusted for age at diagnosis and Gleason score.<br \/>Among all patients included in the analysis, the median age at diagnosis was 66 (interquartile range: 62-70) years, with 20% having a Gleason score&#8805;8 and 10% having lethal PCa. PRS showed no association with lethal PCa (OR per SD increase PRS=0.95, 95%CI 0.85-1.06) or most tumor biomarkers, except for the apoptosis index (per SD in PRS corresponding to 0.22 units increase, 95%CI 0.02-0.42). Statistically significant interactions were found between PRS and p53 overexpression (p interaction = 1.6x10<sup>-5<\/sup>), PTEN loss (p=3.7x10<sup>-3<\/sup>), FASN (p=0.03), and Ki-67 (p=1.6x10<sup>-3<\/sup>), suggesting that compared to men with a PRS higher than the median, <i>TP53<\/i> missense mutation, PTEN loss, higher FASN intensity, and higher Ki-67 indices were more strongly associated with lethal PCa in patients with lower PRS. Incorporating PRS with tumor biomarkers into predictive models enhanced the AUC beyond a model with tumor biomarker and age. The largest improvements were observed when combining the PRS with Ki-67 and apoptosis, showing absolute increases of 5% and 7% respectively.<br \/>In conclusion, PRS integration with tumor biomarkers at diagnosis potentially improves the prediction of lethal PCa, thereby informing more targeted management strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Protein expression,Genetic susceptibility,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

One of the GWAS signals is rs10069690-T, which creates an alternative intron 4 splicing site, co-producing full-length (FL) and truncated <i>INS1b <\/i>transcript for dominant-negative telomerase-nonfunctional TERT. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR6-1, 38 bp repeat unit) within intron 6 remains uncharacterized in relation to GWAS signals and cancer risk. We hypothesized that VNTR6-1 might contribute to GWAS signals represented by rs10069690.<br \/>We scored VNTR6-1 and rs10069690 in short-read WGS data (n=3,202) from the 1000 Genomes Project with a machine learning model using the GLMnet engine, and in phased long-read assemblies (n=544). We defined two VNTR6-1 groups: Short (24-27 copies) and Long (40.5-66.5 copies); the VNTR6-1-Long group was preferentially linked with rs10069690-T compared to C allele (p=2.53E-13). We show that haplotypes of rs56345976 and rs33961405 alleles can predict VNTR6-1 groups. We imputed VNTR6-1 in UK Biobank controls (n=351,634), PLCO cancer cases and controls (n=100,445), and African Burkitt lymphoma cases (aBL, n=79).<br \/>Functional studies in aBL tumors revealed a suggestive association between reduced total <i>TERT<\/i> expression, rs10096690-T (p=0.035) and VNTR6-1-Long (p=0.053). VNTR6-1 forms a G4 quadruplex structure sensitive to G4 stabilizing ligands, altering the ratio between <i>FL-TERT<\/i> and a dominant-negative <i>TERT-&#946;<\/i> isoform in isogenic cell lines with\/without VNTR6-1. In GTEx and TCGA, several metrics related to cell proliferation and telomerase activity correlated positively with <i>FL-TERT<\/i> expression and negatively with <i>TERT-&#946;<\/i> expression.<br \/>We created a composite marker with 0, 1 or 2 copies of the <i>FL-TERT<\/i>-associated haplotype (VNTR6-1-Short\/rs10069690-C) to capture the effects of these variants that negatively affect <i>TERT<\/i> expression and telomerase activity. The number of copies of the VNTR6-1\/rs10069690 haplotype was associated with relative leukocyte telomere length in UK Biobank controlling for sex and age (&#946;=0.049, p=8.75E-78). This marker was also associated with a reduced risk of bladder and prostate cancer but an increased risk of breast, endometrial, ovarian, thyroid cancer, and glioma in PLCO.<br \/>Our findings reveal that germline variants VNTR6-1-Long\/rs10069690-T underlie the multi-cancer GWAS signal and jointly decrease <i>TERT<\/i> expression and telomerase activity, potentially reducing the risk of some cancers by limiting cell growth. However, decreased telomerase activity could deregulate stem cell-driven tissue regeneration and genome integrity, increasing the risk of other cancers. Our findings unveil novel mechanisms of cancer susceptibility and propose therapeutic avenues for targeting <i>TERT<\/i> isoform ratios to modulate telomerase activity and its cellular effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genetics,TERT,Polymorphisms,Structural variation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>O.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with cervical cancer. However, these discoveries have been limited by the small sample sizes of the individual cohorts. To identify additional novel loci associated with cervical cancer, we performed a trans-ethnic meta-analysis.<br \/>Methods: GWAS summary data for trans-ethic meta-analysis were identified in women of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, East Asian ancestry from Biobank Japan, and African ancestries from the pan-UK Biobank and Johannesburg cancer study. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed effect inverse variance weighted method implemented in GWAMA. To localize putative genomic loci associated with cervical cancer, we performed fine mapping using the Bayesian approach by calculating the marginal posterior probability of causality for each single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 99% credible set size.<br \/>Results: Our meta-analysis identified four additional novel genomic loci associated with cervical cancer. These loci include: rs147778467 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.16, P-value = 3.12 x 10<sup>-08<\/sup>) in <i>RGS21<\/i>, rs53150478 (OR =1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.05, P-value = 4.48 x 10<sup>-08<\/sup>) in <i>MAN1C1<\/i>, rs113842373 (OR = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.56-0.81, P-value = 2.31 x 10<sup>-09<\/sup>) in <i>LINCO1850<\/i> and rs75372437 (OR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.72-0.88, P-value = 3.32 x 10<sup>-08<\/sup>) in <i>RNU6-356P<\/i>.

Multi-ethnic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a thousand genetic variants associated with PCa risk in different races. However, the majority of risk variants are located in non-coding regions, making it challenging to understand their contribution to PCa risk. Non-coding regions include functional regulatory elements (REs) such as promoters and enhancers, whose activity can be evaluated by histone modification H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, respectively. In this study, we integrated PCa risk variants with hundreds of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from normal and cancer prostate cell lines and tissues, finding 122 variants in promoters and 301 variants in enhancers. Enhancers are distal to promoters, and they form loops to regulate gene expression, mediated by transcription factors (TFs). Enhancer activities are tightly associated with cell fate. Genetic variants can affect the activity of enhancers by changing the binding preference of TFs and such changes can affect chromatin interactions and dysregulate gene expression. We hypothesize that allele changes of enhancer variants contribute to PCa risk differently among individuals from different ancestries, leading to the development of heterogeneous PCa molecular subgroups, characterized by genetic alterations including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. By integrating H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from prostate cell lines derived from European (EUR) and African (AFR) ancestries, we found 185 risk variants in enhancers in EUR cell lines and 69 risk variants in enhancers in AFR cell lines. Next, we integrated patient tissue-derived H3K27ac ChIP-seq data and performed chromatin quantitative trait loci (cQTL) and allelic imbalance (AI) analyses to determine risk variants associated with enhancer activity. Among the 185 risk enhancer variants in EUR and 69 in AFR cell lines, we found 130 and 46 with significant association, respectively. To determine TFs that change binding upon allele change of enhancer risk variants, we integrated hundreds of TF ChIP-seq data from prostate cell lines and tissues. Among the 185 risk enhancer variants in EUR and 69 in AFR cell lines, we found 142 and 44 variants bound by TFs, respectively. When we further performed cQTL and AI analyses for FOXA1, HOXB13, and AR, we found 87 and 29 variants significantly associated with TF binding affinity, respectively. Moreover, we found that these associations differ between TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive and negative tumors. To identify the target genes of enhancer risk variants, we are currently integrating chromatin interaction data including Hi-C and Micro-C. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of risk variants in various populations and individuals which lead to the development of heterogeneous PCa subgroups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Prostate cancer,Enhancer risk variants,Multi-omics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

EwS occurs primarily in children of European ancestry suggesting a genetic component to susceptibility. Prior investigations identified six susceptibility loci associated with EwS, with evidence for additional signals not reaching the commonly accepted threshold for genome-wide significance (i.e., p&#60;5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;8<\/sup>). At least two of these loci demonstrate evidence of tagging variation in length of nearby GGAA microsatellites, which alter binding of the pathognomonic <i>EWSR1::FLI1<\/i> fusion resulting in downstream dysregulation of target genes promoting sarcomagenesis. To identify additional susceptibility loci, we performed the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date consisting of 1,640 EwS cases and 8,457 cancer-free individuals of European ancestry from 8 studies and matched by principal components. Genotype imputation was carried out by study\/array using TOPMed data as the reference and each set was analyzed using PLINK 1.9 adjusting for significant principal components.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that regulates cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and mutations in the EGFR gene have been found to be a defining hallmark of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We investigated if overall genetic susceptibility to LUAD, defined as a polygenic risk score (PRS), is differentially associated with LUAD by EGFR mutation status.<br \/>Methods: The study consists of 998 female never-smoking histologically confirmed LUAD cases with data on EGFR mutation status and 4,544 female never-smoking controls from the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia. Germline DNA samples were genotyped using the 370K, 610Q, or 660W microarrays. Genomic DNA extracted from fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples of LUAD cases were genotyped for EGFR mutations on exons 19 and 21. We defined cases with EGFR mutation on either exon as EGFR+ (n=518) and cases without such EGFR mutation as EGFR- (n=480). Weights from 942,592 single nucleotide variants derived from a previously conducted genome-wide association study were used in a Bayesian-based approach, LDpred2, to derive a PRS for all participants. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between continuous PRS, PRS quartiles and tumor EGFR mutation status using logistic regression models in a case-case analysis, as well as using a multinomial logistic regression treating controls as the reference. All models were adjusted for age, study and the top 10 principal components.<br \/>Results: In case-case comparisons, compared to EGFR- LUAD, we found a positive association between continuous PRS and risk of EGFR+ LUAD (OR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34), as well as a dose-response relationship between quartiles of the PRS and EGFR+ LUAD (p-trend=0.003). We further found that the association between the fourth quartile of the PRS with EGFR+ LUAD (OR=8.63, 95% CI: 5.67, 13.14) was significantly higher than the association between the fourth quartile of the PRS with EGFR- LUAD (OR=3.50, 95% CI: 2.44, 5.00) compared to controls (p-heterogeneity=0.004).<br \/>Conclusions: We found that the PRS developed for LUAD in EAS individuals was more strongly associated with EGFR+ LUAD compared to EGFR- LUAD, suggesting that germline genetic susceptibility may be differentially associated with LUAD in never-smoking female EAS patients depending on the cancer&#8217;s mutation status. Given that patients with LUAD respond differently to treatments that are used as targeted therapy depending on their EGFR mutation status, our findings may have important public health and clinical implications, which may guide risk stratification, screening, and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Genetic susceptibility,Somatic mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Furthermore, functional interpretation of post-GWAS analysis gains attention and various approaches to find drug-repurposing candidates are used in cancer research. Our study aims to identify susceptible genes for CRC and provide drug-repurposing candidates.<br \/>Methods: CRC patients in Seoul National University Hospital with prospective follow-up were recruited. From blood-derived DNA, genome-wide SNPs were genotyped using the Korea Biobank Array and 409,063 SNPs were extracted. SNP-based logistic regression model was fit for the event of CRC estimating beta values. Furthermore, post-GWAS analysis was conducted using regulatory function, multiple annotation and gene expression database.

We explored the relationship between a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CRC risk and lifestyle risk factors to understand whether individuals with higher genetic risk, who do not develop CRC, engage in healthier lifestyle behaviors, or conversely, whether those with lower genetic risk, who do develop CRC, engage in riskier behaviors in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.<br \/>Using summary statistics obtained from a large independent GWAS meta-analysis of CRC by the GECCO consortium, we developed a genome-wide PRS for CRC using SBayesR and applied it to participants of European ancestry genotyped in the PLCO Trial (n=74,396). For all subjects, we computed an environmental (E) score based on 19 lifestyle risk factors for CRC, a WCRF\/AICR score that measured adherence to the 2018 Cancer Prevention recommendations, and a 2015 healthy eating index (HEI) with higher values indicating healthier lifestyle profiles. We used t-tests to evaluate differences in lifestyle scores between CRC-free participants in the highest quartile of PRS and incident CRC cases in the lowest quartile of PRS. To examine the correlations between the PRS and lifestyle scores, we performed multivariable linear regression models regressing PRS on each lifestyle score. We used multivariable Cox hazards regression models to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for CRC risk; multiplicative interactions between PRS and lifestyle scores were evaluated using the Wald test for the interaction terms.<br \/>During the 15 years follow-up period, a total of 1,052 CRC cases were diagnosed. Individuals in the highest quartile of PRS who remained cancer-free were more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than those in the lowest quartile of PRS who were diagnosed with incident CRC (E-score: -0.01 vs. -0.18, WCRF\/AICR score: -0.05 vs. -0.32, HEI score: 0.06 vs. -0.13); however, differences were not statistically significant (<i>P<\/i> value: 0.1 to 0.4). PRS and lifestyle scores were significantly (all <i>P<\/i> &#60;0.0001), albeit weakly (&#946;: -0.02 to -0.03), associated among participants who remained CRC-free but not among CRC cases (<i>P<\/i>: 0.1 to 0.3). PRS-lifestyle score interactions were not statistically significant (<i>P<\/i>: 0.2 to 0.4).<br \/>Although the differences and multiplicative interaction models were not statistically significant, we found that individuals with a higher PRS who remained CRC-free were slightly more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than those at a lower genetic score who developed CRC. Additional studies with larger sample size are warranted to further explore the interplay between genetic risk and lifestyle factors related to CRC risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Risk factors,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.-Y.

Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor to CLL, is also associated with a significant risk for hematologic malignancies overall and for lymphoid malignancies, specifically. Moreover, previous research has shown an association between the CLL polygenic risk score (CLL-PRS) and common lymphoma subtypes. This study aims to further evaluate CLL-PRS associations with hematological cancer overall and by lineage while also considering MBL status a strong risk factor for lymphoid malignancies.<br \/>Utilizing the Mayo Clinic Biobank, we selected individuals aged 40 years or older, residing in proximal counties, who had no prior hematologic malignancies, and with available biospecimens. MBL screening was done using 8-color flow cytometry, and MBL with CLL (CD5+\/CD20dim) or atypical CLL (CD5+\/CD20+) immunophenotype were included. CLL-PRS was calculated from 41 known susceptibility variants, with weights being the log of the odds ratios from the largest CLL genome-wide association study. Incident hematologic malignancies were ascertained through ICD codes and confirmed via medical record review. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with hematologic malignancies were estimated through Cox regression.<br \/>Of 7,332 participants, 1,150 (16%) screened positive for MBL; median age was 67 years (range 40-101), and 37% male. Median follow-up was 2.9 years (range 0-13), and 56 hematologic cancers were identified. After adjusting for age and sex, the CLL-PRS was associated with increased risk of developing hematologic (HR=1.49, 95%CI=1.12-1.98, P=0.006) which was all attributable to lymphoid cancers (HR=1.79, 95%CI=1.26-2.56, P=0.001). When adjusting for baseline MBL status in the models, the CLL-PRS associations remained significant but were attenuated for hematological (HR=1.33, 95%CI=0.99-1.79, P=0.058) and lymphoid (HR=1.56, 95%CI=1.07-2.26, P=0.020) malignancies, while MBL status was also significantly associated with risk of hematologic (HR=2.76, 95%CI=1.55-4.91, P=0.001) and lymphoid (HR=3.61, 95%CI=1.78-3.32, P&#60;0.001) malignancies.<br \/>In this prospective cohort study of individuals screened for MBL, CLL-PRS was associated with an elevated risk of hematologic malignancies overall and within the lymphoid lineage, underscoring a shared genetic etiology across many B-cell lymphomas. However, the associations between CLL-PRS and hematologic malignancies were attenuated when accounting for MBL status or when analyzing among MBL-positive individuals, highlighting the role of MBL status in these associations. Further research with expanded cohorts is needed to unravel these complex genetic and clinical interactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Clonal evolution,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Existing blood protein biomarkers for PDAC often suffer from replicability issues, arising from inherent limitations such as unmeasured confounding factors in conventional epidemiologic study designs. To circumvent these limitations, we use genetic instruments to identify proteins with genetically predicted levels to be associated with PDAC risk. Leveraging genome and plasma proteome data from the INTERVAL study, we established and validated models to predict protein levels using genetic variants. By examining 8,275 PDAC cases and 6,723 controls,<b> <\/b>we identified 40 associated proteins, of which 16 are novel. Functionally validating these candidates by focusing on two selected novel protein-encoding genes, <i>GOLM1<\/i> and <i>B4GALT1<\/i>, we demonstrated their pivotal roles in driving PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we also identified potential drug repurposing opportunities for treating PDAC.

While detailed study of four loci have implicated critical pathways in RCC, causal genes and pathways for most loci remain unidentified. To identify such causative variants and target genes, we evaluated a set of variants based on Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA), eQTL analysis, capture Hi-C, and an arrayed CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen. The MPRA identified 196 variants across 19 regions with significant allele-specific effects, indicating cis-regulatory activity. Of these, 39 variants across 10 RCC loci displayed chromatin loops allowing physical interaction with the promoter of 24 nearby putative gene targets, as well as a significant cis-eQTL with the same gene. To confirm the presence of a cis-regulatory relationship between these 39 candidate variants and 24 putative target genes, we performed an arrayed CRISPRi screen in ACHN (RCC) and HEK293T (embryonic renal) cells covering each of the 10 nominated regions. Cells were stably transduced with inactive Cas9 fused to the ZIM3 transcriptional repressor domain and cis-regulatory relationships were assessed by TaqMan qPCR for the target genes. The screen identified multiple novel relevant target genes of RCC predisposition variants, including <i>UCK2<\/i> at 1q24, <i>ABL2 and TDRD5 <\/i>at 1q25, <i>GTDC1<\/i> at 2q22, <i>GPR37<\/i> at 7q31, <i>AGBL3<\/i> and <i>CALD1<\/i> at 7q33, and <i>MAP2K1 <\/i>at 15q22. At some regions, evidence indicates cis-regulatory relationships occur between a target gene and all variants predicted to be &#8216;causative&#8217; at the region (e.g., <i>UCK2<\/i> at 1q24 and <i>ABL2<\/i> at 1q25). For other regions, cis-regulatory relationships occur between a gene and only one variant tested (e.g., <i>GPR37<\/i> at 7q31 and <i>TDRD5<\/i> at 1q25).Previously, target genes of only four RCC susceptibility regions had been identified and published. This study identifies eight novel target genes across six additional RCC susceptibility regions, representing a significant advance in understanding of the underlying biology of RCC susceptibility variants. Furthermore, ongoing screening using the orthologous method, CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), and integration of both normoxic and hypoxic conditions continues to provide further insight into the underlying biology at these regions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

We pooled two large-scale cohorts of childhood cancer survivors to characterize overall and specific SN risks among individuals carrying germline variants in 88 known cancer susceptibility genes with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.<br \/>Methods: Using whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (median [interquartile range] follow-up, 29.7 [13.8] years), we identified rare, potentially protein-damaging germline variants with SnpEff\/ClinVar. Conditional logistic regression evaluated overall SN and SN-specific risk, with up to 100 SN-free controls matched to cases by age, sex, primary childhood cancer type, SN type, radiation dose, chemotherapy, study, and follow-up time.<br \/>Results: Among 11840 individuals (50.6% female) who survived childhood cancer, 2162 (18.3%) developed at least one SN. The risk of developing any SN was elevated among 288 survivors carrying rare, potentially protein-damaging germline variants in an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility gene (cases=13.3%; controls=9.6%; odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.70; <i>P<\/i>=5.12x10<sup>-5<\/sup>). A similar proportion of carriers was observed among those who developed common SNs such as basal cell carcinoma (N=107\/882, 12.1%), meningioma (N=52\/373, 13.9%), breast cancer (N=49\/353, 13.9%), and thyroid cancer (N=32\/243, 13.2%). Higher frequencies of carriers were observed in less common SNs, specifically sarcoma (N=24\/151, 15.9%), colorectal cancer (N=15\/72, 20.8%), and glioma (N=16\/64, 25.0%). The observed associations were generally consistent regardless of treatment type for first primary childhood cancer. Gene-specific analyses revealed that the risk of developing any SN was most pronounced among individuals carrying variants in <i>TP53 <\/i>(cases=0.6%; controls=0.04%; OR, 9.93; 95% CI, 4.62-21.34; <i>P<\/i>=0.001) and <i>FANCM<\/i> (cases=0.9%; controls=0.5%; OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.48-4.03; <i>P<\/i>=0.018).<br \/>Conclusion: In large-scale cohorts of childhood cancer survivors with long-term follow-up, individuals carrying potentially protein-damaging germline variants in known autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility genes have substantially increased SN risk, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing and consideration of genetic risk in follow-up guidelines. However, these individuals account for a small fraction of all SN cases, warranting future research on underlying risk factors in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Genetic susceptibility,Molecular epidemiology,Cancer risk,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

However, underrepresentation in clinical research endeavors has left the Latin American population uncharacterized, which may prevent them from reaping the benefits of these advancements. This study sought to identify the genetic drivers and actionable mutations in solid tumors from Chilean patients, enhancing our understanding of the mutational landscape in a population with a genetically diverse background shaped by admixture.Methods: 468 biopsy tissues from gastric (171), gallbladder (91), breast (72), Ovarian (69), and colorectal (65) Chilean cancer patients were collected in several pathology services and biobank at Universidad de Chile. Target-sequencing was performed using Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v.1 and v.3; and TumorSec cancer panel. Data from TCGA, MSK-IMPACT, and ACCR GENIE cohorts was accessed through cBioportal and used for comparison with non-Hispanic populations. Variants were annotated with CGI, CancerVar, OncoKB, and ClinVar tools.Results: Overall, tumors have mutations mainly in TP53 (42.4%), PIK3CA (12.5%), KRAS (9.6%), PTEN (4.7%), BRCA1\/2 (9%). Driver mutations were present in TP53 (42%), PIK3CA (16%), KRAS (10%), ERBB2 (7%), PTEN (7%), BRCA1\/2 (8%), ATM (7%), among others. Accionable mutations were found primarily in PIK3CA (17%), KRAS (10%), ERBB2 (9%), and NTRK1\/2\/3 (4.8%). Besides already-known mutations, many &#8220;novel&#8221; mutations were also found in all tumor types. About 5-15% of novel variants were predicted drivers, including variants in CDH1, NOTCH1, BRCA1\/2, MTOR, TSC2, and MSH2 genes. Significantly, key driver mutations identified in non-Hispanic patients from international cohorts are also prevalent in admixed Chilean patients. However, variations at the driver pathway level were also observed. Notably, the PI3K and MTOR pathways were more frequently affected in Chilean CRC and GBC, respectively. Furthermore, mutations in specific genes, such as TP53 in GBC, were associated with Amerindian genetic ancestry.The observed differences could be attributed to the abundance of newly identified driver-predicted variants, though the possibility of the admixed genetic background influencing the oncogenic process in various tissue types cannot be excluded.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Genomics,Somatic mutations,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.

To date, DNA methylation (i.e., 5-methylcytosine) is the most extensively studied cytosine modification. Emerging evidence suggests that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a product of 5mC through demethylation, in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is associated with the overall survival (OS) of MM. We also showed that African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) with MM have distinct genome-wide 5hmC profiles. However, no study has evaluated whether the association between 5hmC profiles and OS in MM differs between EAs and AAs.<br \/>Methods: A total of 586 newly diagnosed patients with MM at the University of Chicago Medical Center were prospectively enrolled between 2010-2019. The current study profiled genome-wide 5hmC in plasma-derived cfDNA for 303 patients using the 5hmC-Seal and next-generation sequencing. Data cutoff was February 28, 2022. Vital status was ascertained using the National Death Index. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis until death from any cause. The 5hmC-Seal data were mapped to the human genome reference (hg19) and annotated to gene bodies. In each population, patients were randomly divided into a training set (EAs, n=147; AAs, n=64) and a testing set (EAs, n=64; AAs, n=28). After selecting the top 10% candidate genes associated with OS in age-adjusted univariate Cox proportional hazards model, we applied multivariable Cox models with elastic net regularization for feature selection through leave-one-out cross-validation. The optimal &#8220;<i>alpha<\/i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>lambda<\/i>&#8221; were evaluated to maximize model performance measured by the Harrell&#8217;s Concordance Index. The differential 5hmC enrichment levels of selected genes were used to compute a weighted prognostic score (wp-score). The associations between the wp-scores and OS were evaluated in the testing sets, adjusting for established prognostic factors (e.g., age, stage).<br \/>Results: Of the 303 MM patients, 94 (30.92%) were AA and 210 (69.08%) were EA. The median follow-up was 108 months. Our preliminary analyses identified 26 and 10 5hmC marker genes associated with OS in EAs and AAs, respectively. Importantly, none of these genes overlap between the two groups. We used these genes to compute wp-scores in EAs and AAs. In the training sets, patients with a higher wp-score had worse OS. The same trend was observed in the testing sets: hazard ratios (HR) in EAs: 1.31, 95% CI: (0.83, 2.06) and HR in AA: 11.94, 95% CI: (1.88, 75.68) after controlling for established prognostic factors.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that different epigenetic modifications in cfDNA might be associated with OS between EAs and AAs with MM and the 5hmC marker gene-based wp-scores are independent prognostic factors for MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Epigenetics,Race,Multiple myeloma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

A better understanding of the mutational landscape has allowed for a more precise molecular characterization and the development of more effective treatment alternatives. However, tumors present a widespread heterogeneity, and many challenges remain to fully comprehend the influencing factors. Of particular importance is the Latin America population which i) is commonly underrepresented in clinical trials and large-scale epidemiological studies, ii) presents higher incidence and mortality rates in comparison to the developed world, and iii) is constituted by a genetically admixed population. Our research attempts to close this gap by investigating the interplay between sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, and the effect these exert on the mutational profiles of Latin-American NSCLC patients.<br \/>Methodology: The study population is derived from the NIRVANA study, a cross-sectional multicenter observational study aiming to characterize and validate molecular diagnostic technologies for NSCLC patients in Chile, Brazil, and Peru. Between July 2015 to October 2018, 5030 NSCLC patients were recruited from 37 centers, meeting inclusion criteria of age &#8805;18, histologically or cytological proven NSCLC diagnostic, and na&#239;ve treatment. Exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy treatment and refusal to give informed consent. Primary or metastatic NSCLC samples were collected during standard of care biopsy and processed for the DNA and RNA isolation. Next Generation Sequencing (NSG) genomics profiles were obtained using the Oncomine Focus Assay (OFA). Covariates of interest, including sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, were assessed at enrollment. QC-approved genomic profiles were obtained for 1864 participants.<br \/>Results and Conclusions: The prevalence of mutations and fusions in the eight most relevant NSCLC genes (<i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>ROS1 <\/i>and <i>ERBB2<\/i>) varies based on sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics. Clear distinctions emerged in the prevalence of <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>KRAS <\/i>and <i>ERBB2 <\/i>mutations among the three countries (<i>EGFR<\/i>: 20.9%, 17.6%, 35.3%; <i>KRAS<\/i>: 21.8%, 15.6%, 10.3%; <i>ERBB2<\/i>: 2.8%, 3.3%, 4.4% for Brazil, Chile, and Peru, respectively). Furthermore, distinct association patterns were identified between the prevalence of genetic alterations and the studied factors, with attributes such as sex, tobacco use and ethnicity mostly influencing the occurrence of <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK <\/i>and <i>ROS1 <\/i>alterations. These findings provide novel insights into NSCLC studies among Latin-American patients, potentially serving as guidelines for more tailored strategies in the overall management of this underrepresented population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Latin-American Population ,Genomic Alterations,Actionable Genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

We and others previously described a distinct tumor immunobiology in AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we discovered a serum proteome-defined suppression of tumor immunity signature that is prevalent among these patients and associated with lethal prostate cancer. In the current study, we sought to investigate the composition of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in AA and European American (EA) prostate cancer patients and their association with patient group and lethal prostate cancer. We obtained high-quality RNA-sequencing data for 277336 single cells representing circulating PBMCs from 59 AA and EA men. In the analysis, being an AA patients associated with an increased abundance of exhausted T cells, higher numbers of plasma B cells and CD16+ monocytes. Gene signatures indicative of T cell exhaustion and Treg activity were generally elevated in AA PBMCs while T cell effector function features were decreased. Within the overall cell population, interferon gene signatures were robustly elevated in AA than EA patients. This gene signature pattern that we observed in AA patients also associated with lethal prostate cancer, namely the T cell exhaustion, Treg activity and elevated interferon signaling gene signatures, may contribute to immune dysfunction and immune injury; pointing to potential clinical implications. Lastly, the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3), interferon alpha inducible protein (IFI6), cysteine rich protein-1 (CRIP1), and the RAC family small GTPase2 (RAC2) were notably upregulated in AA patient-derived immune cells. In summary, we show that circulating immune cell populations and the associated gene signatures differ between men of African and European descent. Those elevated in AA patients correlated with lethal prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Prostate cancer,Immune cells,Cancer health disparity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

While cancer research has developed and mortality rates have declined, disparities in cancer outcomes have widened. Social determinants of health (SDOH), such as access to health care, education, and economic stability are essential to addressing health equity. While much research is ongoing regarding the identification and etiology of mutational signatures, little work has been published regarding the associations of these signatures with SDOH. Therefore, this study proposes an exploration into the relationships between the presence of mutational signatures and SDOH within an adult pan-cancer patient population.<br \/>Methods: Variant calls from whole exome sequencing for each patient was used to infer the presence of 58 single base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures. Descriptive statistics were calculated for 455 unique patients. Previously documented associations between primary diagnosis site and distinct signatures were used to validate the predicted signatures in the patient population. Signature profiles were then linked to 208 patient health records with complete SDOH. Logistic regression predicting the presence of each signature was modeled for these patients. Full models for each signature included age, gender, Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code, tobacco and alcohol usage, education, income, housing condition, and access to healthcare. Stepwise selection was used to determine significant variables.<br \/>Results: The most common signatures in the complete population (n = 455) were SBS1 (clock-like; 98%) and SBS39 (95%), followed by SBS5 (clock-like; 38%) and SBS22 (aristolochic acid exposure; 36%). However, SBS24 (aflatoxin exposure; p = .019) and SBS7a (UV exposure; p = .002) were significantly more common in lung and skin cancer patients respectively. Each patient had 4.1 signatures on average, with a range of 2-7. The average number of signatures per patient varied significantly by primary diagnosis (ANOVA p = .014). Patients with a vulva\/vagina (4.8) or bladder\/urinary tract (4.9) diagnosis had the highest number of signatures while those with a liver (3.3) or kidney (3.6) diagnosis had the lowest. Logistic regression models for the population with SDOH (n = 208) showed poor housing condition was associated with SBS4 (tobacco smoking; p = 0.091). Any issue in accessing healthcare was associated with SBS13 (AID\/APOBEC; p = 0.114) and SBS21 (MMR; p = 0.076). Greater rurality was associated with SBS16 (p = .144) and SBS21 (p = .107). The relationship was inverse for SBS1 (p = .121).<br \/>Conclusion: Multiple significant relationships between different SDOH and mutational signatures was revealed, pointing the need to extend this research to larger patient populations with diverse SDOH.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,social determinants of health,mutational signatures,whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Furthermore, although the incidence of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer is similar for Black and white women in the US, Black patients have significantly worse outcomes. The field has traditionally focused on systemic factors such as SES to explain outcome disparities. Consequently, differences in the molecular biology between tumors from Black and White women remains a gap in knowledge in the field. Recent studies have found that Black cancer patients have a unique gene expression profile that may modulate treatment response. However, how SES contributes to these differences in molecular biology and whether these differences in SES alter treatment response remain unknown. One challenge to addressing these questions is that existing datasets significantly underrepresent Black women and are not sufficiently annotated to understand the complex interplay between molecular biology and SES. Here, we present analysis of RNA expression datasets from 60 ER+ patient tumors (38 Black, 22 White), with corresponding SES and patient outcome annotations which suggest that the ECM and TIME of ER+ breast cancer are influenced by race and factors of SES including BMI and community poverty burden. We further provide evidence that these alterations in the TME may also associate with worse patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),STAT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J.
