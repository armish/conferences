[{"Abstract":"The mutated BRAF kinase (V600E) is considered the key component in the MAPK signaling pathway that was reported to be significantly contributed to melanoma disease. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are examples of drugs that were approved by FDA to treat melanoma through inhibition of mutated BRAF kinase (V600E). However, drug resistance was reported after 6 - 7 months of treatment using these drugs due to activation of this signaling pathway through another RAF kinase (CRAF). As a Drug Discovery research group, we were interested to study and identify the possible biological target to inhibit this resistant form of cancer. We run molecular modelling simulation to study the key features of the active sites of RAF kinases and we taken vemurafenib as a starting point to design our compounds. We identified a selective back pocket in the active site of RAF kinases that can be targeted to enhance the inhibition of these kinases to overcome the drug resistance in the resistant melanoma. We designed a library of compounds based on imidazothiazole core scaffold decorated with different hydrophobic substituents to target the selectivity back pocket. Among the designed and synthesized series, KS16, that showed potent biological profile against RAF kinases compared to vemurafenib as a standard. In the cellular level, KS16 showed the same potencies against mutated BRAF-based melanoma cell line (A375) as that of vemurafenib. To evaluate the selectivity profile of KS16, kinase panel assay against 60 kinases has been investigated that showed high selectivity profile of KS16 (98 - 100% inhibition against <sup>WT<\/sup>BRAF, CRAF and <sup>V600E<\/sup>BRAF). In addition, KS16 was submitted to National Cancer Institute (NCI) to be tested against 60 human cancer cell lines in 5-point assay. It showed selective cytotoxic inhibition against melanoma cell lines compared to the other types of cancer cell lines. To evaluate the efficacy of KS16 against resistant melanoma, both KS16 and vemurafenib were tested against resistant melanoma cell line (A375R). The results revealed that KS16 showed the capability to inhibit the growth of resistant melanoma cell line in contrast to vemurafenib which failed to exhibit the same inhibition profile. The drug-candidate cardiac safety profile of KS16 was emphasized in this current project. KS16 was tested against hERG using E4031 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.025 &#956;M) as positive control to set up the hERG channel binding assay. The results revealed that KS16 showed relatively weak binding to hERG (% inh 64%) compared to that of the potent positive control (E4031, % inh 97%). The results revealed that KS16 is a potential drug candidate with minimal cardiotoxic effect. Further pharmacokinetic studies are being performed to KS16 to investigate and develop the ADME profile of KS16 to be a potential selected drug candidate against resistant melanoma disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Kinase inhibitors,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"U.

Surgery and chemotherapy (with platinum compounds) are the main treatments. Many patients relapse and develop chemotherapy resistance, limiting the therapeutic utility of these therapies. This persistent resistance makes HGSOC treatment difficult. Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells upregulate Matrix Metalloproteinase-3. MMP3 is an enzyme involved in active tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix protein breakdown during dynamic physiological processes. The structure of MMP3 includes the prodomain, the catalytic domain and the hemopexin domain. We showed that MMP3 protein levels are higher in cisplatin resistant as compared with cisplatin sensitive HGSOC cells. Our research team showed that small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated MMP3 knockdown reduced cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell growth and invasion. This data indicates that MMP3 may be a promising HGSOC treatment target. Targeting MMP3 with small chemical inhibitors (SCI) could represent a better option than siRNA because SCI are more stable and easier to deliver. The purpose of this project is to design SCI of MMP3 in the propeptide, catalytic, and hemopexin domains of MMP3. We used in silico methods to identify MMP3 inhibitors in these domains. The ZINC20 database of commercially compounds was used for virtual screening using Python Prescription (PyRx) software. We identified 25 ligands out of 370,000 with the greatest affinity for each MMP3 functional domains. SwissADME was then used to evaluate in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, drug-likeliness, and medicinal chemistry. This research lays the groundwork for HGSOC therapeutic strategies to improve treatment efficacy, especially for chemotherapy-resistant patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inhibitors,Chemoresistance,Cisplatin resistance,Cisplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>V.

However, mEGFR inhibitors are ineffective in NSCLC over time due to mutations within mEGFR and redundant signaling pathways such as mutant KRAS (mKRAS) that bypass mEGFR inhibition. Simultaneous inhibition of multiple kinases has been suggested to provide synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition and tumor resistance. Studies have shown that resistance to mEGFR inhibitors was overcome when mEGFR inhibitors were combined with aurora kinase (AURK) inhibitors. Additionally, mEGFR inhibitors were found to retain their anticancer effects in mKRAS-positive NSCLC cells if given concurrently with AURK inhibitors.

However, the use of most STING agonists has been hindered by the necessity for intra-tumoral or intravenous administration, underscoring the challenge in developing an orally bioavailable STING agonist with favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In this study, we discovered oral STING agonists featuring a novel tricyclic benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-<i>c<\/i>]pyrrole-1,3-dione scaffold, thus achieving both superior PK properties and potent in vivo efficacy. Our lead compound, ZSA-51, exhibited nanomolar cellular STING activation activity (EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 100 nM) in THP1 cells, surpassing the reported oral STING agonist MSA-2 by 32-fold (EC<sub>50<\/sub> = 3200 nM). Furthermore, ZSA-51 demonstrated superior PK properties with an oral bioavailability of 49%, and robust in vivo antitumor activity both in colon and pancreatic cancers model upon oral administration. Notably, ZSA-51 displayed preferential distribution to the lymph nodes and spleen, enhancing its systemic immune-stimulating effects. The specificity of ZSA-51 was further confirmed by a comparison with a negative control compound (ZSA-52NC2) that was unable to stimulate in vitro and in vivo STING activity. Molecular docking and MD simulation confirmed that the active form of ZSA-51 stably bound to STING dimer with validated hydrogen bond network. Taken together, our findings suggest ZSA-51 as a promising oral STING agonist characterized by superior PK properties and potent in vivo efficacy, holding potential for future development for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Stimulator of interferon genes ,agonist,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-Y.

There are currently 4 FDA approved ADCs utilizing the vedotin drug linker to treat an array of solid tumors and lymphomas and several more in clinical trials. Auristatin payloads have several desirable properties, including strong anticancer cytotoxicity, bystander activity, and induction of immunologic cell death. While auristatin-based ADCs have been remarkably successful, there remain opportunities to further understand and improve payload properties. Bystander activity is one such property that can greatly impact the balance between efficacy and tolerability. Herein, we present a medicinal chemistry investigation into a series of auristatins with similar tubulin binding and biochemical potency that differ in lipophilicity and ability to cross the cell membrane. This design enabled us to focus on and characterize the impact of bystander activity while maintaining all other parameters. Ultimately, this effort resulted in ADCs with similar on-target in vitro cytotoxicity but differed in the extent of off-target bystander activity. Evaluation of in vivo efficacy, in vivo bystander activity, and rodent tolerability afforded a lead drug linker that was well-tolerated as an ADC and exhibited strong antitumor growth delay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Antitumor activity,Bystander effect,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Despite the availability of many therapeutic alternatives, MM remains consistently lethal, demanding the development of novel techniques. The intimate relationship between myeloma cells and the BM microenvironment is a distinguishing hallmark of MM. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 enhance the homing of MM cells to the BM, which has important functional implications. The BM microenvironment secretes a variety of hormones and cytokines that activate several signaling pathways, resulting in enhanced production of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, boosting the proliferation, survival, and migration of MM cells and conferring resistance to standard chemotherapy. As a result, we created GA-A, a hybrid molecule in which we coupled an aralkyl carboxylic acid moiety, known to preferentially inhibit Mcl-1, to gambogic acid, which has previously been demonstrated to inhibit CXCR4 in MM. Our western blot has shown that this unique hybrid compound successfully suppressed CXCR4 and Mcl-1. Interestingly, using qPCR we found that CXCR4 was observed to be higher expressed in CD138- versus CD138+ cells, while GA-A inhibited CXCR4 in both subpopulations. In addition, using annexin-V flow cytometry staining we found that GA-A increased the apoptotic effect of bortezomib in MM stem-like cells while inhibiting the viability of bortezomib resistant cells. Using human cytokine array we found that GA-A activates some of proinflammatory cytokines that can activate the immune system such as GM-CSF, IFN gamma, IL-2 and IL-12. In summary, our findings indicate the successful creation of a novel dual CXCR4-Mcl1 inhibitor that demonstrates efficacy against the stem cell-like population and bortezomib resistant cells and enhances the effectiveness of bortezomib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Drug design,CXCR4,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Mechanistically, we were able to show that the hypersensitivity of <i>TP53<\/i> deficient liver cancer cells and <i>TP53; Rb1<\/i> deficient small cell lung cancer cells towards AURKA ligands is due to low expression levels of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, which is necessary for survival of cancer cells in prolonged mitosis. Our novel AURKA ligands do not affect the kinase function of AURKA and thus, in contrast to conventional AURKA kinase inhibitors, can be administered continuously to mice without inducing toxicity related to inhibition of kinase related non-canonical (non-mitotic) functions of AURKA in normal cells or <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>RB1<\/i> wildtype cancer cells. Preclinical therapy studies in cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) tumor models of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and orthotopic models of <i>TP53<\/i> altered hepatocellular carcinoma and <i>TP53;Rb1<\/i> altered SCLC demonstrated marked monotherapeutic efficacy of AURKA ligands. Conceptually, our herein provided data suggest that small molecules designed to stabilize protein-protein interactions represent powerful anti-cancer drugs with exceptional therapeutic window and thus open a venue towards the development of novel cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,Synthetic lethality,Mitosis,Aurora kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

However, a key limitation of the clinical use of Niclosamide in cancer treatment is its low solubility and cellular uptake, which result in poor pharmacokinetic properties and dose-limiting GI toxicities at concentrations lower than the therapeutic threshold of the drug. To overcome this, we hypothesized that we could use amino acid conjugated niclosamide prodrugs to improve cellular uptake by creating a substrate of the PepT1 transport protein. The overexpression of the PepT1 transport protein that is involved in many hormonal cancers is being used to our advantage. Our study involved first synthesizing a group of niclosamide and niclosamide analogs conjugated with polar or nonpolar amino acids. Next, we conducted a Glycine-Sarcosine assay measuring changes in the uptake of the dipeptide glycyl-sarcosine (Gly-Sar). Our initial step was to examine if our conjugates could disrupt the absorption of Gly-Sar. The active conjugate will be tested whether they are substrates or inhibitors of the transporter. For the future, we have plans to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of niclosamide conjugates in various cancer cell lines and to quantify cleavage of the prodrugs intracellularly.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Seeking to enhance the potency and selectivity of AOH1996, we conducted an exhaustive Structure-Activity-Relationship (SAR) investigation. Over 100 analogues of AOH1996 were synthesized, systematically modifying its three main components: the naphthyl group, glycine linker, and diphenyl ether. The glycine linker underwent substitution with various natural and unnatural amino acids, while the 1-naphthyl group saw replacements with diverse monocyclic and bicyclic aromatic groups, including quinoline and isoquinoline derivatives. The diphenyl ether moiety was extensively explored by substituting the bridging oxygen with different functional groups (sulfonyl, imido, sulfur, amide), substituting both phenyl rings with various functional groups (fluorine, chlorine, hydroxy, methoxy, methyl, trifluoromethyl), and adopting a nitrogen-walk approach on the terminal phenyl ring to evaluate critical ligand\/caPCNA-binding positions. This meticulous effort resulted in the identification of several analogues, such as AOH1160S (featuring a diphenyl thioether group), AOH1996S-4CH3 (with a methyl group at the para-position of the terminal thiophenyl ring), and AOH1996-3CH3 (incorporating an m-methoxy function in the terminal phenyl ring and bridging oxygen), exhibiting similar or superior potency compared to AOH1996. The target binding of these analogues was verified by capturing the binary complex of the more polar version of these analogues in the crystal structure. The synthesis, characterization, and detailed biological activities of these promising AOH analogues will be thoroughly described.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Small molecule drugs,Cancer,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

LCN2 is highly abundant in aggressive forms of many cancers including breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and esophageal cancer. Elevated LCN2 levels in aggressive tumors correlate with heightened cancer cell motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. After the protein folds it makes a barrel structure which encloses a three-calyx pocket that can bind and transport molecules. A first generation of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) targeting LCN2 demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the proliferative capacity of Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cells. IBC stands as a rare and highly aggressive variant, accounting for 1 to 5% of all BC cases, with 20-30% presenting as de novo metastatic disease. In the previous studies the concentration of LCN2 inhibitors to reduce cell proliferation in 50% was around 10 &#181;M. In pursuit of better LCN2 SMIs, we conducted in-silico analysis using a library of 369,000 ligands. Through the High-Performance Computer Facility at UPR R&#237;o Piedras, we employed AutoDock Vina for virtual screening, targeting the LCN2-calyx with Lys134 as the central coordinate. Docking protocols, predicting binding affinities, identified 8,162 out of 327,638 ligands that have been docked already with values below -9.6 kcal\/mol for further consideration. The next phase involves subjecting these potential inhibitors to the SwissADME tool for a comprehensive evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion parameters, as well as pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry considerations. The parameters to be evaluated are the Lipinski rules, which states that an orally active drug may have a maximum of one violation and the pann-assay interference compounds (PAINS) alerts tool, a source of false positives for biologically active compounds. The top candidates, exhibit binding affinities within the range of -11.5 to -12.2. After SwissADME filtering, we will re-rank the ligand list, identifying 30 commercially available candidates for subsequent cell viability assays in SUM149 (TNBC) and SUM190 (HER2+) cell lines. This multifaceted approach integrates computational methodologies with rigorous experimental validation, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions in IBC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory breast cancer,Inhibitors,Modeling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Data obtained in our group suggest that PARP1 could play a key role in the cell cycle regulation through its interaction with E2F1 transcription factor. Considering that most oncogenic processes is associated with cell cycle deregulation, the disruption of this interaction would provide a new therapeutic target of great interest and wide spectrum of indications. Therefore, our goal was to find molecules that interfere its role in cell-cycle regulation without affecting its function on DNA repair. The identification of novel compounds disrupting the PARP1\/E2F1 interaction was carried out by combining <i>in silico<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> screening, using a rational drug design. The virtual screen was performed using a molecular library of several million compounds at the selected target site, using AtomNet&#174; (Atomwise), the first deep learning neural network for structure-based drug design and discovery. Since there is no complete structural information of the PARP-1\/E2F1 protein-protein interaction, a homologous structure of BRCT domain of BRCA1 complex with the phospho-peptide (PDBID: 1T2V) was utilized to identify the potential binding interface of BRCT domain of PARP-1 (PDBID: 2COK) and the E2F1 protein. Top scoring compounds were clustered and filtered to arrive at a final subset of 83 compounds, library that were incorporated to our in vitro screening, which included both transcriptional (E2F1 activity) and survival studies. Twelve compounds were finally selected, based upon their higher capacity of inhibiting E2F1 activity.This work was supported by Agencia Estatal de Investigaci&#243;n (AEl\/10.13039\/501100011033), Xunta de Galicia (GPC GI-1862, ED431B 2020\/26; ED431G 2019\/02) and European Regional Development Fund-ERDF.

ADAR1 has two isoforms: p110 in the nucleus and p150 in the cytoplasm. Both isoforms alter the coding and non-coding sections of self-dsRNA. The ADAR1 p150 isoform is expressed from an interferon (IFN)-response promoter and has a Z-DNA\/Z-RNA binding domain at the N-terminus. ADAR1 has been implicated in promoting cell survival and resistance to immune response in several cancer types like multiple myeloma, breast, lung, liver, and skin cancer. Inhibition of ADAR1 p150 has the potential to enhance anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic modalities. The Z&#945; domain of ADAR1 p150 provides exclusivity to p150 compared to the other isoforms. Herein, we outline the discovery of a potential first-in-class Z&#945; targeted ADAR1 p150 inhibitor and degrader for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: AVA-ADR-001 was identified through a high throughput p110 knockout cell-based assay. The ability of AVA-ADR-001 to induce interferons was confirmed in various cell lines. The anti-tumor efficacy of AVA-ADR-001 was evaluated in B16F10 syngeneic melanoma mice model as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1. PROTAC AVA-ADR-703 was used to demonstrate selective degradation of the ADAR1 p150 protein.<br \/>Results: We have discovered AVA-ADR-001, a novel small molecule inhibitor of ADAR1 which significantly increases the IFN response in vitro in an MDA5-dependent manner. In vitro binding studies confirm that AVA-ADR-001 binds to the Z&#945; domain of ADAR1 with low nM potency. AVA-ADR-001 demonstrates anti-tumor efficacy 1.5X superior to anti-PD1 ICB non-responsive tumor models. In addition, the AVA-ADR-001 monotherapy and combination groups showed a significant upregulation of numerous interferon-stimulated genes, including IFIH1, IFN-&#946;, and CXCL-10. Finally, targeted protein degradation of ADAR1 p150 while sparing ADAR1 p110 was confirmed when cells were treated with AVA-ADR-703 with nM DC<sub>50<\/sub>, the PROTAC variant of AVA-ADR-001.<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, AVA-ADR-001 and AVA-ADR-703 are the first selective Z&#945;-targeted small molecule inhibitor and degrader of ADAR1 p150 respectively to be disclosed. As a powerful and targeted first-in-class ADAR1 inhibitor, AVA-ADR-001 has demonstrated a strong induction of interferon (IFN) in a number of cancer cell lines and <i>in vivo<\/i>. AVA-ADR-001<i> <\/i>has also demonstrated strong <i>in vivo <\/i>anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1. Furthermore, AVA-ADR-703 demonstrates selective and highly efficient degradation of ADAR1 p150 while sparing ADAR1 p110. Given that ADAR1 has a pro-metastatic and immune-suppressive role, AVA-ADR-001 and AVA-ADR-703 have significant potential to emerge as strong cancer immunotherapy candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Immuno-oncology,Solid tumors,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

However, the development of approved small-molecule telomerase inhibitors has been impeded by a lack of structural ambiguity for decades. In our study, we have employed a molecular dynamics approach to validate the binding site of BIBR1532, an approved telomerase inhibitor in the hTERT thumb domain followed by a structure-based drug designing approach to repurpose FDA-approved drugs and identify novel lead compounds targeting the enzyme.<br \/>Material and Methods: Due to the unavailability of a co-crystalized structure of BIBR1532 with the catalytic hTERT thumb domain, we employed a Molecular dynamics-based method to identify and validate the exact binding site of the inhibitor. Two pharmacophore models were generated for the putative and newly identified binding pockets which were screened virtually through an anti-cancer library and Drug Bank database. The models were validated on the basis of the fit value of the BIBR1532 and selectivity value indicating the favorable feature set required. The top hits obtained were filtered using drug-likeliness parameters like Lipinski, ADME, and TOPKAT followed by redocking into their binding site. Finally, lead molecules that were able to dock in the new pocket were validated using Molecular Dynamics (MD)simulation studies and their binding free energy was calculated using MM-PBSA calculations followed by their evaluation using in-vitro TRAP assay.<br \/>Results: Structural investigation, molecular docking studies, and confirmatory molecular dynamics revealed that the exact binding site of BIBR1532 is 8.4 &#197; away from the reported FVYL pocket strikingly with clinically relevant and characteristic interactions conserved. We have identified five lead compounds and four lead compounds from DrugBank and the anti-cancer library respectively, that were stable in the new binding pocket based on their MD trajectory analysis, and parameters like RMSD, RMSF, H-bonds and Radius of Gyration as well as their MM-PBSA scores. The lead compounds are being evaluated in vitro using TRAP assay and ex-vivo assays.<br \/>Conclusion: The study identified five existing FDA-approved drugs in the market for other diseases as potential telomerase inhibitors alongside four novel compounds that can be used for the treatment of cancer in the future after further validation studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Telomerase,Small molecule inhibitor,molecular dynamics simulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

HDAC6 removes acetyl groups from Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is a protein chaperone that folds the androgen receptor. By inhibiting HDAC6 it is possible to prevent the expression of mutated androgen receptors, that are no longer responsive to androgen deprivation therapy, treating castration resistant prostate cancer. The Oyelere lab has previously demonstrated that 3-Hydroxypyridin-2-thione (3-HPT) can serve as a scaffold for HDAC6 inhibitors. While the unaltered 3-HPT has been shown on its own to inhibit HDAC6 in enzyme specific assays. The unaltered 3-HPT had no effect in whole cell assays. This work investigated simple modification of the 3-HPT scaffold to improve the in-vivo activity of 3-HPT. This work is an extension of work previously done in the Oyelere lab. The aim of this work is to apply simple modifications to the 3-HPT scaffold to improve the in-vitro activity. Previously 3-HPT was shown on its own to inhibit HDAC6 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 681nM but have no effect on cell assays. The hypothesis was that by converting the secondary amine into a tertiary amine the pharmacokinetic-properties of 3-HPT allowing can be improved focusing on cellular entry. The specific modification was the addition of alkanes and fluorinated alkanes at the secondary amine. This addition should improve the charge of the compounds improving the invitro activity. Based on molecular docking studies using Autodock vina, the introduction of fluorines improves the binding to HDAC6 by interacting with a hydrophilic pocket near the zinc ion. The preliminary in-vivo results in LnCAP and DU145 cells demonstrate that the addition of fluorinated alkanes has substantially improved the IC<sub>50<\/sub> compared to the base 3-HPT compound. The base 3-HPT compound has an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of greater than 100&#181;M while the compounds with fluorinated alkanes have IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values in the range of 2-15&#181;M. this data indicates improved drug likeness.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{A12ED26D-6D53-452C-BA9C-60F66CB2CD70}\"><caption>Preliminary IC50 values of compounds in prostate cancer cell lines<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Compound Name<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><div><font size=\"-1\"><b>LNCaP<\/b><\/font><\/div><div><font size=\"-1\"><b>IC<sub>50 <\/sub><\/b>(µM<b>)<\/b><\/font><\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><div>DU145<font size=\"-1\"><b><br><\/b><\/font><\/div><div><font size=\"-1\"><b>IC<sub>50 <\/sub><\/b>(µM<b>)<\/b><\/font><\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Vero <b>IC<sub>50 <\/sub><\/b>(µM<b>)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SH-1-78<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SH-1-94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.50<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.29<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22.53<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RK-1-187<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">96.95<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">95.45<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88.57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SH-1-110<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.27<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.47<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17.41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RK-2-16<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.09<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62.86<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RK-2-17<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RK-2-64<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">78.36<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&gt;100<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">76.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RK-2-67<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14.19<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26.95<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11.38<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,HDAC inhibitor,Drug design,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

This fact leads to a constant effort to develop new non-platinum metallodrugs with different mechanism of action (MoA). In our study we developed new half-sandwich organoiridium(III) complexes, of general formulas [Ir(&#951;<sup>5<\/sup>-Cp*)Cl(L<sup>NP<\/sup>)]PF<sub>6<\/sub> (1-3) and [Ir(&#951;<sup>5<\/sup>-Cp<sup>ph<\/sup>)Cl(L<sup>NP<\/sup>)]PF<sub>6<\/sub> (4-6) involving three different N,P-donor phosphinoalkylamines (L<sup>NP<\/sup>), which we tested on 2D and 3D cancer models; HCp* = pentamethylcyclopentadiene, HCp<sup>ph<\/sup>= (2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-yl)benzene. The most effective complexes 3 and 6 bearing 3-(diphenylphosphanyl)propan-1-amine had the highest cytotoxic effect against various cancer cell lines (THP-1, HeLa, SW982, A549, MOR) including a cisplatin-resistant lung carcinoma cell line (MOR\/CPR) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values between 3.1 and 9.1 &#956;M for specific cell lines. The cytotoxic effect was further demonstrated on 3D spheroids of lung cancer cells that revealed anti-cancer and anti-migration potential of complexes 3 and 6. Cell cycle and cell death analysis showed a different mechanism compared to the effect of cisplatin. Moreover, complex 3 did not decrease cell viability of non-cancerous cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and porcine chondrocytes) under 50% at a concentration of 20 &#181;M. In addition, we report for the first time that organoiridium complexes showed high cytotoxic activity on cancer cell lines, including cisplatin-resistant cell line, with different MoA from cisplatin. They trigger expression of stress-related genes associated with oxidative stress, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum stress and, moreover, complex 3 showed cytotoxic selectivity towards cancer cells. <i>This work was supported by the Czech health research council of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (AZV Project NU22-08-00236).<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiproliferative,Antitumor agents,Apoptosis,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

FLT3-ITD inhibitors developed only result in transient disease remission with disease relapse and resistance. Agents overcoming FLT3-ITD inhibitor resistance need to be developed. Sorafenib is one of FLT3-ITD inhibitors used in clinic. Using FLT3-ITD AML MOLM-13 cell line, we established a sorafenib resistant subclone MOLM-13\/Sor, explored the resistance mechanism and revealed the overactivated mTOR signaling. MNK as one of the alternative mTOR signaling pathways is activated. MNK inhibitor eFT508 could overcome sorafenib resistance. Previously we developed a dual pyrido[3,2-<i>d<\/i>]pyrimidine MNK\/PIM inhibitor 21o. Through optimization of 21o we obtained two new compounds H104 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values: MNK1 19 nM; MNK2 8 nM; FLT3-ITD 46 nM; PIM1 1388 nM) and H118 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values: MNK1 35 nM; MNK2 21 nM; FLT3-ITD 25 nM; PIM1 518 nM) with selective inhibition of MNK and FLT3 and losing PIM inhibition ability. H104 and H118 show better antiproliferative efficacy in FLT3-ITD MOLM-13 cells (GI<sub>50<\/sub>: 1.07&#177;0.04 &#956;M and 0.99&#177;0.08 &#956;M) than non-FLT3-ITD HL-60 cells (GI<sub>50<\/sub>: 7.04&#177;0.15 &#956;M and 4.78&#177;0.31 &#956;M).

H104 and H118 decreased the levels of p-eIF4E, c-myc and Mcl-1, the downstream substrates of FLT3-ITD and MNK.

Drug resistance to modern chemotherapies results in decreased therapeutic efficacy and CRC treatment failure. Herein, multi-layered strategies are used for a better identification of the newer therapeutics.<br \/>Methodology: Different publicly available datasets were used for the identification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and CRC tissues. miRNAs, lncRNAs and small molecules interacting with those DEGs were mined from various databases. A complex network of interacting mRNA-miRNAs-lncRNAs-small molecules was created using the Cytoscape. Hub RNAs, significant modules and cliques were identified using Cytohubba and MClique plugins. The mRNAs from the top 30 cliques were analyzed by expression, oncoprint, survival and gene ontology. Polyphenols from the PhenolExplorer database were also assessed for their druggability and toxicity properties to finally obtain druggable polyphenols (DPs). A two-step molecular docking was done using PyRx for mRNAs from top 30 cliques and DPs and the top ten complexes were docked again using AutoDock. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) is performed for the best fit protein-proposed DP vs protein-known drug using GROMACS.<br \/>Results: 1915 DEGs, 2609 miRNAs, 1411 lncRNAs and 8790 small molecules (other than selected DPs) interactions were considered for generating a comprehensive interaction network. The 27 mRNAs from the top 30 cliques were subjected to an array of analyses. NCAPD2, CDK4 and FASN were found to be involved in different stages of CRC. IRF2BPL, CMPK1, CCNF and UST were found as survival biomarkers, whereas FAT4 was found to be the only genetically altered mRNA. Functional enrichment supported the analysis revealing significant CRC-associated gene ontology as well as pathways. 56 DPs when docked with the DEGs, the two-step docking revealed NQO1-Episesaminol to be the best target-drug complex. Results of docking were comparable when MDS was performed for NOQ1&#8226;Episesaminol Vs NQO1&#8226;Doxorubicin (approved drug).<br \/>Conclusion: In the current interaction network and MDS-based integrated analysis, significant druggable CRC biomarkers and their newer therapeutic solutions were identified.

XBP-1s is critically important for the growth and survival of B cell leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. When compared with other inhibitors targeting IRE-1, the tricyclic chromenone-based inhibitors B-I09 and D-F07, prodrugs harboring an aldehyde-masking group, emerged as the very reliable inhibitors for potent suppression of the XBP-1s protein. Protection of the aldehyde as a 1,3-dioxane acetal led to strong fluorescence emitted by the coumarin chromophore, enabling both B-I09 and D-F07 to be tracked inside the cell. We installed a photolabile structural cage on the hydroxy group of D-F07 to generate PC-D-F07. Such a modification significantly stabilized the 1,3-dioxane acetal protecting group, allowing for specific stimulus-mediated control of the inhibitory activity. Upon photoactivation, the re-exposed hydroxy group triggered the aldehyde-protecting 1,3-dioxane acetal to slowly decompose, leading to the inhibition of the RNase activity of IRE-1. Since chemical modifications of the hydroxy group could be used to tune 1,3-dioxane prodrug stability, we installed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive boronate cage groups onto B-I09 (BC-B-I09) and D-F07 (BC-D-F07) to achieve stimuli-responsive activities and improve tumor-targeting efficiency based on that cancerous B cells indeed produced higher levels of ROS than normal B cells. These boronate caged compounds could be further combined with the FDA-approved Auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, to achieve synergistic cancer-killing effects. These results led us to further develop a novel prodrug, TC-D-F07, in which a thiol-reactive dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (Dns) cage was installed onto the hydroxy group of D-F07. The electron-withdrawing Dns group in TC-D-F07 similarly stabilized the neighboring 1,3-dioxane acetal, allowing for stimulus-mediated control of its inhibitory activity. TC-D-F07 exhibited high sensitivity to intracellular thiols produced by cancerous B cells. In addition, when TC-D-F07 was decomposed into D-F07, we observed that a dinitrophenyl cysteine adduct resulting from cleavage of the Dns group could induce the ER stress, causing cancerous B cells to increase the expression of XBP-1s. However, the accumulated levels of D-F07 from TC-D-F07 and its gradual decomposition into the active IRE-1 inhibitor could eventually deprive cancer cells of all XBP-1s, leading to more severe apoptosis in TC-D-F07-treated than in D-F07-treated cells. Thus, TC-D-F07 with both ER stress-inducing and XBP-1s-inhibiting activities represents an IRE-1-targeting caged prodrug that can be used to treat B cell cancer effectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress,Leukemias: chronic lymphocytic,Multiple myeloma,Unfolded protein response (UPR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Currently, there is no targeted therapy for TNBC and treatment options to manage this lethal disease include surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Among the chemotherapy agents, combination of the PARP inhibitors with DNA-damaging results in a more promising anti-tumor effect. A better understanding of TNBC etiology has aided in unraveling the roles of two additional cellular targets - androgen receptor (AR) and histone lysine demethylase (KDM) - in the viability and survival of TNBC. Interestingly, AR overexpression is the most important driver of prostate cancer (PCa). A class of current medications used to treat PCa act as androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (or antiandrogens). Antiandrogens are under investigation in the clinic as potential therapies for luminal AR (LAR) subtypes of TNBC, a particularly worrisome subtype that frequently metastasizes to regional lymph nodes and bones. Although LAR TNBC constitutes 15-20% of TNBCs, it is characterized by minimal response to chemotherapy and aggressiveness. It is therefore plausible to repurpose and optimize antiandrogens, in the context of designed multiple ligands; to obtain a TNBC-targeting therapy effective against several subtypes of this heterogenous disease, including the basal subtype that is responsible for ~80% of TNBC incidence. The proposed therapeutics are dual-acting antiandrogen-KDM inhibitors. The antiandrogen moiety of these agents will enable TNBC cell-targeting and translocation of the drug into the nucleus where inhibition of KDM will prevent transcription of KDMs that promote tumor growth. The three pharmacophores of these agents are (i) an AR binding group, (ii) a linker, and (iii) an iron-binding group. Two functional classes of these compounds, alkyl- and aryl-derivatives, vary in the design of the AR binding moiety. To optimize these agents, the methylene linker length is varied in each class for in vitro determination of the optimal length for increased drug efficacy. The compounds are tested on TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, low AR+; and MDA-MB-453, high AR+), and ER+ BCa (MCF-7) while PCa cell lines (LNCaP PCa, AR+; and DU 145, PCa, AR-) serve as controls for AR dependency of the compounds. Longer linker length compounds exhibited low micromolar cytotoxicity and selectivity for AR+ TNBC and PCa cell lines. Further analysis of lead compounds in TNBC cells aided in understanding the effects on targets, transcriptomic effects via RNA sequencing analysis and the mechanism of action. Thus far, the designed dual-acting therapeutics have potential to revolutionize the design of anticancer drugs and improve treatment outcome for TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Drug discovery,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

As structure determines function, it follows that unique structural motifs are enriched for sites of unique function and high therapeutic target value. We hypothesized that protein structure constitutes high value <i>primary<\/i> information that can drive the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.<br \/>Method: We developed a unique physics-based protein structure analysis platform scaled to run on a supercomputer, allowing us to consider dynamic protein flexibility and the influence of solvent upon protein structure, and to probe large protein libraries as a primary source of structure information that can support up-front structure-based screens. We developed and then probed a high resolution protein x-ray crystallographic library, created and curated by us. From a 60 million compound library, we conducted virtual screens for docking to identified sites. 8-day colony formation assays were conducted on a panel of 8 human breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cell lines, as well as 8- and 14-day trilineage hematopoietic colony formation assays on human cord blood stem cells.<br \/>Findings: From the first 180 deposited protein structures, we screened for unique protein surface structure. Structures were deemed unique if they were not otherwise known to be associated with any particular functional roles and were not the binding site of known therapeutics. Further selection included those that were clefts and possessed physical characteristics compatible with binding small chemicals whose properties have been linked to effective therapeutics. For each of 8 sites on 6 different proteins, a suite of analytics probed docking solutions from the compound library, generating a ranked list of 100 compounds for each site. Based on factors inclusive of availability and low potential for toxicity, compounds were acquired and used in in-parallel selection and de-selection functional assays. Cancer cell growth inhibition was a positive selection criterion, with additional ranking based on greater potency and broader efficacy. Bone marrow toxicity is limiting for most drugs, and inhibition of bone marrow stem cell growth was as a deselection criterion. Multiple compounds clustered around 2 sites on 2 different proteins. One compound, Dxr2-017, exhibited very high relative efficacy against colon and breast cancer cells. Evaluation of Dxr2-017 in the NCI-60 panel corroborated these findings, and showed even higher efficacy against melanoma. We demonstrated that Dxr2-017 inhibited melanoma growth with low nanomolar efficacy, while concentrations of over 2300-fold higher had only limited inhibitory effects on bone marrow stem cells.<br \/>Conclusions: This study provides proof-of-principle that protein structure constitutes high value primary information that can support identification of novel therapeutics.

There is an urgent need for novel drug discovery for GBM. CSPG4\/NG2 transmembrane proteoglycan is a validated target, upregulated in 50% of GBM patient tumours, drives malignant progression and is independently prognostic for poor survival. We have recently identified a cancer specific 13 bp frameshift deletion in the CSPG4\/NG2 gene (CSPG4\/NG2del13), which leads to reduced protein expression and slowed cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor take <i>in vivo<\/i>. The 3D structure of CSPG4\/NG2 has not yet been solved, and unsuited for structure prediction by AlphaFold2 due to its size and PTMs. The structure of CSPG4\/NG2 domain 1 (residues 411-547), containing the site of the 13 bp deletion, has been solved using cryo-EM and can be useful for new drug design. We hypothesize that a small-molecule inhibitor that binds to this 13 bp region of the CSPG4\/NG2 proteoglycan, might induce the same phenotype as the 13 bp deletion.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Using the published structure of domain 1, we performed <i>in silico<\/i> analysis to predict binding sites and docked 1280 compounds from the Prestwick Chemical library&#8217;s database of FDA-approved drugs to these sites.

Then we performed MD simulation for 100ns. Post-simulation MMGBSA on the last 1 ns of simulation assessed change in ligands&#8217; binding energies. The selected leads underwent further validation utilizing two pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was assessed using MTS cell viability assay.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Comparing pre- and post-simulation MMGBSA energies, the reference compound showed increased, while CSF1R-IN-1 and MCULE-8715589337 exhibited decreased energies. The reference ligand's RMSD showed stability with fluctuations of 3 to 3.5 &#197;, whereas CSF1R-IN-1 and MCULE-8715589337 had stable and lower RMSD values (approximately 3 &#197; and 2.4 &#197;). Test compounds, CSF1R-IN-1 and MCULE-8715589337 showed better molecular interactions with ROR1 compared to reference. The reference compound formed hydrogen bonds with ILE555 and ASP633, along with pi-pi stacking with PHE552. CSF1R-IN-1 forms a hydrogen bond with ILE555 and ASP633, pi-pi stacking with PHE552, and interaction with SER632 through a water bridge. Additionally, compound MCULE-8715589337 forms hydrogen bonds with ASP633, SER632, LYS506, and GLU523. CSF1R-IN-1 notably inhibited proliferation in MiaPaCa-2 cells (IC50: 1.29 &#956;M) while no efficacy in PANC-1 cells (IC50: 78.41 &#956;M). MCULE-8715589337 showed relatively similar IC50 values of 39.06 &#956;M and 37.73 &#956;M in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The reduction in MMGBSA energies, low RMSD values, and a higher number of interactions highlight the better characteristics of both compounds compared to the reference. Our findings show CSF1R-IN-1 and MCULE-8715589337 have efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells, but further studies are required to validate and to understand the mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ROR1,Pancreatic cancer,Tyrosine kinase,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Modern clinical therapeutics are often associated with several adverse side effects and the eventual development of multi-drug resistance. Herein, exhaustive computational strategies are employed in designing dietary polyphenol-based small molecule inhibitors against such oncogenic KRAS tumors.<br \/>Methodology: Integrated bioinformatics strategies such as pharmacokinetic property prediction, analysis of medicinal chemistry profile, density functional theory (DFT) study, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and principal component analysis were performed to screen 930 dietary polyphenols to identify potent inhibitors against the G12C and G14D mutants. Sotorasib, an FDA-approved KRAS chemotherapeutic inhibitor was used as a reference drug in this study.<br \/>Results: Out of the 930 dietary polyphenols screened, based on the properties of pharmacokinetic descriptors and medicinal chemistry profile, 512 molecules were shortlisted for further studies. Five dietary polyphenols viz. Quercetin, Luteolin, Peonidin 3-O-glucoside, Myricetin, and Kaempferol identified via DFT and MDS exhibited the highest binding affinity and optimum energy profiles with our selected mutants G12C and G14D. An all-atom MDS study executed over 200 ns each revealed that Quercetin, Luteolin, and Peonidin 3-O-glucoside show favorable thermodynamic stability with significantly less conformational perturbations with G12C mutant. By contrast, mutant G12D complexed with Kaempferol and Myricetin exhibited the least thermodynamic flexibility and stable backbone trajectory, when compared to clinically standardized KRAS inhibitor Sotorasib. The efficient and higher binding stability of the polyphenols targeting the KRAS mutants, G12C and G14D switches I\/II is mainly attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds and other hydrophobic interactions at the molecular level. All five evaluated polyphenols qualified the parameters of cell-line cytotoxicity hinting at remarkable chemotherapeutic efficacy.<br \/>Conclusion: Computer-aided drug designing performed here aided the identification of natural dietary polyphenolic inhibitors as potential drug candidates exhibiting stable binding dynamics like Sotorasib, which thus awaits validation through further <i>in-vitro<\/i> analyses in inhibiting KRAS-driven tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-02 Chemoinformatics, in silico screening, and computational methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Polyphenols,Molecular dynamics simulation,Density functional theory,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>P.
