[{"Abstract":"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are overexpressed in cancer cells associated with dysregulated gene expression and tumor progression. DNMT1 partnered with Class I HDAC as complex to inhibit gene transcription. Several pan-HDAC inhibitors have been approved for T-cell lymphoma with evident side effects. More selective HDAC inhibitors need to be developed. Psammaplin A (PsA), a symmetrical bromotyrosine-derived disulfide dimer isolated from the <i>Psammaplysilla sponge<\/i>, is a selective Class I HDAC inhibitor. We tested its cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in 12 hematological malignant cell lines with 8 lines sensitive (more than 50% growth inhibition at 1 &#956;M) and 4 lines insensitive (less than 20% growth inhibition at 1 &#956;M). PsA induces acetylation of H3, but not &#945;-tubulin, supporting the Class I HDAC inhibition selection. In the sensitive cell lines, PsA induces apoptosis with down-regulation of c-Flip and upregulation of NOXA as well as DNA damage detected by &#947;-H2A.X. RNA sequence analysis results confirm the regulation of PsA on <i>NOXA<\/i>, <i>c-Flip<\/i> and <i>p21<\/i> gene expression. The four insensitive cell lines express high levels of DNMT1 with resistance to apoptosis induction. Silencing DNMT1 with siRNA sensitizes PsA-induced apoptosis with induction of NOXA and &#947;-H2A.X. Azacytidine, the DNMT1 degrader, in combination with PsA induce synergistic cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in vitro. PsA (20 mg\/kg) plus Azacytidine (2.5 mg\/kg) synergistically inhibit tumor growth in insensitive mantle cell lymphoma Jeko-1 xenografts, without detected toxic signs in organ pathological analysis. We find a new mechanism of DNMT1 controlling the sensitivity of Class I HDAC inhibitor PsA and provide a rationale of PsA with azacytidine for combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,DNA methyltransferase,DNA damage,Natural products,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Platinum-based therapy along with poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) maintenance therapy, is recommended to 80% of patients. However, acquired PARPi resistance is an ongoing clinical problem and there is a growing need for the development of more targeted therapies. We have previously shown that the class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), entinostat, which is selective for HDAC1\/2, resensitizes ovarian cancer cells to PARPi. Here, we propose to examine whether selective inhibition of HDAC3 will induce a synthetic lethality in PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer cells. BRD3308 is an HDACi that is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of HDAC3 and of HDAC1\/2 to a lesser extent. To investigate these effects, we used two mouse ovarian cancer epithelial lines ID8 TP53-\/-\/BRCA2-\/- (ID8) and an olaparib resistant line ID8 TP53-\/-\/BRCA2-\/--OR (ID8_OR). We performed cell viability assays (MTS) by treating both cell lines with increasing concentrations of olaparib (0-40uM), BRD3308 (0-2uM), and in combination. When ID8_OR cells were treated with olaparib 5uM and 0.25uM of BRD3308 in combination, cell proliferation was significantly reduced when compared to olaparib treatment alone (p= 0.0077). We did not observe a significant differences in cell proliferation between olaparib alone and in combination with BRD3308 in the ID8 cells. Olaparib and BRD3308 treatment in the ID8_OR cells were found to be synergistic at four out of the five drug concentrations tested, with concentrations 2.5uM olaparib and 0.125 uM of BRD3008 scoring the highest (22, Loewe Synergy Score). In the presence of BRD3308, the olaparib EC50 reduced ~13-folds in the ID8_OR cells compared to only a 2-fold reduction in the ID8 cells. We hypothesizes that inhibition of HDAC3 induces apoptosis by downregulating homologous recombination repair in response to DNA damage. To examine these, we irradiated both ID8 cell lines and treated with olaparib (10 uM), BRD3308 (0.5uM) and in combination, for 24 hours, followed by western blot analysis. Rad51 expression was reduced following combination treatment when compared to control or olaparib alone. Lastly, our clonogenicity data revealed colony formation in both ID8 cell lines were reduced when treated with olaparib (5uM) and BRD3308 (0.25uM). Interestingly, BRD3308 alone reduced colony formation in the ID8_OR cells, but not in the ID8 cells. In conclusion, selective HDAC3 inhibition in combination with olaparib may be an effective therapy in the treatment of acquired PARPi resistant ovarian cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,PARP inhibitors,HDAC inhibitor,PARPi Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Metastatic UM is notoriously unresponsive to existing therapies, rendering it almost uniformly lethal. Virtually all UM tumors have activating mutations in the Gq signaling pathway, predominantly in GNAQ\/11, and around half of tumors have additional loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1. Mutations in the epigenetic modulator BAP1 are the most significant clinical marker of metastatic risk. The limited efficacy of current treatment options necessitates an urgent exploration of novel therapeutic approaches to improve patient prognosis. Thus, we conducted a large epigenetic compound library screen with the currently most well characterized, focused epigenetic library available, which consisted of 960 potent, cell permeable, medically active, epigenetic-directed small molecule modulators (TargetMol, L1200). We screened BAP1-mutant as well as BAP1-wildtype uveal melanoma cell lines and followed up with comprehensive dose-response and synergy tests. Our lead compounds were highly efficient in reducing viability of UM cells. We find that inhibitors with high specificity for class 1 HDAC inhibition are especially cytotoxic to UM cells. Together, our results reveal a possible mechanism of interfering with UM progression and identify lead compounds to be tested in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,HDAC inhibitor,Uveal melanoma,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

The unique structural and functional attributes of class IIb HDAC6 position it as a key player in influencing protein stability and chromatin dynamics. While its role in cancer progression and immunomodulation is well-recognized, the in-depth mechanisms following HDAC6 inactivation, particularly its influence on chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, are not thoroughly understood. This knowledge gap represents a critical area of investigation, given the potential of HDAC6 as a therapeutic target in oncology. This study aims to elucidate HDAC6 inactivation-dependent epigenetic effects of, exploring the possibility to exploit these latter for therapeutic purposes in cancer. This aim includes an examination of the stabilization of the lysine acetyltransferase P300 and its implications for chromatin structure and function.<br \/>Methods &#38; Results: In this study, ITF3756 and CRISPR\/Cas9 were employed to inactivate HDAC6 across a variety of cancer cell lines (Jurkat, MDA 231, HCC1806, 4T1, and B16F10 melanoma). ATAC-seq and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq were used to investigate changes in chromatin accessibility, revealing significant alterations, particularly in introns and distal intergenic regions. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis further supported this alteration in the chromatin landscape, which indicated a differential expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes like cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. A notable outcome of this study was the stabilization of P300 following ITF3756 treatment, an effect that was paralleled by changes in the expression of critical genes, including AKT1, ITGB3, GAS6, SOX9, NF1, TGFB2, and CASP7. These genes are integral to cellular survival mechanisms, and their modulation emphasizes the role of HDAC6 in cancer cell physiology.<br \/>Conclusions: This research shows that the chemical or genetic inactivation of HDAC6 impacts cancer cell proliferation and chromatin architecture, underscoring the potential of HDAC6 as a target in cancer therapeutics.. A critical finding of this study is the stabilization of P300, which offers new perspectives on HDAC6's functionality and its role as an epigenetic modifier in cancer cells. This study contributes to the field by suggesting therapeutic strategies focusing on HDAC\/HAT pharmacological targeting, thereby advancing our understanding of the role of HDAC6 in regulating cancer cell behavior and epigenetic landscape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Histone deacetylase,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Histone acetylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Our group has previously demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors (HDAC6is) modulate multiple immune pathways, including those that suppress the antitumoral M2 phenotype, leading to improved antitumor immunity. Despite the potential of HDAC6is, current inhibitors have poor selectivity and off-target effects and only work at micromolar concentrations. In this work, we designed a screening pipeline of HDAC6i, considering selectivity, potency, capacity to prevent the protumoral phenotype of macrophages, and low cytotoxicity on macrophages and other immune cells. This approach has not been tested before, as the standard screening method for antitumoral HDACis has focused on its cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. We initially designed in silico 980 compound derivatives from previously reported HDAC6i, such as SS208, Nexturastat A, and Suprastat. Twenty-four compounds with a high capacity to bind HDAC6 and chemical stability were screened by their ability to inhibit HDAC6 in cell-free conditions. Sixteen compounds demonstrated high potency and were further evaluated in murine macrophages by their cytotoxic effect using CellTox. The capacity to impede tubulin deacetylation was assessed by western blot and deacetylase activity by HDAC-Glo. The top six candidates were then evaluated by their selectivity compared to other HDAC members and by their effect on repressing the expression of protumoral M2 macrophages Arginase 1 and Fizz1, and activation of antitumoral markers TNFa and iNOS by western blot and qRT-PCR. The best three candidates were then evaluated at nanomolar concentrations to explore their immunomodulatory potential of M1 against M2 by performing antigen presentation (SIINFEKL presentation) and phagocytic capacity using microscopy. Two of these compounds, SM-06-09 and SM-05-947, will be further tested in syngeneic murine melanoma models for their ability in tumor regression and antitumor immunity. This study has yielded important insights into developing new and improved HDAC6is with minimal cytotoxicity, and we believe our work will help advance cancer research and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Macrophages,antitumor,Phagocytosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Yet, the development of effective inhibitors of these potent oncogenes has been challenging. In this work, we break new ground in this direction through the identification of novel inhibitors of YAP1\/TAZ activity. This study describes the identification and target deconvolution of novel small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic YAP1\/TAZ activity with potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1\/TAZ reporter assay. HTS hits that selectively inhibited TEAD-luciferase, but not TK-Renilla-luciferase (n = 3.994) were subsequently assessed regarding their ability to induce translocation of YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is the physiological mechanism of inactivation. Out of these, 392 hits showed activity to induce translocation of YAP1. Finally, selected hits active in both assays (n = 96) were assessed regarding their effect on endogenous YAP1\/TAZ target genes. The small molecule BAY-856 demonstrated the most consistent YAP1\/TAZ inhibitory activity of all selected hits, which warranted further exploration of the unknown direct drug target. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase&#8209;I (GGTase&#8209;I) complex, as the direct target of YAP1\/TAZ pathway inhibitor BAY-856. BAY-856 and close analogs with improved in vitro potency blocked the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1\/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in several tumor types in vitro.

Hippo kinase cascade controls YAP nuclear entry and binding with TEADs by modulating its phosphorylation and stability. Overexpression and activation of YAP\/TAZ are frequently observed in a variety of cancers. It has been well established that YAP aberration contributes to cancer development, metastasis, immunosurveillance escape and drug resistance. Disruption of YAP\/TEADs PPI is an effective approach to inhibit YAP transcriptional activity. We previously have reported the identification of YAP\/TEADs PPI hit compound through the fragment-based screen and advanced the hit to lead compound ETS-003. Here we reported the preclinical candidate of YAP\/TEADs PPI inhibitor ETS-006 with much more potent anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profile. Compared to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitor, ETS-006 could completely disrupt the interaction of YAP\/TEADs, resulting in a more profound downregulation of YAP target gene expression. ETS-006 demonstrated more robust anti-tumor activity than the competitor&#8217;s YAP\/TEADs PPI inhibitor in MPM CDX model with favorable ADME properties. Notably, ETS-006 showed promising efficacy across multiple solid tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and triple-negative breast cancer with urgent unmet clinical needs. In conclusion, ETS-006 is a highly potent and orally available YAP\/TEADs PPI inhibitor with broad anti-tumor activity as a single agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP1,Targeted therapy,YAP\/TEAD interaction blocker,Triple-negative breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"J.

These cells are short living due to the loss of their self-renewal capacity and rapid exhaustion. Enduring antitumor immune response relies on the capacity of regenerating effector cells upon antigen re-encounter by memory cells. Focusing on molecules that could modulate the differentiation of T cells towards a memory subset with a prolonged anti-tumor activity is strategic for an efficient anti-tumor immunotherapy. Thus, we developed a selective HDAC6 inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trial, ITF3756, which <i>in vitro<\/i> drives the differentiation of human CD8 T cells towards a central memory phenotype with reduced expression of exhaustion markers and higher expression of IFN&#947; and Granzyme b upon tumor cells coculture. This suggests that ITF3756-treated CD8 T cells could have a greater tumor killing activity. Moreover, if this augmented cytotoxic activity is directed not only towards tumor cells expressing MHC I but also towards MHC I negative cells, the anti-tumor efficacy could be improved. We thus selected the MHC I negative K562 leukemic cell line as target in an in vitro model of CD8 T cell killing assay. CD8 T cells were stimulated with anti CD3CD28 beads with or without ITF3756, and then co-cultivated with K562 cells for 4h. ITF3756 treatment improved significantly CD8 mediated K562 killing over this short period of time. However, since the effectiveness of memory cells is based on their capacity of maintaining a long-lasting immune response, we monitored the cytolytic activity over a period of 2 weeks. After 14 days of co-culture, ITF3756 treated CD8 T cells showed a higher cytotoxic capacity compared to control cells. These results indicate that ITF3756-treated CD8 T cells can kill a target tumor cell in a more efficient way independently of MHC I restricted tumor recognition, both after short and long term in vitro co-culture. Since it has been described that CD8 T cells can also kill MHC I-negative tumor cells through the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis, we assessed if ITF3756 could modulate the expression of NKG2D on CD8 T cells. Indeed, ITF3756-treated CD8 T cells had a significantly higher expression of NKG2D compared to untreated cells. In conclusion, we show that ITF3756 promotes the differentiation of cells that possess better effector activity when co-cultured with tumor cells for both short and long periods of time. ITF3756 increased the expression of NKG2D and this could be a driver of the increased cytolytic activity. One mechanism of tumor immune escape is the downregulation of MHC I. Our results suggest that ITF3756 could be used to improve the efficacy of T cell therapy by enhancing the cytolytic activity even in the absence of MHC I.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Immunotherapy,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Direct KRAS inhibitors are under intense preclinical and clinical development, with two KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant-selective inhibitors (G12Ci) now approved. However, treatment-associated resistance to KRAS inhibitors has been reported in the clinic highlighting an urgent need to identify both additional therapeutic targets and novel combination treatment strategies with KRAS inhibitors. To that end, we performed a CRISPR\/Cas9 loss-of-function screen using a library targeting ~2,500 druggable genes in KRAS<sup>G12C\/D<\/sup>-mutant PDAC cell lines. We identified multiple genes that were essential for PDAC cell growth and selected PRMT5, a protein arginine methyltransferase, to assess as a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. We found that suppression of PRMT5 activity using two distinct first-generation clinical candidate small molecule inhibitors (JNJ-64619178 and GSK3326595) demonstrated single agent activity and reduced PDAC cell growth. We further assessed a mechanistically distinct MTA-cooperative clinical candidate PRMT5 inhibitor, MRTX1719, that is selective for <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumors, which occur in ~25% of PDAC patients. We determined that MRTX1719 exhibited low nanomolar GI<sub>50<\/sub> activities in <i>MTAP<\/i>-deficient but not <i>MTAP <\/i>wild-type KRAS-mutant cell lines. Unexpectedly, PDAC cells treated with MRTX1719 exhibited a paradoxical activation of ERK, suggesting that combined inhibition of PRMT5 and KRAS might be therapeutically advantageous. In support of our hypothesis, we demonstrated that combination treatment with MRTX1719 and mutant selective KRAS inhibitors (G12Ci\/MRTX849 and G12Di\/MRTX1133) further sensitized KRAS<sup>G12C\/D<\/sup>-mutant PDAC cells to KRAS inhibition in short- and long-term growth assays as well as <i>in vivo <\/i>xenograft studies. Our ongoing studies are evaluating the consequences of co-targeting PRMT5 and KRAS on gene expression changes using RNA-Seq and cancer cell signaling pathways using RPPA analyses. In summary, our data support concurrent inhibition of PRMT5 and KRAS as a promising therapeutic strategy for MTAP-deficient KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Methylation,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Lung cancers harboring these mutations are associated with poor prognosis and often exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapies, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. We evaluated the efficacy of a novel EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, HM97662, and its synergistic potential with cisplatin in <i>SMARCA4<\/i>-deficient lung cancer cell lines.<br \/>Experimental Design: CCLE datasets were employed to identify cell lines harboring truncated mutations in the <i>SMARCA4<\/i> gene. Immunoblotting was conducted to verify the inactivation of <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and to check for the expression of SMARCA2. We assessed cellular viability and colony-forming capabilities of lung cancer cell lines<br \/>(NCI-H1975, PC9, A549, HCC15, NCI-H522, NCI-H1581, NCI-H1048, NCI-H841) to determine the cytotoxic effects of an EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor as well as cisplatin, both as single agents and in combination.<br \/>Results: Immunoblotting showed distinct lung cancer cell lines characterized by three profiles: proficient SMARCA4 expression, absent SMARCA4 but present SMARCA2 expression, and concurrent loss of both SMARCA4 and SMARCA2. After 14 days of treatment with the EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor HM97662, there was a significant reduction in cell proliferation, particularly in the both <i>SMARCA4<\/i>- and <i>SMARCA2<\/i>-loss cell lines. Furthermore, colony-forming assays demonstrated a significant decrease in colony-forming ability upon HM97662 treatment, an effect exclusive to the both SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 loss cell lines. Pre-treatment with 1 &#181;M of HM97662 for 7 days potentiated the cytotoxicity of cisplatin compared to untreated controls in the SMARCA4\/2 loss cell lines, as indicated by a lower IC50 value.<br \/>Conclusion: The novel EZH1\/2 dual inhibitor, HM97662, exhibits antitumor activity and a synergistic effect with cisplatin in lung cancer cell lines with concomitant loss of <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>SMARCA2<\/i>.

This study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic properties of three HDAC inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, or Vorinostat), Valproic Acid (VPA) and CAY10603) and compare them to Paclitaxel (PTX), a chemotherapy agent used to treat Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs). In the present study, drug response in the MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-10A cell lines was evaluated by cell viability assays. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mammospheres generated from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were also subjected to drug treatment; their response was assessed under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.<br \/>We found that SAHA and CAY10603 inhibited breast cancer cell viability without significantly affecting MCF-10A cells. SAHA, CAY10603, and VPA all arrested a significant percentage of MDA-MB-231 cells at G2\/M phase after 24h compared to controls. TNBC cells experienced an increase in both early and late apoptosis following treatment with the most effective concentrations of SAHA, CAY10603, and VPA (1.8&#181;M, 2&#181;M, and 0.4mM, respectively). SAHA proved to be the most effective drug for induction of apoptosis compared to the control, followed by CAY10603 (8.26% and 6%, 3.67%). In both TNBCs and mammospheres under hypoxic conditions, SAHA and CAY10603 down regulated <i>HIF-1&#945;<\/i> expression significantly, but PTX did not. In contrast, VPA and PTX down regulated <i>CTNNB1<\/i> gene expression.<br \/>This study indicates that epi-drugs exert an anti-tumor effect on TNBCs, suggesting a potential role for HDAC inhibitors as novel therapeutics for breast cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Apoptosis,Antitumor effect,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

Accumulated MTA in MTAP loss cells competes with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, the methyl donor) and leads to partial inhibition on protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), resulting in the sensitivity of these cells to PRMT5 inhibition. On this basis, MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors (such as MRTX1719 and TNG908) have been designed to stabilize the binding of PRMT5 to MTA, but not SAM, resulting in further improvement of selectivity window. The clinical data showed that MRTX1719 has the capability to inhibit MTAP-loss tumor growth while avoid hematology toxicity observed with first generation PRMT5 inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: A pair of HCT116 isogenic cell lines (MTAP-\/- and MTAP+\/+) were used to determine the effects of PH020-2 on cell proliferation and intracellular symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) content. Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were collected to evaluate hematological toxicity. Intravenous injection of PH020-2 in rats were performed to assess the brain-penetration capability. The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy was tested in cell derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models with tumor harboring MTAP gene deletion. The <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety properties were assessed with corresponding assay methods.<br \/>Results: PH020-2 dramatically decreased SDMA content and inhibited proliferation in HCT116 MTAP-\/- cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, SDMA, 0.31 nM; proliferation, 5.9 nM), but had very weak effect on HCT116 WT cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, SDMA, 296.2 nM; proliferation, 1381 nM), suggesting an excellent selectivity (proliferation, 253&#215;). In comparison, IC<sub>50<\/sub> of MRTX1719 and TNG908 on MTAP-\/- cell viability was 8.38 and 52.75 nM, respectively, generating a selectivity of 118&#215; and 28&#215;, respectively. PH020-2 mildly inhibited CD34+ HSC (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=807.1 nM), compared to the test on MRTX1719 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=481.9 nM). The tests on a panel of cancer cells confirmed activity and selectivity of PH020-2. PH020-2 possessed excellent PK profiles in all species with absolute bioavailability of 98% in dogs. At the same time, PH020-2 showed outstanding brain penetration in rats (Kp, 0.67). In three CDX models (H838, H2170, Hup-T4), PH020-2 at a dose of 25 mg\/kg BID potently inhibited tumor growth, and tumor regression was observed at higher doses in all tested models. Methyltransferase screening (44 targets) showed that PH020-2 potently inhibits PRMT5, but not others. Safety panel assays covering 47 targets demonstrated excellent safety profiles of PH020-2. All other <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> tests showed favorable results and supported for preclinical development.<br \/>Conclusion: The data suggest that PH020-2 is an MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor with excellent brain-penetration that selectively targets MTAP-deleted tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Synthetic lethality,Precision medicine,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Nevertheless, the crucial involvement of PRMT5 in controlling hematopoiesis, even in normal cells, resulted in significant on-target-off-tumor hematological toxicity when using first-generation, non-selective PRMT5 inhibitors in clinical settings, which hampered the clinical development of these drugs. The MTAP gene is deleted in around 10-15% of all human malignancies. As a result, the loss of MTAP leads to the buildup of MTA, which can bind to PRMT5 and partially inhibit PRMT5 activity. Inhibitors targeting the PRMT5-MTA complex become a promising strategy for treating MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> cancer in a synthetically lethal manner. Herein, we report the preclinical feature of ATG-042-198, a novel MTAP<sup>null<\/sup>-selective PRMT5 inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: The in vitro activity and MTAP selectivity of ATG-042-198 on cell proliferation and cellular symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) expression were profiled using HCT116 MTAP wild type (wt) cells and HCT116 MTAP knock out (ko) cells, as well as in five MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> cell lines. The in vivo efficacy was tested in cell derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models with HCT116 MTAP wt cells, HCT116 MTAP ko cells and LU99 cells (MTAP<sup>null<\/sup>). The in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties were assessed with corresponding assay methods.<br \/>Results: ATG-042-198 demonstrated potent and selectively inhibitory effect on HCT116 MTAP ko cells&#8217; proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=44nM) and SDMA expression (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=0.146nM), but very weak effect on HCT116 MTAP wt cells&#8217; proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=4550nM) and SDMA expression (IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#62;500nM). Consistently, ATG-042-198 showed excellent anti-proliferation activities on multiple endogenous MTAP<sup>null <\/sup>cell lines (A549, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=2nM; LU99, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=6nM; U87MG, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=11nM; NALM-6, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=37nM; MIA PaCa-2, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=43nM). ATG-042-198 demonstrated high permeability (Caco2 assay, ER=2), good metabolic stability (Human liver microsomes assay, T1\/2&#62;145min), and low risk of drug interaction (CYP inhibition assay, 3A4\/2C19\/2D6, all IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#62;10&#956;M). In vivo PK study showed that ATG-042-198 was well absorbed, with a dose-dependent increase in plasma distribution and high oral bioavailability (F=108%). Plasma free drug concentrations were continuously higher than the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of cell proliferation inhibition within 24 hours after 30mpk administration. In three CDX models (HCT116 MTAP wt, HCT116 MTAP ko and LU99), ATG-042-198 at a dose of 30 mg\/kg QD potently and selectively inhibited tumor growth (TGI=-1%, 89% and 106%) without inducing body weight loss.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, ATG-042-198 is an oral MTAP <sup>null<\/sup>-selective PRMT5 inhibitor with potent efficacy against MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> tumor.

Despite aggressive treatments, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 23.7% in the United States. MDM2 and AURKB are two cancer-driving genes that are highly expressed in a broad range of cancer types including lung cancers. Furthermore, MDM2 overexpression can positively impact AURKB expression and contribute to oncogenesis and cancer progression. Therefore, blocking MDM2 with specific inhibitors has become a promising strategy for the restoration of p53 function that could be used for the treatment of different types of cancers including lung cancers. In this regard, both MDM2 and AURKB inhibitors have shown promising antitumor activity against NSCLC. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms linking MDM2 and ARKB using RG7388, CM272, BMS-582949 (p38 inhibitor), and Ralimetinib (p38 inhibitor) in A549 and H460 lung cancer cells. We analyzed the individual or combination treatment effects of these drugs on epigenetic modifications, cell cycle arrest, and cell death mechanisms, using the <i>in vitro<\/i> experimental model. When RG7388 was used individually, or in combination with BMS-582949 or Ralimetinib, a significant increase in the cytotoxic effect was observed in A549 and H460 cells. Induction of cell cycle arrest by RG7388 in cancer cells was evidenced by elevated p21 expression levels. In addition, RG7388 and combination treatments in NSCLC cells showed significant upregulation of p53, p27, Bax, cleaved PARP, phospho-FOXO3a and down-regulation in DNMT3a, DNMT1, FOXM1, AURKB, CDC25, and CDK4 levels. It appears that during treatments with a combination of MDM2 with DNMT or p38 inhibitor, two pathways might be blocked simultaneously, which could lead to increased cancer cell death. RG7388 appears to induce cell death in a p21-dependent manner and CM272, BMS-582949, and Ralimetinib seem to induce cell death <i>via<\/i> a p21-independent manner by inhibiting a downstream pathway. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the intracellular link between MDM2 and AURKB that is disrupted by the anti-cancer agents used in our study.

Loss of MTAP result in methylthioadenosine (MTA) accumulation. PRMT5, which is a type II arginine methyltransferase that regulates multiple essential cellular functions via symmetric dimethylation of arginine (SDMA) in target proteins, was identified as a synthetic lethal target for MTAP del cancers. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors may exhibit better safety profiling compared to first generation PRMT5i (which observe limiting heme-related toxicities in clinical), which preferentially inhibiting PRMT5 in MTAP del cancer cells to normal cells. HSK41959-2 is a MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, which could selectively inhibits PRMT5 in the present of MTA with IC<sub>50<\/sub> was 0.80 nM. In HCT116 MTAP Deleted cell line, HSK41959-2 significantly inhibits the cell proliferation with GI<sub>50<\/sub> of 19.89 nM, which was around 45-fold selectivity in HCT116 cell line.

HSK41959-2 weakly inhibited the cell proliferation with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 544 nM while the first generation PRMT5i with IC<sub>50<\/sub> was 35.39 nM. This results indicated HSK41959-2 may has lower heme-related toxicities compared with the first generation PRMT5i. In the HCT116 MTAP-del xenograft model, daily orally administrated with 25 mpk and 100 mpk HSK41959-2 showed significant tumor growth inhibition, with TGI were 62% and 88%, and PRMT5-dependent SDMA protein inhibition were 89% and 95%, respectively. Meanwhile in the HCT116 MTAP-WT xenograft model, HSK41959-2 did not show tumor growth inhibition at 100 mpk.

Recently, specific targeting of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a key member of the type-II PRMT family and a master epigenetic modulator of arginine methylome essential for cancer progression, has emerged as a promising therapy in various hematological and solid tumors with <i>MTAP<\/i> deletion serving as a precision biomarker. To optimize the potential of targeting PRMT5, we developed CTS3497, a potent, brain-penetrable, orally bioavailable MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, using our EpigenPLUS<sup>TM<\/sup> platform. The overall excellent drug-like properties of CTS3497 support fast track IND application, and it is anticipated to enter Phase 1 trials in 2024. CTS3497 demonstrated potent PRMT5 inhibitory activity in cellular pharmacodynamics (PD) assays, evidenced by the suppression of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Additionally, it exhibited profound cell growth inhibition with a low single-digit nM IC50 and 171-fold high selectivity for <i>MTAP<sup>null<\/sup><\/i> over isogenic <i>MTAP<sup>wt<\/sup> <\/i>cell lines. Moreover, CTS3497 displayed strong inhibitory effects on cell growth across diverse panels of <i>MTAP<sup>null<\/sup><\/i> cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft organoids (PDXOs) spanning various lineages. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral administration of CTS3497 resulted in significant tumor regression in multiple <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted xenograft models, notably <i>MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> <\/i>brain tumors. The observed anti-tumor activity correlated with PRMT5 modulation, as indicated by reduced SDMA levels. Impressively, sustained tumor growth inhibition led to the complete tumor regression, with no regrowth even after discontinuation of CTS3497 treatment. The brain penetration property of CTS3497 underscores its therapeutic potential for both primary brain tumors, and brain metastases arising from specific cancers like lung cancer. At the molecular level, PRMT5 inhibition by CTS3497 induced substantial and distinctive RNA splicing defects and differentially expressed gene signatures, impacting key cellular activities downstream of arginine and epigenetic reprogramming in <i>MTAP<sup>null<\/sup> <\/i>cancer cells. Furthermore, a synergistic anti-tumor effect was observed in multiple <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumors when combining PRMT5 inhibition with CTS2190, an investigational type-I PRMT inhibitor currently in phase I\/II clinical trials. In summary, CTS3497, a PRMT5 inhibitor selectively targeting <i>MTAP<sup>null<\/sup><\/i><b> <\/b>tumor cells, demonstrated robust and durable anti-tumor responses both <i>in vitro <\/i>and<i> in vivo<\/i> across diverse lineages of <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted tumors. Its superior ADME properties and favorable safety profiles observed in preclinical studies mark a breakthrough in the next generation epigenetic therapy.

One such adjacent gene is methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), involved in metabolism, located on chromosome 9p21 in close proximity to the p16\/CDKN2A tumor-suppressor locus. Co-deletion of MTAP is observed in approximately 80-90% of tumors with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, representing 10-15% of all human tumors. These tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and mesothelioma, have a poor prognosis, highlighting the significant unmet medical need in this area.<br \/>Deletion of MTAP leads to a significant accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) in cells. MTA, at high concentrations, selectively inhibits the PRMT5 methyltransferase enzyme, competing with the substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) required for methylation reactions. As a result, the overall level of symmetric arginine dimethylation throughout the proteome is reduced. This heightened sensitivity to modulation of methylosome activity makes cells with MTAP deletion more susceptible to therapeutic targeting of PRMT5. Hence, selective targeting of PRMT5 in cancers with homozygous MTAP deletion represents a promising strategy for specifically eliminating cancer cells with this genetic alteration. Ryvu has developed MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors characterized by good drug-like physicochemical properties and inhibition of methyltransferase activity with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A structure-based lead optimization delivered compounds coming from two independent series with high selective potency in MTAP-deleted cell lines and DMPK profiles allowing an oral administration. The antitumor activities were compared in vitro and in vivo to MRTX1719 and AMG193 in MTAP null tumors such as HCT116 MTAP KO, DoHH-2 and Lu99. The correlation between compound exposure and on-target effect was confirmed in PK\/PD and efficacy studies. Taken together, these studies confirm that MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors exert strong synthetic lethal phenotype in MTAP deleted cancers and offer an exciting therapeutic opportunity for a large patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,MTAP deletion,PRMT5,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"A.

Although prognosis has improved over time, 95% of children with high-risk or relapsed MB eventually succumb to the disease. A key driver gene in high-risk MB is the c-<i>MYC <\/i>oncogene, for which there are currently no approved inhibitors<i>.<\/i> Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are transcriptional repressors that are dysregulated in many cancers, making them an attractive therapeutic target. Although several HDAC inhibitors have been FDA-approved for cancer treatment, they have been associated with high toxicity and limited efficacy as single agents. Therefore, simultaneously targeting c-<i>MYC<\/i> and HDACs may result in synergistic effects that could overcome drug resistance in high-risk MB.<br \/>Methods and Results: We previously reported a novel pyrido-benzimidazole analogue, SE486-11, which enhanced the therapeutic effect of HDAC inhibitors in MYCN-driven cancers. We recently developed analogues (UNSW-SC compounds) with more potent activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 0.017 to 3.70 &#181;M). Here, we showed that these compounds significantly reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in MB cells. MYC status was a key determinant of sensitivity of UNSW-SC compounds, with more than 3-fold higher cytotoxicity in high MYC compared to low MYC MB cells. The lead compound, UNSW-SC-22, was shown to reduce MYC protein expression and was found to be highly synergistic in enhancing the efficacy of HDAC inhibitors in MB cells. Most importantly, we demonstrated that UNSW-SC-22 was able to freely cross the blood brain barrier, reaching a concentration of 10.8 &#956;M, with a half-life of 1.22 hours. UNSW-SC-22 directly bound to c-MYC and MYCN proteins at low micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values which was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance assay. In a MYCN-driven MB mouse model, we found that UNSW-SC-22 as a single agent at 90 mg\/kg decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival. Through RNA-sequencing, we identified 512 differentially expressed genes after in vitro treatment with UNSW-SC-22. Importantly, GSEA analysis revealed MYC targets and cell cycle pathways as highly downregulated pathways, and upregulation in the p53 pathway. Several genes, such as MELK and USP1 were validated as down-stream targets of UNSW-SC-22. As UNSW-SC-22 is a first-in-class anticancer drug, which we are currently testing extensively in other MYC-driven MB mice models.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, our data strongly suggest that c-Myc and MYCN are the molecular targets of UNSW-SC compounds, and these compounds have strong potential to serve as specific targeted therapy to treat subgroup 3 and 4 of MB patients with c-Myc and MYCN overexpression and amplification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Small molecule inhibitor,Myc,HDAC inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
