Any treatment decision in oncology is based on the integration of different types of information, most commonly clinical, radiological, histopathological, and genomic information. In the last five years, artificial intelligence tools capable of handling these different types of information simultaneously have become available and are being widely explored in research studies and in some clinically approved products. This talk will outline the current state of the art of multimodal data integration for biomarkers and precision oncology. In the presentation, three types of multimodality will be discussed from a technical point of view. First, dedicated single-purpose multimodal models, which often are transformer neural networks specifically equipped to concatenate information from two different modalities. Second, multimodal language vision models, which have become widely used since 2023, and could enable vision-enabled chatbot assistance for clinical decision making. Third, large language models orchestrating groups of specialized models for multimodal recommendations. These three classes of multimodal models will be discussed, with a focus on applications aiming to inform an audience of non-computational cancer research specialists.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jakob Nikolas Kather<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
