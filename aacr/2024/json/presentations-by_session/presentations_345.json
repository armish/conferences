[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer stands as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) representing the most aggressive subtype. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) demonstrated durable response in some TNBC patients, the added benefit of current FDA-approved ICI in combination with chemotherapy is estimated to be only around 10%. Fortunately, TNBC displays the highest number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), compared to other BC subtypes, indicating an optimal context for the survival of T cells. Therefore, CAR-T therapy emerges as a promising therapeutic option for TNBC patients. Expanding the application of CAR-T therapies to solid tumors, including breast cancer, remains challenging. One of the key hurdles lies in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, where the T cell receptor experiences long-term exposure to tumor antigens, leading to T cell exhaustion. This state impedes the T cells' capacity to efficiently target and eliminate cancer cells. Identifying key regulatory mechanisms downstream of the T cell receptor holds the potential to revolutionize existing immunotherapeutic strategies.<br \/>In our study, we discovered that the presence of the master transcriptional factor of T cell stemness, TCF1, in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, is essential for controlling TNBC tumors. TCF1 undergoes phosphorylation by LCK, a crucial component of initiating T cell receptor signaling, upon T cell activation. We found this phosphorylation site is indispensable for TCF1's transcriptional activities, inhibiting the downstream program of T-cell persistence and causing T-cell exhaustion. Reversing this process, either through LCK inhibition or introducing a non-phosphorylated form of TCF1, results in a more sustained CAR-T cell-mediated anti-tumor response. Our findings reveal the significance of TCF1 post-translational modification in the development and longevity of stem-like CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, bridging the gap between TCR signaling and transcriptional and epigenetic programs of stem-like CD8+ T cells. This insight contributes to a potential cure for TNBC by maintaining T cell persistence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,T cell,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

However, efficacy against solid tumors has remained limited and is associated with relatively low T cell persistence. Here, we perform an <i>in vivo<\/i> CAR T cell CRISPR screen in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using a curated guide library to identify genes that enhance CAR T cell persistence <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Material and Methods<br \/>The Mario library consists of 1180 total guide RNAs targeting 135 genes that have been shown to modulate T cell functions in other models. To generate Mario-CART cells, primary human T cells were transduced with two lentiviral vectors, the first encoding an anti-mesothelin CAR and the second containing a fixed guide targeting the TCR alpha gene constant region (TRAC) as well as the Mario library. Mario-CART cells were transduced at low MOI, expanded in vitro and selected for loss of CD3 expression using magnetic selection, to enrich for cells that had a successful gene-edited event. Purified Mario-CART cells were intravenously injected into NSG mice bearing subcutaneous pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ASPC1). Tumor and spleen were harvested 2 or 4 weeks after Mario-CART injection, and engrafted T cells were isolated by CD45 positive selection. Genomic DNA was prepared from retrieved cells and illumina sequencing was used to evaluate guide abundance to identify gene knockouts that had been enriched after tumor exposure <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results<br \/>The transcription factor, GATA3, was consistently identified as the most enriched hit across two donor T cells when Mario-CART was recovered at the 2-week timepoint. When compared to control or a depleted hit, GATA3 KO CAR showed early improvements in tumor clearance <i>in vivo. <\/i>However, relapse occurred at similar timepoints across groups. At the 4-week timepoint, the most enriched guides comprised a different set, including genes involved in transforming growth factor beta and JAK-STAT signaling pathways as well as T cell trafficking. In vivo anti-tumor control data are being collected.<br \/>Conclusions<br \/>Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of CART-tumor interactions. Gene knockouts that confer enhancements may change over time with varying context (such as in vitro vs in vivo conditions). It may be difficult to identify single gene knockouts that enhance CAR-T cell functions across different conditions and over time, but rather it may be necessary to exert more dynamic functional control of CAR T cells to enhance their function in different settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Screening,Solid tumors,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Current CAR-T cell <i>in vitro<\/i> manufacturing routes involve T cell isolation, purification, activation, gene transduction and cell expansion. The process duration and the costs present significant barriers. Therefore, there is a need for innovative strategies to address these concerns. Herein, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver CAR-mRNA efficiently and safely to T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>, thereby enabling <i>in situ <\/i>CAR-T cell engineering. By optimizing their composition and introducing anti-CD5 as the targeting ligand, we were able to enhance mRNA delivery and T cell transfection efficiency while maintaining T cell function. Furthermore, to augment T cell responsiveness to exogenous genetic elements, we investigated the pretreatment of T cells with interleukin (IL-7), thereby modulating T cell homeostasis by enhancing survival and proliferation, and rendering the cells more receptive to exogenous genetic modifications. We tracked firefly luciferase (FLuc) in na&#239;ve Balb\/c mice using <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>ex vivo<\/i> bioluminescence imaging after intravenous injection of anti-CD5 FLuc-mRNA LNPs. We observed positive mRNA expression in lymphoid organs, particularly in the spleen. Additionally, we harvested the lymphoid organs, and performed immunophenotyping analysis using flow cytometry after the administration of anti-CD5 LNPs encapsulating mRNA encoded CD19-CAR with a flag tag. We showed enhanced LNP binding in 65.2% of T cells and CAR expression in 11.64% of T cells as compared with non-treated controls, anti-CD5 FLuc-mRNA LNPs, or IgG CAR-mRNA LNPs. In a CD19<sup>+<\/sup> A20 tumor-bearing mouse model, treatment with CAR-LNPs resulted in a significant increase in chemoattractants (CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7 and CXCL10) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, IL6, IL8 and IL15) in blood, and infiltration of T cells and other immune cells in tumors, compared to the non-treated control group over 48 hours post treatment. <i>In vivo<\/i> engineering allows simultaneous CAR T cell engineering and delivery, reducing the time between manufacturing and treatment, minimizing contamination risks, eliminating complex <i>ex vivo <\/i>processes, and reducing the need for high-dose preconditioning chemotherapy. In conclusion, the adoption of <i>in situ<\/i> CAR-T cell production holds promise for improving this therapeutic approach.

CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown promising efficacy in relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) alone and in combination with CD19 CAR-T cell therapies (1,2). CD22 is a multi-domain glycoprotein expressed on B-cells. Natural splice variants of CD22 can exclude domains near the N-terminus, allowing for therapeutic resistance when these domains are targeted. We identified novel single domain antibodies (VHH) to CD22 that bind to multiple epitopes on different domains of CD22, including membrane proximal binders. The VHHs were affinity matured to enhance cell-based binding and formatted as CARs in monovalent and tandem, bivalent formats. Our data demonstrates the best efficacy against CD22+ tumor cells with a biparatopic, tandem VHH CAR format. Through additional engineering, bispecific CARs that combined three CD22-binding VHH and the anti-CD19 scFv, FMC63, in a loop CAR configuration were designed and tested. This CD19xCD22 bispecific, CD22 biparatopic CAR was engineered into primary T-cells and demonstrated cytotoxicity activity against CD19 and CD22 positive tumor cells as well as CD19 knockout and CD22 knockout cell lines. CD19xCD22 bispecific primary CAR-T cells were efficacious in controlling tumors in mouse xenograft models. This novel CAR is being tested in IPSC-derived iT and iNK cells for off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapy to expand patient access beyond CD19 CAR-T cell therapies. Ref: 1.

We identified a role for interleukin (IL)-4 in the development of CART cell exhaustion through three independent approaches including: 1) a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen using healthy donor CART cells in an <i>in vitro <\/i>model for exhaustion, 2) RNA and ATAC sequencing on freshly produced and chronically stimulated healthy donor CART cells, and 3) RNA and ATAC sequencing on pre-infusion CART cell products from responders and non-responders in the Zuma-1 clinical trial that led to the FDA approval of axi-cel. Further, <i>in vitro <\/i>validation studies revealed that CD19 directed CART (CART19) cells chronically stimulated in the presence of human recombinant IL-4 (hrIL-4) displayed signs of exhaustion such as 1) decreased proliferation (p = 0.01), 2) increased coexpression of inhibitory receptors (p = 0.01), and 3) decreased production of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-&#947; (p= 0.02, p = 0.002). Encouragingly, CART19 cells combined with an IL-4 monoclonal antibody improved antitumor activity (p = 0.045) and expansion (p = 0.01) while also decreasing the co-expression of inhibitory receptors (p = 0.02) in a mantle cell lymphoma xenograft mouse model. Building on these results, we asked if IL-4 driven exhaustion results from a direct impact of IL-4 on CART cells. To test this, we used a tumor-free assay where CART19 cells were chronically stimulated with CD19 beads in the presence of hrIL-4 or diluent. CART cells treated with hrIL-4 displayed an exhausted phenotype characterized by increased co-expression of inhibitory receptors (p = 0.04) and decreased production of IL-2 (p = 0.01). Next, we asked if IL-4 driven CART cell exhaustion is dependent on the costimulatory domain. We tested the impact of IL-4 on both CD28&#950; and 41BB&#950; costimulated CART19 cells. Similar to our previous studies with CART19-28&#950; cells, chronic stimulation of CART19-BB&#950; cells in the presence of hrIL-4 enhanced the exhausted phenotype as seen by increased co-expression of inhibitory receptors (p = 0.04) and decreased production of IL-2 and IFN-&#947; (p = 0.08 and p = 0.007). Finally, we asked if IL-4 induces exhaustion independently of its classic role in Th2 polarization of CD4 CART cells. Following CART production, we isolated CD8 cells and chronically stimulated them in the presence of hrIL-4 or diluent. CD8 CART cells treated with hrIL-4 displayed an enhanced exhausted profile as seen by 1) decreased proliferative ability (p &#60; 0.0001), 2) increased co-expression of inhibitory receptors (p = 0.01), and 3) decreased production of IL-2 and IFN-&#947; (p &#60; 0.0001, p = 0.004). Together, our data indicates a novel role for IL-4 in the development of CART cell exhaustion that is independent of tumor cells, costimulatory domain, and CD4 cells. As such, we believe IL-4 neutralization may be a widely applicable and actionable approach to improve the durable response to CART cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Cytokines,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

AB-2100&#8217;s sequential AND logic-gate confers tumor-specific activity by priming off of PSMA-expressing tumor vasculature to induce CA9 CAR expression. This unique feature of the logic gate is intended to increase the safety profile of AB-2100 given that PSMA and CA9 are predicted to have limited co-expression in normal tissues. Additional functionality includes short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against Fas and TGFBR designed to prevent tumor-mediated resistance, and a synthetic pathway activator (SPA) that drives constitutive STAT3 signaling and enhanced T cell cytotoxicity and expansion. Mechanism of action studies demonstrate that AB-2100 can prime off of PSMA-expressing endothelial cells and induce tumor-specific killing of CA9 tumor cells, leading to the eradication of ccRCC targets in vitro. AB-2100 also exhibited selective killing of dual antigen expressing tumors in vivo using a dual-flank subcutaneous xenograft model. Preclinical xenograft studies also demonstrated that TGFBR shRNA and SPA modules enhanced antitumor activity of ICTs. When AB-2100 potency was evaluated in the subcutaneous A498 xenograft model, treatment with AB-2100 resulted in complete and durable anti-tumor responses. In summary, preclinical data demonstrate that AB-2100 selectively targets tumors co-expressing PSMA and CA9, and can overcome multiple suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. These results support the evaluation of AB-2100 in the clinic for the treatment of advanced or metastatic ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immuno-oncology,Renal cell carcinoma,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Complex, multi-stage genome engineering, large batch production and rigorous lot testing could provide a consistent source of off-the-shelf, functionally enhanced T cell products. However, this vision cannot be realized using existing T cell differentiation platforms, which fail to present Notch ligands with the precision and intensity required to control T cell differentiation in scalable, suspension culture.<br \/>We have previously shown that VCAM1 synergizes with DLL4 to enhance Notch signaling and progenitor T cell differentiation. We have extended the utility of this discovery through the creation of DLL4\/VCAM1-coated magnetic microbeads, enabling precise and temporal control of Notch signaling in suspension culture. iPSC-derived CD34+ cells cultured with DLL4\/VCAM1 beads demonstrate dose-responsive activation of Notch gene expression (e.g., Notch1, DTX1, TCF7), resultant T lineage commitment (e.g. CD5, CD7 expression) and maturation to CD4-CD8+ (single positive) cells in a TCR signal-independent manner. Removal of the endogenous TCR is necessary to prevent graft-versus-host-disease. Therefore, differentiation and maturation in a TCR-independent process presents substantial advantage in the development of safe, off the shelf iPSC T cell products.<br \/>Using a clonal iPSC line with a CD19 CAR knocked in at the <i>TRAC<\/i> locus, we apply this approach to generate CAR-expressing, CD8&#945;&#946;+ functional T cells, capable of multiple rounds of <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor cell lysis and sustained tumor growth inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i> comparable to primary T cells.

Apoptosis induction through the FAS ligand\/FAS pathway is a key negative regulator of lymphocyte survival. To define which cellular subsets express <i>FASLG<\/i>, the gene encoding FAS ligand, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 37 patients with diverse cancer types. We discovered that <i>FASLG<\/i> expression is highly constrained and limited primarily to T and NK cells while stromal and tumor cells express minimal to no <i>FASLG<\/i>. Multiplex RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization of clinical samples from patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells confirmed these results and revealed significantly higher <i>FASLG<\/i> content in CAR-expressing compared with non-CAR expressing T cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that FAS ligand expression by CAR<sup>+<\/sup> T and NK cells will engage FAS<sup>+<\/sup>CAR<sup>+<\/sup> cells to induce apoptosis and limit cellular persistence. To test this hypothesis, we performed competitive fitness assays using two phenotypically discernable populations of human CAR-T and CAK-NK cells that are either responsive or unresponsive to FAS-signaling through expression of a FAS dominant negative receptor (&#916;FAS). &#916;FAS<sup>+<\/sup> and &#916;FAS<sup>-<\/sup> CAR-expressing cells were co-infused 1:1 into tumor bearing hosts and persistence of each population was quantified. For both CAR-T and CAR-NK, we measured significant enrichment in &#916;FAS-expressing cells across multiple tissues, demonstrating that FAS-signaling regulates CAR<sup>+<\/sup> cell survival in a cell-intrinsic manner. Knock out (KO) of <i>FASLG<\/i> using CRISPR\/Cas9 prevented population skewing while KO of the <i>AAVS1<\/i> control locus had no effect, indicating that CAR-derived <i>FASLG<\/i> is sufficient to restrain the persistence of transferred cells. By contrast, we discovered that <i>FASLG<\/i> was dispensable for CAR-T and CAR-NK mediated tumor killing both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Finally, using two different tumor models, we found that adoptive transfer of CAR-T or CAR-NK cells that co-express &#916;FAS resulted in superior antitumor efficacy compared with control cells that express the CAR alone. Taken together, these findings reveal that CAR-engineered lymphocyte persistence is governed by a FAS\/FAS ligand auto-regulatory circuit. Further, they indicate that the therapeutic benefit of a FAS-dominant negative receptor is broadly applicable and agnostic of whether <i>FASLG <\/i>is expressed by cells in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CAR NK cells,Cancer immunotherapy,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Fei Yi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tal Cohen<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Zumbo<sup>2<\/sup>, Razan Eltilib<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Arkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Gormally<sup>3<\/sup>, Christopher  S.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting MSLN have been tested in patients with MSLN-positive solid tumors. Despite reported patient fatalities in trials sponsored by PENN, Memorial Sloan Kettering\/Atara Bio, and MD Anderson\/TCR<sup>2<\/sup>, the design approach for MSLN CAR remains constructing high affinity CARs to maximize target cell killing. In this study, we designed MSLN CARs with two different antibodies: one targeting human MSLN specifically and another binding both human and mouse MLSN with comparable affinities. The objectives are to 1) elucidate the risk of fatal on-target off-tumor toxicity associated with high affinity MSLN CAR, and 2) demonstrate how optimizing the affinity of CARs can render CAR T cells to spare normal tissues while retaining cytotoxicity against tumors.<br \/>Methods: To asses on-target off-tumor toxicity in animal models, we developed a CAR using a nanobody isolated from an immune alpaca library with nanomolar affinity for both human and mouse MSLN (labeled as hmMSLN CAR). For comparison, we constructed a CAR using a scFv specific only to human MSLN, designated hMSLN CAR. Each CAR is designed to co-express somatostatin receptor 2 to enable PET\/CT imaging of CAR T cells with <sup>18<\/sup>F-NOTA-Octreotide. Anti-tumor activities and toxicities were assessed in NSG mice using MSTO-211H cell line expressing human MSLN.<br \/>Results: In NSG mice bearing subcutaneous MSTO-211H tumors, hMSLN CAR T cells eliminated tumors rapidly without inducing any overt toxicity. In contrast, hmMSLN CAR T cells not only failed to control tumor growth but also caused severe toxicity, resulting in significant body weight loss and necessitating euthanasia. PET\/CT imaging revealed while hMSLN CAR T cells expanded exclusively within the tumor and subsequently contracted after tumor elimination, hmMSLN CAR T cells exhibited extensive infiltration and expansion in the lungs, liver, and bone marrow, indicating off-tumor, normal tissue-driven proliferation of CAR T cells. To test if affinity-tuned hmMSLN CAR T cells can selectively target tumors, we used a yeast display system to screen for affinity variants of the hmMSLN CAR. We identified one micromolar affinity CAR that binds approximately 1,000 times weaker to MSLN than the parental CAR. In stark contrast to the onset of severe toxicity soon after the administration of the parental hmMSLN CAR T cells, animals treated with micromolar affinity hmMSLN CAR T cells exhibited tumor regression without overt toxicity.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings underscore the risks of using high affinity CAR against MSLN, which may cause unpredictable on-target, off-tumor toxicities. Fine tuning the affinity of MSLN CAR offers a promising strategy for developing a potent and safe CAR for the treatment of MSLN-expressing solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesothelin,Toxicity,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

T cell infiltration into tumors relies upon the enzymatic degradation of these matrix fibers, and adhesion molecule-mediated movement. Gene expression analysis of tumor infiltrating leukocytes from patient samples showed that MMP-7, an enzyme that degrades type IV collagen, and osteopontin (OPN), a molecule that interacts with adhesion molecules to mediate movement, were highly upregulated in infiltrating cells compared to those that were tumor adjacent, suggesting they may be important in navigating tumor-specific environments. <i>We hypothesized that overexpressing MMP-7 and\/or OPN in CAR-T cells will enhance their infiltration into solid tumors.<\/i><br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> We overexpressed MMP-7 and OPN in second-generation CAR-Ts (GD2-28Z and HER2-28Z) and evaluated their infiltration <i>in vitro<\/i> using Halo invasion assays.

While CAR T cells have shown remarkable efficacy, most patients receiving CAR T cell therapy eventually relapse. CAR-mediated trogocytosis (CMT) is a potential tumor escape mechanism involving the transfer of cell surface proteins from tumor cells to CAR T cells. CMT results in antigen-negative tumor cells and correlates with reduced CAR T cell persistence, possibly due to increased CAR T cell fratricide or exhaustion. To date it has not been conclusively demonstrated that antigens transferred by CMT are the cause of fratricide or exhaustion. To answer this question, we developed a system to rapidly degrade trogocytosed protein in CAR T cells. Using this system, we show that the transfer of CD19 to CAR T cells directly causes CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion. We hypothesize that reducing CMT will increase CAR T cell persistence. To identify molecular mechanisms driving CMT as potential therapeutic targets, we inhibited various proteins essential for cell adhesion, endocytosis, actin polymerization, or antigen processing using small molecule inhibitors. We found that inhibition of the cysteine protease Cathepsin B (CTSB), with a membrane-permeable (Ca-074) or membrane-impermeable (Ca-074-Me) inhibitor, significantly reduced CMT without affecting CAR T cell cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that CTSB inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach to limit CMT.CTSB activity is regulated by the protein Cystatin A (CSTA). Both Ca-074-Me and CSTA sterically block access to the active site cysteine of CTSB. We found that overexpression of CSTA in CAR T cells significantly reduced CTSB activity and reduced antigen transfer. CSTA overexpression minimized antigen loss on tumor cells, indicating that CTSB inhibition blocks CMT early during the trogocytic process. CSTA overexpression reduced CAR T cell exhaustion but did not alter their expansion, tumor cell killing, or phenotype, indicating that this approach selectively inhibits CMT. Next, we assessed the effect of CSTA overexpression on CAR T cell persistence in vivo. NALM6 tumor-bearing NSG mice were injected with conventional or CSTA-overexpressing CD19 CAR T cells. Four weeks after CAR T cell injection, we observed substantially increased CAR T cell numbers in the blood (10.6x, p=0.0317), bone marrow (7.3x, p=0.0159), and spleens (5.6x, p=0.0556) of mice treated with CSTA-overexpressing CAR T cells. Taken together, we provide the first experimental evidence that CMT directly causes fratricide and exhaustion, reducing CAR T cell persistence. We demonstrate that CMT can be targeted efficiently by overexpressing the CTSB inhibitor CSTA in CAR T cells, resulting in substantially increased CAR T cell persistence. This represents a promising approach to improve CAR T cell efficacy and limit the occurrence of relapse in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Of note, on-target, off-tumor toxicity is one adverse effect that continues to limit the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cells and has even led to life-threatening or fatal outcomes in patients (Morgan et al. 2010.). To address this, we have developed a unique, codon-based approach by replacing strategically selected codons within CAR non-antigen binding domains with their rare synonymous isoforms. Hoekema et al. (1987) reported the ability of synonymous rare codons to alter gene and protein expression in other model systems. In CAR-T cells, we aim to use this novel, codon-based approach to fine tune and modulate CAR-T cell expression and function to elicit full on-tumor activity while lessening off-tumor toxicity.<br \/>In our approach, we replaced specific endogenous codons within the non-antigen binding domains of Hu8F4-CAR, a TCR-like 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CAR developed by our group which targets the leukemia-associated antigen PR1\/HLA-A2 (Ma et al. 2016.). Briefly, we created variants of Hu8F4-CAR containing rare codon substitutions in two subtypes: intracellular-based (type 1) and combined extracellular- and intracellular-based (type 2). Each variant subtype (type 1 or 2) had either between 6 and 30 or 27 and 57 rare codons introduced, respectively. Expression profiling and functional assessment of the Hu8F4-CAR variants was assessed in the Jurkat mutant cell line (J.RT3-T3.5) or human primary healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were enriched for T cells, respectively. Expression profiling results show that surface expression is reduced in J.RT3-T3.5 cells when assessed by flow cytometry by 1-1.5-fold compared to unmodified Hu8F4-CAR. When evaluated by immunoblotting, novel lower molecular weight bands emerge only in rare codon-modified variants, suggesting that rare codons may have altered translational or post-translational processing leading to truncated CAR protein isoforms (30, 45, or 60kDa vs 73kDa for unmodified Hu8F4-CAR), which may contribute to reduced cell surface CAR expression. Furthermore, we have conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> functional testing of the rare codon-modified variants and show reduced activity against non-malignant off-tumor targets that express PR1 and\/or HLA-A2 including healthy donor PBMCs, mobilized hematopoietic cells, and bone marrow. Importantly, in addition to reduced off-tumor activity against healthy myeloid cells, rare codon-modified variants preserve their activity against on-tumor target cells, including the U937-A2+ cell line and primary acute myeloid leukemia. Altogether, these results suggest that our approach can modulate CAR expression and functionality creating a novel methodology to reduce the likelihood of off-tumor adverse effects typically associated with CAR therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Acute myeloid leukemia,Codon engineering,Adoptive immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Increased memory formation and mitochondrial capacity, particularly in the CD4+ subset, have been linked to improved CART cell function and enhanced <i>in vivo<\/i> persistence, leading to long-term relapse-free survival. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor responsible for promoting metabolic efficiency and T cell memory formation. We have previously demonstrated AMPK activity can be increased in human T cells via overexpression of the AMPK&#947;2 domain. We hypothesized that overexpression of AMPK&#947;2 in CART cells would enhance their metabolic capacity and improve their anti-leukemia function.<br \/>Methods: Human CART cells bearing a CD19-CAR utilizing a 41BB costimulatory domain were generated from healthy human donors via lentiviral transduction and co-transduced with AMPK&#947;2 (AMPK) or an empty vector (EV) control. Flow sorting for the co-transduced populations yielded &#62;95% CD4+ CART cells.

Therefore, understanding mechanisms of CAR T cell killing is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Cytolysis of CAR T cell targets presumably involves recognition of CD19 antigen by the CAR followed by activation of the granzyme\/perforin axis. However, bystander elimination of CD19-negative lymphoma cells by CAR T cells has been reported, indicating that an alternative pathway may be required for optimal killing. Through in-depth phenotyping of a large panel of human DLBCLs and <i>in vitro<\/i> killing assays, we observed that CD19 expression levels on DLBCL cells and vulnerability to CAR T cell killing were weakly correlated. Conversely, cell surface expression of the death receptor, FAS, on DLBCL cells was strongly associated with susceptibility to CAR T cell killing. Although FAS expression across DLBCL cell lines varied, it could be broadly enhanced following exposure to IFN&#947;. Potent CAR T cell-mediated cytolysis of CD19-negative, Fas-positive murine DLBCL cells required the presence of CD19-positive lymphoma cells in the culture. CRISPR\/Cas9 targeting was employed to delete <i>FAS<\/i> and\/or <i>CD19<\/i> in isogenic human DLBCL cells to generate CD19<sup>+<\/sup>FAS<sup>+<\/sup>, CD19<sup>+<\/sup>FAS<sup>-<\/sup>, CD19<sup>-<\/sup>FAS<sup>+<\/sup>, and CD19<sup>-<\/sup>FAS<sup>-<\/sup> subsets, which enabled us to define the extent to which CD19 engagement by the CAR was required to affect killing via FAS.

Double-negative DLBCL cells were poorly killed. This result suggested that CD19 engagement by the CAR was required for optimal DLBCL cell killing via FAS, and that CD19 and FAS need not necessarily be engaged on the same target cell.

As the field evolves to novel target epitopes, longer CAR structures are needed to reach membrane proximal epitopes for improved efficacy. Our approach to reach such epitopes is to have (non-functional) SIRPalpha based extracellular extension, spacer, to our CAR structure. We have shown, in this proof-of-concept study, that stability of the extracellular spacer of a CAR plays a pivotal role to improve in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Various SIRPalpha-based CARs, FiCARs, targeting CD19 was studied for their function. Protein stability of the CD19 CAR structures were characterized and subsequently the killing efficacy of target cells and cytokine release in in vitro as well as in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated.<br \/>Methods &#38; Results: In vitro co-culture assays with primary CD19 CAR T and CD19 positive cancer cells had shown no significant differences between the different spacer containing FiCAR structures. A dose dependent killing efficacy was observed in all the tested structures with up to &#62;90% killing of NALM6 and Raji cells. Comparable results for IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-13 and granzyme B response were seen in co-cultured assay. In the protein stability studies, modifications in the extracellular part of the CAR structure led to an increase in thermal stability (over 2 &#176;C) and reduced\/halted multimer formation. To study the FiCAR T cell function in an in vivo tumor model, NSG mice were injected i.v with Raji cells and few days later mice were injected i.v with FiCAR T cells. Anti-tumor efficacy and overall survival were studied at the end of the study (60 days), the enhanced stability of FiCAR T structure translated into improved anti-tumor efficacy and survival. Interestingly, none of the mice survived in the least stable structure, 40% survival with intermediate stability structures and over 70% survival was observed in most stable structures.<br \/>Conclusion: A stabilized SIRPalpha-based CD19 FiCARs dramatically enhance anti-tumor efficacy and survival in Raji tumor model. The stabilization is critical for improved efficacy, especially in the in vivo setting. This data suggests that, in addition to the length of the CARs stability of the CAR structure appear to play a crucial role in the efficacy of the CAR T cells. The modifications presented here enhanced CD19-targeting CAR T cell efficacy. This approach requires further investigation to improve the efficacy of currently approved CAR T cells, especially CD19-CAR T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"H.

KLN-1010 is a novel treatment for MM currently in preclinical development that uses our iGPS<sup>TM<\/sup> platform, an envelope-modified lentiviral vector particle engineered for specific and efficient in vivo gene delivery, to transduce T cells. T cells modified in vivo by KLN-1010 express a fully human anti-BCMA CAR following a single IV injection without the need for additional treatments or conditioning chemotherapy.<br \/>Results: Human T cells exposed to KLN-1010 in vitro resulted in transduction and expansion of anti-BCMA CAR T cells in a concentration dependent manner. The resulting CAR T cells were highly avid and specific to BCMA-expressing cell lines. KLN-1010 treatment of preclinical mouse models resulted in T cell-specific CAR expression with no evidence of off-target modification including in the lung and liver, except phagocytes. A varied CAR T cell lineage composition was observed that included effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. A single dose of KLN-1010 caused potent anti-tumor efficacy and complete tumor regression in a stringent model that requires high dose levels of ex vivo-cultured CAR T cells similar to those commercially available. When the anti-BCMA CAR molecules used in KLN-1010 are compared in preclinical models to other clinically relevant CARs, we observed superior tumor control by the KLN-1010 anti-BCMA CAR molecules. Clinical application of iGPS technology was modeled in non-human primates (NHP) using an NHP T cell-targeting particle that expresses an anti-CD20 CAR. CAR T cell activity, assessed by B cell depletion, and tolerability were evaluated without prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy across a 10x dose range. Rapid clearance of the iGPS particles from the blood was observed at all dose levels. Even at a low dose of 1.3e8 IU\/kg, potent and durable CAR T cell activity was observed as evidenced by complete B cell depletion lasting over two months. Multiple CAR T cell expansions and contractions were observed during this period. The treatment at all dose levels was highly tolerable with no observed toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, or neurotoxicity.<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate that KLN-1010 is safe and efficacious in preclinical models and may offer greater accessibility than other therapeutic modalities to address an unmet medical need in MM. Without requirements of ex vivo manufacturing, lymphodepletion and inpatient treatment that restrict patient access to therapy, the iGPS technology is well poised to provide significant clinical benefit for a multitude of indications as an off-the-shelf, single dose treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Multiple myeloma,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

We developed four complementary T-cell reprogramming technologies to enhance chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in solid tumors: 1) overexpression of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family transcription factor c-Jun to delay T-cell exhaustion and improve antitumor activity; 2) nuclear receptor subfamily 4A member 3 (NR4A3) gene knockout (KO) to further delay exhaustion and enhance functionality; 3) Epi-R<sup>TM<\/sup> manufacturing protocols to preserve stem-like characteristics; and 4) Stim-R<sup>TM<\/sup> technology, a novel activating reagent to improve product potency compared with standard reagents. LYL119 is an investigational ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell product that combines these technologies to create potent and durable CAR T cells. Healthy or NSCLC patient donor T cells were manufactured with the Epi-R protocols, activated with Stim-R or a standard reagent, and transduced with a vector encoding a ROR1 CAR and c-Jun. The <i>NR4A3<\/i> gene or a control gene was edited using SpyFi<sup>TM<\/sup> Cas9 nuclease (Aldevron&#174;). Cytotoxicity, cytokine production, phenotype, and single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles were evaluated in vitro after antigen restimulation assays designed to promote exhaustion. CAR T cell activity was evaluated in vivo using a ROR1<sup>+<\/sup> NSCLC xenograft mouse model. Research and clinical scale LYL119 products achieved ~90% genome editing efficiency at the <i>NR4A3<\/i> target gene resulting in a 13-fold protein reduction compared to non-edited CAR T cells. LYL119 exhibited superior cytotoxicity and cytokine production upon antigen restimulation across 7 different ROR1<sup>+<\/sup> solid tumor cell lines compared to CAR T cells that lacked one or more reprogramming technologies. After repeated rounds of tumor cell killing, LYL119 displayed reduced surface expression of exhaustion-related receptors (e.g. TIM-3) and higher expression of stemness-related markers (e.g. CD127) compared to non-edited CAR T cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed global downregulation of exhaustion-related gene signatures and retention of unique cell subsets characterized by upregulation of memory and effector-associated gene signatures. LYL119 exhibited robust antitumor efficacy in vivo across a 10-fold dose range, including a very low dose of 1x10<sup>5<\/sup> CAR T cells. Lastly, LYL119 derived from NSCLC patient donor T cells also demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro compared to control CAR T cells. These nonclinical data suggest LYL119, which combines c-Jun overexpression, <i>NR4A3<\/i> KO, Epi-R protocols, and Stim-R technology, can limit exhaustion, maintain stem-like features, and has the potential to provide effective and durable CAR T-cell antitumor activity in patients with ROR1<sup>+<\/sup> solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Solid tumors,Adoptive immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"V.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy targeting GD2 has shown promise in neuroblastoma treatment, but relapses are associated with loss of antigen expression. The selection of the best tumor antigen is critical for the therapeutic success of CAR-T cells in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) receptor is expressed by most neuroblastomas while virtually absent in most normal tissues. ALK is an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma and ALK inhibitors show promising clinical activity. All these features make ALK an attractive target for CAR-T cell therapy. We developed ALK.CAR-T cells that show potent efficacy in monotherapy against neuroblastoma with high ALK expression without toxicity. For neuroblastoma with low ALK expression, combination with ALK inhibitors specifically potentiates ALK.CAR-T cells but not GD2.CAR-T cells. In neuroblastoma cell lines and in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX), the combination of ALK inhibitors and ALK.CAR-T cells significantly reduced tumor growth and extended mice survival. Mechanistically, ALK inhibitors impair tumor growth and upregulate the expression of ALK, thereby facilitating the activity of ALK.CAR-T cells against neuroblastoma. Thus, while neither ALK inhibitors nor ALK.CAR-T cells will likely be sufficient as monotherapy in neuroblastoma with low ALK density, their combination specifically enhances therapeutic efficacy. These findings provide insights into the potential of ALK.CAR-T cells as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma. A Phase I clinical trial to test ALK.CAR-T cells in combination with ALK TKIs in children with refractory\/relapsed neuroblastoma is being implemented based on these results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Neuroblastoma,CAR T cells,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

We have designed a mesothelin (MSLN) CAR T product (OPB-101) which includes a novel promoter (OP1), an optimized CAR, a safety switch, and a CD8&#945;-targeted IL-2\/15 designed cytokine to promote T cell expansion and improve efficacy in solid tumors. Human anti-MSLN binders were optimized for the target using our OUTSPACER<sup>TM<\/sup> library. CAR evaluation was conducted using<i> in vitro<\/i> coculture assays and validated NSG tumor xenograft models. OUTSMART<sup>TM<\/sup> IL-2\/15 was designed to avoid regulatory T cell activation by ablating IL-2R&#945; binding and re-targeted to CD8&#945; to enhance CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell and NK stimulation. EGFRopt<sup>TM<\/sup> was engineered for improved sensitivity to EGFR-targeted immunotherapies. Using 2A polypeptides, all transgenes were expressed with an antigen-dependent, inducible &#8220;stim-on&#8221; promoter (OP1) to regulate CAR expression, cytokine production, and resistance to exhaustion. The efficacy of the OPB-101 construct was tested in stringent exhaustion assays. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy was assessed with mice engrafted with s.c. H1650 tumors that were treated by i.v. injection of mock, CAR only or OPB-101 T cells at doses ranging from 0.25 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> to 2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells. Tumor volume and weight were measured for 80 days. T cell levels and phenotype were measured by peripheral blood (PB) draws and intratumoral analysis (IT; day 14). OPB-101 efficiently killed MSLN<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cell lines in repeat challenge and spheroid assays, and inducibly produced the IL-2\/15 cytokine.<b> <\/b>IL-2\/15 expression did not result in antigen-independent CAR T cell proliferation but extended survival in conditions without exogenous cytokine support. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies showed tumor control at 2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells in the CAR only condition and modest anti-tumor efficacy at the 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> dose. In contrast, OPB-101 demonstrated complete and durable tumor elimination at the lowest dose of 0.25 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells (OPB-101 versus CAR only at 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells, p &#60; 0.0001 and p &#60; 0.0005 for donor 1 and 2, respectively). OPB-101 efficacy was associated with robust expansion in the PB (&#62;100-fold) within IT (&#62;5-fold) compared to the CAR only condition. OPB-101 PB and IT T cells showed reduced levels of PD-1, TIGIT and CD39 compared to CAR only suggesting resistance to exhaustion. Finally, studies conducted in tumor-free mice showed that OPB-101 expansion<i> in vivo<\/i> was dependent on the presence of tumor. In summary, OPB-101 using a regulated promoter (OP1) to dynamically express an optimized MSLN CAR, EGFRopt<sup>TM<\/sup>, and a CD8-targeted IL-2\/15 cytokine enhances anti-tumor efficacy against solid tumors by promoting CAR expansion and persistence while limiting T cell exhaustion. These technologies allow for complete elimination of solid tumors at a low treatment dose (i.e., &#60;250K cells) and may pave the way to more effective CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Cytokines,Mesothelin,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Strategies to improve CAR-T cell therapy efficacy include enhancing intrinsic effector function while preventing T cell exhaustion. The ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, is a key negative regulator of the NF-kB pathway downstream of T cell receptor activation in T cells. Dysfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors have high expression of A20, and deletion of A20 enhances antitumor activity of CD8 T cells in murine tumor models. We tested whether CRISPR-mediated knock-out (KO) of tumor necrosis factor &#945;-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), the gene for A20, increases the effector function and alters the metabolic state of CAR-T cells.<b> <\/b><br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>A20 deletion led to upregulation of NF-&#954;B target genes and resulted in higher levels of activation marker expression and effector cytokine secretion compared to unarmored CAR-T upon incubation with target cells. In addition, A20 KO CAR-T cells maintained prolonged expression of activation markers upon antigen clearance in the absence of enhanced differentiation, and were more resistant to dysfunction in a repeat challenge serial kill assay. <i>In vivo<\/i>, A20 deficient CAR-T exhibited increased anti-tumor efficacy against low, medium, and high target expressing tumor models. Consistent with NF-&#954;B upregulation, A20 KO cells significantly upregulated key glycolytic intermediates suggesting that amino acid anabolism was fueled by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Moreover, the preferential increase of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation confirmed that A20 KO CAR-T cells were skewed towards an effector-like phenotype. Notably, glutathione and its cysteine-glycine bi-products were upregulated upon activation to a higher level in A20 KO CAR-T suggesting enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, in line with their prolonged persistence.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>CRISPR-mediated knock-out of A20 lowers the activation threshold of CAR-T cells producing enhanced <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy particularly against tumors with very low levels of target expression. A20 KO induces metabolic rewiring of CAR-T cells by promoting glycolysis and amino acid anabolism to sustain their superior effector functions. This intrinsic armoring strategy can be applied to any CAR-T in any indication to increase tumor control and reduce immune escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,A20,Metabolism,Efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Given that durable clinical response can be achieved without CAR T cell persistence, we hypothesized that durable remission is correlated with the expansion of tumor-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR) clones following CAR T-cell infusion. To assess this, we examined the TCR repertoire of adult pts with B-NHL who received CD19 CAR T-cell (axi-cel) therapy to identify correlates of clinical response.<br \/><i>Methods<\/i>: Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (seq) and scTCR-seq were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-NHL pts before lymphodepletion chemotherapy (pre), at peak CAR-T expansion (peak), and one month following CAR-T (M1). scRNAseq and scTCR-seq data were processed using CellRanger v7.0.1, which were then analyzed using Immunarch (v0.9.0) for TCR clonality and sample diversity. Diversity was assessed using the Gini coefficient to indicate clone size inequality (0 = maximum diversity). TCR diversity and phenotype of expanded and emerged TCR clones post CAR-T were compared across clinical response categories: CR (complete remission for at least 6 months), PD1 (primary refractory), and PD2 (relapsed after partial or complete response).<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: We analyzed 107,035 T cells from 77 serial samples of 32 pts (16 CR, 4 PD1, 12 PD2) and 5 healthy controls. Compared to pts with PD1 and PD2, pts with CR had a larger Gini coefficient for TCR clones at M1 relative to Pre and Peak. The Gini coefficient was the largest for tumor recirculating CD8 T effector memory (Tem) and activated CD8 peripheral memory (Tpm) cells at M1 for pts with CR. Examining the repertoire of emerged and expanded TCR clones at Peak and M1 from Pre, pts with PD2, compared to pts with CR, had a higher percentage of activated CD8 T peripheral memory (Tpm) and T regulatory cells (Treg) among the emerged clones and activated CD8 Tpm among the expanded clones. Patients with PD1, relative to patients with CR, had more proliferating and non-activated CD8 Tpm among the expanded and emerged clones.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: NHL pts with CR after CAR-T had more robust clonal expansion of T cells, particularly tumor recirculating CD8 Tem and activated CD8 Tpm, compared to pts with relapsed or refractory disease. In contrast, pts with relapsed or refractory disease had an expansion of TCR clones with a larger proportion of CD8 Tpm and Tregs. Endogenous tumor-reactive TCR expansion may help predict favorable clinical response following CAR T-cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,T cell,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Though many autoimmune diseases, like Graves&#8217; Disease (GD), don&#8217;t have treatments that address this risk. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are an effective treatment for hematological cancers by eliminating all B cells, but a more targeted form of CAR T cells could eliminate specific B cell populations in B cell malignancies, including GD.<br \/>Methods: To allow our CAR T cells to target specific B cell populations that cause GD, we engineered chimeric autoantigen receptors (CAAR) with epitopes of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) as the binding domain. This acts as bait for the anti-TSHR B cells. Jurkat T cells were lentivirally transduced with these CAAR plasmids. Anti-TSHR B cell lines were engineered by transducing Nalm6 cells with lentivirus for anti-TSHR B cell receptors. Cytotoxicity assays were performed on primary human TSHR CAAR T cells incubated with the anti-TSHR B cell lines. Cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays were performed on these coincubated cells to determine the efficacy of our TSHR CAAR T cells.<br \/>Results: Two of the three Jurkat TSHR CAAR T cells showed significant binding to anti-TSHR antibodies (TRAbs). They also showed significant activation, measured by CD69 expression, when incubated with plate bound TRAbs, but not soluble TRAbs. The B cell lines were validated by binding to TSHR. The primary TSHR CAAR T cells showed significantly increased proliferation and production of TNF, IFN-y, and IL-2, when compared with controls. The TSHR CAAR T cells also had significant cytotoxic action against the anti-TSHR B cell lines, but not Nalm6 B cells. The cytotoxic function was comparable to our CD19 CAR T cell with the same activation domains, though it demonstrated specificity to only anti-TSHR B cells.<br \/>Conclusion: TSHR CAAR T cells are a potentially curative treatment for GD that will stop chronic inflammation and could reduce GD patient&#8217;s risk of developing thyroid cancer. This is also an important development in CAR T cell therapies that allows for specific targeting of certain B cell populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Inflammation,Immunotherapy,Autoantibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Abiagil Cheever<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hunter Lindsay<sup><\/sup>, MacKenzie Hansen<sup><\/sup>, Chloe Kang<sup><\/sup>, K.

This highlights the need to develop novel CAR-T cell approaches for this disease. CD70 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Although absent on normal brain tissue, it is ectopically expressed in a substantial fraction of GB patients, indicating its suitability as a CAR-T cell therapy candidate. In this study, we generated CD70-targeting CAR-T cells and tested their cytotoxicity <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>. First, we detected CD70 in a panel of primary GB cell lines and to investigate its role, it was overexpressed in human and murine GB cells. In a syngeneic glioma model, C57BL\/6J mice injected with CD70-overexpressing GL261 cells developed significantly larger tumors compared to the control counterparts. Additionally, RNA-sequencing revealed that CD70-overexpression in the same cells led to higher expression levels of immunosuppressive marker <i>CD200<\/i> and lower levels of tumor inhibition genes <i>Prkg2<\/i> and <i>Sh3bgrl2<\/i>, suggesting a tumor-promoting role in GB. For our immunotherapeutic intervention, we designed CD70-targeting CAR-T cell constructs featuring different co-stimulatory domains (CD27, CD28 or 4-1BB) and successfully transduced primary T-Cells from healthy donors. In an <i>in vitro<\/i> co-culture, all CAR-T cells recognized and eliminated primary cancer cells in a target-dependent and donor-independent manner, while secreting high levels of Granzyme B. The killing capacity of these cells was further highlighted in a 3D system in which <i>in vitro<\/i>-generated cortical organoids were treated with CAR-T cells after being infiltrated by CD70-expressing or control cells. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed increased levels of Granzyme B and IFN-&#947; in all treated organoids previously infiltrated by CD70<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. Importantly, generated CAR-T cells showed high specificity and efficiency in killing CD70<sup>+<\/sup> tumors <i>in vivo <\/i>in the brains of immunodeficient mice. Namely, 80% of NSG mice orthotopically implanted with CD70<sup>+<\/sup> GB cells and subsequently treated by CARs but not mock-transduced T-Cells showed complete tumor remission by the end of the experimental endpoint, determined by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). IF analysis of these brains showed high levels of apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3, enhanced effector cell presence and significantly lower tumor cell occupancy compared to control-treated animals. In conclusion, we provide evidence in favor of utilization of CAR-T cells against CD70-expressing gliomas. Based on these findings, a phase-I clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous CD70-specific CAR-T cells for relapsed CD70<sup>+<\/sup> GB is being planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Glioblastoma,Immunotherapy,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandros Kourtesakis<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hiu Nam Hannah Chow<sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis Alexander Agardy<sup>2<\/sup>, Eileen Bailey<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandra Horschitz<sup>3<\/sup>, Ammar Jabali<sup>3<\/sup>, Rainer Will<sup>4<\/sup>, Denise Reibold<sup>1<\/sup>, Sonja Pusch<sup>1<\/sup>, Christoph Schifflers<sup>5<\/sup>, Manuel Fischer<sup>6<\/sup>, Ling Hai<sup>1<\/sup>, Dirk C.

To begin to address the lack of therapeutic options for CRC, we have developed a CAR-T cell therapy specific for leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). LGR5 is known to potentiate Wnt\/&#914;-catenin signaling and mark cells-of-origin in intestinal cancers. Extensive screening has demonstrated elevated expression of LGR5 in CRC, which is correlated with reduced patient survival. In CRC, LGR5 has been intimately linked with metastasis, cell survival and perturbation of chemotherapeutic interventions. We have developed a 9-day preclinical manufacturing method to generate LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells with a minimally differentiated T cell phenotype, which was concomitant with significant cytotoxic and activation marker expression. In human CRC xenograft mouse models, LGR5-targeting CAR-T cells eradicated tumors at doses as low as 800,000 CAR<sup>+<\/sup> cells, and were capable of significantly inhibiting advanced tumor growth following delayed administration. Robust CAR-T cell-mediated immunological protection was observed in rechallenge experiments, in which secondary tumor growth was undetectable in mice which had tumors rejected following previous CAR-T cell administration.

The mechanism for this remains unknown. Lymphodepletion (LD) is considered critical for CART cell therapy success, yet emergency myelopoiesis during recovery from LD may induce a surge of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), particularly in patients with advanced cancer. BTK inhibition has been shown to inhibit MDSC function in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that administration of ibrutinib during and following LD could reduce MDSC-mediated suppression of CART cells and thereby improve CART cell outcomes.<br \/>Methods: To explore the effects of ibrutinib on human MDSCs, we engineered suppressive monocytes through <i>in vitro <\/i>culture of CD14+ cells in the presence of IL-6 and GM-CSF. We added ibrutinib to the culture on Days 0-4 and compared the ability of the monocytes to inhibit proliferation of human CAR-T cells. To model CLL treatment with CART in immunocompetent mice, we used the Em-<i>TCL1<\/i> adaptive transfer model of CLL. Mice were treated with ibrutinib (I), cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (FC), or ibrutinib + FC (FC+I). MDSCs were isolated from these mice for <i>in vitro <\/i>function studies. In subsequent experiments mice were also treated with syngeneic CART19 with or without FC or FC+I.<br \/>Results: <i>In vitro<\/i> generated human MDSC suppressed CART19 function, and this was prevented by pre-treatment of MDSC with ibrutinib. Myeloid cells from the spleens of CLL-bearing mice inhibited syngeneic CART19 function <i>ex vivo<\/i> regardless of treatment with FC or I alone, but myeloid cells harvested from CLL-bearing mice treated with FC+I lost suppressive function. Finally, mice treated with CART19 after a LD regimen resembling that in our recently reported clinical trial (FC+I) showed a survival advantage over all other groups.<br \/>Conclusions: BTK inhibition with ibrutinib prevents myeloid cell suppression of CART cells <i>in vitro <\/i>in human and murine systems. When combined with lymphodepleting chemotherapy (FC), ibrutinib enhances CART cell control of CLL <i>in vivo<\/i>, possibly by preventing MDSC-mediated suppression of CART cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Leukemias,CAR T cells,BTK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

However, systemic delivery of recombinant cytokines or paracrine secretion by CAR T cells can elicit toxicities due to non-specific targeting of the cytokines. Here, we designed immunocytokines with antibodies specific for the invariant linker peptides that join variable domains in the CAR scFv and immunostimulatory cytokines. The immunocytokines were capable of targeting CAR molecules agnostic of target antigen, demonstrating broad applicability without the need for further genetic engineering of CAR therapies, such as co-expression of a surrogate molecule (tEGFR, etc.). The addition of immunocytokines enhanced CAR T cell cytolytic activity and secretion of type I cytokines, even at low concentrations of immunocytokine. In a stringent Nalm6 xenograft model, the addition of immunocytokines delivering IL-12 enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cells and overall survival compared to controls of antibody alone or PBS.

CAR-T cell therapy, successful in hematological cancers, is now being investigated for solid tumors. Finding new CAR-T targets is vital to overcome TNBC's therapeutic constraints.<br \/>Methods: In this study, a Biopanning phage display strategy employing a library of random peptides was utilized to identify potential targets for CAR-T cell therapy against TNBC. Through this approach, Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) emerged as a promising candidate due to its binding affinity to the selected phage clones. Subsequent validation of HSP60 surface expression on TNBC cell lines in comparison to normal cells was conducted using flow cytometry. Concurrently, patient survival data were gathered and analyzed to evaluate the clinical significance of HSP60 expression in TNBC. The identified peptides demonstrating high specificity and affinity for HSP60 on the surface of TNBC cells were chosen for the development of a third-generation CAR-T model, incorporating various optimizations and innovations.<br \/>Results: The Biopanning strategy successfully identified HSP60 as a prominent target for CAR-T cell therapy in TNBC. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed significantly elevated surface expression of HSP60 on TNBC cell lines compared to their normal counterparts, substantiating its potential as an accessible antigen for targeted therapy. Patient survival analysis linked elevated HSP60 levels with poorer prognosis in TNBC, highlighting the protein's clinical relevance. Peptides showing high specificity and binding to TNBC's HSP60 were integrated into a meticulously engineered third-gen CAR-T cell model. This design aimed to boost the CAR-T's precision in targeting and eliminating HSP60-expressing TNBC cells. Iterative optimizations ensured the construct's accuracy, laying the groundwork for a potent, tailored TNBC immunotherapy.<br \/>Discussion: The discovery of HSP60 as a prime target for CAR-T cell therapy in TNBC is a pivotal advancement. Its distinct presence on TNBC cell surfaces, confirmed via flow cytometry, highlights its suitability for targeted immunotherapy. The correlation between elevated HSP60 levels and poorer prognosis in TNBC patients underscores its value as both a biomarker and a therapeutic focus. The peptides' exceptional specificity and strong binding to HSP60 validate their use in crafting a third-generation CAR-T cell model. Their integration and careful refinements in CAR-T design aim to optimize efficacy while reducing off-target effects, laying a robust foundation for tailored TNBC immunotherapy. Preclinical evaluations are imperative to thoroughly assess the safety and effectiveness of this innovative CAR-T approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immunotherapy,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Here, we explore the functional drivers of post-treatment recurrent GBM. By conducting genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in patient-derived GBM models, we uncover distinct genetic dependencies in recurrent tumor cells that were absent in their patient-matched primary predecessors, accompanied by increased mutational burden and differential transcript and protein expression. These analyses map a multilayered genetic response to drive tumor recurrence, identifying protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A2 (<i>PTP4A2)<\/i> as a novel modulator of self-renewal, proliferation and tumorigenicity at GBM recurrence. Genetic perturbation or small molecule inhibition of PTP4A2 represses axon guidance activity through a dephosphorylation axis with roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1), exploiting a functional dependency on ROBO signaling. Importantly, engineered anti-ROBO1 single-domain antibodies also mimic effects of PTP4A2 inhibition. Since a pan-PTP4A inhibitor was limited by poor penetrance across the blood brain barrier (BBB) <i>in vivo<\/i>, a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy was engineered against ROBO1 that elicits specific and potent anti-tumor responses <i>in vivo<\/i>. A single dose of anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cells doubles median survival in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of recurrent glioblastoma, and also eradicates tumors in around 50% of mice engrafted with PDX models of lung-to-brain metastases and pediatric relapsed medulloblastoma. We conclude that functional reprogramming drives tumorigenicity and dependence on a multi-targetable PTP4A-ROBO1 signaling axis at GBM recurrence, with potential in other malignant brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,CRISPR\/Cas9,CAR T cells,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Although significant progress has been made in improving survival in mPCa patients, many of these patients experience relapse or systemic toxicities. Protein expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a common PCa antigen often targeted in PCa therapy, is unfortunately lost in the later stages of mPCa. In contrast, six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 and 2 (STEAP1 and STEAP2) are both overexpressed in most PCa compared to normal and vital organs and has emerged as a next-generation target in mPCa.<br \/>We hypothesize that an antibody that binds to both STEAP1 and STEAP2 via their second extracellular domain (60% homology) could be useful therapeutically. Using an immunogen of this second extracellular domain, we raised several antibody clones that appear to have an affinity towards both STEAP1 and STEAP2 (STEAP1\/2). The specificity and affinity of these antibody clones were successfully determined by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and ELISA. Immunofluorescence results in PCa cell lines and those that overexpress STEAP1 and STEAP2 demonstrate the potential specificity of one clone for human STEAP1 and STEAP2. In addition, ELISA data revealed that the binding affinity of this clone to STEAP1 and STEAP2 is in the low nanomolar and low micromolar range, respectively. This monoclonal STEAP1\/2 antibody has been sequenced and will become the basis for future development of immunotherapies thus expanding the therapeutic armamentarium for mPCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Prostate cancer,Bispecific antibody,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Furthermore, a concomitant elevation in the levels of effector cytokines, TNF-&#945; and IFN-&#947;, was detected in the blood of treated mice demonstrating the functional capacity of the CAR T cells to not only persist but also to maintain an activated state.<br \/>Conclusions: hYP218 CAR T cells show anti-tumor efficacy against gastric and colorectal tumor xenografts due to increased accumulation of activated CAR T cells in the tumor and warrants further investigation for treatment of patients with these cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Mesothelin,Gastric cancer,Colorectal Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.
