However, accurate inference of their coevolution from bulk DNA sequencing is challenging. We present ALPACA (ALlele-specific Phylogenetic Analysis of clone Copy number Alterations), a novel algorithm to allow the practical inference of SNV and SCNA coevolution. ALPACA is framed as an optimisation problem, that takes as input bulk tumor sample copy number mixtures and the tumor phylogenetic tree constructed from SNVs, and deconvolves the optimal, allele-specific integer copy number profiles for every distinct clone present in the tumor. To circumvent the challenge of joint SNV\/SCNA inference, we postulate that in high mutation burden tumors all relevant SCNA clones are identifiable by their unique SNVs, hence ALPACA leverages phylogenetic trees constructed from bulk tumor sequencing data using SNVs. Secondly, to restrict the clone-specific copy number search space, ALPACA leverages constraints imposed by multisample sequencing, specifically in cases where clones are present across multiple samples or clones from different samples are phylogenetically related. Finally, ALPACA relies on parsimony and biologically informed constraints to further guide the deconvolution process.<br \/>We demonstrate that ALPACA infers the copy number evolution of complex simulated tumors with higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods. We apply ALPACA to the large, multisample non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort from the recent longitudinal, prospective TRACERx421 study, and show that ALPACA uncovers loss of heterozygosity and amplification events in minor subclones that were previously missed using standard approaches. ALPACA's assignment of SCNA driver events to branches of the phylogenetic tree reveals the evolutionary ordering of SNVs and SCNAs during NSCLC tumor evolution, such as late focal amplifications affecting the TERT gene locus occurring in subclones which expand and dominate a tumor sample. ALPACA enables an in-depth analysis of the coevolution of mutations and SCNAs in the tumor&#8217;s evolutionary history, revealing distinct patterns of copy number evolution. Notably, ALPACA identifies common patterns of copy number changes across the genome characterizing metastatic seeding clones, revealing that they harbor an increased number of SCNAs compared to clones that do not metastasize. Additionally, ALPACA uncovers subclonal enrichment for CCND1 amplification in primary tumor subclones that seed metastasis, and an overall increase of SCNA events occurring in both tumors with polyclonal seeding and extrathoracic metastases.<br \/>Clone-level results obtained with ALPACA can offer new clinical insights and enable new types of analysis, e.g. copy number signature analysis including temporal order of SCNA acquisition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Computational Modelling,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

However, although genomic loss of HLA is frequent in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in some types of breast cancer, the extent and importance of transcriptomic disruption to HLA presentation, including transcript repression and alternative splicing (AS), remains unclear. To address this, we developed MHC Hammer, a tool to call HLA allele-specific mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), transcriptional repression, and alternative splicing.<br \/>We first assessed HLA allelic expression and the prevalence of AS in normal tissue. Applying MHC Hammer to 510 normal lung samples and 407 normal breast samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression cohort, we identified extensive heterogeneity in HLA allelic expression depending on both the allele and tissue type. In addition, HLA allelic AS, occurring in at least 20% of the allele transcripts, was observed in 19% of normal lung and 13% of normal breast samples.<br \/>Next, we applied MHC Hammer to 413 TRACERx NSCLCs and 743 TCGA breast tumours. While mutations were uncommon, HLA LOH was a frequent event, occurring in 32% of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and 57% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC). We observed a similar rate of HLA LOH in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) tumors (ER+: 14%, ER-: 15%), while in triple negative breast tumours we observed a higher rate of LOH (31%). Due to the heterogeneity in HLA expression observed in the normal samples, to measure tumor specific HLA repression and alternative splicing, we restricted our analysis to tumours with WES, tumor and tumor-adjacent normal RNAseq data. This resulted in a cohort of 88 NSCLCs from the TRACERx study as well as 44 ER+ breast tumours from the TCGA cohort. 61% of LUAD, 75% of LUSC and 35% of ER+ tumours harbored class I HLA transcriptional repression that could not be explained by underlying genomic loss. 27% of LUAD, 7% of LUSC and 55% of ER+ breast tumor patients exhibited no HLA disruption. Tumor specific AS affecting HLA exons 2, 3 or 4, potentially disrupting HLA antigen presentation, was identified in 8% of LUADs, 11% of LUSC and 7% of ER+ breast tumours. Tumor specific AS of exon 5, yielding soluble HLA molecules without a transmembrane domain was identified in 20% of LUAD, 14% of LUSCs and 18% of ER+ breast tumours.<br \/>LUAD and LUSC tumor regions without HLA LOH or repression were enriched for somatic HLA AS events and alleles with somatic HLA AS had a higher neoantigen burden than those without. We found no relationship between survival and HLA expression or AS in the normal tissue. However, consistent with the importance of HLA dysfunction in tumor evolution, LUADs with low HLA expression in at least one tumor region were associated with shorter disease-free survival, HLA LOH was more common in LUAD&#8217;s that metastasized and HLA repression was enriched in LUSC primary regions seeding metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HLA class I,Immune response,Lung cancer,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Many key TSGs accordingly exhibit near universal biallelic loss in associated cancers (e.g., APC in colorectal cancer and RB1 in retinoblastoma). However, because the majority of large-scale cancer genomics studies have utilized non-allele-specific copy number analysis methods, neither the extent of biallelic inactivation across TSGs, nor patterns of selective pressure for biallelic inactivation of TSGs, nor the functional and translational consequences of biallelic inactivation, are well-understood.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Here, through allele-specific analysis of sequencing data from 48,179 cancer patients, we define the prevalence, selective pressure for, and functional consequences of biallelic inactivation across TSGs. We classify TSGs according to their patterns of selection for or against biallelic inactivation across cancer types. Finally, we investigate in detail the association of biallelic status with gene expression and clinical outcome for two TSGs, KEAP1 (in lung adenocarcinoma) and APC (in lung and prostate adenocarcinoma).<br \/><b><\/b><b> <\/b><b>Results: <\/b>TSGs largely assort into distinct classes associated with either pan-cancer (Class I) or lineage-specific (Class II) patterns of biallelic loss, while some TSGs, mostly transcription factors, were predominantly monoallelic (Class III\/IV). We discover that gene expression and co-mutation patterns indicate selection for biallelic losses in noncanonical contexts, including <i>APC<\/i> in lung and prostate adenocarcinomas. Selection for biallelic inactivation is also significantly elevated among variants of unknown significance (VUS) of several TSGs, including in <i>KEAP1 <\/i>in lung adenocarcinoma, nominating these VUS as worthy of in depth functional characterization<i>. <\/i>Patients with KEAP1 VUS also show similarly poor survival and response to chemoimmunotherapy to patients with known KEAP1 driver mutations, indicating that <i>KEAP1 <\/i>VUSs phenocopy established <i>KEAP1<\/i> oncogenic alleles, and that zygosity, rather than variant classification, is prognostic of therapeutic response.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>TSGs vary significantly in their patterns of biallelic inactivation, and can be classified according to whether and how consistently, across cancer types, they are selected for loss of both copies. Additionally, taking into account the zygosity of TSG alteration events is often necessary to understand their phenotypic and clinical consequences, and can be useful in identifying novel driver events.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor gene,Carcinogenesis,APC,biallelic inactivation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark  R.

Numerous techniques exist to identify cellular neighborhoods in spatial datasets, however, these techniques are limited in that they either only capture two-dimensional phenomena - and can't describe the full, 3-dimensional tumor volume, or they are restricted to one spatial technology (i.e. IF, 10X Visium, Xenium, MERFISH, etc.). To address this, we developed Mushroom, a tool for identification of three-dimensional cellular neighborhoods in serial-sectioned multi-modal datasets. Mushroom&#8217;s methodology consists of two main steps: 1) registration of multi-modal technologies taken in serial sections (such as multiplex imaging, H&#38;E, or spatial transcriptomics), and 2) identification of 3-dimensional cellular neighborhoods comprising the tissue volume that has been serially sectioned. Keypoint registration is performed with BigWarp, after which the resulting dense displacement field (DDF) is used to register neighboring serial sections - including those from different data modalities. We then implement a neural network to identify three dimensional cellular neighborhoods. The network is a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a vision transformer (VIT) backbone that has been adapted to work with multiple spatial data modalities. Features extracted from the VIT backbone are then clustered to identify cellular neighborhoods unique to each input data type. With 3D neighborhoods in hand, biological questions not answerable in traditional 2D approaches can be investigated, such as z-dimensional changes in morphology and cellular interactions. Further, seamless characterization of cellular neighborhoods by simultaneous technologies at multiple levels of spatial and genomic resolution becomes possible.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Image analysis,Tumor microenvironment,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

We developed an algorithm to stratify patients into MHC-I Reliant and MHC-II Reliant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) responders.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Our algorithm generates patient mean harmonic best rank scores (PHBR) of each neoantigen in a tumor to estimate the proportion of neoantigens that are likely well presented by each MHC complex, given a patient&#8217;s specific HLA alleles. From there, the ratio of neoantigens presented by each MHC (class-I and class-II) can be used to stratify patients into MHC-I or MHC-II Reliant groupings. The primary goals of our study were to investigate tumor immune microenvironment and survival differences between these groups. First, we used CIBERSORTx infiltration estimates of the ratio of these CD4\/CD8 T cell populations across our MHC Reliance categories and by response vs nonresponse in two separate cohorts: Discovery (110) and Validation (77).<br \/>Results: We first observed that the CD4\/CD8 ratio is higher in MHC-II responders than in MHC-I responders (Fig 6. A, P=~0.0057 Discovery; P=0.025 Validation), but no such a difference was found in nonresponders. Using an alternate digital cytometry tool (xCell) we obtained similar results (MHC-II vs MHC-I responders discovery P=0.44; validation P=0.0015) (Fig. S7). We applied an identical methodology to immune-hot ICB-naive cancer samples from TCGA and found that there was a powerful protective effect of the CD4\/CD8 ratio in TCGA MHC-II Reliant patients (Fig S6. HR=-0.76, P=0.0092), there was a significantly harmful effect of that same ratio in TCGA MHC-I Reliant patients (Fig S6 HR=0.59, P=0.0352). These data demonstrate a benefit to having some level of concordance between CD4\/CD8+ T cell infiltration and MHC-II\/MHC-I neoantigen presentability ratios. Since CD4 memory based immune responses have a longer duration of action over more transient CD8 cytotoxic immune responses (cite), we compared the survival of responders in MHC-II vs MHC-I Reliance groups. MHC-II Reliant responders had a significantly longer overall survival in both discovery and validation cohorts (Fig 6. B-C, discovery P=0.0073; validation P=0.0398).<br \/>Conclusions: While neoantigens are already used in ICB stratification in the context of tumor mutational burden, we demonstrate that the balance of which MHC is presenting a set of neoantigens is relevant to immune infiltration and treatment outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MHC II,Microenvironment,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

While the temporal aspects of tumor evolution can be inferred by applying phylogenetic techniques to bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data, the spatial aspects of tumor evolution remain understudied. Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) measures gene expression at thousands of spatial locations in a tumor, but does not directly measure genetic aberrations. Thus, SRT data has not yet been fully utilized for tumor evolution studies. We introduce CalicoST, an algorithm that simultaneously infers allele-specific copy number aberrations (CNAs) and derives a phylogeographic model of tumor evolution from SRT data. By modeling CNA-induced perturbations in both gene expression and allele frequencies, CalicoST identifies important types of CNAs - including copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) and mirrored subclonal CNAs - that are invisible to total copy number analysis. On SRT data from nine patients from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), CalicoST achieves an average accuracy of 86%, approximately 21% higher than existing methods. On two of these patients with multiple adjacent slices, CalicoST reconstructs a tumor phylogeography that describes the spread of cancerous clones in three-dimensional space. CalicoST analysis of multiple SRT slices from a cancerous prostate organ reveals five spatially coherent clones, with mirrored subclonal CNAs distinguishing clones on the two sides of the prostate, and a bifurcating phylogeography in both genetic and physical space that suggests a polyclonal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-07 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Aneuploidy,Allelic imbalance,Spatial transcriptomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Paradoxically, inflammation is believed to play a key role in PDAC development and invasion: patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis have a 13-fold increase in risk of developing PDAC. PDAC cells are surrounded by a dense network of fibrotic tissue containing immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Better understanding of the role of inflammation in PDAC could lead to the design of effective immunotherapies. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is a precursor to PDAC. While most of us will develop PanINs, few of these lesions will progress to invasive cancer. Efforts to determine which PanINs are likely to progress have shown that the size, incidence, and genetic variation of these lesions is high. Here, we add to these efforts through in-depth quantitative analysis of the pancreatic immune microenvironment. CODA is a novel 3D imaging technique used extensively to study the structure, transcriptomic signatures, and genetic heterogeneity of PanINs. In serial histological samples, CODA integrates image registration, cell detection, and segmentation of nine pancreatic structures: PanIN, normal ducts, islets, acini, nerves, vasculature, fat, stroma, and immune aggregates. Through integration with CD45, CD3, and FoxP3 labelled images, we explored immune infiltration in 48 large (cm<sup>3<\/sup>) samples of human pancreas tissues containing &#62;1,000 PanIN lesions to describe spatial correlations between local immune hotspots, 3D tumor morphology, and the surrounding pancreas structures. We quantified inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity in immune response to pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. We determined that this cohort varied greatly in both the number of PanIN (range 3 - 92 per cm<sup>3<\/sup>) and overall immune cell density (range 3,000 - 40,000 immune cells \/ mm<sup>3<\/sup>). We determined that, while PanIN size is not related to local immune cell density, overall PanIN burden is highly correlated to global immune cell density. This suggests that PanIN content does not have a short-range relationship to inflammation, but does have a long-range relationship with pancreatic structures and immune infiltration. As chronic inflammation in the pancreas shows correlation with development of pancreatic cancer, increased knowledge of the heterogeneous, local immune cell environment in precancerous samples will help us determine the role of inflammation in reacting to and controlling malignant progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Pancreatic cancer,Immune response,Tissue mapping,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
