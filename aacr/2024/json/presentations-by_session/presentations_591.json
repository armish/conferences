[{"Abstract":"Single-nucleus joint ATAC- and RNA-sequencing (snMultiome) can be used to identify functionally divergent cell subpopulations based on their transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles within complex samples. Accurate cell type annotation is critical to successful snMultiome data analysis. Several computational methods have been developed for automatic annotation. Traditional cell type annotation methods initially cluster cells using unsupervised learning methods based on the gene expression profiles, then label the clusters using aggregated cluster-level expression profiles and marker genes. These methods rely heavily on the clustering results. As the purity of clusters cannot be guaranteed, false detection of cluster features may lead to incorrect annotations. Further, canonical cell surface markers may not always be suitable to be applied in single-nucleus RNA-seq studies because single-nucleus RNA-seq generally yields lower detected transcript numbers compared to typical single-cell RNA-seq. Moreover, cell type marker genes in the snRNA-seq data may differ from the ones obtained with scRNA-seq data, reflecting biological differences in the cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA pools. Lastly, the data obtained from malignant cells are best left out in establishing cell type reference data because they are too heterogeneous and patient-specific. Reference-based automated algorithms such as SingleR enable quick and unbiased classifications by leveraging a collection of built-in reference data sets for human (e.g. Human Primary Cell Atlas (microarray-based) and the combined Blueprint Epigenomics and Encode data set (RNA-seq-based)). Still, SingleR may return erroneous cell type classifications. Our dataset was generated using the 10x Genomics snMultiome platform to yield 296,557 nuclei from 82 frozen breast tumors, representing patients from diverse genetic ancestral background. Using these data, we sought to improve the accuracy of cell type annotation by SingleR. To achieve this, we first separated malignant and non-malignant cells based on DNA copy number aberrations (aneuploidy) through CopyKAT. For cells determined to be non-malignant, we built the custom reference from snRNA-seq data set, recently made available by The Human Breast Cell Atlas, and then applied singleR with a custom reference where each cell type is represented by single-cells of that type, allowing a well-founded estimate of the confidence with which a cell type call can be made. Using this approach, we successfully identified 11 distinct cell types for non-malignant cells, including fibroblast, adipocyte, pericyte, basal, luminal-secretory, luminal-HR, myeloid, mast, vascular, lymphatic, and T-cells, which can then be further subclassified. Furthermore, we interrogated each cluster using known canonical markers and transferred the cell type labels to snATAC-seq. This approach enabled us to link peaks to genes in each cell type. We believe this new approach that refines SingleR can greatly improve accuracy and minimize misclassification when annotating cell types in breast tumors using snMultiome data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Multiomics,cell type annotation,marker genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

The set of epigenetic footprints of cf-DNA, such as nucleosome organization, end-motifs distribution, fragmentation pattern, and DNA methylation signatures, constitute a key factor in non-tumor-informed liquid biopsies because the epigenetic status is highly tissue-specific and can distinguish cancer types and cancer subtypes. We developed Fragment Analysis for Tumor Evaluation with Artificial Intelligence (Fate-AI). It integrates multiple epigenetic footprints extracted from Low Pass Whole Genome Sequencing to train an encoder-decoder machine learning model performing a multidimensional embedding of the feature along the genome for tumor detection and tissue of origin classification. Peripheral blood plasma samples, 10 mL, from 167 treatment-naive patients with Prostate Cancer (n=35), Lung Cancer (n=33), and Colon Cancer (n=99) were collected in multiple Italian cancer centers. Blood samples from 62 healthy donors were used as controls. In a leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, Fate-AI outperforms state-of-the-art liquid biopsy approaches based on fragmentomics such as DELFI (Cristiano <i>et al.<\/i><i><\/i>, Nature 2019) and GRIFFIN (Doeble et al. Nat. Comm. 2020) (Table 1). The model trained with the fragmentomics features of our cohort was applied to an external colon cancer encompassing 43 tumor samples and 61 healthy cases (Hallermayr et al. J. Hematol. Oncol. 2022), Fate-AI obtained an AUC of 0.923 vs. an AUC of 0.722 for DELFI and 0.695 for GRIFFIN. In conclusion, Fate-AI is a novel, highly accurate AI-based tool that outperforms current genomewide non-tumor-informed cancer detection approaches.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{5374CF7C-E3CA-43CD-BC20-7C69EECF159E}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">AUC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Sensitivity<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Specificity<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fate-AI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DELFI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GRIFFIN<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fate-AI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DELFI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GRIFFIN<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Fate-AI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DELFI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GRIFFIN<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Colon<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.973<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.852<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.82<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.961<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.706<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.902<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.891<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.873<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.582<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.905<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.905<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.884<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.939<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.788<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.97<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.982<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.855<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.661<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prostate<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.992<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.787<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.943<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.943<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.829<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.98<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.639<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.608<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Table 1.

While the multifarious cellular interactions within the TME have been extensively studied with a significant emphasis on immunotherapy, understanding its role in chemotherapy outcome remains less explored. To this end, we present a novel generic computational framework named DECODEM (<u>DE<\/u>coupling <u>C<\/u>ell-type-specific <u>O<\/u>utcomes using <u>DE<\/u>convolution and <u>M<\/u>achine learning). DECODEM facilitates the exploration of the association of cell-type-specific gene expression profiles with the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in treating breast cancer (BC). This approach holds promise for elucidating the nuanced ways in which the TME can modulate therapeutic efficacy, potentially paving the way for more personalized and effective cancer treatments.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> DECODEM employs cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to extract cell-type-specific gene expression profiles within the TME, and subsequently harnesses machine learning to construct cell-type-specific predictors of clinical outcomes. Utilizing DECODEM, we analyzed three publicly available cohorts of HER2-negative BC patients who received NAC. We assessed the predictive capabilities of the individual cell types as well as their collective influence, benchmarking against a state-of-the-art predictor that employs both clinical and transcriptomic features. We corroborated our findings in a single-cell (SC) transcriptomics cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing chemotherapy. Further, we expanded DECODEM to DECODEMi, which accounts for cell-cell interactions (CCIs) among the predominant cell types, offering potential insights into the mechanistic processes governing clinical responses.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our analysis indicated that the heterogeneous composition of the TME is crucial for chemotherapy response prediction in HER2-negative BC, beyond the influence of malignant cells alone. The key insights from our study are as follows:1. Gene expression of immune cells (<i>myeloid<\/i>, <i>plasmablasts<\/i>, <i>B-cells<\/i>) and stromal cells (<i>endothelial<\/i>, <i>normal epithelial<\/i>, <i>cancer-associated fibroblasts<\/i>) displayed comparable-to-superior predictive powers over both bulk expression and the state-of-the-art predictor.2. The predictive accuracy is further augmented by multi-cell-type ensembles, with a triad ensemble comprising <i>endothelial<\/i>, <i>myeloid<\/i>, and <i>plasmablast <\/i>cells achieving the highest predictive accuracy across multiple cohorts.3. DECODEMi can effectively capture the regulatory impact of CCIs (validated in a SC dataset sourced from the SC-TNBC cohort) and has identified novel CCIs likely to influence chemotherapy response in HER2-negative BC.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We provide an unprecedented computational methodology to quantitatively assess the cell-type-specific influences of the TME on clinical outcome. Our analysis offers insights into the complex interactions among TME cells and their correlation with chemotherapy efficacy in HER2-negative BC, thereby enriching the knowledge base of BC treatment effectiveness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Breast cancer,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Saugato Rahman Dhruba<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sahil Sahni<sup>1<\/sup>, Binbin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Di Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yael Schmidt<sup>1<\/sup>, Eldad Shulman<sup>1<\/sup>, Sanju Sinha<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen-John Sammut<sup>3<\/sup>, Carlos Caldas<sup>4<\/sup>, Kun Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Eytan Ruppin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Institute - Cancer Data Science Laboratory (CDSL), Bethesda, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>National Cancer Institute - Laboratory of Pathology, Bethesda, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"211a247a-f788-4e7b-99b3-ef1a5c930d15","ControlNumber":"10758","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

This method pinpoints sets of surface antigens exclusive to cancer cells, utilizing the logical operators \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT.\" Our technique scales to gene combinations of any size and exhibits robust performance across diverse parameter settings. When applied to five breast cancer datasets, this algorithm successfully uncovered triplet antigen combinations superior to current clinical single antigen targets in distinguishing between cancerous and healthy cells.

Applying various deep learning techniques enables the integration and systematic comparison of multi-omics features, allowing robust marker prediction and patient stratification. We extracted mutation and copy number variation data from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium, consisting of 628 primary or recurrent samples. To achieve the patient recurrence classification task, we designed a transformer-based model that learns the genomic profiles and predicts patient recurrence status. Our model outperforms traditional machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and decision trees, for up to 34% and 40% improvement of AUROC and AUPRC, respectively. Including mutational features alone can achieve the best prediction performance, while copy number variations are less informative in predicting patient recurrence status. Our approach is an early attempt that employs deep learning for dissecting the contribution of diverse genomic profiles on glioma recurrence and might provide insights into developing novel therapies for treating glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Multiomics,Glioma,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.-H.

The cancer-immunity cycle (CIC; Chen et al. 2013; Mellman et al. 2023) systematizes the current understanding of the factors (both suppressive and promoting) that together determine the anticancer immune responses. While the CIC is not limited to any single therapeutic modality, the framework is useful for understanding the mechanisms of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) response and resistance. Given its importance in the field, it is critical to be able to systematically examine and expand the CIC (or related frameworks) using new high-throughput data. Here we intersect the CIC framework with a large-scale atlas of single-cell RNA-seq data to provide a window into the CIC factors supported across multiple tumor types.<br \/>Approach. We have previously developed the Single-Cell Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Atlas (ICI Atlas) which in its original version spanned 27 datasets and 1.9 million cells across a range of tumor types and ICI therapies. Motivated by rapid growth of data in the field, here we develop version 2 of the Atlas, over twice as large and consisting of 55 datasets and 4.4 million cells with cross-dataset integration via a transformer-based deep learning model. Of the 55 datasets, 47 contain both pre- and post-treatment samples, 2 contain only pre-treatment samples, and 6 contain only post-treatment samples. The Atlas spans 124 cell types and covers 19 different cancer types as well as 31 treatment strategies including 19 ICI therapies.<br \/>Results. To determine the ICI Atlas support for each factor in the CIC, we analyzed the percent of studies where the factor&#8217;s cell type-specific pre-treatment expression was significantly higher in ICI responders (for promoting factors) or in non-responders (for inhibiting factors). We found that 16 cell type-specific CIC factors (12 promoting and 4 inhibiting) had strong support in the ICI Altas (supported in &#8805; 50% of relevant studies). Specific steps of the CIC were associated with well-supported promoting factors, e.g. Step 2: interferon alpha\/beta signaling pathway (dendritic cells\/APCs, 50-100% of studies); Step 3: TCR signaling pathway (T cells; 58%); Step 5: CXCL9\/10\/11 (macrophages, 50-75%) and CCL5 (T cells, 58%); Step 5a: SELL (T cells, 68%); or inhibiting factors, e.g. Step 5b: IL10 (T cells, 53%). For some factors the support is tissue-specific, e.g. in tumor samples type-I IFN signaling was higher in dendritic cells and monocytes of responders while in blood this was reversed. Interestingly, certain co-stimulatory factors showed higher expression in non-responders (e.g. OX40 in T-cells, 53% of analyses, and 4-1BBL in macrophages, 50%). Our analysis also identifies a number of new factors whose expression is associated with response to ICI across the majority of ICI Atlas studies, providing opportunities for expanding current knowledge of cancer-immune system interplay and ICI response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Single cell,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"P.

Endoscopic surveillance is recommended to distinguish non-dysplastic BE (NDBE), low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD), or adenocarcinoma (EAC) for endoscopic intervention. However, this paradigm is limited by sampling error, leading to missed\/interval EAC. Herein, we aimed to classify these samples more accurately by performing whole genome methylation sequencing (WGMS) and utilizing multiple genomic features on endoscopic brush samples.<br \/><b>Materials and methods: <\/b>Endoscopic brush samples from patients with NDBE (n=18), HGD (18), EAC (18), and normal controls (18) were collected and underwent WGMS (discovery dataset). Sequence reads were processed through internal pipeline to extract CpG methylation and read level methylation ratio (alpha value). Copy number aberration (CNA) detection was performed using both CNVkit and ichorCNA. Differential methylated regions (DMRs) were identified through comparing EAC\/HGD with NDBE and normal samples. Targeted methylation sequencing for selected DMRs and shallow WGMS were performed on EAC (41), HGD (26), LGD (23), NDBE (42), and normal controls (37) as validation. Ratio of the reads with alpha value&#62;0.6 for each DMR was used for further analysis. Detected CNA segments were summarized into chromosome arm loss or gain (aneuploidy score or AS representing the number of chromosome arms gained or lost in a sample) and trimmed median absolute deviation (tMAD). Classification models were developed using the discovery set and the best performing one was applied to the validation dataset.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Genome-wide DNA methylation largely segregated different groups of samples as diagnosed; however, some unexpected group crossings were observed. Top 200 DMRs were identified between EAC\/HGD and NDBE and normal samples. CNA changes were widespread in EAC, very common in HGD but rare in NDBE (17\/18 EACs,14\/18 HGDs, 5\/18 NDBEs with AS&#62;0). With tMAD &#62; 0.015, 16\/18 EACs, 8\/18 HGDs but none of 18 NDBEs passed the threshold. EAC or HGD samples without detectable CNAs had very low &#8220;tumor&#8221; fraction as determined by methylation-based cell type deconvolution or ichorCNA. Similar results were found in the validation dataset. A multi-omics (AS, tMAD, estimated tumor fraction, and DMR methylation) model could predict EAC, HGD, or NDBE with 0.81 accuracy through cross validation (10X) and 0.73 in the independent dataset. This increased to 0.98 and 0.90 in separating high risk EAC\/HGD from NDBE, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Multi-omics data obtained from single WGMS allow for a comprehensive analysis of BE samples with varying dysplasia levels. Using classification modeling, these characteristics can be effectively used to accurately identify and distinguish between EAC and HGD from NDBE, suggesting their utility as adjuncts to endoscopic surveillance biopsies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Diagnostic marker,Methylation,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Despite the initial response, many patients often develop acquired resistance. Resistance to MAPKi could be linked to various altered signaling pathways, including reactivation of the MAPK pathway, activation of alternative survival pathways like PI3K\/PTEN\/AKT, engagement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as PDGFR&#946; and EGFR, and developmental pathways. While numerous omics studies have aimed to understand the mechanism of acquired resistance, how these pathways are altered remains elusive.<b><i> <\/i><\/b>To gain further insights into the acquired MAPKi resistance in melanoma, we explored the role of RNA splicing events in this context by analyzing publicly available datasets of pre- and post-MAPKi treated melanoma from patients and <i>in vitro<\/i> studies using cell lines. We investigated the differential transcript usage (DTU) to detect the specific splice variants that are altered during the development of resistance.<b><i> <\/i><\/b>We find that the genes involving DTU are enriched in various pathways related to MAPKi resistance, such as the MAPKi signaling pathway, PI3K\/AKT pathway, signaling by RTKs, etc. Furthermore, the DTU-centered analysis provides better insights into MAPKi resistance mechanisms compared to standard differential gene expression analysis. Next, we analyzed the developmental splicing signatures during MAPKi resistance development, revealing developmental reprogramming as a key factor in MAPKi resistance. Further, we identified the top 10 transcription factors as potential upstream regulators of the perturbed transcripts, among which five have been previously reported to be involved in various stages of embryonic development. This finding suggests a link between the reactivation of developmental pathways and MAPKi resistance development. Further, by analyzing MAPKi-treated melanoma cell-line models at different time points, such as no-treatment, on-treatment, and at the resistant stage, we observed significant alterations in transcript isoforms during the development of resistance. These changes involve lipid metabolic reprogramming and PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling, providing further insights into the mechanisms of MAPKi resistance. Our study also uncovers a global shift in transcript profiles towards shorter 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; UTRs in response to MAPKi treatment, suggesting the existence of a master regulatory mechanism influencing global splicing changes during therapy resistance. In summary, our study deciphered the post-transcriptional mechanism coordinating the signaling changes, underscoring the complexity of MAPKi resistance in melanoma, as revealed by the joint analysis of both transcript alterations and splicing events.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Splice variants,Resistance,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Sumit Mukherjee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arashdeep Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyunjeong Joo<sup>2<\/sup>, Sumeet Patiyal<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyungsoo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Lipika  R.

The distinct functional mechanisms underlying this &#8220;sidedness&#8221; remain cryptic and poorly understood. Thus, molecular classification of CRC is of paramount in targeting specific subtypes and personalizing treatment for patients. To identify targetable molecular features to improve treatment regimens, we performed multi-faceted network analyses of a large number of CRC patients. In our network model, differential expression of transcript abundance, epigenetic features, and mutational frequency were used to identify widespread gene dysregulation and perturbed pathways to reveal disrupted networks distinct to right or left sided colorectal cancer.

This advancement has led to a growing demand for spatial data analysis tools that enable quick and insightful evaluation. While existing spatial analysis software like Steinbock and SPIAT offer foundational support, effectively managing the high-dimensional and voluminous cellular data to derive meaningful biological insights remains challenging. This is especially true for researchers lacking bioinformatics expertise who seek to conduct quick preliminary evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce iCellSight: a user-friendly, code-free interactive analysis and visualization tool tailored to empower researchers with rapid and intuitive interpretation of in-situ cellular data.<br \/><u>Material and methods<\/u> A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patient tissue section was subjected to staining using COMET (Lunaphore, Switzerland), which automates sequential immunofluorescence staining and imaging of up to 40 protein markers. The stacked image file produced was analyzed with HALO (Indica Labs, USA), which generated cell-level data like cell coordinates, stain intensity values and user-defined cell types. We developed a Shiny App tool, using the Shiny R package, with key features for cell data interpretation: (1) user-input cell number subsampling; (2) dimensional reduction plots with PhenoGraph for unsupervised clustering, allowing a choice of UMAP or t-SNE, and neighbor number selection of 30, 50 or 150; (3) 2D tissue space mapping of PhenoGraph clusters; and (4) heatmap visualizations displaying cluster-wise biomarker expression (with customizable color schemes and scaling), biomarker co-expression, and cluster pair-wise distance.<br \/><u> <\/u> <u>Results<\/u> Using iCellSight, 297,000 cells were detected from the CRC sample, where 27 clusters were identified. We observed 3 distinct clusters from the t-SNE plot that consist of macrophages, granulocytes, and NK cells and monocytes respectively. From the cluster projection in 2D tissue space, the cluster of NK cells and monocytes was found to be densely populated in a particular area of the tumor nest.<br \/><u>Conclusion<\/u> We presented iCellSight, a code-free visualization and analysis tool which streamlines the semi-automated analysis of spatial hyper-plex protein data. Designed with an intuitive user interface, this app enables researchers to efficiently navigate its features without requiring any prior coding expertise. We anticipate that the visualizations and analysis provided by this tool will significantly assist researchers in their data analyses and facilitate the validation of experimental hypotheses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Unsupervised cell phenotyping,Spatial Biology,Tumor-Immune cell profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Yancun Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Felicia Wee<sup>2<\/sup>, Menaka Priyadharsani Rajapakse<sup>3<\/sup>, Esther Gek Wat Teo<sup>4<\/sup>, Nicholas Ang<sup>3<\/sup>, Solomonraj Wilson<sup>3<\/sup>, Zheng Yi Ho<sup>3<\/sup>, Willa Wen-You Yim<sup>2<\/sup>, Li Yen Chong<sup>2<\/sup>, Craig Ryan Joseph<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey Chun Tatt Lim<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhen Wei Neo<sup>2<\/sup>, Chwee Ming Lim<sup>5<\/sup>, Bernett Lee<sup>6<\/sup>, Olaf Rotzschke<sup>3<\/sup>, Joe Yeong<sup>7<\/sup>, <b>Mai Chan Lau<\/b><sup>8<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NUS High School of Math and Science, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>A*STAR - Inst of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), Singapore, Singapore,<sup>3<\/sup>A*STAR -Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Singapore, Singapore,<sup>4<\/sup>Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>5<\/sup>Duke-NUS Medical School, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>6<\/sup>A*STAR - Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Centre for Biomedical Informatics, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>7<\/sup>A*STAR - Inst of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), Department of Anatomical Pathology, Division of Pathology, Academia, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>8<\/sup>A*STAR - Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3b5634c6-c4bc-4baf-9324-531d4552714d","ControlNumber":"9825","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

While numerous computational methods have been developed for analyzing scRNA-seq data, benchmarking various analytical methods remains a key challenge for two reasons. First, there is a lack of ground truth datasets where unambiguous cell type identities are known using external information. Second, simulation of scRNA-seq data tends to be overly artificial and simplistic, which may not well mimic the underlying biological complexity as well as high level of technical variability. Here, we propose the use of <i>crafted experiments<\/i>, a new approach based upon perturbing signals in a real dataset for comparing different scRNA-seq analytical methodologies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of crafted experiments in the context of a novel univariate distribution-oriented suite of feature selection methods, called <i>GOF<\/i> (Goodness of Fit). We show that GOF more frequently selects features that robustly identify crafted artificial clusters in crafted experiments and achieves similar performance compared to the field standard method using real datasets. Importantly, we show the use of crafted experiments for identifying the contexts in which each method performs the best. Crafted experiments offer valuable comparisons of scRNA-seq analysis methods, and the crafted datasets generated from this study provide a useful resource for the single-cell community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Crafted experiment,Robust feature selection,Cell type identification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

MSI, marked by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects characterizes 5-20% of colorectal cancers (CRCs). MSI-H tumors harbor higher mutational burdens, produce neoantigens, and enhance immune recognition and responsiveness to immunotherapy. The innovative Sub-Insight Learning approach of NetraAI, allows us to overcome challenges associated with smaller data sets not reflecting the totality of the disease they represent. This approach utilizes a set of validated mathematical methods to identify sub-insights about patients even from small data sets. This allows the system to decompose the data sets into high and low confidence patient subpopulations, enhancing predictive model accuracy and reducing overfitting. Further, the system explains what variables are driving the etiology defining the subpopulations of patients. Utilizing a small data set consisting of 141 RNA expression profiles of CRC samples (E-GEOD-41258) with MSI-H and MSI-low colon cancer, we were able to derive several unique insights into patients&#8217; molecular profiles. NetraAI analysis identified several unique variables, including <i>CATSPERB, FUT8, PLLP, DUSP4<\/i>, and <i>MLPH<\/i> that may play significant roles in MSI-H colon cancer pathology. These markers hold potential for personalizing clinical trials as well as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks revealed co-expression and co-localizations that exist amongst these genes, suggesting a complex interplay among these genes, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. The application of NetraAI and its Sub-Insight Learning paradigm has revealed novel insights into the molecular profile of MSI-H colon cancer. These findings pave the way for more targeted and effective precision immunotherapy strategies, demonstrating the power of AI in advancing the understanding and treatment of complex cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Conventional ML methods often rely on large data sets for meaningful discoveries. NetraAI is a novel ML approach designed and trained to work with smaller data sets. The challenge with smaller data sets is that they do not reflect the totality of the disease that they represent. NetraAI employs a novel approach termed &#8220;Sub-Insight Learning&#8221;, utilizing validated mathematical methods to analyze even small patient data sets. This allows the system to decompose the data sets into high and low confidence patient subpopulations, enhancing predictive model accuracy and reducing overfitting. Further, the system explains what variables are driving the etiology defining the subpopulations of patients. Using two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) data sets (GSE18842 and GSE10245) consisting of only 104 samples from adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), NetraAI distinguished the two subtypes through unique genetic signatures. Notably, nine of the ten variables identified correlate with known NSCLC markers, with PIGX emerging as a novel target. Leveraging protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) revealed connections between PIGX and BACE1. BACE1 has been implicated as a driver of NSCLC brain metastasis. These findings shed light on the biology of membrane proteins and their post-translational modifications, a factor implicated in various diseases, prompting further exploration. NetraAI demonstrates a significant breakthrough in precision medicine for oncology, capable of generating meaningful insights from small data sets.
