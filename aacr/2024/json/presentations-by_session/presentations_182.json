[{"Abstract":"In Canada, &#62;4,300 children, adolescents and young adults are diagnosed with cancer each year. 1\/3 have refractory\/metastatic disease or will relapse with an expected 5-year survival rate of &#60;15%. The prognosis for most pediatric cancers has stagnated in the past 30 years and Canada trails the US and Europe in providing accessible clinical trials and improved outcomes. Advocacy for change by patients and families led to a federal government investment of $30M in pediatric cancer research. $23M was allocated to establishing a national pediatric cancer consortium. &#8220;ACCESS: advancing childhood cancer experience, science and survivorship&#8221; is the new multi-stakeholder network created with a vision that every Canadian child with cancer has access to the latest scientific advances, diagnostic tools, therapies and supportive care leading to better outcomes and quality of life.<br \/>ACCESS will connect the Canadian pediatric cancer community, build partnerships, leverage research and clinical expertise across cancer types and ages, implement transformative change and create a unified national strategy. To date, &#62;350 clinicians, researchers, policymakers, advocates, people with lived experience (PWLE; patients, families and survivors) and other stakeholders have been engaged, with a goal of representing Canada&#8217;s ethno-cultural, socioeconomic and geographic diversity. ACCESS is building partnerships between children, families, professionals, and existing programs to collaborate in coordinated research and knowledge mobilization. The goal is to implement transformative change in the delivery of fair, fast, effective and safe cancer care for all Canadian children.<br \/>ACCESS has developed a statement of its values that includes patient\/survivor and family centred; collaborative; anti-oppressive; innovation and excellence; accountable. Uniquely, ACCESS is an interdisciplinary and inclusive organization that directly engages and collaborates with PWLE at all levels of research and governance.<br \/>ACCESS is organized into 7 themes that will address gaps, advance research and educate through all phases of the pediatric cancer journey: cancer biology; clinical trials; access to innovative therapies and optimal care; regulation, policy and economics; education and training; ethical, legal, societal implications and implementation science; and psychosocial and survivorship. In addition, there are two cross cutting groups focusing on Knowledge mobilization and Social justice, Indigenization and Inclusion.<br \/>Collaborations with local, provincial, national and international initiatives are being established through the development of a partnership strategy. Cross-consortium priorities are being implemented, and a data management strategy is in development. The publication of a strategic and sustainability plan for ACCESS is anticipated in 2024.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Patient advocacy,Translation,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Despite a historical trend of female underrepresentation on editorial boards of peer-reviewed medical journals, the extent of diversity within oncology's various subspecialties remains less understood. This study aims to elucidate the landscape of gender and economic diversity among editorial boards in three major oncology subspecialties: thoracic, gastrointestinal (GI), and breast oncology.<br \/>Methods: 5 top oncology journals in thoracic, GI, and breast oncology were selected based on 2022 Journal Citation Reports impact factors (Clarivate). Editorial board members, identified from each journal's website, were assessed for economic diversity using the World Bank's 2024 high-income country classification and gender based on academic profile data. Chi-square tests evaluated the gender and economic diversity differences.<br \/>Results: A total of 762 editor positions from 15 journals were analyzed across the 3 subspecialties. In thoracic oncology, 64.6% were men, 33.5% women, with 7.3% from non-high-income countries. In GI oncology, 84.5% were men, 10.5% women, with 11.1% from non-high-income countries. In breast oncology, 59.3% were men, 39.7% women, with 2.8% from non-high-income countries. Significant disparities in gender and geographical origin were noted (&#967;&#178; &#60; 0.01). A majority of GI oncology journal editors are based in Asia (66.1%), while in thoracic and breast oncology, most editors are located in North America and Europe. Among 17 editors-in-chief, 88.2% were men, all from high-income countries.<br \/>Conclusion: The study highlights a significant gender imbalance and a predominance of editors from high-income countries in oncology journals. This imbalance underscores the need for greater inclusivity and diversity in the editorial boards of prominent oncology journals.<b><\/b><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{44835C0E-90A1-4394-94B2-4E9578187410}\"><caption>Gender and country of origin representation among thoracic, GI, and breast oncology Journals<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;

There are medically vulnerable groups of cancer survivors, such as racial\/ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged populations, that may underutilize healthcare throughout cancer survivorship compared to non-vulnerable groups. Factors associated with survivorship care access\/utilization should be evaluated to identify at-risk groups and reduce risk of poor health outcomes. Among female cancer survivors in Maryland, we examined the associations between race\/ethnicity, obesity, measures of economic stability, and healthcare utilization-related outcomes (including access to care providers, type of doctor provides majority of care, and unmet health care needs because of cost).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Survey data were analyzed for 1,353 non-Hispanic white (NHW) and 280 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women with a self-reported history of cancer living in Maryland who completed the Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey between 2011-2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between independent factors and healthcare utilization outcomes.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> On average, survivors were 66.8 (standard deviation (SD)=12.8) years of age at time of survey and 53.5 (SD=15.6) years of age at time of cancer diagnosis. Breast cancer was the most common cancer reported (58.9%). While most women reported being retired (50.6%), 30.6% reported being employed and 10% were unemployed. Most women were homeowners (81.5%) and 40.1% had household incomes &#62;$50,000\/year. Overall, race\/ethnicity was not associated with any of the outcomes. Unemployed survivors (compared to employed) were 3.90 times more likely (95% CI 1.38-11.04, p=0.01) to report not being able to see a doctor because of cost. Survivors who were not homeowners (compared to homeowners) were 0.39 times less likely (95% CI 0.22-0.67, p &#60;0.001) to report having a general\/family practitioner for majority of cancer survivorship care. Survivors with household incomes &#8804;$50,000\/year (compared to &#62;$50,000\/year) were 2.36 times more likely (95% CI 1.20-4.65, p=0.01) to not have seen a doctor in the past year. Lastly, obese survivors, compared to non-obese, were 0.25 times less likely (95% CI 0.07-0.84, p=0.02) to not have at least one healthcare provider.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> While race\/ethnicity was not associated with healthcare access\/utilization, our results do demonstrate various disparities in access to care and healthcare utilization during cancer survivorship by employment status, home ownership, and income. Our findings can inform interventions in collaboration with healthcare providers caring for female cancer survivors to address challenges associated with access to survivorship care among medically underserved survivors in Maryland.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Race,Obesity,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Yet, racial bias, permeates practice and research in oncology. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) panels recommend guidelines that determine standards for patient care in the United States (US). We investigated the extent of racial\/ethnic representation\/disparity amid this higher echelon of cancer leadership.<br \/>Methods: We collected data from publicly available NCCN (https:\/\/www.nccn.org) guidelines (version: 1.2023-5.2023) published between 11\/2022-11\/2023. Six research team members extracted data. Race\/ethnicity (NIH categories: White, Black, Hispanic\/Latinx, Asian) was identified by advanced AI detection software tools (Namsor and Kairos, utilizing names and facial recognition to infer US race). Gender was determined using name\/pronoun (if available). All information was confirmed using online databases (institutional profiles, biographical paragraphs, social media) and group consensus (in case of discrepancies). Data regarding active US physicians was obtained using Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2022 physician specialty data report. The primary objective was to determine the racial\/ethnic composition of panels and association between race\/ethnicity and chairs\/co-chairs\/vice-chairs (lead positions or leads) within panels. Descriptive statistics were used. Proportions were compared using Fisher-exact or Chi-squared test (odds-ratio [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [95%CI] were reported).<br \/>Results: We reviewed 63 panels corresponding to 63 distinct disease sites. A total of 1223 unique individuals [475 (38.8%) females and 748 (61.2%) males] accounted for 2162 panel members with a median of 34 members (range: 25-42) per panel. Racial\/ethnic representation was 1455 (67.3%) Whites, 570 (26.4%) Asians, 93 (4.3%) Hispanics\/Latinx, and 44 (2.0%) Blacks, which was comparable to racial\/ethnic makeup of active US physicians (64%, 21%, 7% and 6%, respectively). Among these 2162 member positions, 129 (6.0%) were lead positions. In these leads, racial\/ethnic representation was 105 (81.4%) Whites, 5 (11.4%) Blacks, 17 (3.0%) Asians, and 2 (2.2%) Hispanics\/Latinx. Notably, no significant difference was seen between proportion of female (5.2%) and male (6.4%) leads (OR: 0.80; 95%CI:0.55-1.16; P=0.26). However, the proportion of Whites in lead positions was significantly higher than Non-whites (7.2% vs. 3.4%; OR: 2.2; 95%CI: 1.4-3.5; P &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: Although, overall membership of NCCN panels shows favorable racial\/ethnic diversity, underrepresentation and bias appear to subsist for non-White race\/ethnicity, when it comes to leadership positions within this key decision-making body that influences cancer care. Further efforts to improve this disparity within oncology is an essential step to shaping equity within the field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Disparity,Guidelines,Representation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"J.

UNC Lineberger is the flagship publicly funded comprehensive cancer center in North Carolina. We are constantly looking for ways to educate patient and community advocates on recent advances in cancer biology research and clinical trials. Our advocates are also valuable partners for our basic and clinical researchers that may be early in their career. We developed and implemented an inaugural research education program for new advocates. We model this program partly on the highly successful and popular AACR Scientist Survivor Program that recently celebrated it&#8217;s 25<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary. Some of the UNC LCCC advocates participate in the SSP and were motivated to develop our own local program.<br \/>We will showcase our pilot 2024 ASPIRE education program that brings together cancer patient and community advocates and cancer researchers to learn from each other. The basic itinerary of the ASPIRE program is:<br \/>1.Three separate one-hour online presentations by UNC Lineberger researchers with a patient advocate moderator. The topics covered are:<br \/><b><i>Cancer 101<\/i><\/b> : cancer biology, diagnosis, staging, treatment.<br \/><b><i>Clinical Trials 101<\/i><\/b>: clinical trials, phases, patient protection, progress with for example accrual of representative populations.<br \/><b><i>Research 101<\/i><\/b>: bench research, bioinformatic, AI, how research works and how it may lead to new treatments. To showcase a tissue donation program being developed by UNC Patient Advocates that will benefit researchers.<br \/>2.The lecture series is followed by a breakfast roundtable discussion for all the participants to discuss their experiences. There will be short presentations and discussions in small groups of researchers and cancer patient advocates.<br \/>We will summarize our ASPIRE pilot experience, how our participation in the SSP program motivated this local program, and how we plan to incorporate feedback from participants to inform future programs. We hope this will lead to more informed patient advocates that can then be even more powerful in research advocacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient advocacy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Laurie Betts<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Potter<sup>2<\/sup>, Veronica Carlisle<sup>2<\/sup>, Patricia  A.

ProTALKS stands for Prostate Cancer Outreach, Opinions, and Opportunities and is designed to increase awareness of prostate cancer prevention, research, and treatment as well as highlight the health disparities observed in Black communities. According to the Florida Department of Health, prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates among Black men living in Duval County are higher compared to men of other races and ethnicities. Therefore, there is a need for programs like ProTALKS that focus on early detection strategies and promoting community resources. In collaboration with the Prostate Health Education Network (PHEN), The American Legion Post 197, and Florida Blue, ProTALKS has increased access to services such as prostate cancer screening and evidence-based information. Community events implemented by ProTALKS bring together oncologists, researchers, key community leaders, health educators, and providers to educate and promote positive health behavior changes among high-risk communities. In addition to hosting health fairs, ProTalks has hosted grilling competitions and community awareness walks to further educate the community about prostate cancer prevention, screening, and research. ProTALKS also shares information through the local newspaper, <i>The Jacksonville Free Press<\/i>, The Lynn &#38; Friends radio show, and social media platforms. Since its start in 2021, with support from the Florida-California Cancer Research, Education, and Engagement (CaRE<sup>2<\/sup>) Health Equity Center, ProTALKS has implemented more than 10 community events with over 1,000 community members from Jacksonville, Florida. ProTALKS, in collaboration with CaRE<sup>2<\/sup>, continues to disseminate information about cancer screening, the importance of clinical trial participation, and donating biospecimens for cancer research. Although ProTALKS has been successful in its mission, there have been challenges throughout its implementation. For example, one challenge has been increasing the number of community members attending events and using appropriate marketing techniques to promote ProTALKS&#8217; activities. Future implications to avoid challenges include recruiting more volunteers, and partnering with other community organizations in Duval County.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advocacy,Cancer prevention,Patient advocacy,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Lynn Jones-Turpin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ileana Guzman<sup>2<\/sup>, Brooke Hensel<sup>2<\/sup>, Fern Webb<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Florida, Orlando, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"377ccfd3-c892-474e-9237-3783a51c0fda","ControlNumber":"2626","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

The first was having a benign breast tumor removed at age 14. The second was my 2017 mBC diagnosis, including my bilateral mastectomy and the lack of images and information available for Black women concerning reconstruction and scar management. The third is exclusion from and the lack of diversity in clinical trials.<br \/>Objective: In order to address the disparities in cancer and my unmet needs, I use my story and experiences as a catalyst for change primarily in three forms, which have evolved over time: advocacy, awareness, and action.<br \/>Methods: Advocacy: To unburden myself from the shame about my breast health and the scar from my surgery at age 14, I vocalized my concerns and needs as an adult navigating my breast reconstruction options after my 2017 cancer diagnosis. Ongoing frustration that my needs were not being addressed led me to create Uncovered: A Breast Recognition Project, in collaboration with Rethink Breast Cancer. Uncovered, a digital and print resource, shines a light on the disparities and challenges that Black, Indigenous and people of color face in breast cancer care.<br \/>Awareness: The 2020 edition started with my story and those of 7 Black women. After Uncovered launched, other racialized women reached out with similar experiences. The resource was expanded in 2021 to include stories and images of an Inuk woman, Black women, and women of color. This confirmed a systemic need to raise awareness and address racialized communities and inequities in breast cancer care.<br \/>Action: As a result of the slow progress towards systemic change, I, along with the women of Uncovered, co-created the Wish List in 2021. The Uncovered Wish List is 6 accessible and actionable items that should be a priority for ending disparities in breast cancer care. Due to the complexity of my diagnosis, which limits my clinical trial options, and the historical underrepresentation of racialized communities in clinical trials, I now partner with cancer institutions and organizations that focus on research to address ongoing unmet needs with the goal to improve equity, diversity and inclusion.<br \/>Results: Uncovered is a first-of-its-kind resource in Canada. To date, it has had a global reach of over 70 million through conferences, panels, podcasts, resource links, presentations, and various media. The recognition of my story, Uncovered, and the Wish List allows me to form collaborative connections, and become an engaged patient partner committed to systemic change.<br \/>Conclusion: Despite systemic barriers, it is possible for Black women with breast cancer to advocate, raise awareness and take action towards change in meaningful ways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient advocacy,Breast cancer,Disparities,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

With etiologies in both disease and treatment manifesting as a symptom and a side-effect respectively, CRF is highly incident and presents a significant clinical problem that impacts survivorship. We sought to explore CRF in a large multinational cohort of patients with lymphoma and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).<br \/>Methods: Lymphoma Coalition deployed the Global Patient Survey in 2022 targeting patients with lymphoma and CLL and their caregivers. Responses were collected from 8637 respondents over 79 countries. Respondents indicated if they experienced fatigue as a symptom, side-effect or both. Data were enumerated and segregated into the following categories: No Fatigue \/ Treated (A), No Symptom \/ No Treatment (B), Symptom \/ No Treatment (C), Symptom Only \/ Treated (D), Side-effect Only (E), Symptom and Side-Effect (F). Data were stratified across lymphoma subtypes and categorical percentages were computed. An approximation of the contribution of treatment to CRF was calculated using the following equation: (F) + (E) - (D).<br \/>Results: Valid responses were obtained for 6758 respondents. The majority of respondents for most subtypes reported CRF as both a symptom and a side-effect of treatment. Across the 13 subtypes examined, the attributable incidence of CRF related to treatment was found to be highest in: DLBCL (58%), Hodgkin (54%), Peripheral T- Cell (53%) and Mantle Cell (50%). The subtypes with the lowest attributable incidence of CRF included: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (3%), Hairy Cell (12%), Cutaneous (25%) and Marginal Zone (26%).<br \/>Conclusions: The majority of patients in this study cited CRF as a significant issue. The calculated fraction of fatigue attributable to treatment suggests that certain treatments may have a larger effect on fatigue than others. A limitation of this study is that we are relying upon patient reported outcomes and we acknowledge that patients may be unable to reliably differentiate fatigue from being a symptom or a side-effect. Our future work in this area will seek to map the intensity of fatigue from diagnosis through treatment in order to get a better understanding of the dynamic nature of this phenomenon. However, we are of the opinion that the compounding effect of CRF related to both disease and treatment yields opportunities to individualize treatment to patients based upon their symptomatic CRF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-02 Cancer survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer therapy,Cytotoxicity,Lymphoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Patients with cancer can be at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 due to their cancer type or to receipt of immunosuppressives or treatment (2). Their mental and emotional well-being have also been impacted negatively (3). There is a need for awareness and education on managing and navigating risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer.<br \/>Method: Coping Circle Workshop series webinar &#8216;Navigating the Ongoing Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Patients&#8217; was designed for patient\/caregivers to reduce feelings of isolation caused by ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19; provide attendees with the tools to communicate effectively with medical teams; offer tips on utilizing and enhancing their support systems; and help develop adaptive coping mechanisms and provide resources for support. Pre- and post-webinar polls were analyzed to assess webinar impact. Training was provided by a social worker and a mindfulness practice was incorporated.<br \/>Results: Webinar had 11 attendees; 91% had skipped a cancer medical appointment due to COVID-19. Post-webinar, all participants responded that the webinar provided new topic information or insights at a level of &#8805;3 (scale 0-5; Table 1). Attendees&#8217; confidence in understanding and managing their potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection increased from 5.8&#177;1.3 (mean&#177; standard deviation) pre-survey to 8.2&#177;1.8 post-survey (scale 0-10).<br \/>Conclusions: Delivery of COVID-19 education by an aligned provider supports enhanced scientific discourse and disease management resource utilization and awareness. It may also serve to reduce time and resource burden on oncology providers when engaging in educating patients and improve patients COVID-19 care and management. Conclusions are limited by small participation size.<br \/>References: 1.<u>End of PHE.<\/u><u><\/u> Accessed Nov 2023;2.<u>CDC<\/u><u>.<\/u> Accessed Nov 2023;3.Madan et al, Can Med. 2020;9:9205-18<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{E1843EFB-E64D-4D09-81E9-FE5A9220ABD2}\"><caption>Table 1: Webinar &#8220;COVID-19 and Cancer&#8221; - Pre and post webinar questions and responses<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Pre-poll, N=11<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Scale<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Number of patients responded<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>% of patients responded<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Post-poll, N=11<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Scale<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Number of patients responded<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>% of patients responded<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">In the past three years, how many times have you skipped a medical appointment due to concerns or fear related to COVID-19?<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1-3 times<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">The webinar provided me with new information or new insights about this topic.<br>Scale of 0-5; 0-strongly disagree, 5- strongly agree<b><\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3-5 times<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.18<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1-2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5-7 times<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27.27<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18.18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7-10 times<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27.27<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Unknown<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36.36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Never<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.09<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">How would you rate your knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on people diagnosed with cancer?<br>Scale of 0-10; 0-no knowledge, 10- High knowledge<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">I am now more aware of the precautions and measures to take to manage the risk of COVID-19.

With patients increasingly turning to the internet for medical information, the use of LLM chatbots for cancer-related queries risks spreading misinformation. Our study assessed ChatGPT&#8217;s accuracy and reproducibility in offering valid information and treatment advice for lung cancer in line with established guidelines.<br \/>In the evolving landscape of AI-driven healthcare support, the ability of language models to provide accurate and reliable information is crucial. Our study delves into the effectiveness of OpenAI's ChatGPT models (versions 3.5 and 4.0) in responding to patient inquiries about lung cancer across various domains including general information, clinical presentation, risk factors, screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment options, prognosis, post-treatment follow-up, lifestyle recommendations, and psychosocial\/educational aspects.<br \/>We conducted a structured assessment, posing identical sets of questions to both ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0. A total of 47 questions were posed with each query being repeated twice per model to evaluate both the accuracy and reproducibility of the responses. The scoring system focused on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of each response.<br \/>Our findings revealed a notable disparity in the performance of the two models. GPT 4.0 demonstrated higher consistency and accuracy, with 41 out of 47 (87.2%) responses deemed accurate and comprehensive, compared to 36 out of 47 (76.6%) for GPT 3.5. In terms of reproducibility, both models exhibited strong performance: 42 out of 47 (89.3%) for GPT 3.5 and 45 out of 47 for GPT 4.0 (95.7%). When comparing responses between the models, we observed good reproducibility in 38 out of 47 questions (80.8%).<br \/>A key observation was that GPT 4.0 significantly outperformed its predecessor GPT 3.5 in terms of both accuracy as well as reproducibility within its own responses, indicating a more reliable and consistent performance. The area most lacking in accuracy for both models was lung cancer staging, indicating a need for further refinement in this domain. Another key observation was the models' tendency to incorporate empathetic language, often beginning responses with expressions of sympathy and consistently advising confirmation with a medical professional.<br \/>Our study underscores the potential and limitations of current AI models in patient education and support, highlighting areas for improvement and the importance of empathetic communication in AI interactions with patients. As the model continues to be trained on a larger and more comprehensive set of data, it is reasonable to anticipate further improvements in its ability to provide precise, detailed, and contextually appropriate responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient advocacy,Lung cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"A.

CRC screening rates have steadily risen and incidence rates around the nation have declined. To date, forty-one states have expanded Medicaid across the United States, with 9 states remaining that have not expanded. Although, access through insurance has increased, colorectal disparities in screening and mortality persist. Other studies have shown that screening guideline concordance can be inconsistent based on insurance type. Data suggests Medicaid enrollees are more likely to present advanced-stage cancers than those privately enrolled.<sup> <\/sup>The screening differences throughout the United States emphasize how complex colorectal cancer disparities are and how insurance may play a role.<br \/>Aims: Our study aims to investigate the impact of Medicaid expansion on timely CRC screenings, specifically examining whether these effects differ by African Americans, Hispanics, and White Americans.<br \/>Methods: Data was utilized from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to analyze timely CRC screening data of adults below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) of states with different Medicaid expansion statuses. Most recently available data was used in our analysis spanning the years 2014-2022 in all 50 states. States were stratified by dummy variables for Medicaid expansion and non-expansion status. Timely CRC screenings were determined by eligible respondent responses. Difference-in-difference analyses were used to study the effect of Medicaid expansion on timely CRC screenings in states with different Medicaid expansion statuses.<br \/>Results: Our sample included 60.52% White Americans, 12.22% African Americans, and 16.41% Hispanics in both Medicaid expanded and non-expanded states. Sex and race had significant associations to Medicaid expansion status and timely CRC screenings, particularly when analyzing race for Hispanics and White Americans.

In 2017, the Roche Cobas&#174; EGFR Mutation Test v2 for the detection of the <i>EGFR<\/i> c.2369C&#62;T p.(T790M) mutation in plasma-derived ctDNA was FDA-approved to identify patients eligible for osimertinib treatment. Today, different platforms are available for <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation testing in plasma-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). In this study we compared the clinical utility of five platforms for the detection of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations in cfDNA offering insights into their operational costs, target coverage, hands-on-time and turn-around-time.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>Four PCR-based platforms and one NGS-based approach for the detection of <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations were compared. Operational, maintenance, material and personnel costs were calculated for each platform and used as input variables for our recently developed ctDNA micro-costing framework (doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmoldx.2022.10.004). This was compared to target coverage and turn-around-time of each platform in the context of therapy resistance.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Per sample costs decreased for all platforms at maximal weekly throughput. The BioCartis Idylla&#8482; demonstrated the shortest turn-around-time while the Roche Cobas&#174; was the least expensive. Despite being the most expensive and time-consuming, the AVENIO ctDNA Expanded kit covered the most known resistance mechanisms to <i>EGFR<\/i> inhibitors, many of which are targetable with other TKIs.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> <i>EGFR<\/i> ctDNA mutation analysis is only cost-effective when the throughput is high. This implies that centralization of cfDNA-testing is necessary to optimize cost-efficiency. With the advent of ctDNA analysis beyond <i>EGFR<\/i> in the context of targeted therapies for lung cancer, multigene detection assays will become more cost-effective with high throughput.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7FB717A7-0483-4F79-BF09-02D20159B755}\"><caption>Overview of results<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Platform<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Turn-around time at maximal weekly throughput<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Per sample cost at maximal weekly throughput<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Coverage of resistance mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i><sup><br><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup>Additional testing necessary<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Coverage of genome-wide resistance mutations to <i>EGFR<\/i>-TKI<br><sup>1<\/sup>Additional testing necessary<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BioCartis Idylla™ ct<i>EGFR<\/i> Mutation Assay<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2,5 hours<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">€571<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12%<sup>1<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Roche Cobas® <i>EGFR<\/i> Mutation Test v2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 hours<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">€497<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Bio-Rad QX200 droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7,5 hours<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">€766<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">100%<sup>1<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24%<sup>1<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Agena MassARRAY® UltraSEEK® Lung Panel<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 days<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">€613<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">53%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Roche AVENIO ctDNA Expanded kit<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 week<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">€1551<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">100%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">65%<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-05 Value and cost issues in cancer care,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Cancer diagnostics,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Tissue donation programs require a partnership: patients donating tissue and researchers using tissue for translational research. Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) has established a program called Patients and Researchers Together (PART) to value and increase the number of patients who agree to donate tissue for research. The PART Program is a patient-centered partnership between patients, community members, oncologists, surgeons, researchers, as well as staff and faculty from the clinical trials office, tissue procurement facility and UNC health communications to increase tissue donations for cancer research by valuing the patient&#8217;s contribution.<br \/>Methods: The PART program began in 2021 by convening a group of diverse partners with a common goal of valuing patients as partners in biospecimen research. Creating an environment of bidirectional communication and exchange of ideas to 1) inform patients about the benefits of donating tissue for research, 2) inform the public about the importance of tissue to help researchers learn more about cancer, and 3) ensure researchers at UNC have access to tissue for their research. In the initial phase, the PART team evaluated the tissue research needs at LCCC by conducting surveys, interviews and focus groups with key partners. This set the foundation for the focus of current activities. One of the key focus areas is to communicate to patients and the public about the value of using tissue in research. The PART program established a working group to develop patient materials. The working group developed a template for educational materials, study summaries and a rigorous review process. The development of materials and iterative review process includes content experts, health literacy experts, patients and community members, and communications experts.<br \/>Results: The PART working group developed a series of educational materials about tissue donation for research. Understanding the importance of donating tissue for research is the first step in engaging with patients. The team developed a template and a multi-step process to review documents. PART used this information to develop a website to promote tissue donation for research to the public. The team has been developing summaries of studies focused on tissue donation. We developed or consulted on 2 general education flyers and 8 study summaries in a variety of cancer types. There is a continuous queue of studies in progress and plans to develop more general education materials.<br \/>PART patients and community members are leading the effort to educate patients and the public about tissue use in research. LCCC values patients who donate their tissue to research to improve the lives of all cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advocacy,Patient advocacy,Biospecimen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>P.

Both institutions are adopting the 4R Oncology Model (Right Info\/Care\/Patient\/Time) for patient-facing care planning and self-management, proven to enhance supportive and health maintenance care delivery (Trosman JCOOP 2021). This abstract depicts a baseline survey of JBVA veterans&#8217; and Sinai Chicago patients' experiences in planning and delivering guideline-directed supportive and health maintenance care for new cancer diagnoses, informing 4R implementations.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients at JBVA and Sinai Chicago were surveyed from February to September 2023 with participants receiving a $25 gift card. An analysis was conducted using Fisher&#8217;s two-tailed exact test.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The two institutions yielded a 67% survey response rate. Key patient demographics and oncologic and supportive care metrics are outlined in the table below. At JBVA, fewer than 50% of veterans knew their cancer stage at diagnosis, and 63% were aware of their care goals. Furthermore, only 17% of veterans received recommendations for support services offered by JBVA. &#8220;Emotional distress or worry&#8221; support recommendations were received by &#60; 50% of patients at both institutions.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The baseline survey uncovered gaps in care planning, supportive services, and health maintenance care in both institutions, catering to patients with challenging social determinants of health. The implementation of the 4R Oncology Model is designed to address these gaps, providing a personalized care sequence that establishes a clear roadmap through the patient's care trajectory, ultimately enhancing patient-centered care.

Our goal was to develop a standardized approach to the measurement and reporting of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in early-phase trials to improve assessment of tolerability, address noted barriers to inclusion, and enhance patient-provider communication to inform treatment decisions and ultimately improve outcomes.<br \/>Methods: The Office of Patient Centered Outcomes Research (OPCORe) was established in 2022 within the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with the mission to advance understanding of the clinical benefit and tolerability of cancer therapies by integrating patient-centered approaches into CCR clinical trials by fostering education and collaboration with stakeholders. Implementation of regulatory\/consortia guidelines related to use of core constructs, assessment frequency, and hypothesis-driven objectives and analysis plans through protocol template, development of data capture, email-based alerts and data visualization for clinical providers was developed and standardized templates for protocol language, research staff education, tools for workflow, and tracking implemented.<br \/>Results: The OPCORe protocol template includes measurement of 3 constructs, including tolerability, clinical benefit and disease-specific impact, as well as anchors of meaningful change. Core symptomatic toxicities are measured to inform understanding across trials with agent\/class-specific symptomatic toxicities added to assure relevance. Baseline and standardized weekly electronic capture of tolerability during early cycles with alerts to clinical research staff if moderate-severe toxicities reported helps facilitate patient check-ins. Repeat PROs assessments in later cycles are expanded to include disease-specific assessments and align with disease evaluation to further inform clinical impact. To date, we have collaborated with 7 research groups and developed approaches for first-in-human, phase I, and phase II studies with trial start-up and data collection in process.<br \/>Conclusion: The value of including PROs in cancer trials is increasingly recognized by regulators, clinicians, patients, and advocates to advance understanding of the clinical benefit &#38; tolerability of emerging therapies. Standardization and incorporation of PROs in earlier phase trials may enable PROs to be optimized, improve later phase trial design, and help inform health policy, support drug approval, and promote shared decision making between providers and patients to inform treatment decisions.<i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-03 Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Early-phase trials,Patient-reported outcomes,Symptomatic toxicities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

In addition, the Open Science Initiative aims to shift the current paradigm of research practice towards broad sharing and public access to research findings as the norm. Big data in oncology usually includes a combination of genomic sequencing, proteomics, medical imaging, electronic health records, payor records, and other data sources from pharmaceutical research, wearables, and medical devices. While combining, linking, and analyzing data from different sources across research and healthcare enterprises is key to realizing the promise of big data and a health learning system, it poses tremendous challenges for researchers and implementers to understand the nuances of relevant policies, laws, and regulations while striving for broad, equitable, timely and responsible data sharing, as well as tackling issues in data quality, harmonization, interoperability, and security. Herein, we aim to shine a light on the ever-evolving landscape of data privacy regulations, laws, and policies that govern different touch points of a patient's journey where data are collected for research and healthcare purposes throughout the lifecycle that would impact data-sharing outcomes. We hope the illumination of a complex landscape of data governance framework to consider for many data sources will facilitate broad community engagement including data scientists and technologists, patients and advocacy groups, and policymakers to maximize open data and science while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. &#8203;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular profiling,Data sharing,Healthcare data,Policies and Regulations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Patients treated at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (IORS) who undergo surgery upon complete response might be exposed to risks and poor quality of life. A consortium dedicated to redefining prognostic and predictive biomarkers in rectal cancer was formed within the framework of the STEPUPIORS Horizon Europe project. The current study evaluated whether employing collaborative widening funds might lead to sustainable strategies for cancer treatment, lowering inequity and steering societal impact, especially in countries with limited resources, using a pilot rectal cancer project.<br \/>Patients and Methods: The analysis was performed in the period Oct 01, 2022, to Oct 01, 2023, with a Serbian coordinating institution and partners from Spain, Greece, and the Netherlands as expert twinning centers. RT was administered to 75 patients with LARC using volumetric modulated arc therapy-simultaneous integrated boost approach\/concomitant chemotherapy (5FU\/Leucovorin, week 1&#38;5) for the first time in Serbia. A comprehensive approach towards building human capacities on biobanking, multiomics analyses and project management was developed through intensive training and expert visits. Consensus consortium decisions were reached on regular partner meetings.<br \/>Results: Patients with clinical complete response (16.0%) and initially distant-located tumors were enrolled in the watch and wait approach and are under follow up. Developed pipelines for multiomics analyses led to 4 high-quality papers on new predictive biomarkers to nCRT in LARC and the deposition of omics data in open-science repositories following FAIR data principles. A first Serbian cancer biobank was successfully installed. Fifteen IORS researchers (87% female), were certified in biobanking. A grant management office was established to provide and support the sustainability of future research projects. This led to 5 new grant applications and enrollment of 1 female project member in a Masters program for Management in the Health Care System.<br \/>Conclusion: This study showed that even within the first 12 months, implementation of a 3-year collaborative grant dedicated to a specific research problem, might significantly change educational and treatment strategies enabling better patient care (OCEBM level of evidence 3). The results highlight that disparities in cancer outcomes and health equity might only be addressed by progressing beyond descriptions of said outcomes and taking specific action. Systematic, long-term strategic initiatives and collaborations among relevant stakeholders and ethical, legal and societal structures are needed in more countries.<br \/>Acknowledgements: Horizon Europe Project STEPUPIORS (101079217).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-03 Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,equity,rectal cancer,watch and wait,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Despite the prevalence of HPV-related malignancies, current guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) do not recommend post-treatment HPV-DNA testing. Instead, PET-CT imaging is recommended as a prognostic test. This retrospective proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate current NCCN guidelines and examines whether post-treatment HPV-HR DNA testing is a cost-effective, reliable alternative to PET-CT imaging in cervical cancer prognosis.<br \/>Methods: The study included female patients diagnosed with cervical or vaginal carcinomas (2011-2021), ensuring comprehensive records of both pre-treatment and post-treatment high-risk HPV (HPV-HR) testing, alongside PET-CT imaging results. Utilizing the FDA-approved HPV-HR DNA test, capable of detecting 14 oncogenic HPV strains, the study conducted rigorous statistical analyses via STATA software to determine significance of the study results.<br \/>Results: Our analysis of 53 patients who met the inclusion criteria demonstrated that post-treatment assessments using both HPV status and PET-CT imaging exhibited high levels of sensitivity and specificity, as well as impressive negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV, respectively). There was a statistically significant correlation between the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the results obtained from HPV status and PET-CT imaging post-treatment (p-value &#60; 0.001). A critical observation was the superior sensitivity and improved NPV of post-treatment HPV status compared to PET-CT scans. Specifically, the sensitivity for HPV status post-treatment was quantified at 92.31, surpassing the 76.92 sensitivity rating of PET-CT scans. Furthermore, the NPV for post-treatment HPV status was measured at 97.44, which is better than the 92.31 NPV for PET-CT scans. Notably, no patients with negative post-treatment HPV-HR tests had a recurrence.<br \/>Discussion: The results of this study underscore the clinical significance of assessing HPV-HR DNA status post-treatment, particularly when HPV-HR DNA is negative. If future prospective studies confirm these findings, it may eliminate the need for post-treatment PET-CT scans, providing significant survivorship benefits for patients by reducing follow-up visits and eliminating unnecessary imaging. This would also result in substantial financial savings, estimated to be over $75,000,000 per year in the US alone, based on 2023 data. The limitations of the study include small sample size, single-institution data, and biases associated with retrospective studies. Future multi-institutional prospective studies are necessary to improve current guidelines further and validate the findings of this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-05 Value and cost issues in cancer care,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),PET,Prognostic markers,Cervical cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Survivorship care, including long-term health care, for adolescent and young adult (15-39 years) (AYA) cancer survivors is not standardized. AYA cancer survivors have unique challenges that differ from those of other generations. The purpose of this study was to highlight challenges regarding survivorship care for AYA cancer survivors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This study assessed survivorship care challenges for AYA cancer survivors based on questionnaire data in two configurations. We surveyed AYA cancer survivors diagnosed with various cancer types at our hospital regarding the actual status and challenges of survivorship care. Questionnaires assessed schooling and employment status, place of residence, length of hospital visits, cost of transportation to hospital, department and reason for visits, and issues related to survivorship care. We then surveyed cancer specialists who provide survivorship care about the actual status and challenges of survivorship care, including issues identified in the AYA cancer survivor survey.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Ninety-eight<b> <\/b>AYA cancer survivors responded; 42 survivors (42.9%) were aged 20-29 and 45 (45.9%) were aged 30-39.

There were 27 survivors (27.6%) who received survivorship care in more than one department, and 26 (26.5%) received survivorship care in cooperation with other departments in the other hospital. Due to schoolwork and jobs, 52.0% of survivors felt that time for outpatient visits was scarce, and 51.0% of survivors indicated that they would prefer online survivorship care. On the other hand, the survey for cancer specialists was completed by 45 respondents (70.3%). More than 60% of cancer specialists providing follow-up care for AYA cancer patients felt that knowledge and experience in reproductive medicine and life events was necessary. Furthermore, regarding the challenges of long-term follow-up care for AYA cancer patients, more than 80% of physicians felt that mental, endocrine-related, and sexual function-related care and management were difficult in their own practices.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: AYA cancer survivors with schoolwork and jobs felt that they had challenges in visiting outpatient clinics for survivorship care.

To manage the disease, patients and caregivers turn to various tools and resources for financial assistance, information dissemination, emotional and peer support, and treatment planning, among other critical issues and needs they face. The Colorectal Cancer Alliance (the Alliance) created BlueHQ to provide patients and caregivers with a resource solution encompassing all potential areas of need.<br \/>Methods: A survey aimed at understanding needs, barriers, and quality improvement opportunities was disseminated via the Alliance's Blue Hope Nation community for two weeks and by email. One hundred sixty-seven colorectal cancer patients and forty caregivers of colorectal cancer patients completed the survey.<br \/>Results: Patients and caregiver respondents report reliance on external tools and resources to manage disease and support information. Of the support methods, patient respondents reported using social media (46.11%); notebooks, journals, and planners (45.41%); online articles (44.91%); the Blue Hope Nation Facebook group (41.32%); cancer discussion boards (35.33%); and spiritual or religious advice (29.94%). Patients sought financial assistance, local peer support and groups, and mental health help to minimize diagnosis-related stressors. To provide more efficient care and limit stress, the community suggested financial help, communication and support from other patients and caregivers, and informational resources.<br \/>Conclusions: These survey results are consistent with other published learnings about patient and caregiver reliance on support tools and highlight the myriad resources that patients and caregivers currently use for managing CRC. BlueHQ is a support solution that provides patients and caregivers with access to information and resources tailored to users&#8217; specified profiles, including molecular characteristics of the tumor. Users can also store documents and information from healthcare encounters, creating a longitudinal record and tracking disease progression. In the age of precision oncology, BlueHQ ensures patients and users are presented with personalized educational materials and multimedia resources to help manage their disease and bridge the gaps in patient support. BlueHQ was explicitly designed to connect the CRC community to the latest therapeutic and clinical research resources to improve outcomes and quality of life for all CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Colorectal cancer,Patient advocacy,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

SFs relevant for oncology are categorized as cancer-related potentially leading to a cancer diagnosis (CA-SFs) or non-cancer findings revealing important medical conditions, predispositions, or carrier status in cancer patients (NC-SFs). These SFs can inform disease prevention, early detection, or management decisions, but may cause distress, overdiagnosis, and overuse of resources if actionability is limited. There is a lack of consensus for identifying, analyzing, and interpreting the clinical relevance of SFs. This significantly impacts cancer care, where paired tumor-normal sequencing is standard practice. Widespread practice variation can lead to detrimental impacts on patient outcomes and overall health. We synthesized policy guiding the clinical investigation of SFs for cancer to help providers navigate decisions regarding SFs.<br \/>Methods: We carried out a systematic review of international guidance directing the identification, analysis, and management of SFs from genomic sequencing, and analyzed the subset of policies specifically relating to oncology. We searched the grey literature (IFHGS members) and academic databases including MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane. Two reviewers independently assessed policy documents for screening, data extraction and quality assessment (using AGREE-II).<br \/>Results: We identified 7 policies guiding the investigation of SFs relating to cancer across the general population (n=4), adults (n=1), pediatrics (n=1) and research (n=2) contexts. Most policies included guidelines for SF variant selection (identification; n=5) and management (n=4), with a minority detailing analysis processes (n=2). Recommended CA-SFs included medically actionable cancer predisposition variants, while suggested NC-SFs were variants important for drug therapies <i>(identification)<\/i>. Laboratories were advised to ensure adequate coverage and read depth during SF analysis <i>(analysis)<\/i>, while<i> <\/i>policies recommended that a medical genetics healthcare provider return results, specifically discussing their clinical utility <i>(management).<\/i><br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, our review is the most comprehensive synthesis of policy guiding SFs for cancer. Policies outline the types of SFs to investigate from genome sequencing in cancer and non-cancer patients, and related strategies for disclosure. However, best practices for SF analyses and patient follow-up including SF surveillance, treatment, etc. remain poorly described. This synthesis will help cancer care providers navigate critical decision points based on current evidence and direct policymakers on gaps to fill in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-03 Implementation science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Sequencing,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Locations with population density greater than 1000 inhabitants per square mile were considered urban. Locations were categorized based on their distance from NIH as local (&#60;50 mi), short-distance (50-200mi) and long-distance (&#62;200 mi). T-tests, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression compared socioeconomic and urbanity factors.<br \/>Results: 667 NHS participants arrived from 43 states and territories, with the majority (61%) from Maryland and neighboring states, and other states contributing no more than 5% of the participants each. The home locations of the participants were disproportionately urban (60% versus 19% of all US locations, p &#60;0.001) and socioeconomically advantaged (mean ADI 26.94 versus 57.30 across all US locations, p&#60;0.001). Local participants (49%) had greater racial and ethnic diversity (73% White, 11% Black, 9% Asian, 2% other; 11% Hispanic\/Latino) compared to short-distance participants (11% total; 96% White, 3% Black, 0% other; 0% Hispanic\/Latino) and long-distance participants (39% total; 89% White, 3% Black, 3% Asian, 2% Other; 6% Hispanic\/Latino). Local participants lived in the most socioeconomically advantaged locations (mean ADI 16.39) compared to short-distance (mean ADI 40.88, p&#60;0.001) and long-distance (mean ADI 39.69, p&#60;0.001) participants. Short-distance participants were from disproportionally non-urban areas (69%) compared to local (28%, p&#60;0.001) and long-distance (46%, p&#60;0.001) participants. Multivariate analysis also confirmed that local participants were more likely to live in more advantaged areas than short-distance (OR=0.90, p&#60;0.001) and long-distance (OR=0.93, p&#60;0.001) participants, and short-distance participants were less likely to live in urban areas compared to local (OR=0.19, p&#60;0.001) and long-distance (OR=0.44, p=0.008) participants.<br \/>Conclusion: The trial enrolled patients across the US, albeit with most participants arriving from neighboring states and socioeconomically advantaged, urban areas. Greater rural patient participation from nearby areas reflects the positive impact of NIH subsidies in reducing the financial challenges linked to participating in clinical trials. Current trends indicate that continued and targeted efforts to enable participation from local disadvantaged communities can ameliorate access to neuro-oncology clinical care and research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Clinical trial access,Health disparities,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Between 2010 and 2018, the SSAI population in the US increased by 53%, significantly outpacing the 12% growth rate for the overall foreign-born population in the US during that time frame. Despite these growing numbers, little is published about the extent to which SSAIs adapt to health behaviors more common in the US or remain immersed in the values, beliefs and practices reflective of their country of origin. Importantly, no study has comprehensively examined the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) among this population relative to their migration experiences and their influence on health-seeking behaviors and decision-making regarding prostate cancer care and treatment options.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This qualitative study employed grounded theory and the social determinants of migrant heath framework to better understand the needs of SSAI prostate cancer survivors in the United States and how to effectively support these survivors.

This requirement to plan for diverse trial recruitment drives a need to innovate approaches for site selection and trial recruitment that go beyond mirroring race-ethnicity distributions from the US Census or disease prevalence. We present a novel framework that nests clinical trials in a longitudinal patient registry to achieve diverse representation across multiple domains, evaluate site-selection and recruitment strategies, and examine health equity across the cancer patient journey.<br \/>Implementing a registry to support longitudinal data collection (i.e., a cohort study), we establish a continuous view of participant characteristics including demographic and social determinants of health, treatment received, and relevant outcomes. Nesting clinical trials within the structure of the cohort, we can select sites and recruit for diverse representation to achieve equity goals. This framework involves a multi-layer analysis of external population statistics and internal reference registry to gauge the pool of eligible participants and calibrate the sampling strategy and recruitment expectations to the realities of clinical representation. Moreover, where clinical representation differs from population statistics, the registry offers an opportunity to report benchmarks for diversity and compare to site-level and study-level realized enrollment and feasibility.<br \/>In conclusion, the path to health equity in oncology trials depends on a capacity to ask and answer the right questions in planning. What specific aspects of diversity are we aiming to capture? How do these aspects impact outcomes? We advocate for a dynamic planning process that continuously reevaluates goals and strategies in the face of enrollment data and evolving population demographics. By utilizing a registry with longitudinal follow-up, we can set forth clear expectations, transparently report on the progress of inclusion efforts, and candidly address feasibility challenges. We present a structured framework for trial sponsors to not only comply with the forthcoming requirement for diversity action plans, but ultimately to advance the goal of equitable cancer care through research that truly reflects the complex intersectional diversity of those impacted by the disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Risk factors,Race,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Deidentified results were analyzed before or after filtering for fusions based on either a Targeted Solid Tumor NGS fusion Panel (16 drug targetable genes) or only NTRKs fusions. Deidentified patient data presented was analyzed according to an IRB-approved protocol.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The prevalence of fusions in the cohort was 30.5% involving any of the 1104 targeted genes by the assay (27% in frame, 20% out of frame, and 41% others). Druggable fusions were present in 5.1% (422) of patients, where 53% were female with a median age of 68 years old, and 47% were male with a median age of 70. However, when filtering only for NTRK fusions, only 104 patients had an NTRK fusion (38 NTRK1, 10 NTRK2, 56 NTRK3), while an additional 318 patients had detected fusions from the Targeted Panel.

Racial disparities in CRC within the United States pose a significant public health concern, affecting incidence, mortality rates, and screening rates. This study investigates the impact of racial disparities on CRC incidence across various US states, utilizing CRC data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Analysis with GraphPad Prism 5 software and Student's t-test reveals a consistent trend of higher CRC incidence in males compared to females, irrespective of ethnicity. Notably, the Black and American Indian ethnic groups demonstrate the highest CRC incidences among all races, especially in individuals aged 65 and above. Certain states, including Iowa and Mississippi for Black populations, and Alaska, Minnesota, Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota for American Indian populations, exhibit significantly elevated CRC incidences compared to the national average. County-specific analysis in Alabama reveals varying CRC incidence rates across ethnic groups, with higher rates in specific counties, such as Clarke County for Black males. Limited reports for American Indian, Asian Pacific, and Hispanic ethnic groups indicate potential disparities in access to testing, awareness, and funding for CRC detection and prevention. This study concludes that Black and American Indian males and females experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer, possibly influenced by genetic factors or other variables contributing to CRC development. The observed disparities are multifaceted, arising from a combination of social, economic, and healthcare system factors. Addressing these complexities is crucial for mitigating CRC disparities and promoting equitable healthcare access and outcomes. Additional research, including molecular screening studies, is essential to substantiate disparities in cancer-related health and enhance public health and cancer awareness within the community.<br \/><b>Key Words:<\/b> Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Health Care, Racial Disparities","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-01 Cancer disparities,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Colorectal cancer,Cancer detection,Colon,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

There are systemic issues at play that contribute to these disparities. These include lack of diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) fields; bias in healthcare delivery and access; underinsurance in patients from low-income backgrounds; and lack of training that advances those from historically underrepresented groups. The SCHEQ Foundation (STEMM &#38; Cancer Health Equity) is a black-founded nonprofit organization that seeks to increase STEMM workforce diversity and improve outcomes for underrepresented, underserved, marginalized, and invisible populations across the cancer care continuum. Herein we describe the formation of SCHEQ Foundation and our core domains that we seek to make change. We seek to increase STEMM access and exposure, increase STEMM workforce diversity, and improve outcomes for underserved populations navigating the cancer care continuum. This will be accomplished in part by 1) engaging professional in STEMM from their lived background and experiences, 2) developing training, mentoring, and professional developing programs across the academic continuum to increase success of minoritized scholars; and 3) providing information and resources in culturally responsive manners to help underserved patient navigate cancer and advocate for the standard of care they deserve. We will change how we convey content, information, and resources to underserved populations by utilizing a combination of multimedia, infographics, webinars, info sheets, and community engagement. The goal is to increase survival for groups that historically have the greatest cancer disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-04 Patient advocacy and engagement,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Patient advocacy,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Rare cancers typically have outdated treatment guidelines, a lack of targeted therapy options due to insufficient research into their biology, and consequently, a failure to keep pace with the advancements in survival outcomes seen in more common cancers over the past few decades. The initiative is rooted in five core premises: the shared goal of all stakeholders to improve rare cancer care, the prevalence of rare cancers constituting a substantial global burden, the scattered nature of rare cancer researchers and resources, existing disincentives hindering collaboration, and the untapped potential of coordinated efforts. CANCollaborate addresses these challenges by fostering open communication, encouraging cooperation, and creating collaborations among researchers, institutions, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient advocacy groups, financiers, and regulators. The first focus is on appendiceal cancer (AC). AC is exceedingly rare, affecting 1 to 2 people per million, but incidence has been increasing with one study seeing a 232% increase in the U.S. between 2000 and 2016. For some subtypes of AC, management is extrapolated from colorectal cancer (CRC) guidelines, even though it was established that AC is molecularly distinct from CRC. Coordinated collaboration is essential in advancing the field, given that many physicians involved in treating and researching appendiceal cancer often have it as a secondary focus, rather than being their primary area of concentration. In our brief existence, we've successfully facilitated collaborations for appendiceal organoid generation and testing by connecting a leading organoid scientist with a physician who sees AC patients. Additionally, we have established collaborations with a biotech company with an ex-vivo drug testing platform to surgical oncologists for commencing AC susceptibility testing to potential therapeutics. Key components of CANCollaborate include regular communication, frequent workshops, promoting transparency, and sharing research developments, challenges, and results. By forming collaborations among diverse stakeholders, CANCollaborate seeks to diversify and de-risk rare cancer research by eliminating existing disincentives by rewarding collaborative efforts and fostering new forms of incentives, transforming high-risk, low-return efforts into high-return, low-risk endeavors. CANCollaborate invites all stakeholders in the field of cancer research to join by working together, sharing knowledge, and creating a global network. Together we can accelerate progress, eliminate redundancy, and ultimately contribute to the eradication of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++SHP01-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Appendiceal Cancer,Collaboration,HIPEC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jamie Barber<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kyra Itskowitz<sup><\/sup>, Jane Wilkinson<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>CANCollaborate, Bedford, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ef90dcc1-00dc-4a34-b44c-58a4fc4f5326","ControlNumber":"10783","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
