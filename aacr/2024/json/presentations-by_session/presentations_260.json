[{"Abstract":"<b>Introductory Statement:<\/b> The goal is to use an AI model to replicate the human curator&#8217;s response on cancer status in radiology notes of ~20,000 cancer patients.<br \/><b>Introduction<\/b>: MSKCC currently has ~100,000 patients with genomic testing (IMPACT) and continues to accrue more. Clinicians use this genomic data for research but lack clinical structured data to analyze alongside the genomic data. We use a vendor called VASTA Global to manually curate unstructured paragraph text. Depending on the data model, we found that a patient&#8217;s full cancer history can take up to 8 hours to curate. Therefore, we want to implement AI to automate the curation of this data to save time and cost.<br \/>We hope to achieve a faster curation process that allows us to accomplish more than 1 patient a day to catch up to the 100,000 MSK-IMPACT cohort. To decrease the average curation time per patient, we investigated the use of an NLP model to replicate manual curation of the PRISSMM&#8482; ontology field for change in cancer status from radiology reports. Manual curation of radiology reports is time intensive due to curators understanding their cancer status and the volume of scans patients undergo.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>:A pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is fine-tuned using training data using GPUs in IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) platform. The hyperparameters were adjusted using accuracy and F<sub>1<\/sub> metric of evaluation data. Using one vs. rest approach the model is evaluated on held out test data with results shown in table 1.Table 1 includes class 1-5: Progressing\/worsening\/enlarging, stable\/no change, improving\/responding, not stated\/indeterminate or mixed.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b>The weighted AUCROC ~ 0.97, F1 ~ 0.85 and accuracy ~ 93%. These metric scores improve by choosing notes with higher class probabilities only.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>Due to the above 0.9 calculated accuracy this NLP model is successful in replicating the curated results of cancer status and the next steps will be to run this model on a new cohort of patients not yet curated.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{15190EAB-D4CD-4F5E-944F-C7C2C831242A}\"><caption>Cancer Status Metrics<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Class<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prevalence<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Precision<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Recall<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">F<sub aria-hidden=\"false\" data-acsb-hidden=\"false\">1<\/sub> Score<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUCROC<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Accuracy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">38.9%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.0%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.9%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">96.5%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">90.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">89.9%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88.2%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">89.1%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">98.3%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.9%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.6%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">90.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">89.1%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">98.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">96.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">77.0%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">72.6%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">74.7%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94.4%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">92.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.8%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">68.1%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">74.4%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">71.1%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">97.9%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">97.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Weighted Average<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">85%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">86%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">85%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">97%<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">93%<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Cancer progression,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Clinicians use genomic data for research but lack clinical data to analyze together. We use a vendor, VASTA Global to hire curators to manually curate cancer patient&#8217;s core clinical data elements (CCDE) within unstructured\/paragraph text in electronic medical record (EMR) notes.<br \/>CCDE encompasses 122 data elements that include a patient&#8217;s full cancer history that can take up to 1 working day to curate. We collaborated with the Realyze Intelligence Healthcare Solutions vendor to use their AI pipeline to generate the manual curated dataset.<br \/>Realyze generated the CCDE data elements such as histology, pathology site, MMR, TNM staging, ECOG, and KPS for a pilot lung cancer cohort of 150 patients. We manually validated the generated data for 74 out of 150 patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>:The Realyze platform uses a combination of LLMs, ML algorithms and standard terminologies to create a cancer patient model. These models are flexible enough to address the unique needs and challenges of a pan-cancer oncology model. By using standardized FHIR export, results were delivered to a data lake solution and written into a REDCap database to enable human review.<br \/><b>Summary:<\/b>We manually assessed 74 patients. The NLP gave concordant values for MMR, KPS and TNM staging for 100% of the instances. For MMR these were all null values with false negative (FN) of 100% accuracy.

Accurately quantifying specific pre-disease diagnosis factors associated with cancer, as well as predicting cancer through disease trajectories and imaging modalities, presents a complex and formidable challenge. A comprehensive temporal trajectory analysis of cancer diseases, using disease trajectories as an insight within large cohorts in the USA, has not yet been developed. Our analysis used a comprehensive EHR dataset stretching back to 1999, encompassing 293,501,891 records and involving 3,019,978 patients within Ochsner Health, a large integrated health system across the State of Louisiana. According to our investigation, those diagnosed at the ICD chapter level with diseases of the genitourinary system (genitourinary diseases, ICD-10 Chapter 14, relative risk (RR=1.65)) or endocrine nutritional and metabolic diseases (obesity, ICD-10 Chapter 4, RR=1.35) have an elevated risk of being diagnosed with cancer in the subsequent five years. The top four individual diagnosis ICD-10 codes associated with increased risk are N60 (Benign Mammary dysplasia, RR=7.80), M34 (Systemic sclerosis, RR=7.72), R43 (Disturbances of smell and taste, RR=6.93), and R92 (Abnormal and inconclusive findings on diagnostic imaging of the breast, RR=6.59). Furthermore, in our investigation of specific types of cancer risk across 17 cancer types (Breast, Skin, Prostate, Lung, Pancreatic, etc.), we observed that the most common diseases associated with breast and skin cancer involved immune mechanisms (RR=8.35 and 8.68), genitourinary issues (RR=4.13 and 2.48), obesity (RR=3.42 , 3.35), and cardiovascular conditions (ICD-10 Chapter 9, RR=1.73 and 2.19). For prostate cancer, associations were found with obesity (RR=3.50), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, ICD-10 Chapter 1, RR=2.39). Across lung cancer, involvement with chronic viral hepatitis (ICD-10 Chapter 1, RR=4.00), cardiovascular issues (RR=3.52), genitourinary problems (RR=4.13), and obesity (RR=3.42) were indicated. Our comprehensive analysis has the potential to contribute to the early detection, diagnosis trajectories, and improved understanding of the pathological processes underlying cancer in patients worldwide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Diagnosis,Risk factors,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

In this study, we investigated digital pathology TME features of IO outcomes among patients with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) within a real-world dataset.<br \/>Methods<br \/>From the nationwide de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine NSCLC clinico-genomic database, a cohort of 50 <i>EGFR<\/i>\/<i>ALK<\/i>-negative, non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy (mono-IO) or pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin\/cisplatin and pemetrexed (chemo-IO) that had available whole slide images of H&#38;E-stained tissue resection specimens were included. The de-identified data originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care). AI-powered TME characterization models developed by PathAI (Boston, MA; commercially available as PathExplore&#8482;) were deployed on scanned H&#38;E slides to extract a panel of cell- and tissue-level human interpretable features (HIFs). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify digital pathology features or HIFs associated with overall survival.<br \/>Results<br \/>17 HIFs were associated with better survival and 19 HIFs were associated with worse survival among patients treated with mono-IO (p &#60; 0.05). Lymphocyte features were among the HIFs associated with favorable survival, including density of lymphocyte cells in cancer epithelium (hazard ratio (HR) per unit standard deviation (SD) = 0.46 [0.24, 0.88], p-value = 0.02) and proportion of lymphocyte cells relative to total immune cells in cancer epithelium (HR per unit SD = 0.61 [0.39, 0.95], p-value = 0.03). Cell-level features associated with worse survival included density of fibroblast cells in stroma (HR per unit SD = 1.51 [1.01, 2.25], p-value = 0.05). These associations remained after adjusting for tumor mutational burden (TMB) (N = 29 low, 21 high) and PD-L1 status (N = 0 negative, 1 low-positive, 17 high-positive, 32 unknown). Additionally, similar associations were not observed among patients treated with chemo-IO. High lymphocyte density was associated with better survival compared to low lymphocyte density in mono-IO treated patients (adjusted HR per unit SD = 0.36 [0.18, 0.74], p-value = 0.01) but not in chemo-IO treated patients (adjusted HR per unit SD = 1.10 [0.76, 1.60], p-value = 0.6).<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>These results indicate that the composition of TME assessed via digital pathology may have utility in identifying NSCLC patients that will respond to first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors beyond the established IO biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

By integrating these heterogeneous but complementary data, a multimodal approach unites both worlds and could achieve better synergistic results compared to using a single modality. The growing availability of large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with more than 10000 patients made it possible to combine different modalities to train machine learning algorithms which offers great potential to address challenging cancer related research. In this proof of concept initiative we use machine learning approaches within an open-source framework in order to leverage the potential of multimodality (Histopathology Whole Slide Images (WSI) and Genomics\/RNA-seq) to build predictive AI models for cancer type and prostate Gleason score, and provide a potential to develop a quality control step.<br \/>Method: We used matched WSI and RNA-Seq profiles from TCGA, including 11093 samples and 30 cancer types to develop a pancancer classification model using both modalities. For prostate Gleason score prediction 401 patients were available. Both datasets were split into a train (70%) and test (30%) components. We used a late fusion approach where we combined the RNA-seq model (linear SVM) with the WSI model (Resnet18) by multiplying the probability scores of each single-modality model. Model performance was measured with the F1 metric.<br \/>Results: For cancer type prediction, the multimodality model achieved an F1 score of 0.95 on the test set. About 40% of the cancer types benefited from a synergistic effect by combining the two modalities. Cancer types and percent increase in F1 scores, respectively, that benefit most by combining modalities are: Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (4.23%), Cholangiosarcoma (6.66%) and Uterine carcinosarcoma (4%). Interestingly, in other cancer types the combination did not result in improved predictive scores compared to a single modality model, e.g. in Rectum adenocarcinoma, Sarcoma or Stomach adenocarcinoma. For Prostate cancer grading, Gleason score prediction of patterns 3\/4\/5, combined multi modality model earned 0.73 F1 outperforming the single modality models.<br \/>Conclusion: By combining histopathology imaging and omics modalities we demonstrated synergistic effects in predictive power for both cancer-related research questions. We show improved predictive performance in 40% of the classified cancer types by taking both modalities. Imaging or omics modalities alone can be sufficient in some cases and their strengths are very problem-specific.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Cancer,Histopathology,RNA-seq,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.

Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have emerged as a promising platform for selecting efficacious, personalized therapies and developing new oncology drugs. Here, we present a workflow for selecting and validating treatments for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) that integrates orthotopic PDX (O-PDX) models, molecular profiling, machine learning, and in vivo pharmacological validation. Of the nine tumor biopsies collected, seven were successfully developed into O-PDX models (78%) with a median time to establishment of 119 days.

Our community cancer center has collected and sequenced over 5,000 tumor tissue samples from patients with various types of cancer. Since April 2019, we have conducted whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing and stored this data in an internal genomics database. To analyze large patient cohorts, we must first optimize bioinformatic workflows on a smaller scale, which can then be applied to studies of larger populations. Previous studies have shown <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations are associated with an increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We analyzed transcriptomes of a cohort of 30 patients with thyroid cancer, 15 with V600E <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations and 15 wild-type for <i>BRAF, <\/i>for MAPK Pathway Activation Scores (MPAS).<i> <\/i>MPAS serves as a transcriptomic measure of the activation state of the MAPK pathway and has been shown to be a reliable prognostic biomarker of MAPK activity.<br \/>Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from FFPE tumor samples sent to a commercial CLIA-certified laboratory from April 2019 to October 2023. Samples were profiled by whole exome, whole transcriptome sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) was executed using Illumina NovaSeq along with the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V7 bait panel. Resulting data were reported in transcripts per million (TPM) using the Salmon expression pipeline. MPAS was calculated using the expression profile of 10 MAPK-associated genes.<br \/>Results: There was no significant difference in <i>BRAF <\/i>expression levels or<i> <\/i>MAPK activation between patients with <i>BRAF<\/i> mutant and <i>BRAF<\/i> wild-type thyroid cancer (median MPAS scores: -0.09 vs. 0.11, <i>p<\/i>=0.9). This analysis workflow will be repeated with a larger patient population of patients with melanoma in the future; however, the consistency of expression between the groups, the rank-order, and the low variability per group suggest that expression changes related to this <i>BRAF<\/i> mutation may occur upstream or via differential regulation of an indirect pathway. Rank-order statistics and percentiles become more precise as data per tumor type grows.<br \/>Conclusions: Our community cancer center began building an internal genomics database including whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing since 2019. This resource facilitates analysis of patient samples for tumor mutational burden, gene fusions, transcriptomic data, and other important characteristics which could reveal patterns or trends that inform cancer diagnosis and prognosis of other patients.<b> <\/b>Analysis of expression data for patients with advanced solid tumors who have mutations in genes of interest could inform on potential targeted treatments in the future. This study represents a single example of the potential of our internal clinically annotated genomics database.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression analysis,BRAF,Bioinformatics,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

The NTBS technology was introduced in March of 2021. Additionally, we reviewed medical records to assess several factors including the rate of change in care plans as decided by the MCC, compliance of all care plans with national guidelines, and concordance of treatment received with MCC recommendations.

We used SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC) for statistical analyses.<br \/>Results: We identified 151 and 166 thoracic cancer cases before and after implementation of NTBS, respectively. The overall quality of case presentation and discussion, represented by a mean composite score (the summation of individual variables scored on a 1-5 scale, poor to excellent), increased from 56.8 to 82.0 (p&#60;.001). This improvement was also observed across multiple sub-components of the composite score including case history (3.4 vs 4.6), reason for presentation (3.2 vs 4.6), comorbidities\/performance status\/psychosocial information (2.8 vs 4.2), patient views (1.2 vs 3.3), radiology and pathology presentations (3.5 vs 4.8 and 3.2 vs 4.4, respectively), and contribution from surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists (3.9 vs 4.3, 3.3 vs 3.8, and 3.5 vs 3.8, respectively), as well as the moderation by the MCC chair (4.9 vs 5.0). All these results were statistically significant with p&#60;.001. There was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in rate of change in care plans by the MCC, care plan compliance with national guidelines, and concordance of treatment received with MCC recommendations.<br \/>Conclusion: Technology improves the quality of information and discussion at tumor boards.

Diagnosis is delayed in ovarian cancer both because there is no effective screening method and because the symptoms commonly associated with ovarian cancer (i.e., abdominal\/pelvic pain, bloating, loss of appetite, urinary symptoms) are non-specific to the disease. It would be beneficial to develop a flag in the electronic health record (EHR) when a patient&#8217;s healthcare utilization indicates further investigation for possible ovarian cancer is warranted. Thus, we used EHR data to develop a diagnosis score that identifies people who should be further assessed for potential ovarian cancer.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b> EHR data from 211,123 female patients, including 135 ovarian cancer patients, at the University of Michigan Medical System during 2012-2023 were analyzed. Time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were fit to identify the association between ovarian cancer and the diagnostic codes recorded for healthcare visits in the EHR, including the temporal sequence of the diagnostic codes. The beta coefficients for the diagnosis codes from the Cox models were summed to create a weighted diagnosis score for each patient. The weighted diagnosis score was tested for association with ovarian cancer in the same population.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 79 diagnostic codes were statistically significantly associated with ovarian cancer after applying a Bonferroni correction (p&#60;9x10<sup>-5<\/sup>).

The remaining 68 codes were used to construct the diagnosis score. There was a statistically significant trend of increasing rate of ovarian cancer per quartile of the diagnosis score (hazard ratio=3.75, 95% confidence interval 3.50-4.03).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> A score for ovarian cancer diagnosis was developed based on 68 diagnostic codes in the EHR.

Strongest data support the use of chemotherapy for Recurrence Score (RS) &#62; 30, with 25-30 deriving some benefit. Those with intermediate RS 16-25 are thought to have a small benefit from chemotherapy, especially premenopausal patients. Tumor size &#62;5 cm is viewed as a high-risk feature regardless of RS. Our goal is to investigate how patients with uncertainty regarding their anticipated recurrence risk were managed at our institution.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis to explore the management of non-metastatic HER-2 negative hormone sensitive breast cancer patients diagnosed between 01\/2018 &#38;12\/2020 stratifying them into the following study groups of interest: premenopausal (age &#60;50), RS 16-25 compared to RS 26-30 and tumor size &#62;5cm. Patients were compared based on whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy or not. The primary endpoint was the rate of local recurrence.<br \/>Results: The results of our analysis are illustrated in the table. Studying the premenopausal group, 91.3% had RS &#60; 16; yet 35% of them received chemotherapy. Patients with RS &#62; 25 represented 3.2% of the premenopausal group, 12.5% of which did not receive chemotherapy. The six recurrences in the premenopausal group were all from the RS &#60;16 subgroup. Comparing the RS 26-30 to the RS 16-25 group, patients were on average older with tumors being on average smaller, yet more patients were treated with chemotherapy; and there were no recurrences noted in both subgroups. Finally, in the tumor size &#62;5 cm group, 91.4% had RS &#60;16, almost all were premenopausal with many patients being lymph node negative, yet more than half received chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: In our study we demonstrate that in certain subgroups of early-stage breast cancer there is inconsistency in clinical practice when prescribing chemotherapy to patients factoring in their Oncotype DX scores. There is need for larger trials to guide clinicians on using Oncotype DX in those subgroups of patients.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{AF521299-D6BC-4EA3-A000-B3B36A4CCAA6}\"><caption>Characteristics, Treatment Pattern and Outcomes of Patient Groups of Interest<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Characteristics <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Premenopausal (N=506)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>RS 16-25 (N=28)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>RS 26-30 (N=36)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Tumor Size &gt;5 cm (N=47)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Age, Mean (SD)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.65 (5.46)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">44.71 (3.85)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">63.56 (9.65)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.02 (6.14)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Age, Range<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19 - 49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">36 - 49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45 - 79<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">28 - 57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Mean Tumor Size, mm (SD)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.66 (52.21)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29.57 (33.88)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16.88 (11.19)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">83.61 (37.52)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Lymph Nodes Positive, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">91 (18.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2 (7.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16 (34.0%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Received Chemotherapy, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">184 (36.4%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (25.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (36.1%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25 (53.2%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Local Recurrence, n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (1.2%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0.0%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0.0%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Mean Follow- Up, months (SD)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.28 (8.20)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.39 (7.07)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21.21 (11.04)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.26 (8.93)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Predictive biomarkers,Breast cancer,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

This real-world database study aims to evaluate the prevalence of select genomic alterations in stage I-III NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: From the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) V2.1-consortium dataset, we included adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC who had genomic testing using stage I-III NSCLC tissue samples. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline characteristics and the prevalence of select genomic alterations.<br \/>Results: A total of 465 patients were included in this study, of whom 61% were female, 85% were white, 19% were never smokers, and 77% had adenocarcinoma. Less than 2% of the study population had BRAF V600E, HER2 activating mutations, HER2 amplification, MET amplification, HER3 amplification, RET fusion, ALK fusion, or ROS1 fusion. Among genomic alterations with a prevalence of 2% or higher, such as EGFR sensitizing mutations, KRAS G12C, MET exon 14 skipping, STK11, KEAP1, and TP53, some variations in prevalence were observed across baseline patient and disease characteristics such as race, smoking status, and histology (Table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: The prevalence of key oncogenic drivers and its relationship to select baseline disease characteristics among patients with early-stage NSCLC are similar to those of advanced NSCLC observed in other real-world clinico-genomic databases.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{03299661-A7A6-4934-984F-68FD1B876647}\"><caption>Table 1.

We analyzed clinico-genomic databases to evaluate the hypothesis that KRAS mutation status defines subsets of PDAC and CCA with similar genomic characteristics and clinical behavior. Using the genomic data of PDAC and CCA from AACR Project GENIE Cohort version 14.0-public, we analyzed the genomic landscape of four cohorts of pancreatobiliary cancer: KRAS mutated PDAC, KRAS wild-type PDAC, KRAS mutated CCA, and KRAS wild-type CCA. Excluding KRAS mutations, there were 53 gene alterations observed in &#62;2.5% of cases in at least one of the four cohorts. The three most common gene alterations in each cohort were; TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A mutations (KRAS mutated PDAC), TP53, ARID1A, and SMAD4 mutations (KRAS wild-type PDAC), TP53 mutation, CDKN2A deletion and SMAD4 mutation (KRAS mutated CCA), and TP53, ARID1D and IDH1 mutations. (KRAS wild-type CCA) The similarity of gene alteration patterns was evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA) 3D plot and calculation of average Euclidean distance. The PCA plot suggested heterogeneous genomic profiles in KRAS wild-type CCA in contrast to relatively monotonous profiles in KRAS mutated PDAC. The average Euclidean distance between KRAS mutated CCA and KRAS wild-type CCA was significantly longer than that between KRAS mutated CCA and KRAS mutated PDAC (2.00 vs. 1.89, p &#60; 0.001), suggesting that KRAS mutated CCA is more genomically related to KRAS mutated PDAC than KRAS wild-type CCA. The average Euclidean distance between KRAS mutated PDAC and KRAS wild-type PDAC was significantly shorter than that between KRAS wild-type CCA and KRAS wild-type PDAC. To compare the clinical characteristics of the four cohorts, we evaluated the data of patients with stage IV pancreatobiliary cancer, using cBioPortal. The number of cases in each cohort was 1544 (KRAS mutated PDAC), 121 (KRAS wild-type PDAC), 91 (KRAS mutated CCA), and 459 (KRAS wild-type CCA). Median overall survival (OS) was 14.7, 21.5, 10.7, and 15.4 months, respectively. Compared to KRAS wild-type CCA, KRAS mutated CCA had a significantly shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12 - 1.89). The OS of KRAS mutated CCA was shorter than KRAS mutated PDAC (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.68). KRAS wild-type PDAC had a significantly longer OS compared to KRAS mutated PDAC. (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 - 0.92) In conclusion, KRAS mutated CCA has a poor OS and a genomic landscape distinct from KRAS wild-type CCA; it is genomically more similar to KRAS mutated PDAC. KRAS wild-type PDAC has a better OS than KRAS mutated PDAC, though it was not genomically similar to KRAS wild-type CCA. Therapeutic approaches stratified by KRAS mutation status should be considered for pancreaticobiliary cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,KRAS,Pancreatic cancer,Cholangiocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.
