Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) shows demographic variations, being more common in females and Asian populations. Epidemiological studies have also identified environmental risk factors for LCINS, including exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and air pollution. As part of the Sherlock-Lung project (current data freeze of 1217 samples), we generated deep WGS data from a large international cohort of 871 treatment-na&#239;ve LCINS recruited from 28 locations across four continents. Our cohort allowed mapping the genomic landscape operative in lung cancer histologies commonly found in never smokers, including adenocarcinomas (n=737) and carcinoids (n=61), as well as other histologies rarely attributed to never smokers (n=73). Information on passive smoking was collected for 458 patients, with 250 being exposed to secondhand smoke. We identified driver alterations and performed mutational signature analyses for single base substitutions (SBS), indels, doublet base substitutions (DBS), copy number alterations, and structural variants.<br \/>We detected eighteen SBS signatures, with eight not previously linked to LCINS, including SBS4, associated with smoking but also observed in lifelong non-smokers exposed to different environmental mutagens, such as indoor pollution. Several additional signatures were detected in other variant types, including a novel indel signature. Notably, secondhand smoke exposure corresponded to increased SBS burden, although it was not associated with specific signatures. In contrast, we observed a signature-specific association of air pollution (measured as PM<sub>2.5<\/sub> exposure) with SBS, indel, and DBS burden. SBS4 and correlated signatures ID3 and DBS2 were positively associated with PM<sub>2.5<\/sub> exposure. Similarly, clock-like signature SBS5 was highly correlated with PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>, potentially acting as a readout of a promotion mechanism where lung cells undergo more cell divisions in individuals living in highly polluted areas. We also observed variability across histologies and ancestries for signatures and driver mutations, including enrichment of signatures SBS17b and SBS40a as well as <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in adenocarcinomas from Europeans; aristolochic-acid associated signature SBS22a, and <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations in adenocarcinomas from East Asians; and signature SBS8 and <i>ARID1A<\/i> mutations in carcinoids from Europeans.<br \/>The unprecedented size of our cohort allowed us to refine the prevalence and intensity of the driver mutations and mutational signatures involved in LCINS, as well as their variability across ancestries, geographical locations, and histologies. Our results indicate that air pollution may act as both initiator and promoter of neoplastic expansion of LCINS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Mutational signatures,Air pollution,Secondhand smoke exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Marcos Diaz-Gay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tongwu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Azhar Khandekar<sup>2<\/sup>, Burçak Otlu<sup>3<\/sup>, Shuvro Nandi<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher  D.

A total of twelve clinics from two healthcare systems (6 clinics each) participated in Montana, Wyoming and Washington State. Clinics were cluster-randomized to one of two engagement approaches: 1) point of care screening (POC), conducted by clinic staff when a patient came in for their appointment and 2) direct patient engagement (DPE), where letter and email outreach facilitated online home screening. Patients who completed screening and met pre-specified personal and family history criteria were offered GT via a home-delivered saliva kit at no cost. The two primary outcomes of the trial were the fraction of active clinic patients who 1) completed the risk assessment tool and 2) completed GT. Logistic regression models were used to compare POC and DPE, allowing for overdispersion and including clinic as a design factor. Analyses in the screened population were adjusted for age, sex, personal and\/or family history of cancer, and healthcare system. Over a 12-month engagement window, 95,623 patients were seen in the 12 clinics (Table 1). The POC approach resulted in a higher proportion screened for hereditary risk (19.1% vs. 8.7%), but a similar proportion completed testing (1.5% vs. 1.6%). Notably, the rate of testing among eligible patients approached via POC was approximately half the rate observed with DPE (24.7% vs. 44.7%). POC screen completers were less likely to have a personal history of cancer (9.1% vs. 10.7%), a significant family history of cancer (9.5% vs. 12.8%), and, if eligible, order a test kit (33.8% vs. 58.1%). Overall, a POC approach resulted in higher screening rates for familial cancer risk but a similar fraction completing GT, with DPE screeners self-selecting due to greater personal and\/or family history of cancer. Analyses are ongoing to examine patient, clinic and system-level factors predicting screening and testing uptake, which can inform best practices for population-based hereditary cancer screening efforts. <table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{80D3BE62-DE2B-4AC8-8013-DFB2C4460865}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b> <\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>POC<\/b> <b>% (N)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>DPE<\/b> <b>% (N)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Unadjusted OR<\/b> <b>(POC vs DPE)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Adjusted OR *<\/b> <b>(POC vs DPE)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>p-value<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Patient Denominator<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>51,693<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>43,930<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Completed Screening<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19.1% (9892)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8.7% (3813)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.0074<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Completed GT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.5% (757)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.6% (717)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.89<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Screened Participants<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>9892<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3813<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% screened with any personal cancer history<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.1% (902)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10.7% (406)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.77<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% of screened with significant** family history of cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9.5% (935)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12.8% (487)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.69<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% of screened found eligible for GT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31.0% (3070)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">42.0% (1603)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.65<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Participants eligible for GT<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>3070<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1603<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% of eligible who ordered test kit<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.8% (1039)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">58.1% (932)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.43<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">% of eligible who completed GT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24.7% (757)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">44.7% (717)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.49<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#60;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>*Adjusted ORs - Adjusted for age, sex, personal cancer history, family cancer history, healthcare system.**Significant family history: 2 or more first degree relatives with a high-risk cancer","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-13 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,genetic testing,health services,implementation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Elizabeth M.

Melanomas display typically high mutation burden&#8212;a hallmark associated with immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) sensitivity&#8212;but can still evade ICBT. These melanoma phenotypes likely relate to embryonic neural crest cells, a population of cells from which melanocytes arise. For instance, BRAF inhibition-evading melanoma cells adopt neural crest-like states. However, the exact embryonic lineage underlying BRAFi resistance remains unknown as does its relationship with any neural crest-like states that underlie ICBT resistance. To discover such states, we used a mouse fluorescent reporter model of melanoblast development in which melanocyte-specific GFP is driven by the dopachrome tautomerase promoter (iDct-GFP). Embryonic day (E) 11.5 and 15.5 melanoblasts were isolated and sequenced using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). These time-points enriched for cells migrating from the dermis to epidermis (at E11.5) or for cells colonizing the hair follicle (at E15.5). These characteristics could help metastatic progression, namely migration across the basement membrane in early invasive melanomas and colonization of metastatic sites. We classified these embryonic melanocytes and their precursors into multiple clusters which in turn were grouped into four key lineages: Neural Progenitor, Schwann Cell Progenitor (SCP), Mesencyhmal (Mes) and Melanocytes (Mel). To detect the presence of these states in tumors, we derived developmental gene modules (DGMs): sets of genes that were preferentially co-expressed in each embryonic cell state. DGMs stratified TCGA samples; SCP-high and Mes-high subtypes were associated with worse survival compared to Mel-high tumors. Moreover, SCP-high tumors had lower T cell infiltration, and were associated with higher NGFR expression, a known marker of ICBT resistance. High expression of SCP DGMs was associated with poor response to anti-PD1 ICBT. Targeting factors underlying the SCP state might therefore sensitize tumours to ICBT. Mes DGMs on the other hand were associated with targeted therapy resistance. Cross-referencing DGMs with published RNA-seq data from melanoma cell lines suggest that SCP and Mes DGMs are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Together, these observations suggest that the SCP state is implicated in the phenomenon of inflammation-induced de-differentiation, a process by which melanomas are able to evade ICBT. Our identification of the SCP and Mes states, along with a deeper understanding of their transcriptional programs and signaling pathways, may reveal clinically actionable targets to disrupt immuno- or targeted-therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Vishaka Gopalan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chun Wai Wong<sup>2<\/sup>, Chi-Ping Day<sup>1<\/sup>, Eva Perez-Guijarro<sup>3<\/sup>, Maxwell  P.

Cancer cells are known to undergo significant alterations in the cancer genome including changes in the accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). These alterations could lead to novel cancer vulnerabilities but chromatin accessibility has not been systematically profiled in DepMap. Profiling hundreds of cell lines individually for ACRs would require large resources. Here we show that we can efficiently profile hundreds of cell lines using two single-cell approaches developed by our labs. SHARE-seq is a single-cell high-throughput combinatorial indexing method to measure both chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq), and gene expression (scRNA-seq) in the same single cell. MIX-Seq is an approach that leverages the ability to pool hundreds of unique cancer cell lines and then apply single-cell genomics across cell populations from each cell line, resolving its identity using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles. Here, we used a combination of MIX-seq (pooling cell lines) and SHARE-seq (scATAC-seq and RNA-seq) to simultaneously profile 500 unique cell lines covering 110 lineages within 22 cancer types at the single-cell level. Encouragingly, in a UMAP representation of the data, cancer cell lines cluster by lineage. Interestingly, we identified hundreds of thousands of peaks within cis-regulatory elements (CREs), 1\/3 of which are unique to cancer cell lines and not present in normal cell types. Using published tools, we calculated an ATAC-seq gene activity prediction score per cell line. To identify cancer vulnerabilities associated with ACRs changes, we combined the ATAC-seq gene-activity predictions with RNAseq-based features to construct machine-learning models of cancer dependency scores. We found that the prediction accuracy for multiple dependencies improved with the addition of the ATAC-seq-based scores, indicating that chromatin accessibility provides information beyond gene expression. Additional analyses are underway to create other features. Overall, we have generated a large high-quality dataset to simultaneously map the chromatin accessibility in hundreds of cancer cell lines. Importantly, the chromatin accessibility adds to other omics profiling to identify biomarkers of response and understand how changes in chromatin can lead to new vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Patricia Borck<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kirsty Wienand<sup><\/sup>, Fabiana Duarte<sup><\/sup>, Alvin Qin<sup><\/sup>, Ruochi Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Juliana Babu<sup><\/sup>, Simone Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Maffa<sup><\/sup>, Max Horlbeck<sup><\/sup>, Rojesh Shrestha<sup><\/sup>, Joshua Dempster<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Roth<sup><\/sup>, Catarina Campbell<sup><\/sup>, Jason Buenrostro<sup><\/sup>, Francisca Vazquez<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3a6e249c-db7e-469c-8cd0-eb6640c6636e","ControlNumber":"10806","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

In the absence of oncogenic mutation, the ADM lesions resolve and reform the acinar compartment (we terms this as adaptive ADM). However, in the presence of oncogenic <i>Kras<\/i> mutations (we terms this as oncogenic ADM), acinar cells undergo neoplastic transformation after ADM and evolve to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a well-known precursor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Herein, we explore the role of the Paired-Related Homeobox1 transcriptional factor (<i>Prrx1<\/i>) in adaptive ADM and the relationship between <i>Prrx1<\/i> and mutant Kras in oncogenic ADM.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated<i> <\/i>tamoxifen-inducible <i>Ptf1aCre<sup>ERT<\/sup>;Rosa26<sup>YFP\/YFP<\/sup><\/i> (abbreviated as Prrx1<sup>cWT<\/sup>) mice and bred in the <i>Prrx1<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i> allele to make (abbreviated <i>Prrx1<sup>cKO<\/sup><\/i>) mice and subjected them to caerulin (CCK analog) induced acute pancreatitis, a well-estabished model. We created a time course for both mouse genotypes subjected to acute pancreatitis for histological analysis. Quantification of ADM was performed through automated cell-counting of immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Then, we performed 3D <i>ex vivo<\/i> acinar cultures of <i>Prrx1<sup>cWT<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>and <i>Prrx1<sup>cKO<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>mice. We used an exogenous adenoviral vector to induce Cre expression and knock out <i>Prrx1<\/i>, using an empty vector as a control.

Additionally, using a novel nucleofection protocol, we demonstrated that overexpression of the Prrx1b isoform (associated with a progenitor cell state) leads to a notable increase in ADM.

Despite the favorable complete remission (CR) rates of around 50% for r\/r DLBCL and up to 90% for r\/r B-ALL, a notable challenge persists as more than half of patients experiencing CR after CD19 CAR-T cells treatment encounter relapse within a year, attributed to inadequate CAR-T persistence in both indications. Urgent attention is required to devise innovative strategies to overcome these challenges. Recently, we developed metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T cells expressing IL-10 can enhance OXPHOS metabolism, proliferation, and persistence of CAR-T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. Significantly, these IL-10-expressing CAR-T cells trigger stem-like memory responses in various lymphoid organs, leading to robust tumor eradication and durable protection. Motivated by these promising findings, an open-label, single arm, investigator-initiated trial (IIT, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05715606, NCT05747157) was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of newly developed metabolically armed IL-10-expressing CD19 CAR-T (product name: Meta10-19 infusion) for treating patients with r\/r DLBCL or r\/r B-ALL.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: From Feb 2023 to Dec 2023, this IIT clinical trial evaluated Meta10-19 infusion in adult patients with r\/r DLBCL or r\/r B-ALL.

PVRL2 interacts with the co-inhibitory receptor PVRIG that is expressed on T cells and NK cells, inhibiting their function. This interaction has thus become the presumed mechanism for PVRL2&#8217;s immunoinhibitory function. Therapeutic development targeting the PVRL2 pathway has primarily focused on the receptor PVRIG, with two anti-PVRIG antibodies currently undergoing Phase 1\/2 clinical trials (NCT03667716, NCT04570839, NCT05746897). However, to date, very few studies have directly investigated the role of PVRL2, and whether PVRL2 indeed acts through PVRIG hasn&#8217;t been formally tested.<br \/>Our recent work reveals the crucial role of PVRL2 in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses across multiple syngeneic mouse models. CRISPR-directed deletion of PVRL2 robustly reduced tumor growth in an immune-dependent manner, with an even greater effect than seen with the deletion of the prominent checkpoint, PD-L1. Specifically, our findings suggest that PVRL2 functions by suppressing CD8 T and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, the impact of PVRL2 on tumor growth in our study is certainly much more significant than observed in previous work on PVRIG. To follow up on this interesting finding and determine whether the PVRL2&#8217;s impact on immune cells acts through PVRIG, we generated <i>Pvrig <\/i>KO mice. Surprisingly, we found that PVRL2&#8217;s function is largely independent of PVRIG, as it still robustly promotes tumor growth even in the absence of<i> <\/i>PVRIG, indicating PVRIG-independent mechanisms. We further demonstrate that PVRL2 operates in parallel to the PVR-TIGIT pathway, another important immunoregulatory pathway in the Nectin family. Combined deletion of PVR or PVRIG with PVRL2 loss did not further suppress tumor growth, while combined TIGIT blockade with PVRL2 loss resulted in the most substantial reduction in tumor growth.<br \/>These findings strongly indicate the existence of additional unknown receptors mediating PVRL2&#8217;s function that remain to be discovered. Importantly, our study uncovers PVRL2&#8217;s central role in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses through mechanism outside its presumed receptor PVRIG, providing a compelling rationale for directly targeting PVRL2 itself. Combining PVRL2 and TIGIT targeting results in a near-complete block in tumor growth, offering a novel and promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy through the combinatorial targeting of PVRL2 and TIGIT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiuling Yang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Li Wang<sup><\/sup>, James Byrnes<sup><\/sup>, Lisa Kirkemo<sup><\/sup>, Hannah Driks<sup><\/sup>, Cassandra Belair<sup><\/sup>, Oscar Aguilar<sup><\/sup>, Lewis Lanier<sup><\/sup>, Jim Wells<sup><\/sup>, Lawrence Fong<sup><\/sup>, Robert Blelloch<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UCSF - University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c3132eaf-a288-40b0-92a3-65e7d71e93ff","ControlNumber":"9854","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
