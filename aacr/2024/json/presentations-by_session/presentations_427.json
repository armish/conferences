[{"Abstract":"The G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR), CXCR4, is ubiquitously expressed in malignant tumor tissues, and controls migration and other tumor survival mechanisms upon interaction with its chemokine agonist, stromal cell-derived 1&#945; (SDF1&#945;). The CXCR4\/SDF1&#945; axis is relevant to shaping the tumor microenvironment mainly the metastatic spread of primary tumors to distal organs and immune response; thus, expression of CXCR4 in tumors is vital to tumor aggressiveness, survival probability, and metastasis-associated mortality. CXCR4 signals through a homodimer, but also forms heterodimers with other chemokine and non-chemokine GPCRs. We&#8217;ve demonstrated that CXCR4 forms a heterodimer with the GPCR, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), in human breast and prostate cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. The cannabinoid system has earned interest as anticancer therapeutic targets by modulating growth, migration, angiogenesis, <i>etc<\/i>. In our model, CXCR4-mediated, pro-tumor signaling was reduced by the physical heterodimer, and the dimer was induced by simultaneous treatment with agonists (<i>SDF1&#945; and AM1241<\/i>) for respective receptors. The resultant heterodimer negatively interfered with migration, cytoskeletal rearrangement, motility associated proteins, and signaling that coordinates movement. Given that cannabinoids have been shown to reduce metastasis and profession of clinical tumors, <b>we hypothesize that a heterodimer of CXCR4 and CB2 disrupts CXCR4-mediated metastasis, and ultimately, decrease tumor progression <i>in vivo<\/i><\/b>.Herein, we tested our hypothesis in an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of spontaneous metastasis NSG male mice. Luciferase-containing human prostate cancer cells (DU145 RFP\/Luc) were implanted subcutaneously. Once tumors reached 40mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized by volume, weight and age, and divided into 4 treatments: vehicle, SDF1&#945;, AM124, and SDF1&#945;\/AM124(combo) for daily intraperitoneal injections. Tumors reaching 400mm<sup>3<\/sup> were excised, and treatments continued for 3 weeks. Spontaneous metastasis was monitored via IVIS imaging at 2- and 3-weeks post-tumor removal. We observed reduced tumor growth, and decreased incidence rates of metastasis to the lung in the combination treatment group, which, based on our <i>in vitro<\/i> data, is representative of a CXCR4\/CB2 heterodimer. This novel definition of heterodimerization could reveal and exploit new mechanisms for CXCR4 regulation in tumor metastasis. The CXCR4\/CB2 heterodimer may attenuate responses triggered individually by CXCR4 without toxicity and side effects experienced with current CXCR4 antagonists.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,CXCR4,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

We discovered a biological phenomenon referred to as Adherent-to-Suspension Transition (AST) that reprograms adherent cells into suspension cells via aberrant induction of hematopoietic transcriptional regulators, which are hijacked by solid tumor cells to disseminate into CTCs. During dissemination, tumor microenvironment triggers epigenetic alteration of AST factors in the invasive front of solid tumors to evoke spontaneous cell-matrix dissociation, acquire anoikis resistance, and bypass immune surveillance of CTCs, however, in the absence of lineage differentiation and EMT. Using mouse models and de novo metastatic patient specimens, we uncovered how Adherent-Suspension Plasticity (ASP) dictates anchorage plasticity during the dissemination and colonization process within the metastatic cascade. Finally, we demonstrate therapeutic strategies that target AST factors to specifically abrogate CTC formation and suppress distant metastases. Together, these findings underscore an important early mechanism of how cancer cells spread and highlight novel targets for the development of anti-metastatic therapy. Furthermore, AST opens unexplored scenarios how reprogramming anchorage dependency orchestrates physiological events such as development, organ morphogenesis and immune cell activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Metastasis,Cancer prevention,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Our group has discovered KBU2046, a selective inhibitor of cell motility (Nature Communications 2018). We conducted a time-course immunofluorescent staining to investigate the impact of KBU2046 on the cell adhesion and motility components of human prostate cancer cells. Our objective was to compare our findings with our proteomic analysis results in order to gain insights into the novel molecular mechanisms of KBU2046 in modulating cell motility.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Proteomics analysis. We treated PC3 cells with KBU2046 or vehicle (N=3\/group) and quantified protein expression using Liquid Chromatography\/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). In separate experiments (N=4), we performed LC-MS\/MS after Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling on isolated membrane fractions. We used bioinformatics tools, including Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, to characterize significantly differentially expressed proteins upon KBU2046 treatment and tried to verify by Western blots. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Following treatment of PC3, 1532CPTX, and 1532NPTX cells with KBU2046 or vehicle at various intervals, cells were stained for &#946;1, &#946;5 integrin, actin, and DAPI. Images were acquired by a Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope.<br \/>Results: The proteomics analysis demonstrated that KBU2046 was having a major impact on cell motility processes, consistent with our prior functional studies. Despite conducting Western blot analysis, we could not confirm the candidate proteins linked to cell adhesion. Using IF, we examined changes in cell adhesion proteins over time in response to KBU2046 treatment. The time-course IF investigation revealed that KBU2046 affects adhesion proteins kinetically by altering their subcellular localization over time rather than altering their total expression level. This finding corroborates KBU2046's known effects on cell motility, demonstrating that a kinetic-based analysis yields important new information not directly represented in a single time point screen, although functionally related.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of integrating proteomic and imaging methodologies to procure a holistic comprehension of the molecular mechanisms that govern cell behavior, especially those that relate to highly dynamic processes. Through these methodologies, we have obtained a more profound understanding of how cells regulate motility and how that process can be therapeutically modulated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Motility,Prevention,Therapeutic target,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

Intercellular communication between cancer cells and with cells in their environment plays a significant function in tumor progression. In fact, secreted factors like cytokines and extracellular vesicles (EVs) can either halt or stimulate tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. We have previously reported, that the integrin B3 (ITGB3) is required for metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo (Sese et al. Oncotarget, 2017). We furthermore demonstrated, that EVs mediated colony growth is dependent on ITGB3 and that endocytosis mediated uptake of EVs relies on the interaction of ITGB3 with integrin av (ITGav) and heparan sulphated glycoproteins (HSPGs) (Fuentes et al. Nat. Commun., 2021).<br \/><b>OBJECTIVE: <\/b>The objective of this work is focused on identifying inhibitors targeting the ITGav\/B3\/HSPGs complex to prevent extracellular vesicle uptake in cancer cells and to test their ability to prevent metastasis.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>METHODOLOGY<\/b>. Inhibitors targeting ITGB3\/ITGAV or HSPGs were either commercially available or obtained through collaborations and single chain antibodies (scFv) were produced in house. Inhibition of fluorescent labeled EVs was determined by FACS analysis or Incucyte based measurements and the efficacy of inhibitors was determined in a dose dependent manner. Toxicity of inhibitors was studied by crystal violet-based assay in normal and tumor cell lines. Tail vein injection of luciferase labeled MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice was used as model to study metastatic diseases under treatment with the identified inhibitors. Metastasis formation was monitored by bioluminescence imaging and lungs were examined pathologically at end point. Overall survival was determined.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Among the tested Integrin and HSPGs targeting compounds, we identified an integrin-binding antibody, an integrin binding scFv, an RGD-mimetic compound and an HSPGs-binding peptide as inhibitors of EV uptake. Inhibition was validated in a dose dependent manner and toxicity studies did not show adverse effects. Three of those inhibitors, targeting either ITGB3\/ITGAV or HSPGs were tested in mice models in vivo and all inhibitors could significantly reduce the formation of metastasis and strongly increase the overall survival.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>CONCLUSION: <\/b>We have identified four drug candidates that target the ITGav\/B3\/HSPGs complex and are able to prevent EV uptake, demonstrating that EV uptake is a druggable process. Even more, the inhibitors tested in vivo could strongly reduce metastasis formation and increase overall survival. This data supports our hypothesis, that targeting EV mediated intercellular communication is a valuable approach to combat cancer metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metastasis,Integrins,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of (neo-)adjuvant therapies against DCCs remains uncertain. Here, we harnessed novel patient-derived ex vivo models to identify promising candidate therapies targeting DCCs and explored the impact of the unique microenvironment of metastatic target organs on the phenotypes and drug responses of DCCs. We screened disaggregated lymph node (LN) or bone marrow (BM) samples from melanoma, breast, and bladder cancer patients without distant metastasis for the presence of DCCs. Then, we expanded DCCs in patient-derived xenografts, adherent cell culture, or three-dimensional culture. LN and BM suspensions were spiked with allogeneic and autologous tumor cells to unravel the impact of different metastatic niches on DCCs. Automated high-throughput microscopy of disaggregated patient LNs was used to evaluate drug effects on DCCs in the autologous microenvironment. We established 13 cell lines from melanoma DCCs, three organoid models from breast cancer DCCs, and two organoid models from bladder cancer DCCs. The origin of each model was confirmed by assessment of histomorphology, marker expression, and genetic profiles. We screened a comprehensive panel of chemotherapeutics, targeted drugs, and antibody-drug conjugates across these in vitro models, and thereby identified compounds with the potential to eradicate DCCs. We further found that the LN and BM microenvironments differentially affected phenotypes and drug responses of cancer cells particularly when immune modulating drugs were used. Of note, ex vivo drug testing, performed directly on LN suspensions containing DCCs, revealed candidate therapeutics within a time frame acceptable for personalized treatment decisions. In conclusion, we report that the microenvironment of the specific metastatic niche impacts DCC drug responsiveness. Employing DCC-derived in vitro models in drug response assays that include specific niches may help to develop (neo)-adjuvant, personalized therapies and to discover novel therapeutics against metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical testing,Patient-derived models,Disseminated tumor cells,Ex vivo drug screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>L.

LIN28B, an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation, has garnered significant interest in recent cancer research. Our lab has established that LIN28B is an oncogene and promotes CRC metastasis. However, the exact mechanisms through which LIN28B exerts these effects remain elusive.<br \/>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT signaling pathway is altered in 50-70% of CRCs and is characterized by <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene mutations in 20-30% of CRC cases. <i>PIK3CA<\/i> encodes the catalytic subunit p110&#945; of the PI3K&#945; enzyme, which is critical for PI3K\/AKT signaling. Activation of this pathway is associated with worse CRC prognosis. Among the components of this signaling cascade, the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is a crucial downstream effector, playing a pivotal role in protein synthesis and cell growth. Despite the frequent occurrence of <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations in CRC, targeted therapies for <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutant CRC are lacking. Alpelisib, a PI3K&#945;-specific inhibitor approved by the FDA for a subset of <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutant breast cancers, remains largely unassessed in CRC. <i>We hypothesize that LIN28B-mediated CRC metastasis is facilitated by the activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway, representing a potential target for Alpelisib or other related inhibitors<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Our data indicate that LIN28B expression in CRC cells promotes liver metastasis in mouse models of metastatic CRC (mCRC). Furthermore, LIN28B expression activates the PI3K\/AKT pathway, as measured by an AKT phosphorylation array. Treatment of CRC cells with SC79, a pan-AKT activator, enhanced cell migration and invasiveness. Similarly, <i>Villin<sup>Cre<\/sup>;R26<sup>Pik3ca<\/sup><\/i> transgenic mice, expressing a constantly active mutant form of PI3K&#945; in the intestinal epithelium, demonstrated crypt hyperplasia and an amplified propensity for tumorigenesis, mirroring the effects of LIN28B expression in CRC. Importantly, Alpelisib effectively hinders LIN28B-driven CRC progression in cell lines, transgenic mice-derived organoids, and mCRC mouse models, as well as the growth rate of CRC patient-derived organoids (PDOs). The effects observed with Alpelisib treatment were replicated with inhibition of S6K using either LY25284702 or PF4708671. Moreover, a combination of low-dose Alpelisib with low-dose LY25284702 or PF4708671 synergistically restricted the growth of PDOs.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data provide compelling evidence that the PI3K\/AKT pathway regulates LIN28B-mediated CRC metastasis, and its inhibition by Alpelisib is feasible. This underscores the potential for precision medicine in CRC, offering targeted therapies to <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutant CRC patients who lack specific treatment options. Furthermore, our study highlights the clinical advantages of combined inhibition strategies for improved anti-metastatic outcomes, a field in dire need of interventions in mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Alpelisib,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

The most common histological type is endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). While the majority of patients present with early-stage and low-grade EEC and have an excellent prognosis, a subset develops distant recurrence derived from EEC after initial treatment of the primary. However, the exact mechanism of distant metastasis and recurrence from EEC is still unclear. In addition, the lack of suitable pre-clinical models is a significant barrier to research for distant metastasis and recurrent cancer derived from EEC. Our preclinical EEC model, the ablation of both <i>Mig-6<\/i> and <i>Pten <\/i>in the uterus<i> <\/i>(<i>Pgr<sup>cre\/+<\/sup>Mig-6<sup>f\/f<\/sup>Pten<sup>f\/f<\/sup><\/i>;<i><sup> <\/sup>Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i>), dramatically accelerates the development of EEC compared to single ablation of either gene. The ablation of both <i>Mig-6<\/i> and <i>Pten<\/i> in the uterus (<i>Pgr<sup>cre\/+<\/sup>Mig-6<sup>f\/f<\/sup> Pten<sup>f\/f<\/sup>; Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice) displayed distant metastases into the ovary, diaphragmatic skeletal muscle, lymph node, and lung. However, the <i>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice exhibited endometrial cancer without distant metastases. After hysterectomy of EEC confined to uterus, <i>Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice exhibited recurrent EEC in abdomen and lung. To identify prognostic factors for distant metastatic and recurrent EEC, we performed transcriptomic analysis in endometrial hyperplasia, a precancerous condition, from <i>Pten<sup>d\/d <\/sup><\/i>and <i>Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice. Our transcriptomic analysis identified that cholesterol biosynthesis was the most significantly activated pathway in <i>Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice compared to <i>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice. Statins, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are the most common cholesterol-lowering drugs. We evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on tumorigenesis and recurrence of EEC. <i>Mig-6<sup>d\/d<\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice treated with atorvastatin displayed significant reduction of tumor size compared to vehicle treated group. For vehicle-treated group, our pathological analysis revealed EEC outside the uterus, therefore EEC had disseminated to involve the ovary, diaphragmatic skeletal muscle, lymph node, and lung. However, EEC was confined to the uterus in the atorvastatin treated group. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment reduced the rate of recurrent EEC development. This data demonstrated that atorvastatin has a remarkable inhibitory effect on metastasis and recurrence of EEC in <i>Mig-6<sup>d\/d <\/sup>Pten<sup>d\/d<\/sup><\/i> mice. Our results suggest that statins suppress development of distant metastasis and recurrence in mouse models of EEC with <i>Pten<\/i> and <i>Mig-6 <\/i>deficiency by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Metastasis,Recurrence,Statins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

A common resistance mechanism to targeted therapy is upregulation of the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway, which has also been shown to promote the development of melanoma brain metastases. Historically, AKT inhibitors have failed in the clinic due to their limited efficacy or intolerable toxicity. Proteomic analysis comparing non-metastatic vs brain metastatic primary tumors in mice revealed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as an AKT1 specific effector and a potential alternative therapeutic target. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that localizes primarily to focal adhesions to regulate cell migration. To determine whether targeting FAK alone or in combination with the RAF\/MEK inhibitor avutometinib reduces brain metastases and prolongs survival, we utilized both autochthonous and syngeneic melanoma mouse models. Mice with either subcutaneous tumors or established brain metastases were treated with FAK inhibitor, RAF\/MEK inhibitor, or the combination of FAK and RAF\/MEK inhibitors. Each cohort was assessed for tumor onset, growth, metastasis, and survival. Our results show that combined RAF\/MEK\/FAK inhibition significantly delays tumor onset, causes regression of established tumors, prevents the development of brain metastases, promotes the regression of established brain metastases, and prolongs survival. In addition, patient-derived BRAF V600E melanoma xenograft mouse models resistant to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib, were sensitive to combined RAF\/MEK\/FAK blockade. The addition of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib to these models further enhanced the effect on tumor growth. These results support the initiation of a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the RAF\/MEK inhibitor avutometinib in combination with the FAK inhibitor defactinib in patients with brain metastases from cutaneous melanoma. Additionally, we are assessing non-canonical roles of FAK in modulating the tumor microenvironment to determine whether avutometinib and defactinib also enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Karly  A.

Although controversial, in some cases devices have been developed that mimic the electromagnetic fields (EMF) that are emitted from people when delivering BTs. We previously reported that BT significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells and liver metastasis in their relevant animal models mediated in part through modification of the cell cycle, reductions in cell voltage potentials, and down regulation of PI3K\/Akt pathways. We expanded this research to examine the potential role of BT in anti-invasiveness in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and animal models. We found that PANC-1 cells treated with BT (15 min) displayed 55% less invading cells than that of untreated incubator control and sham control cells (P &#60; 0.001). Similar results were observed in human PDAC L3.7 cells and mouse pancreatic cancer KPCY cells. These experiments were replicated 8 times for Panc-1 cells and 4 times for L3.7 cells. Additionally, migration capacity was tested using the transwell migration and scratch assays. Consistent with the result of cell invasion assays, BT treatment also led to significant reduction of migration of PANC-1 and L3.7 cells by 34% and 41%, respectively, compared to sham controls. Two additional therapists independently replicated the anti-invasiveness and anti-migratory effects of BT on these PDAC cells. This suggests the replicability of these findings across studies and therapists. In a repeated PANC-1 mouse orthotopic model, we found that only a third of BT treated mice had visible liver nodules whereas liver metastasis was observed in more than half of mice in the untreated colony control and sham control groups. Furthermore, BT treatment significantly reduced liver tumor burden by 73% compared to that of the sham control group (p &#60; 0.05), which was similar to that observed in the previous study. Similar to the prior PANC-1 mouse model, in the current study BT treatment had only a moderate impact on the growth of primary pancreatic tumor. We assessed certain markers indicative of cell status as well as pathways associated with migration and invasion and these will be presented at the meeting. Our findings suggest that exposure to BT reduced cellular invasion and migration processes and profoundly reduced metastasis of pancreatic tumor in an animal model.

The high metastasizing capability of TNBCs is in correlation with the poor oxygenation of the cancerous breast tissue. This leads to the activation of the hypoxia-inducible-factor 1 (HIF-1), which induces multiple target genes that are involved in tumor progression and metastasis formation. This makes HIF-1 an attractive drug target, however, HIF-1 inhibitors failed if applied in monotherapy. Therefore, our aim is to investigate the combined therapeutic effect of HIF-1 inhibitor acriflavine and paclitaxel, a commonly used taxane in TNBC treatment. The synergy assessment of the two drugs was carried out by utilizing Sulforhodamine B assay on TNBC cell lines. The <i>in vivo<\/i> toxicity and efficacy of the drug combination was tested on NOD SCID mice with orthotopically inoculated MDA-MB-231 cell line. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of multiple genes involved in tumor progression was performed by mRNA and protein expression level assessment with qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. HIF-1 stimulation was achieved by either incubating the cells at 1% oxygen level or through CoCl2 treatment. The<i> in vitro <\/i>mRNA expression studies demonstrated that acriflavin possesses a hypoxic-effect-mitigating property on the expression of metastasis-involved- and HIF-1 target genes. Acriflavine alleviated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of TNBC cells by increasing the expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin. At protein level, we detected decrease in HIF-1alpha and Phospho-Protein kinase B (Akt) and increase in p53 tumor suppressor gene expression in response to acriflavine treatment. We further established MDA-MB-231 xenograft model in mice for investigating <i>in vivo<\/i> toxicity and efficacy. The drug combination efficiently reduced the tumor size and the macrometastasis formation compared to the control groups. The protein analysis of frozen tumor tissue samples indicated that the combination therapy decreased the HIF-1alpha expression and the amount of Phospho-Akt and Phospho-Mitogen-activated protein kinases (pMAPK\/pERK) in CoCl2treated mice. Additionally, expression of epithelial markers increased and that of mesenchymal markers decreased. The combination therapy led to a decrease in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) as well. To conclude, we identified a novel drug combination which can efficiently combat TNBC by inhibiting HIF-1 signaling, mitigating cell migration and metastasis formation and suppressing the activation of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK pathways.

Novel systemic therapies for metastatic cancer are urgently needed. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced signaling molecule in the human body with demonstrated pharmacological activities, including organ protection and anti-inflammation. We determined the therapeutic effect of low-dose CO and CO prodrugs on cancer progression in this study. We found that low-dose CO inhibits the migration of cancer cell lines including breast, pancreatic, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer. We showed that low-dose CO inhibits lung metastasis of breast cancer and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer in preclinical mouse models. Further, to provide safer and more reliable CO delivery, we developed metal-free, organic CO prodrugs and showed that CO prodrugs inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrated that low-dose CO blocks the transcription of heme importers, leading to diminished intracellular heme levels. Altogether, our work lays a strong foundation for the development of CO-based systemic cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutics,Metastasis,Mouse models,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

Abundant high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, a major non-protein component of extracellular matrix, protects naked mole rats from cancer and reduces cancer incidence in mice. Hyaluronidase plays a critical role in degrading hyaluronic acid and is frequently overexpressed in metastatic cancer. We investigated the potential of targeting hyaluronidases to reduce metastasis. High throughput screening identified delphinidin, a natural plant compound found in fruits and vegetables, as a potent hyaluronidase inhibitor. Delphinidin-mediated inhibition of hyaluronidase activity led to an increase in high molecular weight hyaluronic acid in cell culture and in mouse tissues<i>, <\/i>and significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion of breast (EO771), prostate (RM1), and melanoma (B16-F10) metastatic cell lines. Addition of exogenous hyaluronidase partially reversed all of these effects. Moreover, delphinidin treatment suppressed melanoma (B16-F10) metastasis in a spontaneous mouse model of metastasis. These results provide a proof of principle that inhibition of hyaluronidase activity suppresses cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. These results combined with the lack of adverse effect make delphinidin an attractive potential therapeutic option for inhibition of metastasis. We believe further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms and optimize the use of delphinidin in cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Natural products,Extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) represents an innovative intervention utilizing short high-voltage electric pulses to induce cell death through either permanent membrane lysis or disruption of cellular homeostasis. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that the combination of IRE and immune checkpoint blockade using anti-PD-1 antibody (&#945;PD-1) enhances the infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, significantly prolonging survival in an orthotopic murine PDAC model. However, the impact of IRE\/&#945;PD-1 on metastatic PDAC tumors, known as the abscopal effect, remains unclear. In this investigation, we bilaterally implanted C57BL\/6J mice with subcutaneous KRAS* PDAC tumors, treating the right flank tumors with or without IRE, in conjunction with or without &#945;PD-1 administered intraperitoneally. Tumor growth in both the treated (with or without IRE) and untreated (abscopal) left flank tumors was closely monitored until humane euthanasia or long-term survival. In a separate study, mice serum and tumor tissues were collection on the 5th day post-IRE\/&#945;PD-1 treatment. Luminex cytokine assays were conducted on the collected serum, and immunostaining was performed on tumor tissue. Results demonstrated significantly enhanced antitumor activity in both IRE-treated and untreated tumors on mice treated with combined IRE and &#945;PD-1, leading to a marked extension of overall survival. Luminex cytokine assays revealed a substantial increase in crucial cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-18, IL-19, and IL-3, known for their pivotal roles in fostering cytotoxic T lymphocyte development, promoting T cell differentiation into effector T cells, and facilitating the recruitment of effector CD8+ T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissue illustrated a notable accumulation of CD169+ macrophages in IRE-treated tumors compared to untreated tumors. Tumors from the combined IRE with &#945;PD-1 group exhibited increased CD8+ T cell accumulation compared to other groups. These data suggest IRE combined with PD-1 blockade promotes robust antitumor immune, leading to systemic antitumor activity and robust abscopal effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor metastases,Irreversible electroporation (IRE),Anti-PD-1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Q.

For several tumor types, the standard of care is to manage the regional LN basin separately from the primary tumor. For head and neck cancer, melanoma, and complex breast cancer cases, pre-surgical imaging is required to determine the number and location of LN(s) to remove. Most sentinel LN biopsies are performed with nuclear imaging, which relies on short-lived radiotracers and can have poor image quality, making it challenging to identify sentinel LNs in complex anatomies. An alternative and non-inferior workflow uses a non-radioactive iron oxide magnetic tracer (ferucarbotran) with a magnetic probe [2], however this tool can only be used intraoperatively. In this abstract we introduce magnetic particle imaging (MPI) as a pre-surgical imaging technology that detects iron oxides with high sensitivity at mm-scale resolution [3]. <b>Our objective is to demonstrate that MPI provides sensitive and quantitative tracking of ferucarbotran pharmacokinetics from four anatomical sites to primary draining LNs in mice.<\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> Ferucarbotran was administered intradermally to C57BL\/6 mice at a standard clinical dose of 0.675 mg Fe\/kg to the forepaw, hindpaw, or base of tail, or tongue (n = 4). Full-body 2D and 3D imaging was performed after 20 mins, 24 h, and 48 h, and 144 h using MOMENTUM imager (Magnetic Insight Inc.). MPI signal was quantified at the injection site and draining LNs. LNs of interest were extracted to verify MPI signals ex vivo then were processed for Perl&#8217;s Prussian iron staining. <b>Results:<\/b> After 20 minutes, MPI signal was seen at the injection site and primary LNs. The pharmacokinetics of ferucarbotran to LNs varied based on administration site. For hindpaw, signal was present in the popliteal LN (1.4% of tracer). For forepaw, ferucarbotran accumulated in the primary axillary LN (9%). For base of the tail, signal was observed in inguinal LN (2%). For tongue, MPI signal was detected in cervical LNs (14%). In all mice, MPI signal at the injection site decreased over time and signal in primary LNs persisted for at least 6 days. <b>Conclusions<\/b>: We demonstrated MPI is a quantitative, hotspot imaging technique for identifying primary LNs. As iron oxide tracer pharmacokinetics varies with injection site, this imaging technique could provide fundamental information required for surgical planning. Unlike nuclear imaging, persistence of MPI signal for several days provides tremendous flexibility in clinical workflow and introduces the potential for an image-guide delayed SLN biopsy [4] . This preclinical LN imaging is timely as our team is actively building and testing the world&#8217;s first large-bore, clinical-scale MPI scanner.[1] Leong SP, <i>Clin Exp Metastasis<\/i> (2022).

The scale of this heterogeneity on a lesion specific level has yet to be quantified but is of clinical importance because it may provide an indication of molecular mechanisms underpinning metastasis growth. Currently, whether metastasis growth patterns can be predicted by the primary tumor or governed by metastasis specific characteristics is not known. Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has proven useful to predict disease relapse, but how closely it reflects metastatic growth post relapse is unclear. In 104 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study with disease relapse post-surgical resection of the primary tumor, lesion volumetric dynamics were tracked in 460 metastases. Total volume growth rate (TVGR) was calculated using CT imaging performed between disease relapse and death. All patients had whole exome sequencing (WES) of the primary tumor. For 19 patients enrolled in the PEACE autopsy study WES and RNAseq from 60 metastases visible on imaging prior to death and subsequently sampled at autopsy were analyses. In 29 patients, ctDNA was used to track 200 tumor-specific mutations to assess tumor burden and detect metastatic subclones. High TVGR correlated with poor survival (hazard ratio for death 1<sup>st<\/sup> vs 2<sup>nd<\/sup> tertile was 0.21, p&#60;0.001; 2<sup>nd<\/sup> vs 3<sup>rd<\/sup> tertile was 0.51, p=0.04). Primary tumor subclonal whole genome doubling was predictive of high TVGR. There was considerable heterogeneity in the growth rate of metastases within patients. The anatomical location of metastases contributed to this, extrathoracic soft tissue and pleura had the highest growth rates, whilst lymph node and adrenal the lowest (p&#60;0.001). Molecular attributes differed between metastases, with fast growing metastases being enriched for proliferation pathway gene expression. It was observed that the most prevalent population of cells, or clone, in the fastest growing metastasis within a patient was exclusive to that metastasis, suggesting that genomic features that characterize the clone might support rapid growth. ctDNA tracked with tumor burden post relapse and patients with extrathoracic relapse had higher levels of ctDNA. In 9 patients, metastasis specific mutations identified at autopsy and in ctDNA, were used to determine the proportion of ctDNA shed by different metastatic sites. ctDNA subclonal fraction was found to track with changes in lesion volumes during disease progression. This work highlights significant heterogeneity in metastatic growth rates which can potentially be attributed to the presence of distinct genomic features which may dictate tumor growth rate. ctDNA accurately reproduces patterns of radiological disease progression and when combined with longitudinal imaging and tumor DNA sequencing, can accurately reconstruct the natural history of cancer evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Tumor growth,Liquid biopsies,Cancer Evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

There are a variety of mouse model cancer types (e.g. sub-cu, orthotopic, genetically engineered). Orthotopic tumors are increasingly prevalent but usually require surgery, which reduces throughput and injures the surrounding anatomy. Injections are an alternative to surgery, but usually require image guidance or extensive training. US guided injection systems exist, but are suboptimal because they require significant training, as the US beam is not necessarily coplanar with needle location or trajectory, reducing accuracy and throughput. We tested a new approach to image guided injection which ensures that the US beam is coplanar with the needle. To test the efficacy of the image guided injection device across a variety of common orthotopic tumors, we delivered luc-tagged cells to the prostate (2.5e5 cells in 40 &#181;L, PC3, N=8), liver (2e6 cells in 100 &#181;L, Hep G2, N=5), and brain (1.75e5 cells in 100 &#181;L, U87-MG, N=3). The brain tumor model was introduced via intracardiac injection to simulate metastases. Between 3 and 8 mice were injected for each tumor model. For injection, animals were anesthetized and positioned on motion stage. A 1 mL syringe was mounted to the adjustable injection gantry with the needle co-planar with the US beam, and the target organ was visualized with US. Cells were delivered to the targets using the US live stream as a guide. Between 1 to 3 weeks after the injections, tumors were confirmed via BLI with an IVIS (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA). For each of the three tumor cell lines, animal preparation and injections could be performed in 10 mins by recently-trained novice users. All three cell lines could be effectively delivered to the orthotopic host tissues, and this was confirmed by using BLI of the cells. This study represents the first time a co-planar US beam and needle delivery mechanism was used for the purpose of non-surgical implantation of orthotopic tumors. Future developments of this platform could include improvements to automation of needle placement and trajectory to ensure successful payload delivery by novice users.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Orthotopic models,In vivo,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Prostate tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

To support the clinical treatment concept, Dr. Martin-Martinez's lab observed no differences in the time of orthotopic breast mammary fat pad tumor development, necrosis, or color change of tumor tissue between male and female mice. However, the clinical treatment readout, especially tumor metastasis, is different in men and women, and current models for breast cancer are inadequate due to the absence of metastases. It is necessary to evaluate the development of breast cancer 4T1-derived tumor metastasis in male and female mice.<br \/>Method and Result: 4T1-Luc breast cancer cells were implanted in male and female Balb\/c mice via various routes, including inguinal fat pad injection, tail vein injection, caudal artery injection, portal vein injection, and Intratibial Injection. Illuminance images showed no significant differences in tumor metastatic development between genders for inguinal fat pad, tail vein, and intratibial injections. However, following caudal artery injection, early-stage metastasis differed; male mice developed femoral head metastasis, while female mice developed lung metastasis. In the late stage, male mice displayed lung and femoral bone metastasis, while female mice primarily showed lung metastasis with barely bone metastasis.<br \/>Conclusion: While both male and female mice showed similar primary breast tumor development, mouse gender affected tumor metastasis differently, particularly when tumor cells went through the caudal artery. Male mice presented earlier femoral head metastasis and less lung metastasis than female mice. Based on this work, sex hormones would affect both hormone-related and nonhormone-related tumor metastasis. To elucidate whether this phenomenon is caused by estrogen or androgen or to test if a drug has any beneficial effects, HD Biosciences provides established tumor metastatic cell-delivering platforms and over 1000 cancer cell lines for target validation and drug efficacy study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Gender,Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Many lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients experience brain metastasis during the disease process with unfavorable prognosis. Our previous study has discovered that P4HA1 was exclusively upregulated in brain metastatic cells. Through the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing of LUAD samples, we found that the expression of P4HA1 in brain metastatic tumor cells is higher than that in primary tumor cells. This finding was further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Significantly, a strong presence of P4HA1 in primary tumors is associated with a reduced duration of disease-free survival in individuals with LUAD. Overexpression of P4HA1 in A549 and PC9 cell lines significantly increased the incidence of brain metastasis in BALB\/c nude mice, whereas knockdown of P4HA1 in high brain metastatic cells significantly decreased the incidence of brain metastasis and reduced the tumor foci in brain with improved survival. Utilization of DHB, a P4HA1 inhibitor, exerts both therapeutic and preventive effects in relieving brain metastases in nude mice. Furthermore, remarkable inhibition of tumor growth by DHB was observed in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that the reduction of P4HA1 expression had a substantial impact on cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptors interactions. Western blotting analysis verified that the decrease in P4HA1 expression led to a drop in the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, NCAM1, as well as integrin molecules ITGA2 and ITGA3. Furthermore, when endothelial cells were co-cultured with conditioned medium from tumor cells, it was observed that the expression of the tight junction molecule ZO1 was reduced after co-culturing with conditioned medium from P4HA1 knockdown A549 cells. The results from the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model and in vivo biofluorescence imaging indicate that P4HA1 promoted brain metastasis of LUAD via modulating the ability of tumor cells to cross the blood-brain barrier. In conclusion, our study reveals that overexpression of P4HA1 promotes metastatic spread to the brain, and targeting P4HA1 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Brain metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

Microglia have emerged as promising therapeutic targets due to their role in brain parenchymal homeostasis. However, with evidence for both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions, their role in brain metastasis (BrM) remains unclear. Here, we show that the microglial response to tumor cells within a single host is heterogeneous and can alter tumor fate. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on five surgically resected metastatic brain tumors, and the transcriptome of tumor-associated microglia was extracted by single-cell variational inference (scVI). Evidence for the coexistence of cytokine-secreting and angiogenesis-supporting subsets, as well as subsets associated with phagocytosis and antigen presentation, within each tumor sample was determined. To demonstrate the intra-tumoral functional heterogeneity of tumor-associated microglia, we established a metastatic brain tumor model that allows us to visualize the metastatic process and the dynamic microglial response in vivo by injecting mCherry-tagged allogeneic cancer cells into the internal carotid artery of <i>CX3CR1-EGFP <\/i>mice. Metastasis formation was suppressed in microglia-depleted mice, identifying a dominant microglial response that promotes tumor growth. However, continuous in vivo imaging of the BrM model revealed tumor-eradicating anti-tumor microglia coexisting with pro-tumor microglia in the same host. The transcriptome of anti-tumor microglia supported that they are enriched for phagocytosis, antigen processing and antigen presentation genes. The subset was identified in microglia extracted from human samples. We then examined the immune checkpoint of microglial phagocytosis in the tumor transcriptome and identified <i>Cd24a<\/i> and <i>Cd47<\/i>. Simultaneous deletion of both genes in cancer cells enhanced microglial phagocytosis, reduced tumor volume and improved survival, and rescue of both genes reversed these anti-tumor effects. The microglial dependency was addressed by microglial depletion experiments, and the anti-tumor effects were reproducible in nude mice lacking mature T cells. These results suggest that there are distinct immune cell subtypes that respond to lung tumor metastases in the brain and either promote tumor growth or inhibit metastasis through phagocytosis. Furthermore, anti-tumor activity in mouse models can be enhanced by genetic deletion of <i>Cd24a <\/i>and <i>Cd47 <\/i>in tumor cells, which regulate phagocytosis by microglia.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Metastasis,Microglia,CD24,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

The progress of spheroid invasion and the drug-inhibitory effects on tumor invasion were quantified by tracking and calculating the area of invasive protrusion from the spheroid. Our data show that 1) different types of cancer cells had different metastatic potentials demonstrated by the level of invadopodium extending into the Matrigel at desired time points; 2) the invasion of 3D HT1080 spheroid was inhibited by cytochalasin D (Cyto D), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and GM6001, a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), in a dose-dependent manner; 3) Cyto D exhibited higher efficacy of inhibiting tumor invasion than GM6001. In summary, our approach by combining the 3D tumor spheroid invasion model with the RTCA eSight&#8217;s capability of live cell imaging and automatic quantification of the area of invasive protrusion can facilitate and enhance the development of new treatments at the preclinical stage in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-06 Imaging of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,3D spheroid,time-lapse imaging ,tumor invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"G.

Breast cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) of &#8805;30 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> have an increased risk for metastatic disease compared to patients with a BMI in the normal range. Although immune cells like neutrophils and myeloid derived suppressor cells have been studied in breast cancer metastasis of the lung, little is known how T cell populations change before and after metastasis. To investigate these gaps, we fed 3-week-old female FVB\/N mice either a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to induce obesity. One group was set as a tumor-na&#239;ve control and the other was injected estrogen receptor positive (ER+) TC2 cells into the mammary fat pad. Tumors grew to 0.5 cm in diameter then were surgically removed. Lung tissue was collected 8 weeks after tumor removal to examine progression of metastatic disease, and T cell populations were quantified in tumor-na&#239;ve and metastatic lung tissue from obese and lean mice using flow cytometry. Lungs from na&#239;ve obese mice showed a significant increase of total CD45+ immune cells. CD8+ T cells from naive obese mice expressed higher levels of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1), a marker of T cell dysfunction or T cell activation. Metastatic lungs also showed increases in CD45+ immune cells and PD-1+ expression on CD3+ cells and CD8+ cells. Overall, metastatic lungs showed higher levels of PD-1 expression than na&#239;ve lungs on more cell types, evidence of more immune dysfunction or activation. To further investigate how obesity alters the function of T cells, CD45+ cells were sorted from lungs from lean and obese mice with and without metastasis, and gene expression was examined using the NanoString nCounter Immune Exhaustion panel. Immune cells from the lungs of obese non-tumor-bearing mice showed increased expression of markers for increased TCR signaling. This may indicate more T cell activation which leads to exhaustion in obese na&#239;ve mice. In metastatic lungs from obese mice, immune cells showed impaired interferon and tumor necrosis factor signaling. In addition, immune cells from metastatic lungs of obese mice also had upregulated expression of genes associated with senescence which may indicate a combination of both exhaustion and senescent phenotypes are present. This was not seen in immune cells from na&#239;ve samples, indicating that obesity leads to more chronic T cell dysfunction in metastatic lungs. Overall, even without pathogenic interference, obesity contributes to more T cell signaling and impaired CD8+ T cell activation that leads to higher T cell dysfunction once metastasis is present.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Obesity,Metastasis,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
