One of their critical roles is to process and present tumor associated antigens to T cells, thereby inducing antigen-specific T cell response.

Consistent with our previous studies in neural stem cells and microglia, we found QKI and PPAR&#948; enhance phagocytosis in DCs by upregulating genes involved in the formation of phagosome and endosomes.

Despite a near-perfect 5-year survival rate in patients with localized disease with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), about 10-20% of patients on ADT eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Immunotherapies are typically ineffective in treating these treatment-resistant patients due to the abundance of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and lack of infiltrating lymphocytes. We propose to target these immunosuppressive macrophages through the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which has been identified as a major mediator of suppressive macrophage function but has not been studied in the context of PCa and CRPC. For this study, we analyzed publicly available RNA-seq datasets to query for TREM2 expression amongst patients with a range of prostate cancer disease states and cell types, measured tumor growth kinetics in two subcutaneous models of prostate cancer, and compared tumor immune infiltrates by flow cytometry. Our analysis of the TCGA prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and the Stand Up to Cancer\/Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C\/PCF) datasets implicate <i>TREM2<\/i> expression with prostate cancer progression, by Gleason score and progression-free status, and with worse overall survival of patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Manual curation and analysis of 10 single-cell RNA-seq datasets with a total of 84 patients, encompassing primary PCa, CRPC, and mCRPC indicate that <i>TREM2<\/i> is highly and specifically expressed on TAMs in prostate cancer, with macrophages from patient-matched tumor samples expressing higher <i>TREM2<\/i> compared to normal adjacent tissue. B6CaP tumors, with a luminal cytokeratin profile, high AR expression, and high Myc expression, show slower tumor growth in <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice compared to tumors in <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>wt<\/sup> mice. On the other hand, RM1 tumors show no difference in growth kinetics on <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. A major difference between the B6CaP and RM1 tumor microenvironments is the level of macrophage infiltration, where only 2-5% of immune cells in RM1 tumors are macrophages, compared to the 40-50% in B6CaP tumors. RM1 cells co-implanted with <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> macrophages show slower tumor growth, compared to tumor cells co-implanted with <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>wt<\/sup> macrophages, confirming the role of <i>Trem2<\/i>-expressing macrophages in mediating tumor growth. Consistent with previous reports of suppressive Trem2 signaling, we also observed higher levels of inflammatory cytokine production in <i>ex vivo<\/i> stimulated <i>Trem2<\/i><sup>-\/-<\/sup> TAMs. By targeting TREM2 in prostate cancer, we find that TAMs are less suppressive, more inflammatory, and permit cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration to enhance anti-tumor responses by synergizing with chemo and immune checkpoint therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Prostate cancer,Bioinformatics,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Chemotherapy (e.g. gemcitabine and cisplatin), the standard of care for advanced bladder cancer, disrupts inflammation resolution and is only partially effective in preventing tumor recurrence after treatment. Immunotherapy has emerged as a potential treatment option for bladder cancer patients, however it is ineffective in 80% of patients and can induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, there is a critical unmet medical need to improve chemotherapy and immunotherapy in bladder cancer. To address this, we have developed dual COX-2\/sEH inhibitors (e.g. PTUPB). This lead compound is representative of a newly patented class of &#8220;dual acting&#8221; molecules that target two important enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade with nanomolar binding affinity: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Oral dosing of PTUPB is well-tolerated in animal models. Since chemotherapy and immunotherapy both induce tumor-promoting inflammation via an eicosanoid\/cytokine storm, we hypothesized that dual COX-2\/sEH inhibition would enhance immunotherapy in experimental bladder cancer via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. When syngeneic (MB49) bladder tumors reached ~200 mm3 in immunocompetent mice, treatment was initiated with PTUPB, anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1, gemcitabine &#38; cisplatin, or various combinations thereof. Here we demonstrate that chemotherapy and\/or immunotherapy stimulated sEH and COX-2 expression in tumor tissue which was counter-regulated by PTUPB. While monotherapy treatment with PTUPB, gemcitabine &#38; cisplatin, anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4 suppressed tumor growth compared to control, the tumors escaped single treatments by the end of the study. Remarkably, dual COX-2\/sEH inhibition in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) and\/or immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD1) induced sustained tumor regression via synergistic anti-tumor activities. Chemotherapy and\/or immunotherapy induced the expression of ER stress response genes (e.g. BiP and CHOP) and angiogenic factors (e.g. EGF and VEGF-C) in bladder cancer tissue, which were repressed by PTUPB. PTUPB also prevented chemotherapy-induced toxicity and prolonged survival in an orthotopic MB49 tumor model. Taken together, our results demonstrate dual COX-2\/sEH inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach to enhance immunotherapy in bladder cancer without overt toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Immune response,Immunosuppression,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

While it is established that breast cancer cells have the capacity to evade immune responses, the mechanisms driving this evasion remain elusive. Therefore, finding ways to enhance anti-tumor immunity is crucial to improve patient outcomes. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a Wnt inhibitor whose levels correlate with poor prognosis and decreased immune infiltration in various cancers. In this study, we used mice orthotopically injected with the PyMT, EO771, and 4T1 breast cancer lines. In all models, we found elevated DKK1 serum levels, and its neutralization with an &#945;DKK1 Ab resulted in a significant reduction in primary tumor growth but also in metastatic dissemination. To identify the source of DKK1, we examined its expression in the tumor. DKK1 was detected in stromal cells with a fibroblast-like morphology but not in cancer cells or immune infiltrates. Co-staining confirmed colocalization between DKK1 and the CAF marker &#945;SMA. To address the role of CAF-derived DKK1, we specifically deleted DKK1 in CAFs by generating FSP1CreDkk1<\/i>fl\/fl<\/sup> and &#945;SMACreERT2<\/sup>Dkk1<\/i>fl\/fl<\/sup> mice. Both models showed a significant reduction in primary tumor growth while maintaining comparable serum DKK1 levels, indicating locally produced DKK1 supports tumor growth. To understand how DKK1 promotes tumor progression, we conducted bulk RNAseq of tumor cells isolated from IgG or &#945;DKK1 treated mice. While no changes related to cell viability or cell cycle were observed, immune response-related genes were upregulated in &#945;DKK1-treated cells. In support of this, &#945;DKK1 did not reduce tumor growth in NSG immune-compromised mice. To pinpoint the immune cell targeted by DKK1, we depleted T, NK cells, or macrophages in WT tumor-bearing mice treated with &#945;DKK1. Remarkably, only NK cell depletion negated &#945;DKK1 anti-tumor effects. In vitro assays further demonstrated that rDKK1 or the presence of CAFs reduced NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells while &#945;DKK1 restored it. To assess whether DKK1 levels correlated with tumor progression and immune suppression in breast cancer patients, we analyzed DKK1 serum levels and circulating NK cells at the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease and 15-18 months after standard care. DKK1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with progressive bone disease compared to those with stable disease. Importantly, NK cells from the progressive disease cohort had reduced perforin and granzyme B expression at the follow-up visit compared to baseline, indicating reduced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, rDKK1 reduced perforin in NK cells from healthy donors. In sum, our data show DKK1 is an important regulator of breast cancer progression, and we report for the first time DKK1 directly impairs NK cell cytotoxicity, creating an immune suppressive environment resistant to treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Immunosuppression,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells secrete IFN&#947;, eliciting tumor-intrinsic IFN&#947; signaling and expression of immunosuppressive genes, which are critical for effective therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although the IFN&#947; receptor (IFN&#947;R) is expressed in all cell types, its surface density can determine a cell&#8217;s responsiveness to ligand. Mechanistic control over this process remains a mystery. Herein we report that the endocytic trafficking protein ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6 (ARF6) is critical for IFN&#947;-driven AIR during primary tumor progression and in the setting of ICB therapy. The IFN&#947;R1 subunit of the receptor is constitutively internalized in a ligand-independent manner. ARF6 is necessary for endocytic recycling of IFN&#947;R1 and determines the steady-state surface density of the receptor. Loss of ARF6 results in lysosomal degradation of the receptor and controls IFN&#947;R1 protein levels in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. IFN&#947; activates ARF6 in parallel with JAK1-STAT1 signaling, suggesting a positive feedback loop that allows tumor cells to dynamically respond to immune attack. Silencing ARF6 reduces tumor intrinsic IFN&#947; signaling and downstream expression of immunosuppressive genes. In murine melanoma, loss of ARF6 causes resistance to systemic ICB therapy. Likewise, low expression of ARF6 in patient tumors correlates with inferior outcomes with ICB. Our data provide new mechanistic insights into tumor immune escape, defined by ARF6-dependent adaptive immunity, and support that ARF6-dependent endomembrane trafficking of the IFN&#947; receptor shapes clinical outcomes of ICB therapy.<br \/>Private Information","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Immune checkpoint blockade,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Y.

Initiating cancers frequently disable this first line of defense before establishing T-cell exhaustion programs. However, the molecules linking IFN-I, danger signals, and unique metabolic conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain to be discovered.<br \/>Methods: We performed centered log-ratio transformation on the cluster composition data using the R-package ALDEx2 to compare the clusters in single-cell data sets. IFN-I signatures were quantified using qPCR and ELISA. ChIP was performed to examine the H3K27me3 epigenetic marker on the promoters of BATF2 and IFN-I genes in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM). For the cigarette smoke carcinogen-induced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) model, experimental mice were fed with water containing 50 &#956;g\/mL of 4-NQO for 16 weeks and then switched to regular feeding water. We started monitoring 10 weeks post-treatment for the number, location, and diameter of the lesions. TME analysis was performed using single-cell RNA-Seq and multispectral imaging.<br \/>Results: We analyzed three large independent cohorts of patients and found that BATF2 strongly correlated with the immunogenicity of HNSCC, with a stronger correlation coefficient than <i>STING<\/i>. We generated <i>Batf2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>BMDM and found that <i>Batf2<\/i> deficiency rendered cells insensitive to STING agonists. However, the dsRNA-induced IFN-I activation was not affected by <i>Batf2<\/i> deletion. BATF2 interacted with STING, promoting its phosphorylation and oligomerization. Glutamine is enriched in the TME. We found that glutamine inhibited the BATF2-STING pathway by increasing a repressive epigenetic marker, H3K27me3, on the promoters of <i>BATF2<\/i> and <i>IFNB1<\/i>. The expression of BATF2 in cancer cells resulted in IFN-I- and &#947;&#948; T-cell-dependent tumor rejection. Single-cell immune profiling showed that Batf2-expressing tumors contained significantly expanded Cxcl10<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells and &#947;&#948; T-cells. Utilizing the 4-NQO-induced HNSCC model, we found that BATF2 limited suppressive myeloid cells and expanded effector cells in the TME, serving as a potent tumor suppressor.<br \/>Conclusion: BATF2 is a glutamine-responsive tumor suppressor that limits tumor initiation by engaging the STING-&#947;&#948; T-cell pathway.<br \/>Acknowledgments: This work was supported by NIH grants R01 DE026728, U01 DE029255, R01 DE031951, and U01 DE033330","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-05 Innate immunity to tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Type-I Interferon,Metabolism,Innate immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>W.
