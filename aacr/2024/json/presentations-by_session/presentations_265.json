[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Lymph node metastasis evaluation in solid tumors is mainly complicated by the diagnostic yield of standard imaging modalities and tumor size contradictions. Exploring clinical\/molecular features that complement the use of radiologic and bronchoscopy findings may provide significant values for a more accurate pathologic determination of nodal metastasis.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed surgery-resected tumor samples from 72 treatment-na&#239;ve lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients via whole-exome sequencing (WES). Mutational profiles of patients categorized based on their pathologic lymph node metastasis (pN) status were assessed, and the association between metastatic-driving features and overall survival (OS) was then explored in both the study cohort and the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) external cohort.<br \/>Results: Among all 72 patients, 41 (56.9%) were pathologically confirmed as positive for lymph node metastasis (pN-positive), while 31 (43.1%) were categorized as pN-negative. The most frequently mutated gene was <i>TP53<\/i> in both subgroups (54.8% and 53.7%, respectively), and the aberrant KEAP1-NRF2 signaling pathway was found significantly more enriched in pN-negative patients. Copy-number variant analysis showed that chromosome 7p amplifications (X7p_amp) at the arm level and <i>EGFR<\/i> amplifications at the focal gene level were more frequently identified in pN-positive patients (<i>P<\/i>=0.008 and <i>P<\/i>=0.004, respectively). Importantly, these amplifications were associated with worse OS in both the study cohort and the TCGA external dataset. Consistent with the unfavorable prognosis, pN-positive patients demonstrated a higher chromosome instability score (CIS) (median: 0.32 vs. 0.14, <i>P<\/i>=0.14) and a lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) (median: 1.83 vs. 3.85 muts\/Mb, <i>P<\/i>=0.048) compared to pN-negative patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that X7p_amp, particularly <i>EGFR<\/i> amplification, might be associated with pathologic involvement of lymph nodes and an unfavorable prognosis in LUAD patients. Our study highlights the importance of integrating clinical and genomic data into conventional radiologic modalities for a more accurate determination of pathologic nodal involvement.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-08 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymph node metastasis,Lung adenocarcinoma,Whole exome sequencing,Pathologic examination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

Mutations in the NF2 gene affect predominantly the nervous system causing the development of benign tumors. NF2 mutations have been reported in Renal cancers with morphologically specific tumor types and in aggressive tumors. We studied a cohort of 16 cases of RCC in which the NF2 mutation was identified and describe other molecular changes as well as morphology and clinic-pathological correlation.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients had been consented and treated for renal masses in protocols of the UOB division of the NCI. Next generation sequencing was performed with tumor DNA from FFPE tissue using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 Kit (TSO500) NextSeq 550DX. TSO500 assay was designed to detect single nucleotide variations, small insertions\/deletions, copy number variations from 92 genes, TMB and MSI. Morphology and IHC stains were performed.<br \/>Results: Nine patients were female and 7 males, ranging in age from 21 to 87 years. Fourteen patients underwent partial or total nephrectomies, one case had a biopsy and in 1 case a metastatic tumor to a lymph node was studied. Morphologically, nine cases were diagnosed as HLRCC, three clear cells, two cases with clear and papillary cell, one medullary and one oncocytoma. Genetic findings revealed mutations in NF2, FH,VHL, SMARCB1, HOBB13, ARID1B, B2M, EP300, BCORL1 and MGA. Concurrent coexistence of NF2 and FH mutations was present in 9 cases. Three patients with concurrent FH and NF2 mutations died of the disease.<br \/>Conclusions: NF2 mutations have been identified in a variety of morphologic types of Renal cell cancer. However, we were surprised by the number of cases with NF2 mutation in tumors that also harbor the FH (HLRCC) mutation. NF2 tumors have been reported to have an aggressive behavior, and FH cancers are also known to have poor survival. Genomic studies of renal cancers is recommended since some genetic alterations are targetable and may provide adequate therapies that will lead to longer survivals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Kidney cancer,Gene expression,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

The current diagnosis of Gliomas incorporates molecular biomarkers that include whole chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Testing CNVs and SNVs are traditionally done using different large platforms and are performed in large genomic facilities that have the suitable infrastructure. This creates delays in testing, where samples undergo lengthy referrals and the tissue is often split between institutions, which also adds substantially to the costs. We have previously used Nanopore sequencing to develop an assay to detect <i>IDH<\/i> SNVs from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Nanopore sequencing platform uses small inexpensive tools and can test for both CNVs and SNVs. However, combining both targets efficiently in FFPE tissue remains a challenge.<br \/>While nanopore whole genome sequencing can detect CNVs, it does not allow for enough coverage to accurately detect small SNVs. Also, raw FFPE DNA is not compatible with the nanopore technology. To fix both challenges we used a PCR based approach that allows enrichment of the SNV targets, as well as creates new nanopore compatible DNA copies. To counteract the bias that PCR creates with uneven amplification, we used a SNP based method to call chromosomal gains and losses. Statistical analysis of probability showed that targeting 15 heterozygous SNPs per chr arm is sufficient for accurate CNV detection (error rate &#60;0.1%). A total of 57 amplicons targeting CNVs on Chr 1,7, 10, 19, and <i>EGFR<\/i> gene; and <i>IDH1 <\/i><i>and<\/i><i> IDH2<\/i> SNVs were pooled together in one assay and tested on 4 Glioma samples. Variant calling was performed with a custom Python script.<br \/>All CNV targets were accurately detected on all samples. Losses in chr 1p, 19q and chr 10 were evident with a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) pattern on the SNP analysis. The gain in chromosome 7 was also observed as an allele gain 2:1 SNP pattern on the corresponding samples. The SNV statuses of these samples were also accurately detected when compared to reference results. Finally, the SNV and CNV calling analysis were streamlined using custom shell script, further reducing total turnaround time (including sequencing and data analysis) to less than a day for the entire batch of samples. Initial cost analysis shows &#60;50% of the traditional testing costs for the assay.<br \/>This work is the first to develop a streamlined single test to detect CNVs and SNVs in Gliomas using FFPE DNA on the nanopore sequencing platform. The shorter testing time, streamlined workflow, and low assay\/capital cost could positively influence the care of brain cancer patients. Notably, nanopore-based sequencing tools can also be implemented in other types of tumor diagnosis, especially by smaller labs, helping to overcome many of the existing diagnostic challenges.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Diagnosis,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Here, we aimed to refine this subgroup by assessing the evolution and identifying CN-signatures (Drews et al. Nature) to establish CN-clusters. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS;100X) data from 146 CN-high cases from Genomics England (GeL) as discovery cohort. We then performed shallow WGS (sWGS;0.1X) of FFPE tumor DNA of <i>n<\/i>=307 CN-high EC from (non-)trial cohorts. Timing of canonical driver mutations by MutationTimer in CN-high GeL revealed that <i>TP53<\/i> mutations were: (i) not ubiquitous and (ii) not consistently identified as early clonal events (Table), challenging conventional belief that <i>TP53<\/i> inactivation is necessary for initiation of CN-high EC. Evolutionary analyses (Plackett-Luce) are ongoing to identify carcinogenesis trajectories and assess how driver mutations other than <i>TP53<\/i> influence CN-phenotypes. Unsupervised clustering of 307 EC by CN-signatures identified five clusters (E1: 19%; E2: 2%; E3; 20%; E4: 19%; E5: 40%), characterized by CN-signatures linked to biological phenomena. Clusters E1\/E4 reflect homologous recombination deficiency (CX3), while cluster E5 seems driven by chromosomal missegregation (CX1). Notably, there was no one-to-one relationship between CN-clusters and histotypes, suggesting CN-evolution is independent of morphology. In conclusion, we have identified <i>TP53<\/i>-dependent and -independent pathways in CN-high EC evolution. Potentially clinically relevant CN-clusters were identified using cost-effective sWGS. sWGS of additional <i>n<\/i>=475 CN-high EC are ongoing.

This study aims to identify the molecular explanation for the observed clinical behavior and suggest novel treatment strategies in PM-CRC.<br \/>Design: Tumor samples from a Norwegian national cohort of 230 patients undergoing surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with mitomycin C (MMC) for PM-CRC were subjected to targeted DNA sequencing, and associations between molecular findings and clinical data were analyzed. mRNA sequencing was conducted on a subset of thirty samples to compare gene expression in tumors harboring mutations in the <i>BRAF<\/i> or <i>KRAS<\/i> oncogenes and wild-type tumors.<br \/>Results: Almost one-third of the patients had mutations in the <i>BRAF<\/i> oncogene, which were associated with <i>RNF43<\/i>\/R-Spondin aberrations and low expression of negative Wnt regulators (ligand dependent Wnt activation). This molecular profile, with high abundance in PM, could be an underlying mechanism promoting aggressive tumor biology that facilitates metastasis to the peritoneal cavity, and could contribute to the observed poor overall survival of this patient subgroup. <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations were also associated with gene expression changes in transport solute carrier proteins and drug metabolism enzymes that could influence the efficacy of MMC and irinotecan, commonly used in PM-CRC treatment. <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutated tumors exhibited increased expression of BTN immune checkpoint molecules, and targeting these checkpoints in addition to ligand dependent Wnt activation could be two novel targeted therapy approaches.<br \/>Conclusion: <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations were associated with particularly poor survival in this cohort, possibly related to altered drug transport and metabolism conferring resistance to MMC and irinotecan.

Whereas STAT3 activation is common in myeloid neoplasms, it is primarily mediated through STAT3 phosphorylation. <i>STAT3<\/i> mutation has only rarely been reported in myeloid neoplasms. We assessed the clinicopathologic and molecular genetic features of 32 <i>STAT3-<\/i>mutated myeloid neoplasms. Twenty (62.5%) cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 7 (21.9%) as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 5 (15.6%) as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). It is of note that <i>STAT3<\/i> mutation was not detected in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). <i>STAT3 <\/i>mutations were detected at the initial diagnosis in 22 of 25 (88%) cases, suggesting <i>STAT3 <\/i>mutation is an early event in pathogenesis. However, <i>STAT3<\/i> mutations represented the dominant clone in only 6 (18.8%) cases, all classified as AML. Most are missense mutations, located at the SH2 domain. The median variant allele frequencies were 6.8%, 4.6% and 3.1% for AML, MDS and CMML, respectively, and in a case of CMML, the VAF increased from 2.4% to 34.8% upon leukemic transformation. <i>STAT3<\/i> mutation was accompanied by co-existing mutations in all cases, with <i>SRSF2 <\/i>(40.6%), <i>TET2<\/i> (40.6%), <i>ASXL1 <\/i>(37.5%), and <i>SETBP1<\/i> (34.4%) being most common. Cases with <i>STAT3 <\/i>mutations were usually associated with morphologic dysplasia and increased blasts. Monosomy 7\/del7q was the most common cytogenetic abnormality, seen in 11 (34.4%) cases. With a median follow-up of 24.5 months, 21 patients died, 6 had persistent disease, and 5 achieved complete remission. We summarize that <i>STAT3 <\/i>mutation is present in a variety of myeloid neoplasms, but not seen in MPN. It is often an early events and always with concurrent mutations. It may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of myeloid neoplasms by activating JAK-STAT pathway, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,STAT3,Molecular diagnosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, obtaining sufficient and high-quality nucleic acid material from limited FFPE samples presents a challenge for downstream molecular analysis, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). We present an optimized sequential extraction method that generates high-quality DNA and RNA from a single set of input tissues that is automatable and operation-friendly. This workflow performs well with reduced FFPE tissue input and efficiently supports various high-throughput clinical NGS applications. The DNA\/RNA yield, quality, purity, and impacts on NGS assay performances were on par or better than an existing validated comparator extraction method. With comparable FFPE input, the new method demonstrated a superior extraction performance with significantly higher yield, quality, and purity. For DNA, NGS libraries were made with two different library preparation methods: a TA-ligation-based method and a single-strand-based method, followed by hybrid capturing and sequencing. The DNA from the new extraction method demonstrated a superior library conversion rate and improved target enrichment uniformity with both chemistries. This provides the potential of reduced input requirements, allowing very limited tissue, such as fine needle aspirate or core needle biopsy, for clinical NGS testing. The sequencing results were highly concordant between the existing and new extraction methods when the extracted DNA was subjected to a validated comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) clinical test, demonstrating the quality and robustness of the extraction. For RNA, NGS libraries were made following the validated CGP clinical test with hybrid capturing, and the results were comparable between the two extraction methods. In conclusion, an FFPE extraction method was optimized to allow more clinical biopsy samples to be tested with different NGS workflows, providing a better diagnostic value for patient care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),FFPE,Solid tumors,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Leiomyomas can cause symptoms that can significantly reduce the quality of life. Treatment mainly involves hysterectomy or myomectomy, the latter for women who wish to preserve their uterus. Most leiomyomas harbor one of the three driver mutations affecting either <i>MED12<\/i>, <i>HMGA2<\/i>, or <i>FH<\/i>. Recently identified rare subtypes include tumors with mutations in genes linked to the neddylation of the Cullin 3-RING E3 ligase or SRCAP complex. Recurrence of leiomyomas is poorly understood in relation to their clonal origins and molecular factors. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutational profiles of leiomyomas from recurrent operations and to identify the frequency of clonally related tumors. We utilized a retrospective cohort of 234 women who underwent laparoscopic or open abdominal myomectomy, with 46 (20%) of them experiencing multiple procedures related to leiomyomas. We examined the mutation profiles of 133 leiomyomas (62 index and 71 recurrent tumors) from 33 patients who required multiple tumor removal surgeries. We screened the tumors for the three primary leiomyoma drivers&#8212;<i>MED12 <\/i>mutations, HMGA2 overexpression, and FH-deficiency&#8212;to identify potentially clonal tumors. We found that 21 out of 33 (64%) patients had tumors from multiple operations with identical leiomyoma driver alterations. To further assess the clonal relationship, we executed whole exome sequencing on these 52 tumors. We identified three patients with two clonally related tumors each through shared somatic copy number alterations and point mutations. The clonally related tumors included HMGA2, FH, and wild-type tumors. Notably, leiomyomas with <i>MED12<\/i> mutations&#8212;the most common molecular leiomyoma subtype&#8212;were not found among the clonally related tumors. Three patients harbored numerous FH-deficient tumors from recurrent operations. In all those patients, we found <i>FH<\/i> germline mutations, characteristic of Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer syndrome (HLRCC). Moreover, we identified somatic mutations in <i>YEATS4<\/i>, a member of the SRCAP complex, in four recurrent tumors from three patients. Interestingly, all <i>YEATS4<\/i> mutations were different, and the tumors were not clonally related. Further research is required to elucidate the role of <i>YEATS4<\/i> in leiomyoma recurrence. In conclusion, our systematic study confirms that reinterventions are common after myomectomy, and while uterine leiomyomas typically develop independently, some share a clonal origin. Additionally, we show that recurrence may be due to genetic predispositions, such as germline <i>FH<\/i> mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole exome sequencing,Uterine leiomyoma,Recurrence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Anti-PD-1 therapies are ineffective in MSS CRC but demonstrate efficacy in combination with BRAF + EGFR inhibition for MSS BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC. A comprehensive characterization of MSS BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC as an immunologically distinct subpopulation of MSS CRC has not been performed. Here, we characterize the clinicopathological and transcriptomic features of MSS BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> CRC patients, relative to BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup> MSS CRC patients.Methods: De-identified records of 12,009 MSS CRC patients were retrospectively analyzed from the Tempus clinicogenomic database. CMS subtypes were derived using the CMScaller algorithm. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with risk set adjustment (RSA) method; log-rank test was used to compare survival. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using chi-squared test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively.<br \/>Results: BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> was found in 5% (n=630) of the patients. Demographics and clinicopathological features varied significantly between the BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup> and BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> cohorts (Table 1). Relative to the BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup> cohort, BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> tumors were enriched for the immune-activated CMS1 signature (53% vs 11%, p&#60; .001), PD-L1 detection (9.5% vs 3%, p&#60;0.001), and CD8+ T-cell infiltration (4.6% vs. 2.5%, p&#60;0.001). CMS4 was linked to an unfavorable prognosis in the BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup> cohort (HR=0.58 compared to CMS1, p=0.026), yet this was not observed in the BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> cohort (HR=2.60 compared to CMS1, p=0.083).<br \/>Conclusions: BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> MSS CRC exhibited immune activation characteristics that were not observed in the BRAF<sup>WT<\/sup> group, including greater CMS1 status, PD-L1 expression, and CD8-T cell infiltration.

Therefore, we performed a miRNA analysis and whole exome sequencing (WES) investigating four patients with multiple recurrences over seven to 16 years and eight patients with non-recurrent tumors (NRTs), conventional, sacral chordomas in order to compare both groups as well as the recurrence cases (RCs) to each other. Our aim was to find typical miRNA patterns distinguishing the recurrences from the NRTs. After histopathological classification, immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis, DNA and miRNA were extracted from formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded tissue samples and analyzed by WES and Nanostring. The microRNA regulation patterns showed similarities within RCs differing from NRTs. In unsupervised clustering there is a tendency of recurrences clustering apart from the NRTs. The differential expression between cases developing recurrences and NRTs showed highly significant differences between both groups with 32 miRNAs upregulated in the RCs being downregulated in NRTs. The miRNA expression of long-term recurrences of each patient are quite homogenous differing only from their primary tumor. Comparing NRTs with primary tumors that would later develop long-term recurrences showed significant up-regulation of 5 miRNAs in the RCs. This suggests a pivotal molecular difference between singular and long-term recurring chordomas. Our WES analysis confirmed known and revealed possible new driver genes. Recurring tumors had a higher number of mutations classified as pathogenic as well as increased proliferation rates and pleomorphic changes. Recurrences displayed a change in mutational distribution, showing considerably more disturbances in embryonic signaling and our proposed driver genes. Intriguingly, our study found a progress in number of alterations throughout the recurrences most of all affecting chromatin regulation and the new drivers.<br \/>Less disruption of these pathways in primary cases than in recurrences implies their pivotal role not only in chordoma formation, but also in recurrence evolution. The miRNA alterations were correlated with the genomic differences. Validated affected genes of miRNAs deregulated primarily in the recurrences are involved in those pathways as well. As current targeted therapy options are only sporadically altered in few patients, the progress in number of pathogenic mutations throughout the recurrences as well as the drastic change in miRNA expression could present new research approaches for chordomas with long-term recurrences. Combined clinical and molecular studies of miRNA patterns and genetic alterations could expand the understanding of recurrence development leading to new therapeutic targets inhibiting or delaying recurrence formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Whole exome sequencing,Recurrence,Chordoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Risk-factors for recurrence are mainly derived from histopathological factors. Senticol III is a large multicenter international randomized prospective study aims to validate sentinel lymph node biopsy in the surgical management of ESCC. Our objective is to characterize prognostic and actionable biomarkers in ESCC.<br \/>Methods: FFPE-fixed tumoral slides of the first 150 randomized patients were analyzed based on SEDLIS criteria. We characterized TIL&#8217;s infiltration, PD-L1 expression and HPV status. Sequencing of tumor DNA was carried out using an in-house targeted next-generation sequencing panel (571 genes). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time between randomization and relapse of any type. We performed Fisher&#8217;s exact test and Student&#8217;s t-test to compare distributions of categorical variables and Log Rank test.<br \/>Results: The sequencing quality control criteria were met for 135 samples. <i>PIK3CA<\/i> was the most commonly altered gene (17%). Loss-of-function variants in <i>KMT2-<\/i>family genes (<i>KTM2C <\/i>9%, <i>KMT2D<\/i> 6%, <i>KMT2A<\/i> 1%) were found in 16% of samples. The loss-of-function variant of <i>ARID1A <\/i>was mostly non-sense mutation (6%). Activations of <i>ERBB2<\/i> (5%) were 3 focal amplifications and 4 hotspot missense mutations. Two samples were found to have microsatellite instability due to an alteration of <i>MLH1. <\/i>The Pik3\/AKT\/mTOR (26%) and the chromatin remodeling (23%) pathways were the most altered pathways. <i><\/i>The median follow-up period was 20 months. There were 6 relapses, of which 80% were considered as low risk based on SEDLIS criteria. Recurrences were local and occurred 9-23 months following surgery. Multiparity was the only clinical feature associated with RFS (p &#60; 0,001). Tumor size, histological subtypes, PD-L1 status, number of TIL&#8217;s, presence or absence of lymphovascular emboli and deep stromal invasion were not associated with RFS in our cohort.<i>KMT2C<\/i> (p=0,018) and <i>ARID1A<\/i> (p &#60; 0,001) pathogen variants were significantly associated with RFS. The pathway chromatin remodeling (p=0,063) showed a trend toward association with RFS. We found 32% of genomic alterations actionable for a target therapy including mutations of PIK3CA, ERBB2, ARID1A, PTEN, BRCA2, KRAS, BRAF, CDK12, FGFR2, NF1, AKT1, BRCA1, TP53 and MSI-high.<br \/>Conclusion: Our prospective, randomized and multicentric study suggests a genomic profile from a homogeneous cohort of 150 patients. We identified genes involved in chromatin remodeling (<i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>KMT2C<\/i>) as prognostic biomarkers of clinical interest and suggesting the relevance of epidrugs in ESCC. Theranostic annotations of variants identify a matched to target therapy for 32% of alterations. Those targets represent multiple tracks for personalized therapy in ESCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-08 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Genomics,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Existing methods for CMS classification rely on a representative input cohort as a preprocessing step (CMScaller) or have difficulty generalizing to metastatic samples (CMSclassifier). We developed Tempus CMS to overcome these limitations. Our method normalizes gene expression data from input samples to a static reference cohort to enable single sample classification of both primary and metastatic tumors. We evaluated the performance of this classifier on a large, de-identified CRC cohort comprising 8,489 samples from primary and metastatic sites.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> To normalize input data, our method shifts and scales each gene expression value based on the mean and standard deviation of the expression of that gene in the reference cohort (n=2,787 primary and metastatic CRC). CMS calls are then generated via nearest template prediction similar to CMScaller (Eide et al., 2017). The analysis cohort was selected from clinical biopsies within 30 days of primary or metastatic diagnosis excluding reference cohort samples. CMS calls were assessed by comparing subtype prevalence to reported rates and by testing for known enrichments of pathways and genomic markers.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Subtype prevalences for lower gastrointestinal (GI) biopsies and resections (n=5,090) were comparable to reported rates for primary CRC tumors: CMS1 - 12%, CMS2 - 28%, CMS3 - 19%, and CMS4 - 33% with 7.6% no calls. Biopsies from metastatic tissue showed site-specific changes in prevalence: CMS2 increased to 43% in liver samples (n=1,715) and CMS4 was identified in 49% of samples from metastatic sites excluding the liver (n=1,684). In addition, we found that purity had an effect on prevalence: in lower GI tumors with &#8805; 50% tumor purity rates of CMS2 and CMS4 were 34% and 26%, respectively, while rates in tumors with purity between 20% and 50% were 20% CMS2 and 41% CMS4.<br \/>Across all tissue groups, pathway enrichment showed significant associations, including TGF-&#42933; signaling in CMS4 (adj <i>P<\/i> &#8804; 4.4e-15) and cell differentiation in CMS3 (adj <i>P<\/i> &#8804; 3.0e-27). Expected enrichments of CMS markers were also observed: <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations and microsatellite instability in CMS1 and <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in CMS3. In liver tissue, higher <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation rates were noted in CMS1 (57%) and CMS3 (83%) compared to GI tissue (35% and 67%, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>In this study, we developed an enhanced, single sample CMS-calling algorithm optimized for primary and metastatic sites.

The primary endpoint of this study was to identify patient exome differences between early-stage laryngeal cancer patients who responded or rapidly progressed following definitive, narrow field radiotherapy. Our study offers the first exploration of mutation patterns in early-stage laryngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients receiving curative radiation therapy.<br \/><b>MATERIALS\/METHODS<\/b><br \/>We identified 36 early-stage laryngeal (T1 = 8, T1a = 4, T1b = 2, T1c = 1, T2 = 20, NA =1) HNSCC patients from the University of Kansas Medical Center treated with definitive narrow field radiotherapy to 63-70 Gray (gy) dose. Whole exome sequencing was performed in all patients. Patients were stratified into &#8220;responders&#8221; (never failed, N=14) and &#8220;non-responders&#8221; (recurrence &#60;12 months, N=21). Most non-responder patients with local recurrence underwent total salvage laryngectomy (TSL, N=18). All patients underwent whole exome sequencing. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) was used for pre-processing and functional annotation of variants. Cancer driver genes were detected for each group using the OncodriveCLUST algorithm. Differentially mutated genes were assessed using Fisher&#8217;s exact or exact McNemar&#8217;s test at P &#60; 0.05. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) comparisons employed the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with the same threshold. For pathway analysis in Reactome and Ingenuity, a P &#60; 0.1 was used for exploratory significance.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b><br \/>Mutation analysis identified distinct cancer driver genes between responders, (N=3), non-responders (N=36), and post-TSL (N=4). Among 75 genes with significant pre-treatment mutation differences between responders and non-responders, KCNT2 and AGAP6 were exclusively mutated in non-responders (OR=0, P=0.005 and OR=0, P=0.027, respectively), ADAMTS7 was solely mutated in responders (OR=inf, P=0.019), and PLEC showed more mutations in responders (OR=11.6, P=0.006). Pathway analysis showed these genes were involved in the RND2 GTPase cycle, protein O-glycosylation related diseases, and apoptotic pathways. Post-treatment analysis indicated an enrichment of mutations in apoptosis regulation pathways, with genes like PLEC being more frequently mutated in responders than in non-responders or TSL patients. In addition, we observed in non-responders that they trended towards higher median pre-treatment TMB compared to responders (7.98 vs 6.16, P=0.072). There was no significant difference in TMB between TSL patients and responders or non-responders pre-treatment.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b><br \/>Our analysis reveals distinct mutation patterns in early-stage laryngeal cancer patients by response to radiotherapy and the potential role of these mutated genes in apoptosis related pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutations,Head and neck cancers,Radiation therapy,Tumor mutational burden,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Aaron Segura<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Nissen<sup>2<\/sup>, Chris Lominska<sup>3<\/sup>, Ryan Morse<sup>4<\/sup>, Deri Morgan<sup>3<\/sup>, Prakash Neupane<sup>5<\/sup>, Dong Pei<sup>2<\/sup>, Devin Koestler<sup>2<\/sup>, Randall Kimple<sup>6<\/sup>, Umamaheswar Duvvuri<sup>7<\/sup>, Sufi Thomas<sup>8<\/sup>, Rohit Nallani<sup>8<\/sup>, Lisa Shnayder<sup>8<\/sup>, Kevin Sykes<sup>8<\/sup>, Kiran Kakarala<sup>8<\/sup>, Andres Bur<sup>8<\/sup>, Emrullah Yilmaz<sup>9<\/sup>, Gregory Gan<sup>10<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Radiation Oncology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Ctr., Albuquerque, NM,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biostatistics & Data Science, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Albuquerque, KS,<sup>6<\/sup>Deparment of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Hematology and Medical Oncolgy, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH,<sup>10<\/sup>University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3a696060-8bc7-4846-a850-803eaa7f3126","ControlNumber":"5505","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Heavy tobacco use, &#62;40 pack-years, is strongly associated with developing SCLC, which near universally harbors <i>RB1<\/i> and<i> TP53 <\/i>co-mutations. However, there is a paucity of information regarding SCLC tumors that occur in patients with minimal tobacco use. This represents an unmet need given an increasing appreciation for low pack-year and never-smoker SCLC with some studies, like the CAPSTONE-1 trial, demonstrating an incidence of never-smoking SCLC &#62;20%. To address this, we clinically characterized the treatments and outcomes of a 164 SCLC patient cohort with &#8804;10 pack year smoking histories treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; 22 of which underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES).<br \/>The overall survival of limited-stage (LS-SCLC) and extensive-stage (ES-SCLC) disease in the low pack-year cohort were 33.6 and 16.6 months, respectively (P=0.003); superior to historic medians of roughly 17.0 and 12.3 months, respectively. Among those with ES-SCLC, those who reported 1-10 pack-years had significantly <u>improved<b> <\/b><\/u>median overall survival as compared to never-smokers; 19.5 vs 15.8 months, respectively (P=0.02). This trend was observed in LS-SCLC as well with 1-10 pack-year and never-smokers demonstrating median overall survivals of 88.6 vs 26.2 months, respectively (P=0.2). Demographic differences including age were similar across these cohorts.<br \/>WES of tumors from 22 patients demonstrated significantly fewer mutations in <i>RB1<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> than was observed in previously reported cohorts of SCLC from smokers. Among the low-pack year cohort, 7\/22 (32% vs 98.2%:P&#60;0.001) harbored an <i>RB1<\/i> alteration, 7\/22 (32% vs 90.9%: P&#60;0.001) harbored a <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation, and 4\/22 (18% vs 90.9%: P&#60;0.001) had co-occurring <i>RB1\/TP53<\/i> mutations. No patients harbored mutations in <i>EGFR, HER2<\/i>, or <i>RET<\/i>. Mutations in potentially targetable pathways were observed throughout the cohort including the DNA-damage repair pathways, RTK\/RAS, and PI3K.<br \/>Taken together, these data demonstrate that patients with low pack-year SCLC have improved overall survival compared to historic averages for SCLC patients with a history of heavy tobacco use. Paradoxically, however, light-smokers with SCLC live longer than never-smokers, and these patients may harbor a higher frequency of targetable alterations than typical SCLC patients, highlighting the importance of molecular profiling in SCLC patients with minimal tobacco use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Genomics,Targeted therapy,Smoking,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Genes within several cellular pathways have been previously evaluated for their clinical impact in NSCLC. In this investigation, we evaluate genetic mutations found in 50 cancer-critical genes implicated in the signaling pathways RTK\/RAS\/MAP, TGF&#946;, PI3K, Wnt, GPCR, p53, JAK\/STAT, Notch, and the cell cycle pathway. Some of these mutations have not yet been described or have not been described in NSCLC. The intent of our study is to evaluate these mutations and allow further research into their impact, specifically highlighting mutations that are involved in clinically important pathways.<br \/>We evaluated mutations found in 59 NSCLC patients at the Prisma Health Cancer Institute. These mutations are part of 2,800 COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) hotspot mutations in 50 cancer-critical genes. Each mutation was investigated further using the ClinVar database to identify whether it had been described in NSCLC or other cancers\/conditions, its genetic consequence, pathogenesis, possible variations, and origin.<br \/>A total of 73 unique mutations in 59 NSCLC patients were evaluated. Of the 73 mutations, 17 had not been described at all, 40 had been described in other cancers\/conditions, and 16 had been previously described in NSCLC. The known mutations&#8217; effects in other cancers\/conditions were categorized as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, benign, or uncertain. Novel mutations were found in genes that provide a druggable target, help predict treatment response, are under investigation for their ability to predict treatment response or confer additional clinical utility.<br \/>Medical management of cancer has benefitted greatly from studies of genetic mutations. Most mutations identified in our patient population had not been described in NSCLC, and a smaller number of those had not been described at all. Further elucidation of these mutations may lead to additional discoveries relevant to NSCLC prognostication and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutations,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Oncogene,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

The current TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system for NSCLC uses physical exam, histology, imaging, and surgical findings to define the extent and spread of a patient&#8217;s cancer. Despite advances in molecular testing which can impact treatment and prognosis for NSCLC patients, the current system does not incorporate molecular data into staging.<br \/>We proposed a novel predictive model for survival analysis which integrates molecular analysis of liquid biopsies (B) into the TNM staging system (1). In this study, we tested this new staging system and our predictive model shows TNM + B (TNMB) provides a better predictive model for survival compared to TNM alone.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b>176 patients were identified at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist with Guardant 360 liquid biopsies sent at diagnosis for NSCLC. Clinical data was obtained through retrospective chart review. Molecular analysis was performed on 81 genes across all Guardant 360 liquid biopsies. Using Cox proportional hazards model, we identified significant gene mutations or genes with significant magnitude of variant allele frequency (VAF) that improved survival prediction. We then designed a novel staging system incorporating whether a patient had a positive liquid biopsy test (B1), defined by the presence of these impact gene variables, to TNM stage.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Three impact genes STK11 (p=0.0253), NFE2L2 (p = 0.0025), TP53 (p=0.0129) and one gene with a magnitude of VAF, ARID1A (p=0.0082) was identified which significantly improved the predictive model for survival. Patients with negative liquid biopsy test, B0, had improved survival compared to patients with a positive liquid biopsy test, B1 (p&#60;0.005). In our cohort, TNM staging alone did not show a significant survival difference between stage II and III (p = 0.19). Whereas TNMB staging showed a significant survival difference between stage II, III and IV.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>While TNM stage remains a major prognostic factor for NSCLC patients, it fails to incorporate molecular data which has a critical impact on management and prognosis. We designed a novel method to analyze molecular data obtained by liquid biopsy to identify significant gene mutations and gene magnitude of VAF that impacts survival prediction. In our cohort, we showed 4 impact genes which we used to create a new TNMB staging system which led to improved survival prediction compared to TNM alone.<br \/><b>Acknowledgments<\/b>: Research partly supported by NIH T32 Grant (T32CA247819) and Cancer Center Support Grant (P30CA012197)<br \/><b>Reference: (1) <\/b>Yang M, Forbes ME, Bitting RL, O'Neill SS, Chou PC, Topaloglu U, Miller LD, Hawkins GA, Grant SC, DeYoung BR, Petty WJ, Chen K, Pasche BC, Zhang W.

Here, we aimed to identify and to characterise ILC subgroups based on TME heterogeneity by combining spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).<br \/>Methods: We performed ST (Visium 10x Genomics) on frozen tumor samples from 41 primary hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) ILCs. Information coming from the morphological annotation of ST slides and the gene expression-based clustering of ST spots was integrated and used as input for a patient level classification (using intNMF algorithm). Subgroups of patients were annotated using morphology, gene set enrichment analysis and ST deconvolution based on scRNA-seq data (CARD software). SCAN-B bulk RNA-seq dataset was used as validation set (HR+, HER2- ILC samples, n = 853).<br \/>Results: Four subgroups of patients were identified: proliferative (P, n = 12, enriched in tumor cells and proliferation-related pathways), normal-stroma enriched (NSE, n = 10, enriched in fibroblasts, stroma-related pathways and showing an higher level of colocalization between invasive and in situ carcinoma), metabolic (M, n = 9, enriched in metabolic related-pathways) and metabolic-immune enriched (MIE, n = 10, enriched in adipocytes, metabolic and immune-related pathways). Deconvolution of ST spots with single cell data revealed matching results with morphology (in terms of cell types). We observed an enrichment of myofibroblasts in NSE, an enrichment of cancer epithelial in P and, interestingly, an enrichment of endothelial cells in M subgroup (fdr &#60; 0.25). MIE was characterized by perivascular like-endothelial cells and myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages, fdr &#60; 0.25). Of note, at the level of the ST slide, myeloid cells in MIE subgroup were more present in the adipose tissue compartment (fdr &#60; 0.25) compared to the rest of the slide. NSE subgroup showed a trend for association with better prognosis. Gene signature-based assignment identified the same four subgroups in SCAN-B: GSEA analysis and comparisons among the four subgroups showed matching results between our dataset and SCAN-B. Of note, in SCAN-B, we observed differences in prognosis among the subgroups, with NSE showing better, M and MIE intermediate and P worse prognosis for overall survival and relapse free interval (p &#60; 0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: Four subgroups of ILC based on TME heterogeneity and showing differences in prognosis were identified and validated in external cohort. Of note, two of these groups were related to metabolism, highlighting the value of such process in ILC biology. Importantly, myeloid cells were the predominant immune cell types in ILC, and they showed a specific compartmentalization inside the TME. Further validation is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Invasive lobular carcinoma,Spatial transcriptomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Rare cases exist where both de novo NEPC and ARPC are found in the same tissue sample. Our study examines one such unique case: a 78-year-old male treated at Ehime University Hospital who was diagnosed with both ARPC and adjacent de novo metastatic NEPC. This case provides an excellent opportunity for studying gene expression in these two types of prostate cancer. Materials &#38; Methods We used Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression technology from 10x Genomics to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from this unique patient. Results We observed elevated expression levels of specific neuroendocrine markers like PEG10, DLL3, NCAM1, SYP, and CHGA in de novo NEPC regions. In contrast, androgen receptor markers such as KLK3, ACPP, TMPRSS2, and NKX3.1 were more prevalent in ARPC areas. Furthermore, genes like Chek1, BRCA1\/2, TOP2A, and FANCA were also elevated in NEPC, suggesting that PARP and TOP2 inhibitors could be effective. Expression levels of Rbfox3 and SFRTM2 were lower in NEPC areas, implying possible roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, fibrotic markers like HGF, HMOX1, ELN, and GREM1 were upregulated, suggesting that de novo NEPC tumors might be 'immune cold,' thus requiring treatments to boost the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusion The data from additional cases could open the door for new treatment options for NEPC and improve survival rates for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Our research serves as a pioneering application of Visium CytAssist on FFPE samples and is the first to examine gene expression in both ARPC and de novo NEPC. A subset of these findings was published in the International Journal of Molecular Science (IJMS) in May 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine tumors,Gene expression patterns,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

Currently, standard-of-care cytogenetics in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is composed of a combination of karyotyping, FISH testing, and in some cases chromosomal microarray analysis, each test offering a unique combination of advantages and weaknesses. A particular challenge for this combination of tests is the delivery of results in a timely and comprehensive manner. To overcome these limitations, we have developed OncoTerra, a proximity-ligation-sequencing based method which can rapidly detect all classes of variants detected by cytogenetics tests in a single assay. We applied OncoTerra to a cohort of more than 100 samples from a SWOG AML trial (S0106), benchmarking sensitivity and specificity of the variants. We observed an overall &#62;0.95 sensitivity and a specificity of 1 for the variants identified by cytogenetics and identified numerous cryptic variants. Overall, we identified variants that changed the diagnostic risk stratification of 15% of the patient involved in the trial based on the ELN 2022 criteria. This translated into better overall prediction of outcomes of patients in the trial and has identified both known and novel variants missed by standard-of-care tools.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Acute myeloid leukemia,Cytogenetics,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

The risk of developing secondary hematologic malignancy, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (MDS\/AML), is substantially higher (4-12%) after PARPi maintenance or treatment in the second line and beyond in patients with ovarian cancer. This elevated risk necessitates additional investigation into the pathogenesis of PARPi-related secondary malignancy. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been associated with the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. We aim to understand the patterns of CHIP in patients with high grade serous ovarian carcinoma who receive PARPi therapy.<br \/>Methods: We performed ultra-high-depth whole exome sequencing of plasma derived cfDNA or white blood cells (WBCs) barcoded with unique molecular identifiers from patients with high grade serous ovarian carcinoma who were treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy (n=6) or with PARPi in addition to chemotherapy (n = 10). Using spike-in mutated DNAs as positive controls, we detected variant alleles as low as 1% variant allele frequency. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on identified groups.<br \/>Results: We identified 7162 recurrent variants among our patients. We began by comparing quantities of CHIP between the samples from patients who eventually receive PARPi and those who do not. Samples contained a median of 2030 recurrent CHIP variants and 4300 total variants. No differences in total CHIP quantity or mutation type was discernable among samples from patients who will receive PARPi (BRCA1\/2 enriched) vs those who will not. Among our 16 patients, 14 ultimately developed secondary hematologic malignancy (t-MN+ Comparison of t-MN+ (n=14) and t-MN- (n=2) defined a group of 14 variants enriched in the t-MN+ population and a group of 85 variants depleted in the t-MN+ population. The t-MN+ enriched variants we identified were not previously associated with CHIP and had significant overlaps with alkyl transferase activity (FDR q val &#60; 0.01) and nucleotide binding gene sets (FDR q val &#60; 0.01).<br \/>Conclusions: We used a novel methodology to identify unbiased low variant mutational changes in the hematopoietic system. These results suggest that baseline clonal hematopoiesis variants are similar among patients newly diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma. We have also identified a signature potentially related to future risk of leukemia requiring further validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Epcoritamab SC, a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, demonstrated promising efficacy with a manageable safety profile in pts with R\/R FL after &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy (phase 1\/2 EPCORE NHL-1; NCT03625037). Here we evaluated MRD with PBMCs and ctDNA in pts with R\/R FL and correlated the results with clinical findings.<br \/>Methods: Adults with R\/R FL 1-3A enrolled in EPCORE NHL-1 received epcoritamab SC in 28-day cycles. MRD analysis was performed on longitudinal plasma and PBMC samples collected at prespecified timepoints (clonoSEQ assay, Adaptive Biotechnologies). Screening tumor biopsies were used to identify trackable tumor clones; samples were quantified as tumor clones detected per mL plasma for ctDNA and per one million nucleated cells for PBMC. Overall response and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed using Lugano criteria by independent review committee.<br \/>Results: Of 128 pts in the R\/R FL 1-3A cohort, 91 with PBMC data and 100 with ctDNA data were MRD evaluable. Overall MRD negativity was achieved in 67.0% [95% CI: 56.4-76.5] of pts per PBMC and 68.0% [95% CI: 57.9-77.0] of pts per ctDNA. Concordance of subject-level MRD status was high (79 of 89 with PBMC and ctDNA data; 88.8%). In most pts, MRD negativity was reached prior to radiographic complete response (PBMC, 76.4%; ctDNA 58.5%). MRD negativity by PBMC preceded ctDNA (median days to MRD negativity, 28 [PBMC] vs 57 [ctDNA]), suggesting a difference in methodology in detecting tumor DNA. Pts who became MRD negative had prolonged PFS (median not reached). Baseline MRD levels were not associated with clinical outcomes (PBMC; Wilcoxon <i>P<\/i>=0.59, ctDNA <i>P<\/i>=0.39). PFS was similar in pts achieving MRD negative status (median not reached, PBMC and ctDNA), independent of high-risk\/difficult-to-treat disease (&#8805;4 prior lines, Ann Arbor stage III-IV, bulky disease, double refractory, FLIPI 3-5, and POD24). The overall MRD negativity rate was also similar in high-risk pts, except those with &#8805;4 prior lines of therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Based on the EPCORE-NHL-1 study, one of the first pivotal studies to report MRD in pts with R\/R FL, epcoritamab drives rapid, deep, and sustained responses as supported by MRD assessment by both PBMC and ctDNA. MRD results correlate with clinical outcome, and achieving MRD negativity is associated with longer PFS. PFS was similar among all pts who achieved MRD negativity, including those with high-risk disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-08 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Lymphoma,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>D.

The biological basis for such heterogeneous disease behavior remains to be elucidated. Bulk transcriptomic profiling and subsequently single-cell RNAseq have provided insight in the epithelial subtypes and immune microenvironment. Recently spatially resolved transcriptomic assessment allow molecular profiling of tissue while preserving tissue architecture. Utilizing ST technology we sought to perform deep characterization of a large cohort of patients with primary CRC with the intention to decipher the biological determinants of spatio-temporal patterns of recurrence.<br \/>Methods: 750 patients who underwent resection of CRC with mature follow up were studied. Bulk transcriptomic, genomic and multiplex immune characterization was performed using a TMA format. Of these, 28 patients were assessed using single cell spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI, 1000plex gene panel)), 120 tumors underwent regional whole transcriptome profiling of epithelium and TME (Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler using FFPE tissue). We used image analysis and bioinformatics to integrate these complex datasets in over 120000 single-cells in the context of their spatial tissue architecture and clinicopatholgical outcome and recurrence data.<br \/>Results: Using the CosMx SMI we characterized cells with complete topographic detail and defined 2 unique epithelial cell states defined. Each epithelial state had distinct spatial properties including cell size and morphology, average distance to nearest lymphocyte, neighboring cell types and stromal neighborhood. This epithelial signature was integrated in GeoMx samples and were found to predict recurrence (p&#60;0.05). The Epithelial, Fibroblast and Immune GeoMx transcriptomic compartments were expanded and grouped using unsupervised clustering. Each compartment demonstrated groups of patients where specific spatially derived signatures could predict site and time of recurrence (p&#60;0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: By maintaining the tissue structure, we have directly measured cellular interactions and captured cells commonly missed during dissociative studies whilst defining novel molecular subtypes of CRC with clinical relevance. Novel platforms such as CosMx allow deeper characterization of unique cell types and cellular interactions that may pave the way for novel therapeutics and precision medicine for patients with CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Molecular subtypes,Tumor microenvironment,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Colin Stuart Wood<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Joao Da Silva Filho<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Cameron<sup>1<\/sup>, Assya Legrini<sup>1<\/sup>, Holly Leslie<sup>1<\/sup>, Tengyu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoana Doncheva<sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Kennedy-Dietrich<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthias Marti<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanne Edwards<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Horgan<sup>1<\/sup>, Campbell Roxburgh<sup>1<\/sup>, Colin Steele<sup>1<\/sup>, Nigel Jamieson<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Glasgow - Institute of Cancer Sciences, Glasgow, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Glasgow - Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Glasgow, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7c39f212-eb95-4a2e-9ec7-811080b45f45","ControlNumber":"3988","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

However, the proteogenomic implications of these signatures and their connections to environmental influences and immune interactions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we comprehensively investigated these signatures from a broader proteogenomic perspective to further discern their genetic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and environmental ramifications. The harmonized dataset of 1064 samples across ten cancer types from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) pan-cancer resource was utilized for this investigation. Beyond genetic alterations and mutational signatures, we harnessed high-throughput multi-omics data to detect critical changes and infer expression signatures associated with the transitions to seven tumor-linked phenotypes: aging, Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide (APOBEC), Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD), Microsatellite Instability (MSI), Polymerase Epsilon (POLE), smoking, and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure at the pan-cancer level. We prioritized the top differentially expressed markers uniquely found at the protein and phosphoprotein levels and developed a quantitative score predicting each phenotype status, such as MSI. Respectively, we pinpointed potential candidates as actionable therapeutic targets by linking the identified markers to druggable databases. This offers additional cues to optimize therapeutic options for patients. Specifically, directing attention to genes up-regulated in HRD tumors treated with PARP1 inhibitors shows potential promise in overcoming resistance. Moreover, we explored environmental exposure-related tumor proteogenomic signatures and their association with immune infiltration levels and phenotypes. Notably, smoking strongly influenced the tumor microenvironment (TME) and prognosis in lung cancer. In summary, our identification of expression signatures facilitates phenotype prediction and unveils their molecular mechanisms. We anticipate clinical utility in classifying samples using proteogenomics, particularly in cases where a solely genomic assessment is inconclusive.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Genomics,Therapeutic target,Environmental exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Molecular regulation of splicing is an attractive drug target and clinical trials are currently evaluating splice-targeted therapies (STTs). Due in part to the complex and pleiotropic nature of splicing regulation, molecular biomarkers to identify patients who may benefit from STTs are lacking. While mutations in splicing factors (SFs) are promising biomarkers, these are rare, leaving many patients with unmet need. In this study, we identified and characterized splicing patterns (SPs) in a large, multi-cancer cohort.<br \/><b><i>Methods<\/i><\/b> De-identified patient records with splicing data from the Tempus xR whole transcriptome assay were extracted from the Tempus clinicogenomic database (N=2918). A total of 1052 alternative splicing events were detected in at least 90% of the samples with at least 10 supporting reads. Leiden clustering was applied to the percent spliced-in (PSI) values of these events to identify SPs. Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to assess clinical and molecular enrichment in SPs, and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to assess associations with rwOS and derive hazard ratios (HRs).<br \/><b><i>Results<\/i><\/b> From a list of 404 SF genes 7.7% of patients had one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P\/LP) SF variants, and 2.2% had variants in the key biomarker SF genes <i>SF3B1<\/i>, <i>SRSF2<\/i>, or <i>U2AF1<\/i>. Clustering revealed 15 SPs containing 43 to 353 samples. One SP had a significant enrichment of SF variants (19.7% of SP, P &#60; 0.0005). SPs were associated with significant differences in rwOS, and many were enriched for samples from a single cancer type, biopsy, or histology - principally by prostate cancer (97.5% of SP), melanoma (94.3% of SP), urothelial carcinoma (93.4% of SP), and renal clear cell carcinoma (93.0% of SP), as well as samples collected from liver biopsies (93.9% of SP). In contrast, colorectal and lung adenocarcinoma samples were present in a wide variety of SPs. One SP was enriched for squamous histologies (66.6% of SP, P &#60; 0.0005) and associated with shorter rwOS (HR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.11, 1.59], P &#60; 0.0005). This association remained after controlling for squamous histology (HR = 1.45, 95% CI [1.02, 2.05], P = 0.04). Samples in this SP were characterized by increased expression of <i>MYC-<\/i> and proliferation-related genes, and lacked enrichment for SF variants (P = 0.51, 6.6%).<br \/><b><i>Conclusions<\/i><\/b> Mutations in SFs were rare in our cohort, highlighting the need for additional biomarkers related to STTs. This work revealed the presence of multiple SPs - characterized by distinct clinical and molecular traits. Further work will be able to contextualize STT response data using SPs to facilitate STT biomarker discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Splice variants,Spliceosome,Molecular subtypes,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Characterization of tumor microenvironment (TME) in GC is important not only to comprehensively understand tumor biology in GC but also to develop a novel cancer therapeutics targeting TME. In this study, we conducted multi-omics analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq), and whole exome sequencing (WES) using biopsied tumor samples through endoscopy from 23 GC patients: 3 treatment-na&#239;ve patients, 7 patients in treatment with chemotherapy (Chemo), 5 patients in combination treatment with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (Chemo+CPI), 3 patients in combination treatment with chemotherapy and Her2-antibody targeted therapy (Chemo+Her2i), and 5 patients in third-line or later treatment. We initially classified the GC samples into 4 molecular subtypes (CIN, GS, MSI, and EBV) using datasets of WES, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq, showing that our samples were mainly composed of CIN (n=7) and GS (n=16) types. In scRNA-seq, we revealed that drug treatments profoundly modulated not only proportions of TME components but also their molecular characteristics. For instance, Chemo+CPI treated patients showed higher proportion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with activation and\/or exhaustion markers. Combination treatments with Chemo+Her2i, in addition, resulted in higher Trail and Estrogen signaling pathways in epithelial cells of TME components. These findings suggest that interventions with certain cancer therapeutic drugs could substantially convert transcriptome landscape and reconstitute GC TME components. High-resolution of GC TME analyses should provide a clue for developing a next generation of cancer therapeutic drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-05 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Single cell,Cancer genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>H.
