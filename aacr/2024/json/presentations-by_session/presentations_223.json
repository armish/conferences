[{"Abstract":"Background: Although trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for HER2-positive mGC, not all patients respond to the therapy. To date, there is no reliable and efficient biomarker that can predict the response to trastuzumab-based treatment.<br \/>Methods: Clinical data and pathology slides from HER2-positive mGC patients treated with first-line trastuzumab and capecitabine\/5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin were retrospectively collected. HER2 positivity was confirmed using standard methods with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and\/or in situ hybridization. An AI-based model was applied to a single HER2 IHC-stained whole slide image (WSI) of each patient to identify and quantify the tumor cells with HER2 IHC staining intensity categories of 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ on the slide. The proportion of tumor cells with 3+ staining intensity among total tumor cells (h3 percentage) in each slide was calculated and analyzed in relation to clinical outcomes.<br \/>Results: A total of 160 cases were included in this analysis. Overall, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.2 mo, and the overall survival (OS) was 18.9 mo. By standard IHC HER2 grading, 107 (66.9%) 3+ and 53 (33.1%) 2+ cases were included. The median AI-estimated h3 percentage in these patients was 14.8% (range 0 - 99.5%). The patients with their best tumor response of complete (CR) or partial response (PR) (44.4%) exhibited significantly higher h3 percentages (mean h3 percentage 46.6% in CR\/PR vs. 29.4% in stable or progressive disease, p = 0.018). The h3 percentage exhibited strong associations as a continuous variable with longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 - 0.99] for 10% change of h3 percentages, p = 0.015) or OS (HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.89 - 0.98] for 10% change of h3 percentages, p = 0.004). Notably, patients having a proportion of 3+ tumor cells at &#8805; 90% (27\/160, 16.9%) showed particularly longer PFS (median PFS 21.4 mo in &#8805; 90% vs. 8.5mo in &#60; 90%, p = 0.006) and OS (median OS 40.3 mo in &#8805; 90% vs. 16.6 mo in &#60; 90%, p = 0.004).<br \/>Conclusion: AI-based models interpreting WSI can provide additive predictive information to HER2-positive mGC patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Machine learning,Predictive biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"M.

Tivumecirnon (formerly known as FLX475), a small molecule oral CCR4 antagonist under clinical evaluation, blocks the binding of CCR4 to its ligands CCL17 and CCL22 and thereby reduces Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). This relieves Treg-mediated immune suppression resulting in increased antitumor immunity. Our clinical study (NCT03674567) demonstrated that tivumecirnon can block the local accumulation of Treg in the TME and has clinical activity as monotherapy as well as in combination with pembrolizumab. In both mouse and human tumors, we identified a subset of tumor infiltrating dendritic cells (DC) producing high levels of CCL22, previously identified as mregDC, suggesting a potential role in the CCR4-dependent recruitment of Treg.<br \/>To study the role of mregDC in the recruitment of Treg, non-clinical studies were performed. CD45+ immune cells from the TME of MB49 tumor bearing mice treated with tivumecirnon or vehicle and were analyzed by flow cytometry, scRNA-seq and CITE-seq. We confirmed that<b> <\/b>mregDC cells are the primary producer of CCL22 in the TME and that tivumecirnon treatment reduced the number of Treg cells in the TME and increased the percentage of IFN gamma and granzyme B expressing CD4+ T cells.<br \/>Based on these findings we interrogated tumor biopsies from patients from our clinical study prior to (n = 33), and after approximately 6 weeks of treatment (n = 22, pre\/post-treatment paired samples) with tivumecirnon +\/- pembrolizumab. We performed RNAseq and compared to published biopsy data from anti-PD-1 treated patients. We found that higher mregDC + Treg signature levels at baseline significantly (p &#60; 0.001) associated with response to tivumecirnon and pembrolizumab therapy. Importantly, analysis of published datasets revealed that higher baseline mregDC and Treg levels are not associated with response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Analysis of TCGA gene expression data demonstrated a positive correlation with mregDC and Treg cells across human tumor types, indicating a previously unknown relationship between these cell types. Further application of this mregDC and Treg signature to the TCGA dataset identified a subset of cancer types resistant to prior treatments that could potentially benefit from combinatorial treatment with tivumecirnon. Overall, this study demonstrated that inhibition of the CCR4 pathway using tivumecirnon can disrupt the immunosuppressive mregDC &#8211; Treg axis leading to enhanced antitumor activity. Furthermore, the levels of mregDC and Treg may be used as a biomarker for selection of patients more likely to respond to tivumecirnon in combination with anti-PD-1. Additional studies are required to confirm these results","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Bioinformatics,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Adam Grant<sup>1<\/sup>, Juraj Adamik<sup>1<\/sup>, Jingtao Qiu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacob Wert<sup>1<\/sup>, Molly Grandcolas<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Jacobson<sup>1<\/sup>, Rakesh  K.

Nevertheless, intrinsic or acquired resistance is common, and the interactions between tumor-intrinsic features and the microenvironment underlying these resistances remain unclear for most patients.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we developed a framework to analyze response and resistance, both intrinsic and acquired, via tumor-intrinsic programs, immune features, and tumor-stromal-immune interactions in a standardized, uniformly processed, and deeply clinically annotated cohort of metastatic melanoma patients (n=61) treated with ICB as part of the NCI funded human tumor atlas network (HTAN) initiative. From the same tumor samples (pre-treatment (n=33) and post-progression (n=28)), we conducted bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES), single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and for a subset of the samples high-resolution spatial imaging (including protein mIHC, CODEX, and transcriptomics MERFISH). Standardized processing and data pipelines allowed for integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and spatial features to elucidate shared tumor and microenvironmental states and their relationships with resistance.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary analysis on a subset of 28 samples identified an enrichment of B cells, plasma cells, and T follicular helper-like cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients sensitive to treatment. The TME of non-responders was predominantly characterized by macrophage\/monocyte cell populations. Post-treatment responder samples showed an enrichment of CD4+ T cells. Genomic heterogeneity, assessed through WES, was confirmed as a feature of intrinsic resistance across different ICB treatment settings, while ploidy was associated with treatment response in pre-treatment, ipilimumab-na&#239;ve patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Comparing the immune compartments of samples with high and low heterogeneity revealed NK cell enrichment in samples with a high proportion of subclonal mutations.<br \/>Conclusions and Future Directions: Overall, our work provides a high-resolution understanding of the tumor-stromal-immune interaction in metastatic melanoma, shedding light on the factors contributing to therapy response and resistance, and contributing a repository of data from deeply clinically annotated, multimodally characterized and uniformly processed patient samples. Ongoing spatial analysis will further enhance our understanding of these compartments at a spatial level. The results of our study have the potential to guide more personalized and effective treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Single cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>G.

This observation could be confirmed in the external cohorts of immunotherapy patients (SU2C-ICI: HR=0.54, CI 0.28-1.03 and MSK-ICI: HR=0.35, CI 0.14-0.88), whereas KRASmut\/TP53mut was not associated with prolonged survival in the surgical cohorts. Tumor mutational burden, proliferation (measured by TOP2A mRNA expression), and PD-L1 mRNA were significantly higher in TP53mut compared with TP53wt tumors, regardless of KRAS status. Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis revealed 64 genes including the chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine) as specific transcriptomic characteristic of KRASmut\/TP53mut tumors.<b><\/b> In summary, KRAS\/TP53 co-mutation predicts ICI benefit in univariate and multivariate survival analyses and is associated with unique molecular tumor features.

As previously published, durable responses (progression-free at 12 months) were observed in 4 out of 32 enrolled patients. Here, we present the final overall survival (OS) results and an analysis of potential biomarkers for immunotherapy response.<br \/>Methods: Preplanned analysis projected that at 27\/32 events, the study would have 80% power (2-sided &#945;=0.05) to assess whether the OS for the entire cohort significantly differed from the hypothesized historical median for stage IV patients. Baseline tumor tissue samples were subjected to bulk-RNA sequencing (n=31), fluorescent (n=28) and chromogenic (n=30) multiplex immunohistochemistry. We quantified the densities of CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T-cells, CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>-<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>-<\/sup> T-helper cells, CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>-<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> regulatory T-cells, CD68<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and CD20<sup>+<\/sup> B-cells in both the tumor and stromal compartments and assessed spatial relationships. We also quantified CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> (potentially enriched for tumor reactivity) and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>-<\/sup> T-cells. Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using the hallmarks gene sets.<br \/>Results: The median OS for the entire study cohort was 11.3 months (95% CI, 5.5-16.7), which is an improvement compared to the hypothesized historical median of 7.8 months for stage IV patients (one sample log-rank <i>p<\/i>=0.033). Biomarker analyses showed an increased density of stromal macrophages (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) and intratumoral cytotoxic T-cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.035) in durable responders compared to non-responders. Additionally, we observed an increased density of intratumoral CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> in durable responders (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). In contrast, intratumoral CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>-<\/sup> densities were comparable between durable and non-responders (<i>p<\/i>=0.057). Patients with a high density of intratumoral CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+ <\/sup>also had an improved progression-free survival (PFS) (log-rank, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001) and OS (log-rank, <i>p<\/i>=0.002). Analysis of the spatial relationships in the tumor microenvironment (TME) showed that durable responders had larger distances between cytotoxic T-cells and T-helper cells (<i>p<\/i>=0.034). GSEA revealed significant (FDR&#8804;5%) up-regulation of IFN-&#945;\/&#947; responses in durable responders. In contrast, non-responders showed up-regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, KRAS signaling and angiogenesis, suggesting potential barriers to an anti-tumor response.<br \/>Conclusion: In the final clinical analysis, OS was improved with atezolizumab compared to the historical population of stage IV patients. CD8<sup>+<\/sup>PD1<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, a common proxy for tumor-reactive T-cells, and spatial relationships in the TME might serve as biomarkers of durable response to immunotherapy in advanced penile cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Penile Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>T.

Unfortunately, response to immunochemotherapy is highly variable, despite most EAC cases featuring a high mutation burden. EAC response to ICI is assessed using radiological criteria such as irRECIST, but its ability to predict long-term survival is poor. Consequently, early recognition of a failing therapy is challenging. More accurate early biomarkers of response to ICI are therefore of critical importance.<br \/>Here, we show that a classifier based on epigenetic features in cfDNA taken 4 weeks after treatment initiation accurately predicts treatment benefit after one year. Strikingly, this blood-based biomarker predicts OS better than radiological criteria.<br \/>We collected cell free DNA (cfDNA) from patients enrolled in the LUD2015-005 trial, in which ICI was administered for four weeks before adding standard-of-care chemotherapy (ICI+CTX). For each patient, we collected cfDNA, tumor and adjacent normal tissue at diagnosis, before ICI+CTX, during and at the end of treatment, in addition to radiological clinical imaging.<br \/>Tissue and cfDNA samples were sequenced using TET-Assisted Pyridine-borane Sequencing (TAPS), a method recently developed in Oxford which provides high-depth, base-resolution DNA methylation information from low-input samples.<br \/>Based on tissue data, we identified a genome-wide hypomethylation signature specific to tumor cells. By accounting for sample-to-sample variability in stromal composition, we show that this signature is present in most EACs, allowing us to model the admixture of tumor and normal methylation patterns to quantify the amount of <u>t<\/u>umor <u>m<\/u>ethylation <u>d<\/u>etected (TMD) in cfDNA.<br \/>16 patients had increased TMD (TMD-up) after 4 weeks of ICI monotherapy compared to pre-treatment levels, while 15 patients had decreased TMD (TMD-dn). Median OS for the two groups were 37 and 112 weeks, respectively (<i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.0001). We evaluated the radiological response according to irRECIST at similar timepoints. 17 of 32 patients (53.1%) had no definitive evidence of progression nor response and were deemed to have radiologically stable disease. 8 of these patients went on to develop progressive disease within 1 year - all 8 patients belonged to the TMD-up group. Contrastingly, 8 out of 9 patients who had PFI greater than 1 year belonged to TMD-dn. In all 32 patients, TMD predicted radiological disease progression within 1 year with 83.3% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity.<br \/>Taken together, we report the discovery of a circulatory biomarker that measures molecular response to ICI in EAC and identifies poor prognosis patients that appear stable from radiological imaging. Furthermore, patients with favorable molecular response were found to have a median OS almost 3 times that of patients with unfavorable molecular response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Epigenomics,Immune checkpoint blockade,Esophageal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"P.

Here we describe the performance of a methylation-based ctDNA assay to quantify ctDNA levels and correlate changes with outcomes in a real-world NSCLC cohort.<br \/>Methods: RADIOHEAD is a pan-tumor observational study of 1200 patients on standard of care ICI treatment regimens with plasma samples collected prospectively for retrospective analysis. We randomly selected 241 NSCLC pts that have a combined total of 761 samples (236 baseline, 191 C3D1, and 128 at 6 months post first dose). Samples were analyzed using a commercial NGS assay, which quantifies circulating tumor fraction (cTF) via interrogating thousands of methylation sites from ctDNA, validated with LoB, LoD, LoQ, and linearity studies. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) were used for comparison of real-world progression free survival (rwPFS). Gender, age, disease stage, and blood-assessed tumor mutational burden (bTMB) were included as covariates. Median rwPFS was calculated using Kaplan Meier analysis. rwPFS ordinal groups were defined as PFS event within 3mo, 3-6mo, 6-12mo, and greater than 12mo, and association with early ctDNA changes was assessed with a chi-squared test.<br \/>Results: In this cohort, 4, 11, 83 and 142 pts were stage I to IV, respectively (1 unknown). Methylation based detection of ctDNA at baseline or C3D1 was associated with shorter rwPFS (baseline: mPFS 12.7 mo [9.3-19.5] vs NR [16.4-NR]; HR=2.2 [1.3-3.7] p&#60;0.005, C3D1: mPFS 12.4 mo [9.3-16.1] vs NR [19.5-NR] HR= 2.2 [1.3-3.5], p&#60;0.005) independent of stage, gender, or age. Longer rwPFS was associated with &#62;95% reduction in cTF from baseline to C3D1 or low ctDNA at both timepoints (rwPFS &#60;3mo = 12.5%, 3-6 mo = 30.8%, 6-12 = 37.1%, &#8805;12 mo = 55.3%; N=153, p=0.015). For pts with ctDNA not detected at C3D1, ctDNA detection at 6 months post first dose was strongly associated with shorter rwPFS (mPFS 13.5 mo [9.5-NR] vs. NR [19.5-NR]; HR= 6.2 [1.9-20.1], p&#60;0.005).<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate a significant association of ctDNA detection via methylation-based cTF and on-treatment changes in cTF with rwPFS. Furthermore, subsequent cTF detection 6-months on-treatment, without cTF detected early on-treatment was associated with worse outcomes, suggesting the value of serial monitoring to improve identification of patients likely to progress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Methylation,Epigenomics,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

In this study we demonstrate the ability of the Oxford Classic (OxC)<sup>1,2<\/sup>, a non-genetic classifier, to identify HGSOC patients who may benefit from EMT targeting drugs.<br \/>Methods: 139 HGSOC diagnostic tumor tissue (Brescia cohort) underwent RNA sequencing.

By Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, a significant difference in overall survival in Brescia cohort (p=9e-06), Scottish cohort (p=2e-03) and a combined set of 1023 cases (p=1e-04), was observed between EMT-low risk patients (OxC-EMT score-0) and EMT-high risk patients (OxC-EMT score&#62;0). Notably, 5-year median survival of EMT-low risk and EMT-high risk group was 50% and 13%, resp. (95%CI: 36.1%-69.3% vs 7.1%-23.5%) in Brescia cohort. Therapeutic options for OxC-EMT-high risk group DGE analysis of EMT-low patients and EMT-very high patients (OxC-EMT score&#62;0.5) identified 404 differentially expressed genes common to the datasets.

However, only subgroups of patients respond and their identification via PD-L1 as a biomarker remains imperfect. PD-L1 expression is commonly assessed by pathologist tumor cell (TC) scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue. We developed a system for digitally scoring PD-L1 in IHC (PD-L1 QCS), which demonstrated robust scoring across studies [1]. Here, we present a comparison of PD-L1 QCS against manual scoring of PD-L1 (SP263 assay, Ventana) in the MYSTIC clinical trial.<br \/>Methods: PD-L1 QCS on digitized whole slide images (WSI) comprises two deep learning models, enabling segmentation of single TCs followed by PD-L1 expression quantification via their optical density (OD). Positive cells are classified based on an OD threshold, allowing robust digital calculation of the TC percentage [1]. The analysis included 502 WSI from the MYSTIC trial (NCT02453282), representing 256 patients treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy and 246 treated with chemotherapy as standard-of-care (SoC) [2]. First, an optimal cut-point was determined by optimization against outcome, classifying patients with &#8805;0.575% TC as biomarker positive (BM+). Next, the approach was compared against manual TC scoring at 1%, 25% and 50% cut-off.<br \/>Results: In durvalumab treated patients, median overall survival (mOS) in the PD-L1 QCS BM+ subgroup (prevalence 54.3%) was 12.1 months longer than in the BM- subgroup (19.9m vs. 7.8m, HR=0.45, CI [0.33, 0.60]). Analogous comparison of subgroups based on manually scored TC proportion at 1% (prev. 75.0%), 25% (prev. 42.6%) or 50% (prev. 29.7%) cut-points yielded a mOS difference of 7.8m (HR=0.52, CI [0.38, 0.72]), 8.3m (HR=0.61, CI [0.45, 0.82]) and 11.0m (HR=0.55, CI [0.40, 0.77]) respectively. Comparing durvalumab treatment against SoC within the PD-L1 QCS BM+ subgroup yielded a HR of 0.62 (CI [0.46, 0.82], log rank p=0.0008, 7.4m mOS delta). In comparison, a HR of 0.69 (CI [0.46,1.02], p=0.0642, 8.4m mOS delta) was obtained for manual TC scoring at 50%.<br \/>Conclusion: We compared a computational pathology approach for continuous PD-L1 scoring for the selection of mNSCLC patients for anti-PD-L1 treatment against established manual scoring. Our results suggest that PD-L1 QCS has the potential to identify a larger patient subgroup that retains benefit from anti-PD-L1 treatment and more precisely identifies non-responders.<br \/>References: 1.

PARSIFAL was a randomized, open-label, phase II trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of first line P plus fulvestrant (F) or letrozole (L) in this pts population. Both treatments had comparable efficacy and safety results (JAMAOncol. 2021;7(12):1791-1799). Although multiple CDK4\/6i clinical outcomes biomarkers have been reported, the only validated predictive factor for response is HR positivity. TransFAL, a translational study of PARSIFAL, assessed a comprehensive set of biomarkers of sensitivity\/resistance to P plus ET.<br \/>MATERIALS AND METHODS TransFAL employed a sample biorepository from PARSIFAL comprising formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and blood samples obtained from pts included in either study arm. Tumor samples (N=33) derived from the primary tumor at initial diagnosis or from primary tumor or metastatic lesions at study entry. Blood samples were obtained at baseline (N=73) and disease progression (N=22). Pts were categorized as sensitive or resistant based on progression-free survival (PFS). CDK4\/6 pathway activation was assessed by immunohistochemistry for CDK4, CDK6, Rb, pRb, ER, PgR, and Ki67. Proteins extracted from FFPE slides were analyzed using hierarchical clustering, significance analysis of microarrays, and probabilistic graphical models. RNA expression and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis were assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis of panel of 56 genes\/gene regions, respectively.<br \/>RESULTS A worse median PFS was found in pts with CDK6 positive (&#8805; 1% positive cells; p &#60; 0.001) and high Ki67 (&#8805; 10% positive cells; p = 0.013)at baseline. ctDNA density at baseline was significantly higher for resistant (PFS &#60; 9 months; 17.1 ng\/mL) pts compared to sensitive (PFS &#62; 31 months; 11.3 ng\/mL) pts (p &#60; 0.001). Most pts (83%) presented a genomic alteration detected in ctDNA, TP53 (28%) and PIK3CA (28%) being the most frequently mutated genes. Pts (9%) who harbored ARID1A mutation had lower PFS (p = 0.052).&#8239;ESR1 mutations at progression were numerically higher in the L arm (37.5%) compared to F arm (14.3%); (p=0.31), but numbers were low. Proteomic and RNA analyses did not yield confirmable distinctive expression pattern between resistant\/sensitive pts...<br \/>CONCLUSIONS High Ki67 levels and CDK6 expression in the tumor and high ctDNA density, but not proteomic or RNA sequencing data, were associated to poor outcome in this analysis of pts treated with CDK4\/6i and ET. This data adds to the growing evidence of poor prognosis biomarkers in this setting, highlighting the need of novel strategies for these pts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Palbociclib,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"Joan Albanell<sup>1<\/sup>, Angelo Gámez Pozo<sup>2<\/sup>, Carlos  L.

However, the identification of predictive biomarkers remains of unique importance. We used a 279 multi-analyte panel and confirmed CCL3 as the most significant plasma protein for chemoresistance in patients receiving gemcitabine (GEM) [overall survival (mOS) (95%CI), high vs low, 3.6 (2.5-4.0) vs 10.1 (7.2-17.0) months, HR (95%CI)= 3.92 (2.14-7.20); p&#60;0.001]. GAL dramatically reverted this resistance and CCL3 was the most significant predictive marker for the combination of this agent plus GEM [mOS (95%CI), GAL + GEM vs. placebo + GEM, 9.0 (5.5-12.1) vs 3.6 (2.5-4.0) months, HR (95%CI)= 0.39 (0.23-0.68); p&#60;0.001]. We delved into the mechanisms behind this exceptional response in PDAC with this prognostically negative ecotype sustained by CCL3 in 6 different murine PDAC models. Mice bearing high-Ccl3 tumors had a significantly shorter mOS, a higher infiltration of M2-macrophages (TAMs), and a more mesenchymal\/basal-like phenotype than did models with undetectable Ccl3.Ccl3 was stably expressed in DT4313 and PAN610, and silenced in RC416 cells. In co-culture models, DT4313<sup>Ccl3<\/sup> and PAN610<sup>Ccl3<\/sup> had a more mesenchymal phenotype and induced a M2 polarization of RAW264.7 murine TAMs than did controls. Mice bearing DT4313<sup>Ccl3<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>or PAN610<sup>Ccl3<\/sup> tumors had a significantly shorter mOS, an higher infiltration of M2-polarized TAMs and a more mesenchymal\/basal-like phenotype than controls. The expression of Tgf&#946;1 ligand and the phosphorylation of Smad2 were triggered only in TAMs if co-cultured with Ccl3-high RC416<sup>scr<\/sup>, DT4313<sup>Ccl3<\/sup> or PAN610<sup>Ccl3<\/sup> cells. This activation of Tgf&#946; pathway was blocked by maraviroc, a selective inhibitor of Ccl3-receptor Ccr5. In co-culture, GAL reverted the mesenchymal phenotype of PDAC cells and the M2 polarization of TAMs. By using an 111 different cytokine immunoassay, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (Lif) was the most significantly factor overexpressed by TAMs if stimulated by Ccl3. GAL suppressed this Lif expression. In mice bearing DT4313<sup>Ccl3<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>tumors GEM was ineffective, whereas it prolonged mOS in those with DT4313<sup>NTC <\/sup>tumors. Conversely, GAL plus GEM doubled mOS duration vs. GEM, modulated M2- TAMs infiltration, the mesenchymal\/basal-like phenotype and plasma Lif only in mice bearing DT4313<sup>Ccl3<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>tumors, but not in those with DT4313<sup>NTC <\/sup>controls. In summary, we demonstrated that tumor-derived Ccl3 activates an autocrine Tgf&#946; signaling in TAMs, triggering their M2-phenotype and secretion of Lif. This Tgf&#946;-Lif axis sustains paracrinally a mesenchymal\/basal-like PDAC ecotype resistant to GEM. Inhibition of Tgf&#946; signaling modulates this poor prognosis ecotype, and explains the exceptional response to GAL in patients with high-CCL3 PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Chemoresistance,Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;),CCL3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"S.

This one-size-fits-all approach does not account for heterogeneity in tumor biology and fails to cure ~30% of patients, highlighting the urgency for biomarkers to better understand and predict resistance to ACT or to offer alternative targeted treatment.<br \/>Aim: To identify molecular characteristics predictive of resistance to standard ACT in stage III colon cancer.<br \/>Methods: Patients with resected stage III colon cancer who received ACT (93% CAPOX, 7% CAP) were selected from the Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer cohort (PLCRC). RNA exome capture sequencing was performed on resected FFPE tumor tissue to compare differential gene expression, hallmark pathway enrichment, immune cell deconvolution and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) between patients with versus without recurrence after surgery and ACT. Postsurgery circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detected in PLCRC-PROVENC3 (separate abstract) was used to select a subgroup with minimal residual disease (MRD) postsurgery, as sensitivity analysis of patients with recurrence despite ACT (chemoresistant) versus curation by ACT (chemosensitive).<br \/>Results: For 264 out of 278 patients (95%), tumor-derived RNA sequencing libraries were of sufficient quality. 67 patients (25%) with recurrence (median after 13 months [IQR 7-23]) were compared to 178 patients with at least 2 year recurrence-free follow-up (median 42 months [IQR 30-53]). A total of 320 genes were differentially expressed between patients with versus without recurrence. Genesets defining epithelial-mesenchymal transition (p = 0.002) and angiogenesis (p &#60; 0.001) were enriched in the primary tumor of patients with recurrence, in part explained by the estimated larger fraction of stroma (Wilcoxon effect size r 0.18, p &#60; 0.001) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (r 0.19, p = 0.003). In contrast, the fraction of CD4+ T cells was lower (r 0.14, p = 0.001). Consistently, CMS4 was found more frequently in tumors from patients with versus without recurrence (57% versus 34%, p &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Of the subgroup with ctDNA-based MRD postsurgery (26 out of 171 assessed patients), 19 patients (73%) with recurrence (median after 12 months [IQR 7-17]) were compared to 7 patients without recurrence (minimum follow-up 32 months). This sensitivity analysis showed similar trends in pathways, immune cells and CMS as the main analysis, with a more pronounced effect size for CAFs (r 0.27).<br \/>Conclusion: Stage III colon tumors of patients who experience recurrence after resection and ACT are enriched for stroma and CAFs, while displaying less CD4+ T cells. The observed trends are sustained in the patients with MRD postsurgery. These findings may help to better predict resistance to standard ACT and elucidate targets for alternative personalized treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,ctDNA,Adjuvant,Chemotherapy response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>I.

Several therapeutic regimens have been shown to extend patient survival, but the majority of the patients become refractory to the treatments in a short period of time. Hence, it is critical to monitor a patient&#8217;s response to treatment in a timely manner so that different treatment regimens can be considered promptly. Currently, CA19-9 is the most common blood-based marker being used to monitor disease burden in patients with PDAC. However, 15-20% of patients with PDAC do not have elevated blood CA19-9 levels. In this study, we sought to determine the utility of two circulating extracellular vesicle (EV) based protein biomarkers, ALPPL2 (Alkaline phosphatase, placental-like 2) and THBS2 (Thrombospondin 2), for disease monitoring in patients with PDAC. We first established and optimized EV assays using the ExoView<sup>TM<\/sup> platform for detecting and quantifying the number of ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> or THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs in serum samples. We then determined the concentrations of ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> or THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs in samples from healthy individuals and longitudinal samples from patients with Stage IV PDAC undergone treatment. The longitudinal samples were from 26 patients of which 16 were CA19-9 secretors (defined as &#62;35 U\/ml) and 10 were CA19-9 non-secretors (defined as &#60;35 U\/ml) that were treated with various regimens for 4-24 months with monthly blood sample collection and CT scans (a total of 305 samples). We found that the concentrations of ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> and THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs are on average 1,737 and 1,113 times higher in PDAC patients than in the healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis using the mixed linear model showed that the concentrations of both ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> and THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs significantly correlate with changes in tumor size (based on RECIST measurements) in the longitudinal samples of CA19-9 non-secretors or secretors. In CA19-9 non-secretors the correlation p values are 0.003 and 0.006 for ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> and THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs, respectively, whereas in CA19-9 secretors, the p values are 0.014 and 0.016 for ALPPL2<sup>+<\/sup> and THBS2<sup>+<\/sup> EVs, respectively. Our data indicates that EV based ALPPL2 and THBS2 could potentially serve as biomarkers for disease monitoring in patients with PDAC.

While comprehensive tumor profiling using tissue-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly adopted for initial profiling in mCRC, the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS as initial testing in patients with sufficient tumor tissue is not clearly understood. We assessed the clinical value of ctDNA sequencing compared to tumor NGS in patients with newly diagnosed mCRC who have sufficient tumor specimens.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with newly diagnosed mCRC at the National Cancer Center Korea. As per the institutional protocol for mCRC, initial tumor profiling was performed on primary tumor tissue using an in-house NGS panel (NCC PCP ver.3), which included 525 genes. For ctDNA sequencing, patients were evaluated using the AlphaLiquid&#174;100 comprehensive cancer panel (IMBdx, Inc.), which included 118 genes, before the initiation of chemotherapy. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) testing for HER2 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\/IHC testing for MSI and\/or MMR were performed to assess the accuracy of HER2 and MSI\/MMR status.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>A total of 188 patients were enrolled. In 139 eligible patients, 275 potentially actionable mutations were found in 12 selected CRC-related genes (APC, TP53, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, FBXW7, PIK3CA, ERBB2, SMAD4, NF1, EGFR, MET). Of these, 32% were found both in ctDNA and tissue; 54% were found in ctDNA only; 12% in tissue only, and 2% were discordant. For RAS\/BRAF mutations, which are required for anti-EGFR treatment decisions, the concordance rate between ctDNA and tissue NGS was 83.1%, and the concordance was higher in patients with higher ctDNA concentrations. For 9 patients with potentially actionable copy number variations (CNV) in EGFR, HER2, MET, and FGFR1, 3 cases were found by both assays; 4 were found by ctDNA only, and 2 were found by tissue only. ctDNA NGS correctly predicted MSI\/MMR status in 2 out of 4 patients with MSI-H\/dMMR; in the 2 other patients, the MSI and MMR statuses were different, suggesting potential false positivity. In addition, the fold changes in ctDNA dynamics during treatment significantly correlated with changes in tumor size and CEA levels, as well as with droplet digital PCR copy number fold changes. In a patient with MET amplification, ctDNA NGS identified MET Y1230H as a potential acquired resistance mutation after crizotinib treatment, which responded to cabozantinib but not to capmatinib.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>Initial tumor profiling using ctDNA NGS yielded outcomes comparable to those of tumor tissue NGS in guiding treatment for patients with newly diagnosed mCRC, thereby suggesting its utility as an initial profiling method in mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Droplet digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

RAF\/MEK\/ERK signaling is downstream of KRAS signaling. Preclinical studies targeting MEK showed promises but clinical trials failed to show the benefit compared to Standard-of-Care treatment chemotherapy. To elucidate the mechanism of action and resistance to several targeted therapies including MEK inhibition in human PDAC, we conducted a Window-Of-Opportunity trial for Metastatic pancreatic cancer (WOOM trial). In this trial, metastatic PDAC patients received 10 days of Cobimetinib, a FDA approved MEK inhibitor, therapy and specimens of pre- and post- treatment were obtained by biopsy to evaluate the response to targeted treatment using deep multi-omic analytics including DNA-seq, RNA-seq, multiplex IHC, cyclic IF and Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). The clinical grade KI67 staining positivity was used as a readout of tumor response. We found three of 15 patient&#8217;s tumors had significantly decreased KI67 staining positivity after Cobimetinib treatment and defined them as Responsive tumors. Genomic sequence showed that KRAS allelic imbalance and Kras<sup>G12R<\/sup> mutations were seen significantly higher frequency in Responsive tumors compared to Non-responsive tumors. RNA-seq analysis showed that these Responsive tumors were more likely to be classical-like subtype compared to Non-responsive tumors. DSP analysis confirmed the downregulation of ERK phosphorylation after treatment in all examined cases consistent with effective target inhibition. Interestingly, MEK phosphorylation was upregulated after treatment paradoxically. This suggests that paradoxical upstream pathway activation including RAF activation could be potential resistance mechanism. MYC protein expression change was significantly correlated with KI67 protein expression change, which suggests MYC downregulation could contribute to action of Cobimetinib. We also found that Cobimetinib treatment increased the immunosuppressive TREM2+ Macrophage population from single cell RNA-seq data. Furthermore, PDX from biopsy recapitulated patient's response to therapy and could be a great tool for testing new therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the multi-omics data and discuss potential mechanisms of response and resistance to targeting RAS signaling and related microenvironmental changes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,MEK inhibitor,KRAS,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

However, sequencing-based biomarkers are not detected for most patients and imperfectly predict response to therapy even when present. To address this unmet need, we have developed a CRISPR-based diagnostics platform for &#8216;personalized functional genomics&#8217;, allowing identification of patient-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities irrespective of mutation status. We have previously applied this approach to primary hematologic malignancies, and here report application to solid tumor-derived samples. &#8239;<br \/>Methods: Patient-derived solid tumor samples from several tumor types including breast, ovarian, colon and lung were obtained from 3 sources: fresh tissue (obtained from patients via core biopsy, surgical resection, or malignant fluid sampling), primary Patient-Derived Cell Lines (PDCLs, generated from surgical material and adapted for <i>ex vivo<\/i> culture), and commercially obtained viably frozen dissociated tumor cells (DTCs). Samples were dissociated to single cell suspensions and transduced with a lentivirus encoding Cas9 and an sgRNA library covering a custom targeted oncology gene panel. The panel consists of genes encoding targets of FDA-approved oncology drugs, as well as reference genes. After a short culture period, transduced cells were harvested and relative sgRNA distribution was measured by amplicon NGS. Changes in sgRNA abundance were collapsed into gene-level log2-fold changes, and significantly depleted genes scored as functional dependencies. For select PDCLs, cells were treated with cognate small molecule inhibitors over the course of 4 days. Cell viability was read out using CTG assay and a calculated IC50 lower than 500nM inferred as inhibitor sensitive. &#8239;<br \/>Results: In a double-blind study using primary PDCLs, functional dependencies identified by CRISPR perfectly discriminated alpelisib sensitive (2\/2) from resistant samples (6\/6). Using fresh primary samples from varying cancer types and specimen sources, we achieve a technical success rate &#62;70%. Among gene dependencies identified, targets of FDA-approved oncology drugs and those under late-stage clinical investigation were both observed including BRAF, CDK4\/6, VEGFR1\/2 and PARP1\/2.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate technical proof of concept of the FX platform for CRISPR-based personalized functional genomics. This approach is feasible when applied to primary patient samples from a variety of tumor types and tissue sources, and results are validated by comparison with orthogonal methods. CRISPR-based functional profiling represents a powerful adjunct to traditional genomic profiling, for the first time allowing drug target dependency mapping in a patient-specific and mutation-agnostic manner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Targeted therapy,Diagnostic marker,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

HER2-status is assessed through HER IHC and ERBB2 FISH assays. HER2-status has been shown to be correlated to RNA expression. This study aimed to assess if the addition of DNA to an RNA-based model can improve HER2-status prediction performance. Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between model score and outcomes for TDXD patients according to their overall survival (OS).<br \/>Training and test sets of breast cancer samples were collected for HER2 status prediction (n = 1275, n = 397 respectively). HER2 status was reported positive: 11%, 12%, low: 61%, 60%, negative: 28%, 29% for each set respectively. HER2 testing and NGS were performed on samples with the same collection date. A TDXD discovery cohort of 284 patients included patients who received TDXD after RNA\/DNA collection and had at least a 30-day follow-up. Metastatic disease was reported for 98% of the TDXD cohort. Receptor status was HR+\/HER2- 39%, HR-\/HER2- 17%, HR+\/HER2+ 16%, HR-\/HER2+ 9%, unknown 19%, and HER2-status was negative 11%, low 42%, and positive 27%, unknown 20%. OS was measured from medication start date.<br \/>We trained a 12-gene linear model based on RNA expression and DNA copy number to predict HER2-positivity. The genes were selected by stepwise-selection on RNA and DNA features when predicting HER2-positivity using a random forest model. A baseline model consisting only of ERBB2 RNA expression was compared. Setting a HER2-positivity score threshold and allowing for an indeterminate group of 15% of the validation cohort, the RNA-DNA model achieved 91% PPA and 91% PPV in validation, whereas the RNA-only model achieved 83% PPA and 85% PPA. This indicates that the addition of DNA data improved the RNA-only HER2 predictor.<br \/>The Concordance index of the RNA-DNA model score and OS for TDXD was 0.64. Characterizing this relationship, we partitioned the TDXD cohort to three equal sized sub-cohorts (33 1\/3%) ordered by model score: low, intermediate, and high. Median OS in months for groups was: low 13.6, intermediate 18.5, and high 20.4. High-group patients had significantly better OS on TDXD compared to the low-group (HR = 0.39, log-rank p-value &#60; 0.002). For patients with reported status, HER2-positivity rate in each group respectively was 6%, 16%, 85% (n=78), and HR-positivity in each group was 70%, 68%, 67% (n=156).<br \/>Together, these findings indicate that HER2 status prediction improved by adding DNA to an RNA base predictor, and the predicted score was positively correlated with OS for TDXD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Trastuzumab deruxtecan,IHC,antibody drug conjugate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"K.

APOBEC plays a crucial role in the mutation process of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is essential for both adaptive and innate immune responses. This study aims to evaluate the role of the APOBEC mutation signature in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/>Methods: We conducted whole-exome sequencing and whole-transcriptome sequencing using fresh tissue or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 100 patients diagnosed with pathologic stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC, all of whom underwent complete resection between January 2014 and December 2020 at Samsung Medical Center. This study aimed to assess the impact of APOBEC enrichment on disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS) of EGFR-TKI, and overall survival following recurrence.<br \/>Results: Median follow-up duration was 58.2 months (range, 11.3-141.1). Of the patients, 74% were never-smokers, and 52% had stage III disease. Among the 100 patients, 18 (18%) exhibited APOBEC enrichment (&#8805; 2). The median RFS was 25.2 months (95% CI, 17.3-33.2). Notably, APOBEC enrichment did not show a significant association with DFS (P=0.14). Among the 76 patients who experienced radiological recurrence, 69 received EGFR-TKI as first-line treatment. The median PFS for EGFR-TKI was 22.9 months (95% CI, 13.0-32.8). However, within this group, patients with APOBEC enrichment showed a shorter PFS compared to those without APOBEC enrichment (8.1 months vs. 24.6 months, P=0.014). In multivariate analysis, poor PFS of EGFR-TKI was associated with the type of EGFR mutation (L858R vs. exon 19 deletion, HR=1.9, P=0.04), TP53 mutation (mutation vs. wild type, HR=2.1, P=0.03), and APOBEC enrichment (&#8805; 2 vs. &#60;2, HR=2.2, P=0.02).

Current genomic scar tests for HRR deficiency (HRD) are predictive of response to PARPi on a population scale but they may fail to provide a real-time functional status of HRR in an individual. RAD51 is a critical DNA repair factor that functions in HRR to safeguard the integrity of the genome and could be a useful patient selection biomarker for PARPi response.During HRR, RAD51 forms filamentous structures to facilitate repair, which can be visualised by direct immunofluorescence (IF) as nuclear foci. Quantification of these RAD51 foci has been shown to be a functional readout of HRR status, however current manual counting of foci is challenging and can result in high inter-observer variability. In order to standardise RAD51 quantification, we aimed to develop an image analysis solution.Tumour samples from patient derived xenograft (PDX) studies and human tissues from commercial sources and clinical trials were co-stained with IF for RAD51 and geminin, as a marker of cells in S\/G2 phase of the cell cycle. Manual scoring was performed as reported previously. Visiopharm was used to create and image analysis pipeline in allowing delineate tumour epithelial areas, detection of the geminin positive nuclei and RAD51 foci within these and the quantification of the foci.We have successfully developed an image analysis solution to select geminin positive proliferating tumour cells from PDX and clinical material, then quantify the RAD51 foci within these cells. There is a good correlation with manual scores with a similar accuracy to the manual inter-observer variability (PDX: R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.76, F1 = 0.95 [n=34]; breast cancer samples: R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.72, F1 = 0.92 [n=33]). Developing and image analysis solution has challenges due to several factors such as pan-nuclear staining of non-focus forming RAD51 being variable across samples, manual scoring using a wider Z-plane, susceptibility of RAD51 to pre-analytical factors and the fact that a duplex IF stain with geminin is required to mark actively replicating cells.The frequent inactivation of HRR is known to sensitise cancer cells to PARP inhibitors, we demonstrate a quantitative functional readout of HRR competency using RAD51 foci staining and an image analysis algorithm. This solution may enable the use of RAD51 foci as a patient selection biomarker for PARP inhibitors by providing an objective, robust and reproducible algorithm for scoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RAD51,Homologous recombination,Image analysis,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

RIN treatment was observed to remodel the local tumor microenvironment by enhancing immune infiltration, especially in responders. Systemic immunity, as assessed through peripheral blood analysis, showed that responders had lower baseline immune activity, which increased markedly post-treatment. Patients with liver metastases demonstrated a reduced CD4\/CD8 T cell ratio, indicative of immunosenescence.<br \/>Methods: Building on our prior research, we analyzed blood samples from 29 chemotherapy-resistant MSS mCRC patients undergoing RIN therapy, collected at baseline and after two consecutive treatment cycles. Two 28-marker spectral flow cytometry panels were used to assess immune senescence and cytokine production in lymphocytes. Additionally, T cell receptor repertoires and transcriptional profiles were analyzed using RNA sequencing from sorted non-na&#239;ve T cells. Results: The study unveiled distinct immunological profiles in MSS mCRC patient responders vs non-responders to RIN treatment. Responders demonstrated increased numbers of newly expanding CD8 T cell clones on-treatment, indicative of an active immune responses. In contrast, non-responders displayed evidence of increased DNA damage in circulating lymphocytes (T, B, and NK cells), as marked by elevated &#947;-H2AX levels. We also identified divergent cytokine production profiles patterns at baseline: T cells in non-responders demonstrated increased capacity for production of IL-2, IL-10, IL-4\/-13, and IL-22, while production of IFN-&#947; in both T cells and NK cells correlated with improved outcomes. Notably, patients with liver metastases exhibited greater frequencies of senescent T cells, characterized by increased expression of senescence markers (SA-&#946;Gal, CD57, Granzyme B\/K) and a reduction in CD27 and CD28 in CD4 T cells, along with an accumulation of terminally differentiated CD8 T cells both pre- and post-treatment. Additionally, RNA sequencing revealed an upregulation of FOXO1 related genes in non-naive T cells of responder patients, which is consistent with its important role for this pathway in attenuating senescence and maintenance of stem-like properties in T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: The effectiveness of RIN therapy is associated with baseline functional potential of circulating T cells and an on-treatment expansion of T cell clonotypes. Pre-existing and persistent features of senescence and DNA damage in circulating lymphocytes may be a major barrier to RIN treatment efficacy in MSS colorectal cancer and should be validated further in future studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Jian Ye<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chongkai Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Colt Egelston<sup>1<\/sup>, Weihua Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Marwan Fakih<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Duarte, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7effe89e-a73e-4c44-aaf0-ddbe04e44bc6","ControlNumber":"4100","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

About 20% patients receiving nCRT alone experience a pathologic complete response (pCR), while up to 25% patients exhibit a poor response. Currently, there is no biomarker to predict response to nCRT. We hypothesized that inherited ability to recognize and repair DNA damage, especially lethal double-strand breaks (DSBs), manifest in lymphocytes, would yield a reproducible test predicting therapeutic response to nCRT.<br \/>Methods: Expression of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins was studied using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from LARC patients and healthy controls. PBLs from LARC patients collected either before nCRT or after a standard course of ~5.5 weeks of nCRT were assessed by immunofluorescence (IF) for phospho-&#947;H2AX<sup>Ser139<\/sup> and by Luminex multi-analyte platform (xMAP) approaches. The xMAP assay was modified from a qualitative to a semi-quantitative assay that measures the following DDR-associated proteins- total ATR, phospho-&#947;H2AX<sup>Ser139<\/sup>, total MDM2, phospho-Chk1<sup>S345<\/sup>, phospho-Chk2<sup>T68<\/sup>, phospho-p53<sup>S15<\/sup>, total p21. The analytical performance of the assay was assessed with vendor-provided reference controls and banked PBLs from healthy controls (n=50). LARC patients were segregated by neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score to determine if tested biomarkers correlated with nCRT response. We used two independent sets of LARC biospecimens for xMAP analysis (set 1, n=48; set 2, n=44).<br \/>Results: IF-based assessment<\/u>: Using PBLs from LARC patients, we found that poor responders (PoR; NAR score&#62;14; n=21) had significantly lower &#947;H2AX foci than complete responders (CR; NAR score&#60;1; n=21) (P&#60;0.0001, logistic regression). No significant difference was observed in positive &#947;H2AX foci from PBLs drawn pre-nCRT versus post-nCRT from the same patient (p=0.4961, n=11, Wilcoxon test). <u>xMAP assay performance<\/u>: The performance assessment showed linear sample curves, precision with acceptable inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variability, and high reproducibility with ~1% outliers identified in replicates. <u><u>Clinical associations using xMAP assay<\/u>: levels of six proteins (ATR, p-&#947;H2AX<sup>Ser139<\/sup>, MDM2, p-Chk1<sup>S345<\/sup>, p-Chk2<sup>T68<\/sup>, p-p53<sup>S15<\/sup>) significantly differentiated CRs from PoRs (p-values and False Discovery Rate &#60;= 1e-5). The strongest associations with nCRT response were observed for: ATR, MDM2 and &#947;H2AX.<br \/>Conclusion: 1) we standardized an xMAP assay to assess DDRs in human PBLs, and 2) found novel biomarkers that predict response to nCRT in LARC patients using minimally invasive PBL biospecimen.

These markers include tumor mutational burden (TMB), immune infiltration and HLA loss of heterozygosity. Our previously published meta-analysis of biomarkers included over 1000 patients (CPI1000) across multiple cancer types and demonstrated that clonal TMB and CXCL9 expression were the strongest predictors of response pan-cancer. Biomarkers were combined into a multivariable predictor of response which out-performed TMB in three validation cohorts. However, even with an extensive systematic review, the literature and exploratory biomarkers only accounted for ~60% of the variance explained in CPI response. Approach and<br \/>Results: Extending the cohort to over 3000 patients from 20 studies, across 11 tumor solid tumor types, we have utilized available genomic and transcriptomic data to further validate the multi-variable predictor of response as well as conduct additional exploratory analysis to uncover the remaining variance explained. The raw data is processed through a robust bioinformatics pipeline and is harmonized across studies. The pipeline developed to process the CPI3000+ cohort will be open-access and available to promote federated learning and collaborations. Firstly, we have expanded the systematic review to include recent biomarkers from literature. The literature review included over 1000 papers, and we identified greater than 200 unique biomarkers which can be quantified and assessed in the CPI3000+ cohort. Data presented on this extensive set of genomic and transcriptomic biomarkers across the cohorts will improve understanding of biomarkers of response to CPI therapy. Second, we will explore novel biomarkers of response including non-classical sources of antigen such as retained introns as well as pathways such as the unfolded protein response. We will also survey the effects of tumor-associated antigens such as those involved in CAR-T cell and vaccine trials in CPI response which was limited in the CPI1000 cohort. We will also be presenting data on emerging checkpoints in late-stage trials across cancer types. Finally, we will be combining the biomarkers into a novel multivariable predictor of response.<br \/>Conclusions: Results from this work will highlight the varying determinants of immunotherapy response across solid tumor types, offering insight into tumor intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of immunogenicity. We have shown that sources of tumour antigen are a major group of biomarkers for CPI response, here we expand on this further in a larger cohort as well as identifying novel biomarkers to create an improved multivariable predictor of clinical value.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Predictive biomarkers,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

One of the hallmarks of GBM tumor growth and progression lies within the proangiogenic tumor microenvironment. Current anti-angiogenic drugs such as the anti-VEGF antibody take effect by inducing tumor cell starvation, leading to a functional normalization of the tumor vasculature. However, the survival benefits of anti-angiogenic drugs have been very limited. To this end, we hypothesized that the tetraspan Epithelial Membrane Protein-2 (EMP2) may help mediate resistance.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> We hypothesize that Epithelial Membrane Protein-2 may serve as a targetable biomarker for anti-VEGF resistance. We further explored the effectiveness of combination therapy in SB28 and GL261 GBM mouse models using anti-VEGF drug, Aflibercept, with a novel anti-EMP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Tumor tissue was collected prospectively from patients undergoing surgery for suspected glioblastoma and stained for EMP2 and HIF2a using standard immunohistochemistry. Patients had banked tumor tissue both prior to and after bevacizumab treatment with 3 months of clinical and radiologic follow-up available. Bevacizumab treatment increased EMP2 protein expression. This increase in EMP2 correlated with reduced mean survival time post-bevacizumab therapy. Similarly, HIF-2a showed increased expression post-bevacizumab treatment and showed expression in both tumor and stromal cells. Limited animal models exist for anti-VEGF therapy for GBM. To establish syngeneic models, 10<b> <\/b>week-old mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine SB28 or GL261 GBM cells. Treatment with either polyclonal sera to VEGF or Aflibercept failed to reduce tumor load or provide a therapeutic benefit. To next investigate if this model could recapitulate the response obtained patients tumors, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue was analyzed for both EMP2 and HIF-2a expression. Both markers were significantly upregulated in Aflibercept treated samples compared to the control.To next investigate if combination treatment could produce a significant reduction in tumor load, animals were treated with a combination treatment with Aflibercept and anti-EMP2 mAb. The combination therapy significantly reduced tumor volume and weight in comparison to control-treated tumors. Combination treatment in SB28 tumors resulted in a two fold reduction in tumor load and 50% reduction in tumor weight. Moreover, tumors showed reduced Ki67 expression. Similarly, treated GL261 tumors produced a 2.3 fold reduction in tumor size and ~2.7 fold reduction in tumor weight. Our results suggest that EMP2 can be a promising new target therapeutic target that can be combined with anti-VEGF treatment to potentially increase overall survival in GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Biomarkers,Antiangiogenic therapy,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

In cancer, both an oncogenic and a tumor suppressive function of GR has been proposed. To comprehensively evaluate GR expression in normal and tumorous tissues, a tissue microarray containing 18,570 samples from 147 different tumor types and subtypes and 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). GR positivity was found in 76.3% of 14,349 interpretable cancers, including 18.5% with weak, 19.6% with moderate, and 38.3% with strong positivity. GR positivity of at least a fraction of tumors was found in all 147 analyzed tumor types and at least one strongly GR positive tumor was found in 136 tumor types. 77 of our 147 tumor entities showed GR positivity of variable intensity in all analyzed cases. 43 further tumor entities showed GR positivity in 80-99.9% of cases. 21 tumor entities had a GR positivity rate between 50 and 80%, including urothelial carcinoma as well as gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Only 6 tumor types had less than 50% GR positive. These included adenomas (21.7-32.5%), adenocarcinomas (17%) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (45.5%) of the colorectum. Reduced GR staining was significantly associated with adverse histopathological and clinical features in several tumor types. Low GR expression was linked to grade progression in pTa (p&#60;0.0001) and to nodal metastasis in pT2-4 urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (p=0.0051), advanced pT stage (p=0.0006) and estrogen receptor positivity (p=0.0126) in breast carcinomas of no special type (NST), as well as to high grade (p&#8804;0.0076), advanced pT stage (p&#60;0.0001), distant metastasis (p=0.0081), and poor overall survival (p=0.002) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. GR expression was unrelated to clinic-pathological parameters in gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal adenocarcinoma as well as in serous high-grade carcinoma of the ovary. In summary, our data demonstrate frequent GR expression across all cancer types. Significant associations between reduced GR expression and unfavorable tumor features in some but not all tumor types suggest that the functional importance of GR regulated genes for cancer progression depends on the cell of tumor origin.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid receptor,Predictive biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"C.
