[{"Abstract":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly complex disease, characterized by extensive genomic heterogeneity and dynamic evolution under therapeutic pressure. This evolution can lead to alterations in the antigens expressed by cancer cells, thereby influencing the T cell repertoire (TCR) as T cells expand in response to foreign antigens. Despite the central role of TCR in cancer progression and treatment response, only few studies have investigated the temporal and spatial changes in the TCR repertoire. In this study, we delve into the role of the TCR repertoire in metastatic progression in NSCLC. We conducted TCR sequencing of multiregion primary tumors, normal-adjacent tissues, and post-mortem metastases sampled from a cohort of 22 patients enrolled in the TRACERx and PEACE studies. Our findings reveal that primary tumor regions and normal-adjacent tissues exhibit similar fractions of expanded clonotypes. However, a higher proportion of expanded intratumoral TCRs were privately expanded in the tumor samples, suggesting a unique TCR landscape within the tumor microenvironment. The TCR repertoire across multiregion primary tumor samples was largely homogenous, with most expanded clonotypes shared across at least two regions. However, only a small fraction of these clonotypes were tracked in metastases, indicating a significant shift in the TCR repertoire during metastatic progression. Notably, the expanded clonotypes that persisted over time from early to late stage disease were significantly enriched for clonotypes ubiquitously expanded in the primary tumor across all regions. This was not shown to be associated with an increased likelihood of generation via VDJ recombination, suggesting a tumor-specific immune response. The expanded TCR repertoire in the postmortem metastases clustered mainly by anatomical site, suggesting an immune response driven by tissue-resident T cells. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between repertoire dissimilarity and genomic distance, suggesting that T cell clones track with tumor clones across spatial sites within patients. Our study demonstrates the significant spatiotemporal dynamics of the TCR repertoire during the metastatic progression of NSCLC, orchestrated by both tissue-resident T cells and the genomic evolutionary trajectory of tumors. Such an exploration could provide valuable insights to inform future strategies for immunotherapy treatments and enhance clinical monitoring of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,T cell receptor,Cancer evolution,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

To explore this crosstalk, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 217 tumor regions from 59 patients from the TRACERx study, all with matched adjacent normal tissue, to deconvolve tumor methylation rates. We combined two new metrics for integrative evolutionary analysis with DNA and RNA sequencing data. I-TMD (intra-tumoral methylation distance) quantifies intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity. MR\/MN classifies genes based on the rate of hypermethylation at regulatory (MR) versus non-regulatory (MN) CpGs, to identify driver genes exhibiting recurrent functional hypermethylation. We observed early DNA methylation of VIPR2 and ZNF714 co-occurring with driver mutations in CDKN2A and STK11, respectively. Finally, we found DNA methylation-linked dosage compensation of essential genes co-amplified with neighboring oncogenes. Our identification of hypermethylated driver genes under positive selection may open new avenues for therapeutic stratification of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Epigenetics,Epigenomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"F.

The prevalence of ecDNA across several cancer types, such as glioblastoma and sarcoma, has made promising therapeutic targets. However, while DNA damage is a hallmark of nearly all cancers, the formation of ecDNA is not, and the determinants for ecDNA acquisition are unclear. Furthermore, whether the timing of tumors&#8217; acquisition of ecDNA (i.e., early or late clonal or sub-clonal) affects patient survival and drug resistance is unclear. Here, we leverage orthoganol information from ecDNA amplicons, such as mutation allele frequency and sequence synteny, to develop computational methods for elucidating the evolutionary history of ecDNA. Applying these to several cancer subtypes in TCGA, we find that most ecDNAs arise early in tumor evolution.

Under immunosurveillance, a subset of cancer-associated antigens or neoantigens are presented to the cancer cell surface via the antigen presentation machinery (APM) for recognition by antigen-specific T cells. During clonal evolution, cancer cells can evade such immunosurveillance by suppressing or ablating the APM. The defects in APM can further cause resistance to cancer immunotherapies and is associated with worse prognosis. Understanding how the defects in APM emerge and further shape the evolution of cancers is critical for devising strategies to overcome such immune escape mechanisms. However, it is not known when mutations in the APM occur along the history of cancer clonal evolution. We utilized a molecular archeology of cancer approach to reconstruct the evolution history of mutations in APM across 38 cancer types using whole-genome sequencing data from PCAWG. Genetic alterations in the APM occur in nearly 30% of patients, with varying frequencies and associations with immune infiltration across cancer types. Employing a League model to compare the timing of genetic events, we found that APM mutations can be early clonal, late clonal, or subclonal along cancer development. Further examination of individual tumors identified driver mutations that can happen before or after APM mutations along cancer development. Our study reveals the evolution of APM mutations in different cancers in a genetic context-aware manner. This information can contribute to optimizing personalized immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Clonal evolution,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"W.

However, previous observations have been limited to the microscopic scale, and it is still unclear how clonal expansion occurs over the entire endometrium and what driver mutations are responsible therein. To address these issues, we performed multisampling of the endometrium with extensive spatial mapping.<br \/>Methods: We collected multiple endometrial glands from normal endometrium in a 5mm lattice in 19 patients aged 30 to 85 years who underwent hysterectomy (3-31 samples per case), followed by DNA extraction, detected somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing, to identify large clones that spread across samples based on shared mutations.<br \/>Results: In total, 213 bulk endometrial glands were analyzed. The number of detected somatic mutations per sample ranged from 4 to 81 (mean&#177;SD: 32.5&#177;14.1), with at least one known driver gene mutation detected in 204 of 213 samples (mean&#177;SD: 3.03&#177;1.78). The mutational signature analysis revealed the predominance of the age-related SBS1 and SBS5 signatures. dN\/dS analysis identified 20 genes that were positively selected in normal endometrium, including <i>PIK3CA, PIK3R1, KRAS, PPP2R1A, ARHGAP35,<\/i> and <i>FBXW7<\/i>, most of which are also known as driver genes for endometrial cancer. The number of mutations and their frequency for each driver gene did not differ by background diseases: endometriosis, endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer and other non-endometrial related diseases. In contrast to the high frequency of driver gene mutations, copy-number alterations were found in only 3 samples, such as +1q, +7, +10 and +12. We found clones showing a large expansion involving multiple samples in 8 cases, most of which harbored one or more driver mutations, such as <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i>. The size of the largest clone carrying a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, which was found in a 32-year-old woman with cervical cancer, spanned as long as 10 mm in diameter. This suggests that clonal expansion in the endometrium could be very rapid even in healthy women, which contrasts to the observations that clonal expansion in other organs is usually seen in aged individuals.<br \/>Conclusion: We confirmed the high frequency of driver mutations in the normal endometrium, most of which overlapped to those found in endometrial cancers, suggesting that these driver genes<br \/>are involved in the early phase of the development in the endometrial cancer. Some of the driver-mutated clones expanded in macroscopic size. Our findings provide an interesting insight into the clonal structure and underlying genetic variation in the normal endometrium.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Endometrial cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

However, the critical aspect of equitably selecting molecular features across multiple patients is often overlooked. To address this challenge, we introduce FALAFL (FAir muLti-sAmple Feature seLection), a novel algorithmic approach based on integer linear programming. FALAFL is designed to bridge the gap between molecular feature selection and algorithmic fairness, ensuring a balanced selection of molecular features across different patient samples.<br \/>We have applied FALAFL to the problem of selecting lineage-informative CpG sites within a cohort of 9 colorectal cancer patients subjected to low-coverage single-cell methylation sequencing. Our results demonstrate that FALAFL excels at rapidly determining the optimal set of CpG sites, which are well covered by cells across the vast majority of the patients, while ensuring that each patient contributes a similar number of sites to the final selection. An analysis of the FALAFL-selected CpG sites reveals that their lineage informativeness exhibits a strong association across diverse patient profiles, suggesting the non-stochasticity and universality of methylation changes in tumor evolution. Furthermore, these universally lineage-informative sites exhibit subclonal level alterations in the colorectal cancer primary tumors and are strongly associated with lineage-specific gene expression patterns.<br \/>By integrating equity considerations into the molecular feature selection process, FALAFL is poised to propel equitable healthcare data science practices and advance our understanding of cancer and other complex diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor evolution,Bioinformatics,Methylation,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Consequently, it is unknown whether diagnostic samples are representative enough to guide treatment directions at relapse, or whether acquired changes during therapy provide targets in patients with relapses. To answer these questions and characterize tumor evolution during treatment, we used data from &#62;700 tissue and plasma samples from 200 HGSC patients belonging to the observational, longitudinal DECIDER trial (NCT04846933).<br \/>Mutations from whole-genome sequencing data from tissue samples (2-12 per patient) were used to construct phylogenetic trees. The trees were corrected by the copy-number alterations and curated to integrate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) exome- and targeted-sequencing data from plasma samples. Evolutionary states presenting within and between sample heterogeneity were evaluated through clonal complexity and divergence. Additionally, genetic differences between persistent and non-persistent subclones were studied to identify features affecting treatment resistance.<br \/>Our results indicate that the majority of subclones survive chemotherapy treatment and major subclonal replacement takes place in only a few patients. Within-sample heterogeneity was higher in plasma samples than in ascites, highlighting the importance of ctDNA samples to estimate persistent subclones. Additionally, our recently reported evolutionary states (Lahtinen et al. Cancer Cell 2023) were often altered by the treatment induced selection pressure. At late relapses, subclone compositions typical of maintaining evolutionary state tumors were less common, and a higher number of acquired subclones were detected, suggesting further evolution of the persisting clones.<br \/>In summary, chemotherapy does not suppress heterogeneity in HGSC tumors. Interestingly, patients with the worst prognosis have a stable composition of multiple clones in their tumors, and tumors with low heterogeneity responded better to primary treatment. Relapse samples show lower within-sample heterogeneity and further evolution. Furthermore, we detected several evolutionary trajectories from stable, persistent cancer subclone populations to highly dynamic subclone structures. This renders diagnostic samples suitable to guide relapse treatment decisions in a subset of patients with HGSC but not for all. Our characterization of the dynamics of tumor clonal heterogeneity during treatment allows to define better therapeutic interventions for HGSC patients with relapsed disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Ovarian cancer,Tumor evolution,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Here, leveraging the extensive sampling approach of our postmortem rapid tissue donation program UPTIDER (NCT04531696), we used phylogenic reconstruction to analyze disease progression.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Thirteen patients with HR+\/HER2 non-amplified primary breast cancer, recruited in UPTIDER between 12\/2020 and 05\/2022, were considered. Shallow whole-genome sequencing was performed on 495 solid samples including a matched germline DNA and archived primary tumor sample for each patient. Log2 coverage ratios were computed with CNVkit and profiles with median absolute pairwise deviation &#60; 0.35 were co-segmented per patient using the copynumber R package. Purity and ploidy were assessed by ABSOLUTE and manually reviewed. Samples with purity &#62; 30% were kept for downstream analysis. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using MEDICC2 for each patient. Metrics derived from the trees were: (i) tree length, (ii) trunk length, (iii) trunk ratio as trunk length\/tree length*100. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time between primary diagnosis and death. Comparison was done using Wilcoxon test, time to event analysis using cox regression. Endocrine resistance was defined as per the ESMO guidelines (PMID:34678411).<br \/>Results: 81% (399\/495) of the samples passed QC. Phylogenies included a median of 28 samples per patient (range: 9-59) and 10\/13 phylogenies included primary samples at diagnosis. Multi-seeding from the primary tumor was observed in 7 patients, suspected in 1, and a single seeding was observed in 2 patients. Median OS was 8.0 years. Higher trunk ratios tended to associate with poorer OS (Hazard ratio: 1.08 per 1% increase, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.16, p=0.06). In organs where multiple metastatic lesions were sampled (n= 73 organs, median of 3 samples\/organ, range: 2-18 and median of 5 organs per patient, range: 1-10) seeding from at least 2 organs was detected in 48% (35\/73) of the organs. Phylogenies from patients with secondary endocrine resistance (7 patients) tended to have a shorter trunk compared to patients with primary endocrine resistance (5 patients, median of 18 and 48 alterations respectively, p=0.15).<br \/>Conclusion: Branching evolution from the primary tumor was more frequently observed than linear evolution. Phylogenies revealed extensive tumor heterogeneity, questioning treatment decisions based on a single biopsy. Additionally, evaluation of multiple metastatic samples per organ showed seeding from multiple organs in 48% of organs evaluated, indicating greater disease heterogeneity than previously thought. Phylogenetic differences were also noted according to the type of endocrine resistance (primary versus secondary).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tumor evolution,Bioinformatics,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>F.

Personalized-medicine strategies mostly rely on single tumor-biopsy samples which might not capture the mutational burden of heterogeneous tumors. We investigated genetic ITH portrayed from multiregion spatial sequencing in early-stage HNSCC patients.<br \/>Patients and Method: Seventy-eight early-stage HNSCC patients treated with upfront curative-intent surgery in the prospective biobanking SCANDARE study (NCT03017573) were included. We developed a pathological measure of ITH, based on the relative contribution of multiple poorly and well-differentiated intratumor regions (<i>n <\/i>= 199) in resected tumor samples. To characterize genetic ITH, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing on multiple spatially separated intratumor regions by using a custom panel of 571 genes (named DRAGON), in combination with 3&#8217;-Tag RNA sequencing and pathway enrichment analysis.<br \/>Results: Fifty-nine patients displaying a minimum of two sequenced intratumor regions (total, <i>n<\/i> = 180) were analyzed. We observed genetic ITH in 22\/59 patients (37%), of whom 6\/22 (27%) based on theranostic molecular alterations. Three of the six patients exhibited molecular alterations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (<i>n<\/i> = 2) and <i>TSC2<\/i> (<i>n<\/i> = 1) that have supporting clinical evidence of actionability in some cancer types (OncoKB level 1) and three patients exhibited actionable molecular alterations in <i>PTEN<\/i> (<i>n<\/i> = 2) and <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> (<i>n <\/i>= 1) supported by substantial research evidence (OncoKB level 4). Two patients exhibited molecular alterations in <i>SMARCA4<\/i> that is likely oncogenic, albeit not yet annotated by OncoKB. The pathological measure of ITH accounted for a significant source of variation in gene expression. Notably, we identified 346 differentially expressed genes imposing <i>p<\/i>-values &#8804; 0.05 and |log fold-change| &#8805; 1 involved in several Reactome&#8217;s signaling pathways, including the cell junction organization (R-HSA-446728) and the tight junction interaction (R-HSA-420029) pathways.<br \/>Conclusions: We reported clinically relevant genetic ITH in early-stage HNSCC, which can lead to underestimation of the mutational landscape portrayed from single tumor biopsy and may present major challenges to precision medicine.

While these patterns associate with clinical outcomes, it remains unknown whether they fully reconcile tumor behavior and how genetic and transcriptional features co-evolve in relation to the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>Methods: To analyze the patterns of transcriptional and TME heterogeneity, we performed bulk whole-transcriptome sequencing on 244 samples, including 22 metastatic and 12 tumor-adjacent normal samples, from 79 ccRCC patients recruited to the TRACERx Renal study. We integrated transcriptional data with previously published genetic, phylogenetic, spatial and clinical information.<br \/>Results: Transcriptional distances between paired samples from the same primary tumor mirrored but were not fully determined by genetic distance (p-value &#60; 0.001); and increased from primary-primary to primary-metastasis and primary-normal pairs. Within primary-metastasis pairs, metastasis-seeding primary tumor regions were transcriptionally closest to their matched metastasis (p-value &#60; 0.001), suggesting that an important fraction of metastatic transcriptional traits were acquired in the primary tumor. Regarding the tumor clonal structure, transcriptional evolution followed a conserved path through increasing cell proliferation and oxidative phosphorylation and downregulating DNA repair from earlier to later clones. Further, within tumors with increasing WGII we observed upregulation and downregulation of repressors and downstream effectors, respectively, of the canonical cGAS-STING pathway. Combining the presence of this transcriptional pattern with WGII predicted shorter PFS in TRACERx Renal (p-value &#60; 0.001) and in TCGA-KIRC (p-value &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Clonal evolution was also linked to changes in TME, with each of the previously defined genetic evolutionary trajectories associated to a specific TME (p-value &#60; 0.001). For example, ccRCCs on a PBRM1-SETD2 trajectory demonstrated increased infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells. TME ITH was pervasive and associated with shorter PFS (p-value = 0.03). A recurrent trend from earlier to later clones was progressive T cell depletion (p-value &#60; 0.001). The evolution of the TCR repertoire mirrored the tumor clonal structure (p-value = 0.002), suggesting the thus far elusive antigenic source in ccRCC is heritable. Accordingly, the TCR repertoire in metastasis-seeding primary tumor regions resembled the closest the TCR repertoire of matched metastasis (p-value = 0.06).<br \/>Conclusion: Integrated analysis of genetic and transcriptional data in TRACERx Renal showed i) transcriptional and TME ITH not fully recapitulated by genetic ITH, ii) conserved paths of transcriptional and TME evolution and iii) a heritable nature of part of the ccRCC antigen source.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,RNA-seq,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Á.

Driver mutations of angiosarcoma, specifically <i>PTPRB<\/i>, and <i>PLCG1<\/i>, are well-known as reported previously. Notably, contralateral breast is another metastatic site of the breast angiosarcoma, where an unusual location for other soft tissue sarcomas. However, it remains uncertain whether the contralateral disease originates from the primary tumor or emerges independently. Here, we present a 75-year-old woman with bilateral breast angiosarcomas to investigate the genetic relationship between the tumors.<br \/>Methods: Irregular and heterogeneous masses were synchronously detected through breast sonography. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted at 60X coverage using bilateral total mastectomies, along with a matched normal blood sample (n=1). Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels were identified using Strelka2 and Varscan2. Subsequent filtering was performed using custom Python scripts to establish high-confidence variants. A phylogenetic tree was then reconstructed based on SNVs to trace clonal evolution and distinguish between de novo primary and metastasis. Following this, COSMIC mutational signatures were analyzed to characterize the genomic profile.<br \/>Results: For the left breast angiosarcoma, we found 1,086 SNVs and 101 indels, while the right breast angiosarcoma had 921 SNVs and 92 indels. Despite their small size (&#60;1.0 cm) and low FNCLCC grade (G1), these two cancers shared 600 SNVs and 135 indels as &#8220;truncal events&#8221;, indicating that one side metastasized from the other. According to the phylogenetic tree and the molecular clock of the two angiosarcomas, we estimated that the metastasis occurred during the middle stages of cancer evolution. Additionally, we identified 7 nonsynonymous SNVs (<i>ADAMTS7, RPS15, CYP2A6, OR1S2, ARHGAP23, GNAQ, UGT2B7<\/i>), five of which were shared. Remarkably, the GNAQ driver mutation exhibited a mutation at codon 209, a hotspot mutation not previously reported in breast angiosarcoma. The dominant Cosmic mutational signatures were SBS1\/5 and ID1\/2, all of which were associated with aging.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that bilateral breast angiosarcomas metastasized from one side to the other, as evidenced by the WGS data. This study underscores that the capability of WGS to distinguish between oligometastatic disease and multiple primary cancers, which has implications for predicting patients&#8217; prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Breast,Whole genome sequencing,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disease of unknown etiology affecting the bile ducts and has been associated with a substantially increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Clonal dynamics in the normal bile duct and PSC epithelium remains poorly understood because of the limited accessibility to normal\/inflamed bile ducts. In this study, we established a method to detect somatic mutations accumulated in the bile duct epithelium and investigated a mutation rate in normal bile duct cells and clonal expansion in PSC epithelium.<br \/>Methods: We established single cell-derived organoids from bile, which were subjected to whole genome sequencing to measure the age-related mutation rate in normal epithelial cell in the bile ducts. We next established organoids from multiple sites in perihilar bile ducts and collected epithelial samples from intrahepatic bile ducts obtained by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from patients with PSC who underwent total hepatectomy for liver transplantation, for which we performed whole exome sequencing to investigate clonal expansion in PSC-involved bile ducts.<br \/>Results: In total, 14 single cell-derived organoid lines were established from 2 patients with PSC and 3 control individuals. Based on the whole genome sequencing of those organoids, the number of mutations found in non-PSC bile duct epithelium increases with age at an annual mutation rate of 34.3 mutations per genome per year, which did not substantially differ from the rate in the PSC epithelium, suggesting that the inflammatory process in PSC hardly affected the mutations in PSC epithelium. To further investigate clonal expansion in the PSC epithelium, a total of 120 bulk organoid samples from perihilar bile ducts in 3 PSC patients and 111 LCM samples from intrahepatic bile ducts in 4 PSC patients were analyzed. In perihilar bile duct-derived organoids, we detected a median of 13 [1-30] somatic mutations per exome in samples derived from perihilar bile ducts and 20 [5-41] mutations per exome in those from intrahepatic LCM samples. Most mutations were detected in a single sample but some mutation clusters were shared by adjacent samples, which expanded in an area as large as 13 mm in length. Expanded clones harbored mutations in known cancer-driver genes, such as <i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>KRAS,<\/i> which were enriched in segmental bile ducts, suggesting their role in the clonal expansion.<br \/>Conclusions: Here, we established the method to detect somatic mutations accumulated in the normal\/inflamed bile duct epithelium using an organoid-based analysis of clonal somatic mutations. Our results revealed clonal expansion existing in PSC epithelium and open up a way to the better understanding of carcinogenesis in the bile duct.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Inflammation,Cholangiocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Using 2699 prostate cancer tumor exomes, genomes, and panel sequences (1648 primary tumors and 1051 metastatic samples), we calculated the cancer effect size (CES)&#8212;the each mutation confers to lower-risk (Grade Group 1\/2) and higher-risk (Grade Group 3\/4\/5) tumorigenesis and metastasis. The lower-risk, higher-risk, and metastatic tumors exhibited similar neutral rates at which mutations were introduced into DNA, with these underlying gene mutation rates generally increasing from lower-risk to higher risk to metastatic tumors. However, lower risk, higher risk, and metastatic tumors noticeably differed in the genes and specific somatic variants that were most highly selected for within each group. Therefore, to assess whether differences in natural selection that we observed among low-risk, high-risk, and metastatic tumor types were at least partly due to epistatic interactions, we applied a model of pairwise epistasis that quantified the effect of the presence or absence of a mutation in one gene on the selection for mutations in another gene. We found significant evidence of epistatic effects among driver genes. Our results indicate a very early role for SPOP in the development of prostate cancer: strength of selection for SPOP mutations is tightly associated with the degree to which the mutation ablates contact with the BRD3, and these disruptive mutations in turn increase the selection for mutations in several other tumor suppressors and oncogenes such as RHOA. Previously identified gene-gene interactions such as that between SPOP and PIK3CA were supported by this analysis, and we also identified novel gene-gene interactions such as those between AR and MUC16 occurring during metastasis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that rates of mutation and strengths of selection on these driver mutations vary dynamically along the trajectories to lower-risk, higher-risk, and metastatic prostate cancer, and that powerful selective epistasis among driver genes provides an explanation for these differences. Because precision therapeutic targeting of somatic variant genes is fundamentally targeting the selective benefit obtained from that variant at the time of treatment, understanding these changes in stage-specific and somatic genotype-specific selective strengths will enable better therapeutic targeting in translational and clinical science.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Epistatic interactions,Selection,Cancer stage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.
