[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Endometrial cancer (EC) is the leading gynecologic malignancy in the U.S., with obesity implicated in 57% of cases. This study explores the molecular workings of oncogenic protein expression (TMEM205, STAT5, and FAS) and their role in regulating exosome secretion. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for unraveling pathways involved in obesity-related EC, informing the development of innovative strategies for prevention and treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The isolated exosomes were quantified using nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA) and their size measured by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TMEM205, STAT5, FAS and PIAS3 expression was confirmed by IHC, ELISA and RT-PCR in patient and high fat diet treated mouse tissue. Endometrial hyperplasia was developed in immunocompetent mice using high fat diet (HFD; 45 kcal% fat diet) for 16 weeks.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our study investigates exosome secretion and the regulation of oncogenic proteins in adipose and uterine tissues from obese EC patients compared to non-obese EC samples. Analyzing the effects of a 45% kcal high-fat diet (HFD) on mice over 24 weeks, we observed higher body weight and increased adipose tissue in the HFD group, along with enlarged uterine horns and heightened inflammation. This correlated with elevated exosome secretion and increased expression of TMEM205, FAS and STAT5, while the tumor suppressor gene PIAS3 was downregulated. The identified small molecule inhibitor, DAP-5, selectively targeting TMEM205 and exosome secretion, demonstrated a significant reduction in body weight and adipose tissue accumulation when administered to HFD mice. Additionally, DAP-5 treatment restored normal uterine morphology and reduced the expression of exosome-related proteins.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study offers central insights into the mechanisms underlying obesity-mediated TMEM205 expression and exosome secretion, shedding light on their role in the pathogenesis of EC. Additionally, it provides pre-clinical evidence supporting the initiation of the first in-human studies for exosome-targeted therapies aimed at preventing obesity-mediated EC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Obesity,Endometrial cancer,Exosomes,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"T.

It is also considered the initial step of pancreatic cancer development when oncogenic mutations accumulate. However, its precise mechanism and regulatory pathways remain unclear. This study profiled the transcriptome of dedifferentiated acinar cells from both humans and mice. Differential expression analysis integrated with a systematic literature search revealed several potential regulators (e.g., GDF15, GFRA1, MXRA5, CXCL17), of which the expression pattern over time was validated by qRT-PCR. We also focused on multiple conserved pathways of cell survival, among which SLC7A11 (xCT) is transiently upregulated in both species. The xCT subunit, integral to the cystine\/glutamate antiporter system xc-, plays a critical role in cell survival across various cell types. To elucidate its role in acinar dedifferentiation, we employed gene silencing, pharmacological inhibition, and a knock-out mouse model. Acinar cells with diminished xCT function exhibit increased ferroptosis linked to lipid peroxidation. Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and ferroptosis inhibitors like Ferrostatin-1 can mitigate lower glutathione levels and lipid ROS accumulation. Similarly, in mouse acute pancreatitis, xCT prevents lipid peroxidation. Our findings indicate that xCT fuels the glutathione pool and maintains ROS balance during ADM, thereby preventing pancreatic acinar cells from ferroptosis, a form of cell death rarely reported in relation to ADM. Next to xCT, a future and similar comprehensive study of the aforementioned genes could provide valuable insights into the dynamic changes that occur during acinar cell dedifferentiation and pave the way to the discovery of new intervention targets to suppress tumorigenesis in chronic pancreatitis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Pancreatitis,Dedifferentiation,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

Our understanding of LUAD initiation and progression is limited, impeding early diagnosis and effective treatment. A comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis, unraveling the malignant transformation from normal lung to LUAD, will provide key insights into the initiation and development of this challenging disease. However, human tissues are not amendable for such analysis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We generated two mouse models, a genetically engineered mouse model with Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> activating mutation (GEMM) and a carcinogen urethane-induced mouse tumor model (CITM) in the same 129S4 background. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was conducted on lung tissues collected at five time points after induction for each model. The LUAD and its precursors were defined by experienced lung cancer pathologists as normal lung, hyperplasia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma. This analysis aimed to characterize the dynamic interaction between epithelial and immune cells, providing insights into the initiation and progression of LUAD.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A comprehensive analysis identified a total of 12 major cell types, revealing a gradual increase in the proportion of epithelial cells during LUAD progression. EpiC 1, 2, 5 and 8 were consistently found in normal lung epithelium and various stages of abnormal epithelia, indicating their role as background components in lung tissues. In contrast, EpiC 4 emerged from hyperplasia and EpiC 0 and 3 emerged from early adenoma, while EpiC 6 and 7 were predominantly present in adenocarcinoma. Further investigation into the developmental trajectory of AT2 cells indicated a clear separation between normal (EpiC 1, 2, 5 and 8) and tumor cells (EpiC 0, 3, 4, 6 and 7). Cancer hallmark analysis revealed that tumor clusters exhibited higher scores in KRAS_SIGNALING_UP, HYPOXIA, APOPTOSIS, and P53_PATHWAY compared to normal epithelial clusters, suggesting the potential activation of these pathways in the tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the proportion of Macro_C1qc increased over time, accompanied by Macro_C1qc exhibiting the highest M2 signature score. This indicates a unique enrichment of M2-like macrophages in LUAD tissues. Remarkably, a notable increase in ligand-receptor pairs contributed significantly to the signaling from macrophages to tumor cells during progression. The dynamic regulatory interplay between Macro_C1qc and tumor cells was notably mediated by Thbs-Sdc1, App-Cd74, Spp1-Cd44 and other L-R pairs across various time points.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We constructed a single-cell LUAD developmental atlas of dynamic tumor-immune cell interactions, which sheds light on the initiation and progression of LUAD.

Approximately 70% of pre-malignant breast tumours, known as ductal carcinoma <i>in situ <\/i>(DCIS), and 20% of invasive breast tumours overexpress HER2. Although molecular mechanisms of HER2 function in breast tumour cells have been extensively studied, our knowledge on how HER2 drives breast tumourigenesis at its pre-malignant stage is quite limited. Here, we investigate the HER2-overexpression driven cellular events at the earliest stages of breast tumourigenesis using <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in vivo and ex vivo <\/i>models. Using mouse models of HER2+ breast cancer and clinical samples of patients with DCIS, we showed that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) reside in HER2-negative population of tumour cells and arise from a HER2-negative cell-of-origin. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses of mammary ducts isolated from the MMTV-Neu mice at the pre-cancerous stage showed that <i>HER2\/Neu <\/i>overexpression<i> <\/i>alters the energy metabolism<i> <\/i>in mammary epithelial cells<i> in vivo<\/i>. Furthermore, we have observed an accumulation of reactive oxygen species levels in pre-cancerous mammary ducts, which consequently causes oxidative stress induction and DNA damage in both HER2-positive and HER2-negative epithelial cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that HER2 overexpression in normal mammary epithelia may lead to a genotoxic tissue microenvironment that may consequently result in the accumulation of further somatic mutations in HER2-negative cell populations, which contain BCSCs and their cell-of-origin. Our findings therefore illustrate a novel mechanism explaining the HER2-driven breast tumour initiation and thus provide new avenues of research for developing novel preventive approaches against breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-03 Biological and biochemical mechanisms in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),Breast Cancer Stem Cells (BCSC),Oxidative stress and DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

One factor contributing to this cancer disparity is the lack of diverse representation in preclinical models and clinical trials. Cell lines are widely used preclinical models, though of the breast cancer cell lines commercially available, only 8% are derived from women of African ancestry, compared to 90% from women of European ancestry. Thus, diversifying cancer cell lines would better represent the population as a whole and strengthen the translatability of results. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize three novel breast cancer cell lines derived from a woman of African-Caribbean ancestry, ACRJ BC24 parent, ACRJ BC24&#945;, and ACRJ BC24&#946;. Characterization assays included cell line authentication, growth curve analysis, western blots, immunohistochemistry staining, flow cytometry, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), xenografts, and karyotyping. Short tandem repeat profiling confirmed the novelty and human origin of the cell line. WGS confirmed the cell lines to be of 100% African ancestry. The ACRJ-BC24 parent, &#945;, and &#946; lines have been passaged over 70 times in vitro with a doubling time of 70 hours, 133 hours, and 70 hours, respectively. All cell lines were confirmed triple-negative, CD49f+ and EpCAM-, as well as CD44+ and CD24-, suggesting a basal-like subtype. Additionally, all the ACRJ BC24 cell lines expressed vimentin but not E-Cadherin, suggesting a mesenchymal phenotype. Expression of N-cadherin is demonstrated in the parent and &#945; line, but not in the &#946; line, showing varying levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition amongst the lines. Additionally, varying intensity of expression of CD49f was observed between the three ACRJ BC24 lines, further confirming a biological distinction. Cytotoxicity of 10 chemotherapy drugs was assessed against the 3 novel cell lines and established lines (MCF7, T47D, HCC70, and HCC1806). Differential viability was observed among the cell lines as gemcitabine and docetaxel were most potent against ACRJ BC24&#945; with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of 4.6 nM and 10 nM respectively compared to all other cell lines. Our findings confirm the need for increased representation of Black breast cancer cell lines among the preclinical panel for drug screens. The inclusion of these three novel Afro-Caribbean breast cancer cell lines in preclinical models will provide further insight into the current disparities among Black and White breast cancer cell lines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-06 Cellular models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cell lines,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Drug design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"I.

Cellular blebbing, a distinctive feature observed during apoptosis and cell migration, has gained significant recognition. However, existing tools such as atomic force microscopy and optical tweezers have limitations in terms of throughput and complexity. Microfluidics has emerged as a promising technology to overcome these limitations.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this study, we developed a novel microfluidic device with a double-layer compression mechanism to induce controlled blebbing of cells. We implemented a convolution-based tracing program to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cell area measurement. The device was used to examine the enforced blebbing response of two human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and investigate the potential of blebbing as a marker for drug resistance using a human lung cancer cell line (HCC4006). Additionally, we elucidated the role of annexin-6 (A6) in enforced blebbing and its underlying mechanism.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our microfluidic device successfully implemented a double-layered design that induced cell deformation through compression from the second pressurized polydimethylsiloxane layer. The findings revealed that highly invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 and osimertinib-resistant HCC4006, required significantly higher critical compression levels compared to their non-invasive counterparts (MCF-7 cell line) or osimertinib-sensitive cells. Moreover, the drug-resistant groups exhibited a greater compression strain requirement for blebbing compared to the control group, indicating their enhanced resilience against disruptive forces and superior survivability. Prior studies have demonstrated that A6 protein is recruited to the site of membrane injury and facilitates the formation of blebs, thereby contributing to cellular repair processes. Our further investigation into the role of A6 protein demonstrated its involvement in cell blebbing. Knockdown of A6 resulted in a notable 27% reduction in cellular volume, reflecting reduced intracellular pressure, and a corresponding 1.7-fold increase in the critical compressive strain necessary for inducing blebbing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our microfluidic device allows for rapid and simultaneous testing and automated analysis of hundreds of cells, making it suitable for applications such as cell sorting, highly invasive and drug-resistant cancer cell detection, without the need for labeling. Furthermore, it serves as a powerful tool for fundamental studies of membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics. The label-free nature of the device, coupled with its high throughput capabilities, highlights its potential in future applications, including cancer monitoring and drug-resistance screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-06 Cellular models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microfluidics,Annexin-6,Cellular blebbing,Osimertinib-resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"W.

Although it is evident that cancer is an evolution like process driven by rare adaptable cancer cells that persist under various selection pressures, most of our knowledge about cancer comes from studying proliferative cancer cells. To overcome the hurdle in modeling adaptable cancer cell state that defeats all currently offered therapies, we are exploiting a linkage that exists between different adaptability substates such as metabolic, regulatory, and structural substates. Our studies, thus far carried out with aggressive triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma cell lines, suggest that it is feasible to apply severe metabolic challenges as realistic selection pressures\/bottlenecks for modeling highly abnormal and highly adaptable cancer cells that drive cancer evolution and therapy resistance. The most significant aspect of our approach is an ability to model rare resistant cells (approximately 0.01% of cells) that survive in reversible quiescence under selection pressures. Monitoring of cells under microscope for several weeks under a severe and prolonged metabolic challenge, for example, a lack of glutamine in culture medium, revealed perhaps most interesting and cancer-relevant cells that survive in quiescence for weeks and then advance to generate therapy-resistant cells. Such microscopic monitoring revealed a significant heterogeneity among surviving cells. As examples, 1) surviving cells differ in the depth of quiescence, some cells trying to proliferate sooner than others; 2) as cells progress from quiescence to proliferation, their fate is far from certain: cells may progress to yield few cells, tiny colony, or large colony and then stop proliferating and in most instances die (abortive attempts at evolution). Of significance, the cell lines derived inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, possessed a higher evolutionary fitness than non-IBC cell lines. This approach also eliminates 99.99% of cells that proliferate in cell culture but would not survive selection pressures in the body. The adaptable cells that survived the bottleneck and then proliferated indefinitely were highly resistant and metastatic. Molecular analyses of adaptable cells, including gene expression microarrays, CGH microarrays, and whole genome sequencing revealed mechanisms for their plasticity (exemplified by markers of high EMT), and for generating cellular diversity by altering epigenome (exemplified by low TET2) and by structural modifications in transcriptome (exemplified by high FTO). We conclude that the phenotype-based approach described here is good at modeling deep intrinsic resistance and may be useful in developing strategies for improving outcomes in resistant cancers.

Currently, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality among patients globally, largely due to delayed diagnosis, chemotherapy resistance, high metastasis rates, and subtype heterogeneity. Recent OC research highlights extracellular vesicles (EVs) as pivotal contributors to intercellular communication and disease progression, elucidating the intricacies of OC pathology. EVs, diverse membrane-derived vesicles released by most cells, carry molecular cargoes containing proteins and nucleic acids. Studies indicate that the biogenesis, packaging, and release of EVs are highly dependent and sensitive to the cellular microenvironment and depend on the in-vitro and in-vivo modelling systems. Labs use varied model systems&#8212;2D monolayers, animal models, and innovative 3D models&#8212;to investigate EVs' ovarian cancer roles. Therefore, in this study we aimed to compare the miRNA profiles associated with EVs in 3D ovarian cancer cell models, and to identify the pathophysiological relevance of the EVs isolated from these models to the patient derived EVs.In this study, two OC epithelial cell lines, SKOV-3 and OVCAR-, were initially cultured as 2D monolayers and embedded within Gelatin Methacryloyl hydrogels. Over nine days, multiple assays observed spheroid formation within the cell-laden hydrogels. EVs isolated from the cell-conditioned media were characterized per MISEV 2018 guidelines. Small RNA sequencing identified statistically significant miRNAs, subject to gene ontology and gene rank analyses. EVs from a cohort of 60 OC patients were used to identify survival-associated miRNA profiles.Our findings in the cell-laden hydrogels demonstrated OC cell growth, proliferation, and aggregation into spheroidal structures, establishing an ideal 3D model. The isolated EVs were characterized for size, concentration, morphology, and surface markers. Small RNA sequencing revealed 18 significantly different EV-associated miRNA species across 3D vs 2D models, influencing apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation in ovarian cancer. Notably, 3D model-derived EV-associated miRNAs mirrored patient-derived EV-associated miRNA profiles, indicating their pathophysiological relevance.This study establishes a robust 3D OC model in hydrogels, showcasing growth, proliferation, and aggregation capabilities. Differential miRNA profiles between 3D and 2D model EVs highlight the critical roles of these miRNAs in essential ovarian cancer processes. Moreover, similarities between 3D model and patient-derived EV-associated miRNA profiles emphasize the clinical relevance of our model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-06 Cellular models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Ovarian cancer,Extracellular vesicles,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>N.

Single-cell technologies have unveiled the intricate interaction between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) with unprecedented precision. However, the spatial context of single-cell phenotypes within TME during LUAD early carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we sought to characterize human-relevant murine LUAD precancer models to elucidate the molecular and immune changes in the spatial context during early LUAD carcinogenesis to inform lung cancer interception strategies.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We have developed genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) (129S4 KrasG12D) and carcinogen-induced LUAD precancer model (CITM) (129S4 Urethane). Lung tissues were collected at various time points after induction and analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES), imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Pathological image analysis demonstrated a significantly higher tumor burden (p&#60;0.01) in the 129S4 KrasG12D model compared to the 129S4 Urethane model across different time points. WES revealed a progressive increase in tumor mutation burden (TMB) from precancers to invasive LUADs in both models, with the CITM model having significantly higher TMB (p&#60;0.05) at matched timepoints than GEMM model. IMC assessed 39 biomarkers in 284 regions of interest (ROIs) and identified 1.4 million individual cells with 17 major cell types. Macrophages were the most prevalent immune cell type in TME, representing 9.00% of total cells in GEMM and 8.29% in CITM. The percent immune cells of the total cells progressively decreased from early-stage hyperplasia to late-stage adenocarcinoma in both models. The CITM exhibited a significantly (p&#60;0.05) higher immune proportion than the GEMM model at hyperplasia and adenoma stages, with no significant difference at the invasive adenocarcinoma tumor cores between these 2 models. On the other hand, CITM had a significantly higher overall immune proportion (p&#60;0.05) and the CD8 T cell and B cell proportions than GEMM tumor adjacent lung tissues at the adenocarcinoma stage leading to a significantly higher immune cell gradient between tumor adjacent lung tissues and tumor cores in CITM models. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data demonstrated an increased presence of immune response signaling at the tumor adjacent lung tissues compared to the tumor core in the latest stage.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Spatial analysis revealed different molecular and immune landscapes in the genetic and carcinogen-induced LUAD precancer models, leading to distinct cellular spatial arrangements within the tumor microenvironment in each model. Overall, innate immunity, particularly macrophage, probably plays critical roles during early carcinogenesis of LUAD regardless of carcinogen exposure.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Prevention,Single cell,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>B.

Dysregulated TGF-&#946; signaling and loss of CEACAM1 activity are implicated in fatty liver disease. Clinically, 40% of human liver and GI cancers have genetic alterations in the TGF-&#946; pathway members. CEACAM1 expression is significantly decreased in the liver of patients with Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In contrast, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CEACAM1 is associated with invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that TGF-&#946; signaling and &#946;II-Spectrin modulate MASH and HCC through CEACAM1.<br \/>Methods: Wild type and the liver-specific &#946;II-Spectrin (<i>Sptbn1<\/i>) knockout (LSKO) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or Western diet (WD) and analyzed for <i>Ceacam1<\/i> expression, changes in immune cell population, liver inflammation, and cancer. We used Alphafold and molecular modeling to identify the CEACAM1 and SPTBN1 interaction sites.<br \/>Results: Single cell sequencing analysis of MASH mice liver revealed that Ceacam1 expression is significantly decreased in hepatocytes. Interestingly, we found that CEACAM1 levels are restored to normal in tissues from liver-specific &#946;II-Spectrin knockout (LSKO) mice. Transcriptomic and multiplex imaging analysis suggest that proinflammatory TGF-&#946; signaling is activated and infiltration of CD11b+ cells is increased in MASH liver. These phenotypes are blocked in LSKO mice. Furthermore, siRNA-knockdown of &#946;II-Spectrin blocks diet-induced obesity, fibrosis, lipid accumulation, tissue damage, and cancer susceptibility. We have also found that CEACAM1 interacts with the Smad3 adaptor, &#946;II-Spectrin. Furthermore, structural analysis of CECAM1 and &#946;II-Spectrin revealed critical residues involved in the interaction.<br \/>Conclusion: These data suggest that &#946;II-Spectrin regulates CEACAM1 expression in the liver and is a potential target for therapeutic intervention to treat MASH and prevent progression to HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carcinoembryonic antigen,Metabolic syndrome,TGF-&#946;,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"K.

Prophylactic mastectomy and systemic hormonal therapy are only recommended for high-risk individuals. Prophylactic mastectomy is a drastic surgery that removes the entire breast, including the epithelial cell-lined ductal trees where BC arises but also uninvolved stroma. Even with a 90% risk reduction, many women are deterred from prophylactic mastectomy due to its associated risk of infection, lymphedema, painful recovery time, and mental health toll. Hormonal therapies, tamoxifen and raloxifene, reduce BC risk by upwards of 50% but also increase the risk of uterine cancer and stroke. Thus, new interventions to reduce the risk of BC and minimize deterrents are necessary. Intraductal (ID) injection is a minimally invasive procedure that avoids systemic toxicity by cannulating a needle directly into the ductal tree opening to directly administer a solution to the epithelial cells. We previously reported that ID infusion of 70% ethanol (EtOH) as a cell-killing solution prevents tumor formation in an aggressive genetically engineered mouse model of BC with minimum collateral tissue damage. Here, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of EtOH-based ablative solutions in a Methyl-N-Nitrosourea (MNU) chemically induced rat model of BC to assess scalability of this procedure towards clinical trials. Two weeks after tumor induction, rats received ID infusions of a solution containing 70% EtOH to ablate epithelial cells, ethyl cellulose (EC) to minimize collateral tissue damage, and\/or Tantalum Oxide (TaO<sub>x<\/sub>) to visualize infused ductal trees via micro-CT imaging. EtOH-infused glands had the longest tumor latency (273 days vs 97 days in control group, p &#60; 0.0001). No statistically significant differences were noted in epithelial ablation or collateral tissue damage between treatment groups receiving ID injections of 70% EtOH with varying concentrations of EC, but there was a trend to lower collateral damage with EC-containing solutions. Local clearance of TaO<sub>x<\/sub> in infused mammary glands enabled post-procedure MR imaging surveillance after 15 d of ID procedure. This preclinical study demonstrates that ID injection of a refined solution containing 70% EtOH and TaO<sub>x<\/sub> is an efficacious and scalable procedure for primary prevention of BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Prevention,Local treatment,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"E.

TNBC accounts for 20% of breast cancer and is more aggressive due to increased metastasis, high recurrence rate, and significant resistance to chemotherapy (e.g., Doxorubicin, DOX). Napabucasin (NAPA, a small organic molecule) is recognized to kill cancer stem cells by targeting the transcription factor STAT3 pathway and is currently in clinical trials. Our previous <i>in vitro<\/i> results showed significant effects with hypoxia-responsive targeted polymersomes compared to control in MDA-MB-231 and Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) TNBC cells. Further, we observed increased NRP-1 expression in TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells under hypoxic (0.2% oxygen) conditions compared to normoxia (21% oxygen). Hence, we hypothesize that targeted hypoxia-responsive polymersome drug therapy would reduce the tumor growth of the PDX mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer <i>in vivo.<br \/><\/i>Methods: We have established the TNBC PDX mouse model with two major phases, initial propagation (F1-F3) and final study phase (F3-F6), for <i>in vivo<\/i> study (TNBC tumor samples received from Sanford Broadway Clinic, Fargo, IRB approved). We utilized 3-6 months old female adult NSG mice (Jackson Lab) weighing 18-25 g. PDX tumor-bearing female NSG mice were administered polymersome-encapsulated drug (doxorubicin and other groups) by intravenous injection twice a week for 4 weeks and then observed the animals for an additional week. The percentage of tumor volume growth was calculated on these treatment groups and compared to vehicle. The tumors from all the groups were excised and dissected after the treatment and fixed in 10% formalin for histological evaluation. Tumors from all the groups after treatment were stained using hematoxylin and eosin to analyze the tumor core necrosis, and the average area of necrosis was compared among all the groups.<br \/>Results: The TNBC PDX mouse model treated with DOX alone and a combination of encapsulated DOX with NAPA showed significant weight loss compared to the control (over 4 weeks). DOX-alone treated mice have shown reduced tumor growth and exhibited a significant difference compared to the control group. Notably, the targeted DOX-encapsulated polymersome demonstrated a much lower tumor volume and displayed a marked difference compared to non-targeted vehicles, free-DOX, and saline. In the initial analysis, we observed a higher necrosis in the tumor of the targeted DOX-encapsulated polymersome compared to the control.<br \/>Summary and Conclusion: Overall, the hypoxia-responsive targeted polymersomes showed potent antitumor activity in the novel TNBC PDX animal model. With further developments, the targeted polymersomes might have translational potential as drug carriers for treating TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Targeted drug delivery,Hypoxia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Among younger US women, lung cancer incidence rates have in recent years become higher than rates seen in men, despite comparable histories of tobacco use. The possible contribution of stress to higher lung cancer risk in young women has received little research attention despite preclinical evidence that exposure to stress-related neuroendocrine responses can cause DNA damage. The present study used a well-established lung cancer model in young female mice (<i>in vivo<\/i> exposure to NNK) along with a mouse stress model to explore their independent and combined effects on lung cancer development. In addition, we explored one possible biological pathway by chronic administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol). We also tested the use of <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging for repeated monitoring of tumor development over time. Cohort 1 (n=60) had 4 groups: Home cage control, NNK treatment alone, repeated stress (RS) alone and NNK+RS. Cohort 2 (n=60) had the same 4 groups with the addition of administration of propranolol in drinking water. Cohort 3 (n=48, imaging cohort) had 3 groups: Home cage control, NNK alone and NNK+RS. FVB\/N (4-6 wk) were purchased from a commercial supplier and acclimated with gentle handling for two weeks. The repeated stress protocol began week-3 and continued for the duration of the study. It combined two well-established rodent models: social disruption stress via changes in cage mates at the time of cage cleaning (2x\/week) and a 90-minute restraint stress immediately prior to cage change (1x\/week). NNK or saline treatment began on week-4 (IP; 2x\/week; 3 mg\/injection) and continued for 4 weeks. 21 weeks after stress initiation, the mice in cohorts 1 and 2 were sacrificed, lungs removed, inflated and tumors counted and sized. Mice in cohort 3 were imaged by Hounsfield-calibrated micro-CT (&#956;CT) at baseline, 14, 19 and 23 weeks. The entire lung space, excluding the heart, was defined as a volumetric region of interests (VOIs). The VOIs were subjected to thresholding to segment the lungs into air space and tissue space compartments. The volume of tissue space of each animal was ratioed against its own baseline tissue space volume. Results from Cohort 1 revealed significantly greater numbers and overall size of lung tumors in stressed mice that received NNK. No significant effects were seen in the absence of NNK. Results from Cohort 2 revealed no significant differences between stressed and unstressed groups treated with propranolol. Cohort 3 revealed a pattern of results with stressed mice generally showing the highest lung tumor volume levels (Hounsfield Units), which reached significance at 19 weeks in preliminary analyses.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this study, we found that repeated stress increased lung tumor burden in female mice treated with NNK, and that a beta-adrenergic pathway may be involved.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-01 Animal models in prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,Lung cancer,Tobacco,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"F.

We describe a novel method to induce LC in transgenic pigs carrying Cre-inducible Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> and TrP53<sup>R167H<\/sup> mutations (Oncopigs).<br \/>The Oncopigs (n=12; 9 females, and 3 males) at 9 weeks of age were anesthetized and adenovirus (1x10<sup>11<\/sup> PFU) carrying Cre recombinase gene (Ad-Cre) &#177; polybrene (1:100) &#177; IL-8 (5 ng\/ml) was injected via flexible bronchoscopy with two techniques: (1) Bronchial lavage (n=6) and (2) Transbronchial needle injection (n=6) into different lung lobes. As controls, a combination of polybrene &#177; IL-8 was injected without AdCre into the contralateral lobes in the same pigs (n=8). Oncopigs were monitored via clinical monitoring, blood counts, basic metabolic panel, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging for LC progression and metastasis at 3-, 4-, 7-, 10-, 16-, and 26 weeks post-intervention.<br \/>All animals tolerated the injections with expected weight gains. Blood counts and metabolic panels remained normal during LC progression. At the site of injection\/lavage, lung masses were detected on CT imaging at 3 weeks post-injections. However, a decrease in masses was observed on CT at 7 weeks post-intervention. The decrease in size of the lung masses coincided with increasing attenuation. No distant metastases were observed on CT imaging. Lavage-based lesions appeared to be more heterogeneous with surrounding inflammatory changes. Transbronchial-injection-based lesions appeared more consolidated and coin-shaped without surrounding inflammatory changes. Control injection sites did not show any mass growth on CT imaging.<br \/>Immunohistochemistry analysis on lung tumors revealed increased pancytokeratin, trichrome, E-cad, Ki-67, IBA, and CD3 expression. Further, immunofluorescence revealed decreased E-Cad, CK-19, and Zo-1 expression, whereas increased expression of N-Cad, FN1, snail, CD44, &#945;-SMA, and &#947;-catenin, was observed in the LC and metastatic tissue compared to normal.<br \/>We successfully generated and characterized a novel transgenic Oncopig LC model.

The literature points out that obesity is a potent risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Interestingly, CRC incidence is higher in men compared to women, and the sex hormone estrogen protects reproductive-age females from CRC despite obesity. In this project, we aim to understand the sex-based differences and protective role of estrogen in obesity-influenced CRC. An improved mouse model was devised where the effects of obesity and estrogen in CRC could be meticulously studied. We deployed 4-5-week-old male and female FVB\/NJ mice and performed either sham surgery (males and females) or bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) (females). Post one week of recovery, all mice were randomly sub-grouped into either low-fat diet (LFD, 10% fat) or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) groups, weekly injected with a colon-specific carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM; 5 mg\/kg for week 1, 10 mg\/kg for weeks 2-6), and cyclically every 4-5 days injected 17-beta-estradiol (E2; 4 &#956;g\/ mouse) to a group of OVX mice for the study period of 22 weeks. The body weight of all mice was tracked every week. A whole-body composition analysis after 22 weeks showed that males and OVX females are more obese compared to females with sham surgery and OVX females with E2 injection (OVX+E2), respectively. Additionally, mice on HFD had a higher body weight compared to those on LFD; however, the absence of estrogen in OVX females led them to have higher body weight compared to sham and OVX+E2 females. Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the tumor size between males and females, females and OVX females, and OVX and OVX+E2 females. Study models have rarely incorporated both sex-dependent differences and diet-induced obesity in understanding CRC. With the current study model, it is anticipated to learn more about these differences at molecular, cellular, and metabolic levels.

In PCa though, PPARG is considered pro-tumoral and I<sub>2<\/sub> effects have not been fully studied. Hence, the aim of this study was to analyze I<sub>2<\/sub> individual and combined effects with androgen deprivation by using both androgen dependent (AD) and independent (AI), <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> PCa models.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> <i><u>In vitro.<\/u><\/i> I<sub>2<\/sub> effects in cell viability and invasion were analyzed in AD (LNCaP) and AI (DU145, PC3) PCa cells. LNCaP cells were also treated with androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. PPARG participation in I<sub>2<\/sub> effects was assessed with GW9962 (antagonist) and rosiglitazone (agonist). NE phenotype was induced in LNCaP by prolonged culture under androgen-depleted conditions and was assessed by measuring the growth and length of neurite-like projections. RT-qPCR was employed to assess the expression of NE markers (<i>SYP, ENO2<\/i>), and lipogenic genes (<i>FASN, SREBF1<\/i>). <i><u>In vivo<\/u><\/i>. Eighteen weeks-old TRAMP mice were subjected to sham surgery or castration, and were provided or not with I<sub>2<\/sub> (0.025%, drinking water) for four weeks. Prostates were subjected to histopathological analysis (H&#38;E and Masson's trichrome) and IHC (AR, SYP, PPARG). Scoring systems were used to grade the severity of high proliferative intraepithelial lesions (HPIN), and desmoplasia.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><b><\/b> I<sub>2<\/sub> decreased the cell viability and invasion capacity of all PCa cells tested, and when supplied with AR antagonists further enhanced their antiproliferative effects in LNCaP cells. I<sub>2<\/sub> failed to induce the expression of PPARG target genes, and GW9662 did not prevent I<sub>2<\/sub>-induced decrease in cell viability. Like androgen deprivation, I<sub>2<\/sub> also caused NE-like morphology in LNCaP cells, but unlike androgen deprived LNCaP cells, I<sub>2 <\/sub>treated cells had decreased expression of NE markers. In TRAMP mice, I<sub>2<\/sub> increased the presence of HPIN, reduced nuclear AR protein detection, and had no effect on PPARG. As expected, castration reduced HPIN, caused epithelial atrophy and desmoplasia; decreased total AR levels and PPARG nuclear levels. However, the number of NE (SYP-positive) cells did not change. The addition of I<sub>2<\/sub> to castration did not modify the score of epithelial lesions but increased the desmoplasia and the presence of NE cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b> I<sub>2<\/sub> exhibited <i>in vitro <\/i>antineoplastic effects over epithelial cells, however, these effects did not translate into the <i>in vivo<\/i> model. PPARG did not seem to mediate I<sub>2<\/sub> effects. Overall, our data suggest that tumoral microenvironment may interfere with I<sub>2<\/sub> epithelial-specific antitumoral effects.<br \/><b>Funding: <\/b>PAPIIT-UNAM (IN217223, IN202322) and CONAHCYT (774791).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR02-12 New agent development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen deprivation therapy,TRAMP model,Chemopreventive agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Drugs developed to combat KRAS-driven cancers become less effective due to intrinsic changes in the cells resulting in resistance and relapse. Due to the enormous challenges encountered in developing direct KRAS inhibitors, agents targeting alternative downstream RAS mediator kinase enzymes of the MAPK and PI3K\/AKT signaling pathways have been developed. However, other avenues that directly target KRAS and similar cancer drivers must be explored to obtain alternative effective therapies. PCAIs constitute a group of potential anticancer agents that we developed to specifically disrupt and suppress signaling by hyperactive G-proteins such as mutated KRAS. In previous studies, PCAIs stimulated MEK1\/2, ERK1\/2, p90RSK and AKT phosphorylation resulting in cell death. The present study aims to determine whether specific inhibitors of the kinases can reverse PCAIs-stimulated phosphorylation and cell death. PCAIs were thus tested against the KRAS mutant NCI- cell line H23 (from a B\/AA patient) and compared to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor Sotorasib and other kinase inhibitors drugs. The EC<sub>50<\/sub> values for the PCAIs NSL-YHJ-2-27 and NSL-AB-45 were 4.1 &#177; 0.3 and 5.5 &#177; 0.1 &#956;M, respectively, compared to Gefitinib (EGFR), Sotorasib (KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>), Dabrafenib (BRAF), Selumetinib (MEK1\/2), Ulixertinib (ERK1\/2) and Ipatasertib (AKT) whose EC<sub>50<\/sub> values were 83 &#177; 12.9 &#956;M, 38 &#177; 5.5 &#956;M, 33 &#177; 1.2 &#956;M, 71 &#177; 5.3 &#956;M, 11 &#177; 0.2 &#956;M, 12 &#177; 1.0 &#956;M, respectively. The results indicate that the PCAIs are more effective against NCI-H23 than the other kinase inhibitor drugs. Future work will determine the effects of co-treating cells with the PCAIs and the respective kinase inhibitors on cell viability and PCAIs-induced phosphorylation of the kinases.
