[{"Abstract":"G protein-independent pathway (&#946;-arrestin dependent signaling cascade) is initiated by activated GPCRs phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), triggering multiple signaling pathways. The purpose of this research is to reveal the role of GRK2 on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Through <i>in vitro<\/i> assays, we showed that GRK2 overexpression led to loss of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. The cell spreading assay further indicated that the loss of focal adhesion (FA) assembly and cell size decreased in GRK2-overexpressing cells. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments demonstrated that tumor formation and metastasis were suppressed in xenograft mouse models implanted with GRK2-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. In addition, label-free imaging detection of the collagen pattern suggested that GRK2 overexpression caused bundle loss but the formation of thicker, twisted collagen fibers in xenograft tumor samples. Together with the transcriptome and proteomic data, we hypothesize that GRK2 suppresses cell motility and metastasis by reducing FA and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in ovarian cancer. This research revised the mechanisms underlying GRK2-mediated ovarian cancer metastasis and suggested the potential to target the GRK2-meditated pathway for cancer suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix remodelling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>W.

The dynamics of E-cadherin is critical in collective cell migration as the important mechanism of metastasis. DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor 1) has been shown to promote E-cadherin stability at adherens junction in epithelial cells by regulating endocytosis of E-cadherin. However, in the growth of epithelial cell cluster and collective cell migration, the role of DDR1 in the cell-cell contacts is not clear. In this study, HT-29 colon cancer cells with epithelial phenotype were used in the experiments. Cells were treated with epidermal growth factor to stimulate E-cadherin turnover or applied with lysosome inhibitor chloroquine to interfere cellular vesicle transport. DDR1 and E-cadherin were revealed by immuno-confocal microscopy. The immunostaining results showed DDR1 was localized at cell-cell contacts and co-localized with E-cadherin. When cells were treated with epidermal growth factor, the phosphor MAPK activity was increased and DDR1 was localized at cell-cell contacts intensively. When lysosome activity was blocked by chloroquine treatment. The cellular vesicle transport and collective cell migration was reduced and furthermore inhibited DDR1 translocation to the cell-cell contacts. This study demonstrated DDR1 co-localized with E-cadherin is responsible for epidermal growth factor stimulation in cell cohort. Lysosome activity is required for E-cadherin turnover and affected DDR1 translocation. Chloroquine maybe the potential drug to suppress tumor nest growth and collective cell migration by interfere DDR1 mediated E-cadherin stability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-01 Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,DDR1,E-cadherin,Lysosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.-C.

Organoid technologies often rely on commercially available EHS mouse sarcoma matrix materials, and it remains uncertain how batch-to-batch variability of this matrix impacts the consistency of cancer signaling. Here, we present a novel photo-activated hydrogel tuned to the properties of the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC organoid cultures.<br \/><b>Method: <\/b>We designed multiple synthetic hydrogel materials with tunable mechanical properties, including SP-139 (Stem Pharm, Inc), a polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel functionalized with norbornene and formed with both degradable and non-degradable crosslinking peptides and a cell adhesion peptide (CRGDS). We used rheometry to measure the elastic modulus of the polymerized hydrogel after visible light photoactivation (395 nm) and expanded multiple cancer organoid cultures.

Exosome (EV), an important intercellular communication mediator, participates in a highly and complex network that drug resistance of cancer cells. EV has been reported to be able to transfer drug resistance from drug-resistant tumor cells to adjacent drug-sensitive cells. We identified a novel target, UBE2R2, based on our previous exosome proteomics analysis of resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The main goal of this study is to validate the underlying mechanisms leading to chemotherapy resistance.<br \/>Methods: We isolated EV from drug resistant cancer cell lines including coloractal cancer cell lines (HCT116-OXAR, DLD-1 OXA-R, DLD-1-OXA-R\/SN38) its parental cell lines (HCT116, DLD-1) using the ExoLutE isolation kits based on a combination of multiple isolation techniques. Based on the existing data (proteomic analysis), we conducted experiments to elucidate the functions and mechanisms involved in cancer resistance of the identified UBE2R2. Cell viability assay and invasion asaay were performed to assess the effects of EVs drived from drug resistance colorectal cells on oxaliplatin and irinotecan resistance. In addition, cells transfected with siControl and siUBE2R2 were treated with oxaliplatin to access the relative UBE2R2 drug resistance effect. To explore the related mechanisms, we performed real time PCR and western blot to identify the UBE2R2-SMYD3-P53 pathway, and FACS analysis to confirm apoptosis. Additionally, TMA samples were utilized to confirm resistance according to patient stage, and UBE2R2 expression was validated by immunohistological methods.<br \/>Results: UBE2R2, which is involved in ubiquitination, was most prominently expressed in resistant cell lines compared to controls in our previous proteomic analysis. Based on these results, we found that cell lines treated with exosomes which were derived from resistant cell lines showed lower sensitivity to the drug. Notably, treatment of resistant cell lines with siUBE2R2 resulted in increased sensitivity, confirming the involvement of UBE2R2 in resistance. As a possible mechanism in which UBE2R2 may be involved, western analysis targeting the SMYD-P53 mechanism showed that the combination of UBE2R2-SMYD3-p53 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Analyzed using TMA patient samples, we found that the expression of UBE2R2 increased towards more advenced stage.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest a novel mechanism of chemotherapy resistance may be associated with UBE2R2. Exosome (including UBE2R2) which was drived from drug resistance cells may induce oxaliplatin and irinotecan resistance in parental colorectal cells via regulation of SMYD3-UBE2R2-P53 signaling pathway, which will be useful for investigating a potential clinical target in prediction drug resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-02 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Colorectal cancer,Resistance,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

Patients with GBM, a common malignant brain tumor, have an average survival of 12-15 months after first-line therapy. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a histone demethylase that is overexpressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and functions to promote proliferation, inhibit differentiation, and enhance motility. Previous work from our group has investigated LSD1 as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma and identified genes that may predict resistance to pharmacological LSD1 inhibitors using RNA-seq. Five upregulated genes, HKDC1, RAB3IL1, RAB39B, FTH1, and FAM213A, were associated with LSD1 inhibitor (LSD1i) resistance and were validated in brain tissue of a GBM model treated with GSK-LSD1 after succumbing to tumor burden. In order to determine whether selection pressure from LSD1 inhibitor treatment caused upregulation of these genes, we created a model of acquired resistance in GSC lines in vitro. Isogenic resistant lines were generated by treating MDA-GSC17 cells with increasing concentrations of LSD1i or diluent (DMSO), as tolerated starting at 50 uM (which was five fold below the IC50 for these lines). In parallel, MDA-GSC17 controls were exposed to DMSO. The resistant line was created over 4 weeks and monitored by cell number and viability to reach 90%. To assess the change in gene expression, we conducted quantitative PCR for the five genes in the parental and resistant MDA-GSC17 line and saw upregulation in 3 of the 5 genes. Two genes, HKDC1 and RAB3IL1, were unable to be assessed due to low basal expression. However, 3 genes were upregulated which are RAB39B, FTH1, and FAM213A. RAB39B is a Ras-analog in brain (RAB) small GTPase and a member of the RAS oncogene family, involved in vesicular trafficking. High expression of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) is correlated with high-grade gliomas and poor prognosis in glioblastoma. Lastly, the redox regulatory protein, FAM213A, can activate antioxidant proteins and elevated expression is associated with worse outcomes for AML patients. This suggests that modulating the RAS signaling pathways and specific redox pathways may overcome LSD1 resistance. Understanding the changes in gene expression as the cells acquire resistance to LSD1 inhibitors will help us understand the mechanism of resistance to LSD1 inhibitors in glioblastoma and to design new treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-02 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Resistance,Therapeutics,LSD1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>K.

Histological studies of human tumors have demonstrated increased expression of the epithelial-resident placental (P-cadherin) and ectopic expression of the mesenchymal neuronal (N-cadherin) cadherin in oral dysplasia. We hypothesized that these changes in cadherin expression during early oral tumor development could facilitate increases in survival signaling. We genetically modified dysplastic oral keratinocytes to overexpress P-cadherin or suppress endogenous expression of N-cadherin. P-cadherin overexpression and N-cadherin suppression independently elicited a 3-6-fold decrease in apoptosis levels in response to docetaxel treatment compared to similarly treated controls. We found that in untreated dysplastic cells, P- and N-cadherin expression had positive and negative correlations, respectively, with the activation of the survival-associated enzymes focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT kinase. The total levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkb) were positively correlated with P-cadherin overexpression and reciprocally correlated with levels of N-cadherin. In docetaxel-treated dysplastic cells, we observed the reverse effect compared to untreated cells: the increased level of N-cadherin was positively correlated with FAK activity whereas FAK activity was suppressed by P-cadherin. P-cadherin expression in docetaxel-treated cells also increased activation of both MAPK and AKT, whereas alteration of N-cadherin levels had no effect. Because N-cadherin levels are known to increase in late-stage oral tumors, we extended these signaling studies to oral squamous carcinoma cells (OSCCs) expressing low or high levels of N-cadherin. In contrast to its suppression of survival pathways in docetaxel-treated dysplastic cells, in docetaxel-treated OSCCs, N-cadherin expression strongly enhanced phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT, and increased expression of NFkb. N-cadherin overexpression during this treatment also increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and suppressed phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Increase cadherin expression in all untreated cell lines increased expression of an inducer of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, the transmembrane protein mucin-1 (MUC1). N-cadherin overexpression also increased motility in both cell lines. Taken together, our data demonstrate antiapoptotic signaling directed by increased levels of P-cadherin in oral dysplasia and N-cadherin in OSCC, whereas increased levels of N-cadherin in dysplastic cells directed cellular signaling that were associated with a proapoptotic phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-02 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cadherin,Chemoresistance,Docetaxel,Dysplasia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.
