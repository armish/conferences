[{"Abstract":"ZC3H18 is a multifunctional regulator of gene expression that is lost in a subset of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). Our prior studies have established that the loss of ZC3H18 diminishes BRCA1 levels, leading to the disruption of homologous recombination DNA repair (HR) and heightened sensitivity of HGSOC cells to PARP inhibitors. Here we show an additional facet to ZC3H18's impact, showing that its loss also induces a reprogramming of energy metabolism in HGSOC. Our findings demonstrate that the depletion of ZC3H18 results in reduced mRNA and protein levels of the NAD<sup>+<\/sup>-biosynthetic enzyme, NMNAT1, in HGSOC cells. Mechanistic studies uncovered that ZC3H18 occupies the <i>NMNAT1<\/i> promoter, facilitating <i>NMNAT1<\/i> transcription by recruiting CDK12 onto the promoter. Consistent with this mechanism, loss of ZC3H18 led to a reduction in CDK12 levels on the <i>NMNAT1<\/i> promoter, diminishing NMNAT1 abundance and subsequently causing a decline in cellular NAD levels. These observations unveil a previously unknown role for ZC3H18 in HGSOC, shedding light on its involvement in the regulation of energy metabolism. Importantly, our findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic pathways that leverage the metabolic changes linked to ZC3H18 deficiency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Cancer,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"B.

Despite the clinical advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors, median survival continues to be less than twenty months and most patients develop resistance making it one of the deadliest malignancies. The rate of liver cancer continues to rise, which is coupled to the high prevalence of steatosis and steatohepatitis that accounts for about 25% in the general population. Pathologically, 80% of liver cancer occurs in patients with an underlying liver disease that displays liver steatosis. Thus, it is paramount to better characterize the transition from steatosis to HCC.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Utilizing a <i>P<\/i><i>ten<\/i> deleted mouse model (<i>Pten<\/i><i><sup>loxP<\/sup><\/i><i><sup>\/<\/sup><\/i><i><sup>loxP<\/sup><\/i><i>; Alb-Cre<\/i><i><sup>+<\/sup><\/i>) that recapitulates HCC progression, protein and lipid fractions were isolated to explore differentially expressed proteins and their correlations with bioactive lipid metabolism.

Our analysis using a bio-active lipid multi reaction monitoring panel of <i>Pten<\/i> deleted mouse livers further validates significant decreases in resolving eicosanoid levels along with increases in proinflammatory eicosanoid precursors as steatosis progress to HCC.

LKB1 loss is frequently co-mutated with <i>KRAS<\/i> and associated with primary resistance to immunotherapy, which is partially due to MCT4-dependent lactate secretion. However, the mechanisms driving MCT4 elevation and metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. We hypothesized that increased MYC expression, which is associated with LKB1 loss, plays a pivotal role in metabolic alterations, promoting lactate incorporation and maintaining redox homeostasis. To explore the impact of lactate on tumor cells with LKB1 loss, we performed metabolic profiling on KRAS mutant (K) murine lung cancer cells with or without LKB1 knockout (KL) treated with either glucose or lactate as the carbon source. PLS analysis indicated that there was no notable difference between K and KL cells after glucose treatment. However, we observed significant changes in metabolites between K and KL cells when treated with lactate. Differentially altered metabolites included TCA-related components such as acetyl-CoA and glutamate, indicating enhanced lactate utilization in KL tumor cells. We also noticed that KL cells showed increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with the addition of lactate, with increased GSH\/GSSH and NADPH\/NADP+<\/sup> ratios, suggesting that, as compared to LKB1-intact cells, LKB1-deficient cells had an enhanced ability to utilize OXPHOS and maintain redox homeostasis with lower levels of ROS generation when utilizing lactate as an energy source. However, in KL cells, MYC knockout (KO) or MCT4 KO partially abolished the lactate-induced OXPHOS and increased ROS. Moreover, [U-13C]lactate tracing revealed that isotopologues were significantly enriched in TCA components in KL cells, and this was reversed by either MYC KO or MCT4 KO, suggesting that MYC and MCT4 were critical for lactate reutilization in KL tumor cells. We observed that MYC could directly bind to the promoter region and transcriptionally activate MCT4 expression, and restoring MCT4 in MYC KO cells enhanced lactate incorporation and decreased ROS levels. Finally, we injected KL murine tumor cells with or without MYC\/MCT4 KO into mice and infused [U-13C]lactate to detect the isotopologues distribution in vivo. KL tumors showed significantly enhanced lactate incorporation as compared to K tumors, while MYC KO or MCT4 KO reversed these phenotypes. Collectively, our data indicates that in LKB1-deficient tumors, upregulation of MYC promotes MCT4 expression and increases lactate incorporation and utilization, and that can be inhibited by targeting MYC or MCT4. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms driving the metabolic reprogramming and aggressive phenotype of KRAS-mutant LKB1-deficient tumors and identify a novel therapeutic strategy for this recalcitrant subgroup.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LKB1,Myc,Lactate,Lactate transporter,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Cancer cells also utilize fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to generate ATP to meet their energy demand. Notably, lipid metabolites can inhibit and trigger ferroptosis due to iron-dependent oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Therefore, identifying regulators that maintain the intricate balance of lipid biosynthesis required for cell proliferation and survival is critical in cancer biology and therapy. Lipid metabolism is regulated by two oncogenic signaling pathways: the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. About 30% of all cancers harbor constitutively active mutations in KRAS, HRAS, or NRAS, resulting in hyperactive RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling to drive tumorigenesis, metastatic progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. KRAS regulates lipid uptake, lipid synthesis, and FAO. mTOR is a serine\/threonine kinase acting as a key intracellular signaling hub to regulate nutrient homeostasis, metabolism, protein synthesis, and autophagy. The mTORC1 complex promotes lipogenesis. The RAS and mTOR signaling pathways exhibit both positive and negative cross-regulation. The coordinated activity of both pathways is critical to sustained tumor growth. Notably, mTORC1 signaling inhibition enhances RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, constitutive mTORC1 signaling induces cell death when the supply of unsaturated FAs is limited. However, the molecular link for coordinating the activity of the RAS and mTOR signaling pathways remains poorly defined. Death domain-associated protein (DAXX) is essential for mouse embryonic development and has ill-defined pro-cell survival functions. Our lab has a long-standing interest in deciphering DAXX&#8217;s complex biological functions. Our recent study shows that DAXX drives tumorigenesis by promoting lipogenic gene expression and lipid synthesis through interacting with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1 and SREBP2 (SREBP1\/2) (Mahmud et al., 2023, PMID 37045819). Unexpectedly, our new data reveal that DAXX inhibits ferroptosis. Significantly, phosphorylation via RAS signaling appears to regulate DAXX&#8217;s activity in lipid synthesis and resistance to ferroptosis. Remarkably, disruption of DAXX-mediated lipid synthesis potentiates ferroptosis due to mTORC1 activity. Based on these observations, we propose that stimulated by the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK oncogenic signaling, DAXX promotes tumorigenesis through upregulating genes for lipid synthesis and resistance to ferroptosis, and that the lack of DAXX-mediated lipid synthesis leads to sensitization of cells to ferroptosis due to mTORC1&#8217;s proliferative effects.

Using KRAS-driven models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we were the first to demonstrate that macropinocytosis functions in tumor cells as a nutrient acquisition pathway. Macropinocytosis triggers the internalization of extracellular proteins via discrete endocytic vesicles called macropinosomes. The incoming protein cargo is targeted for lysosome-dependent degradation, causing the intracellular release of amino acids. These protein-derived amino acids support metabolic fitness by contributing to the intracellular amino acid pools, as well as to the biosynthesis of central carbon metabolites. In this way, macropinocytosis represents a novel amino acid supply route that tumor cells use to survive the nutrient-poor conditions of the tumor microenvironment. While the tenets of the signal transduction events that drive macropinocytosis in cancer have emerged, a detailed picture of the macropinosome itself is not yet available. With the aid of nanotechnology, we have developed a methodology to isolate a pure fraction of macropinosomes from PDAC cells. Using a large-scale proteomic approach, we have been able to generate a list of proteins that reside in macropinosomes. The specificity of this approach was confirmed through the identification and validation of proteins known to specifically localize to these organelles in different contexts, such as Rab5 or SDC1. Thanks to this innovative method, we have demonstrated the involvement of two calcium channels, ATP2B1 and ATP2B4, in the formation of macropinosomes. By elucidating the molecular anatomy of KRAS-driven macropinosomes, we will gain further insight into the regulation and function of macropinocytosis in cancer. Moreover, having a clearer picture of the macropinosome will make us better positioned to exploit this pathway therapeutically and deliver breakthroughs to patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Endocytosis,Nanoparticle,Calcium,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Cooperative regulation of these metabolic processes is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Based on these findings, our group has been focusing on how the regulation of nutrient-driven metabolism controls the malignancy of cancer cells. Metabolic regulation has been considered crucial for cellular adaptation to environmental changes and promoting survival and proliferation. Recent studies showed the successful applications of targeting specific nutrients for cancer therapy. In this study, we developed a new lysosome-targeting therapeutic strategy, centered around the manipulation of the amino acid metabolism for GBM. Using patient-derived GBM cells, we found that lysosomal proteolytic activity is a unique metabolic biomarker representing malignant phenotypes of GBM and that it is closely correlated with the efficacy of current conventional therapy for GBM patients. Furthermore, the MiT\/TFE family members, TFEB and TFE3, which are the master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis, controlled malignant progression and therapeutic efficacy in vitro and vivo. Combinatory analyses with clinical patient samples and xenograft models demonstrated that the MiT\/TFE family plays a crucial role as a regulator of malignant properties in GBM. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioma dataset, which includes data from patients with Grade 2, 3, and 4 (GBM) gliomas, showed that higher expression of the MiT\/TFE family was significantly associated with shorter survival. Interestingly, we discovered that an essential amino acid controls lysosomal biogenesis and membrane integrity by regulation of nitric oxide signaling pathway. Finally, we screened the potential anti-cancer drugs, including temozolomide, exhibiting the synergy effect in amino acid-restriction conditions by conducting a drug screening using a clinically available anti-cancer drug library. Our study demonstrated that lysosomal function, supported by amino acid metabolism, plays a critical role in the regulation of GBM malignant status and proposed precision nutrition as a promising therapeutic approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lysosome,Amino acid,Drug sensitivity,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Here, we investigated the regulatory crosstalk between LKB1-AMPK and KEAP1-NRF2 pathways during metabolic stress. We found that metabolic stress activates NRF2 through the expression and phosphorylation of p62, causing the autophagic degradation of KEAP1. Intriguingly, the induction of p62 during metabolic stress is also required to activate AMPK by promoting AXIN-LKB1-AMPK complex formation and recruiting it to the lysosomal membrane. Importantly, the p62-driven dual-activation of AMPK and NRF2 was critical for tumour growth by synergizing antioxidant defences. In turn, the induction of p62 also required LKB1-AMPK activity, suggesting a double positive feedback loop between AMPK and p62. Mechanistically, the increase in lysosomal pH caused by low glucose metabolism and AMPK-dependent reduction of proton generation induced PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of TFEB\/TFE3 which increased the expression of p62. The increase of ROS caused by metabolic stress induced lysosomal MCOLN1-Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> dependent activation of TAK1 which increased p62 phosphorylation. Protons provided by lactic acid abrogated all the effects caused by metabolic stress. This positive feedback loop between AMPK and p62 that activates AMPK and NRF2 can potentially explain why co-occurring mutations in LKB1 and KEAP1 occur and further provide promising therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AMPK,Nrf2,p62,Lysosome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"E.-J.

Using proteomic analysis, we found that NPC patients resistant to gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) induction chemotherapy were characterized by abundant metabolic pathways.

Knockdown of IDH1 augmented the inhibition of <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis induced by gemcitabine and cisplatin but reversed the suppression of purine nucleotide synthesis, which leading to DNA damage caused by nucleotide pool imbalance. IDH1 facilitated transcription of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate-limiting enzyme for <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, through promoting chromatin accessibility by ALKBH5 in an &#945;-ketoglutaric acid dependent manner. DHODH inhibitor, BAY2402234 significantly sensitized NPC cells to gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy.

CAC has been reported to often lead to poor outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), emerging as a standard treatment for various types of cancer. Previously, we have demonstrated that KRAS-mutant lung tumor tissues display an immunosuppressive microenvironment with decreased CD8 T cells and increased regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this orthotopic lung cancer mouse model, treatment with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, a representative ICI, reduced tumor burden, whereas accelerated loss of body weight and skeletal muscle mass. We thus assumed that CD8 T cells could facilitate skeletal muscle wasting in lung tumor-bearing mice, a key feature of CAC. First, we established a syngeneic CAC mouse model through orthotopic transplantation of murine lung cancer cells. At 7 weeks post-injection, these mice developed CAC, displaying over 20 % body weight loss, almost total loss of epididymal fats, and profound skeletal muscle wasting. In line with our assumption, CAC mice showed an increased number of CD8 T cells but a reduced number of Tregs in skeletal muscles, compared to tumor-free control mice. We then investigated whether skeletal muscle-infiltrating CD8 T cells directly induce muscle atrophy indeed. In CAC mice, CD8 neutralization led to restoration of muscle mass and downregulation of muscle atrophy markers, but was not able to significantly affect lung tumor burden. Moreover, direct co-culture with splenic CD8 T cells exacerbated C2C12 myotube atrophy in a conditioned medium from lung cancer cells, further supporting the involvement of CD8 T cells in CAC. To elucidate its underlying mechanism, RNA sequencing analysis was conducted in both skeletal muscles and lung tumors of CAC mice. Based on the differently expressed gene analysis, <i>Cxcl13<\/i> was upregulated in skeletal muscles of CAC mice, while downregulated in lung tumors. It is well documented that CXCL13 can mediate recruitment of CD8 T cells. In this regard, CXCL13 might be a plausible regulator in CD8 T cell-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, which requires further investigation to fully understand the molecular mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Immune checkpoint inhibitors,Skeletal muscle wasting,CD8 T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.-Y.

Despite recent advancements in treatments, the challenges of recurrence and chemoresistance persist. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, and emerging evidence suggests significant roles for NRF2 and GPX4 in iron metabolism, regulating tumor cell functions. In osteosarcoma, however, the molecular mechanisms of the NRF2\/GPX4 axis and its therapeutic potential remain unknown. In this study, we first determined GPX4 and xCT expression levels and cellular responses to RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor, and Erastin, an xCT inhibitor in osteosarcoma cells. A total of seven osteosarcoma cell lines, consisting of five human cell lines (HOS, 143B, Saos-2, MG-63, U2OS) and two canine cell lines (COS31 and DOUG), were used. Our results revealed that the IC50 values ranged from 0.02 uM to 1.01 uM in cells treated with RSL3 and from 0.35 uM to 1.41 uM in cells treated with Erastin, respectively. These values were proportional to GPX4 and xCT levels across the cell lines. Then, U2OS, as the most sensitive, and Saos-2, the least sensitive based on their IC50 values, were selected to examine the iron regulatory machinery. In U2OS cells, RSL3 treatment significantly decreased NRF2 and GPX4, while increasing ferroportin-1 and ferritin. GPX4 knockdown also led to comparable changes in NRF2, ferroportin-1, and ferritin expression. NRF2 appears to mediate iron metabolism, ferroportin-1 acts as an iron exporter, and ferritin stores intracellular iron. Therefore, our findings suggest that GPX4-mediated ferroptosis is regulated by iron metabolic pathways, potentially to prevent ferroptotic cell death. We also found that Ferrostatin-1, a lipid peroxidation inhibitor showed no changes in ferroportin-1, ferritin, and NRF2. In Saos-2, RSL3 induced a remarkable reduction in GPX4 expression, akin to U2OS. However, no significant change was found in NRF2, ferroportin-1, and ferritin. Instead, Ferrostatin-1 restored the decreased GPX4 and increased NRF2, ferroportin-1, and ferritin levels. In addition, Z-VAD (a pan-caspase inhibitor), Necrosatin-1s (a RIPK1 inhibitor), and Ferrostatin-1 were capable of preventing Saos-2, COS31, and DOUG cells from RSL3-induced cell death at lethal doses. Such protection was undetected in U2OS. These data suggest that metabolic pathways controlling intracellular iron are crucial for NRF2\/GPX4-mediated ferroptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, we generated RNA-seq and LC-MS\/MS data to identify novel molecular targets governing the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis in osteosarcoma. Our ongoing work includes downstream molecular and functional assays following gene modifications in osteosarcoma cells (overexpression and knockout) and assessing metabolic vulnerabilities by targeting iron-mediated ferroptosis in xenografts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Osteosarcoma,Cell death,Iron,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Mutant KRAS in &#62;90% of PDAC cases promotes activation of the MAPK pathway, yet targeting the MAPK pathway clinically has failed to improve patient outcomes. SHP2 canonically promotes KRAS activation and is essential for PDAC development in mouse models. Because targeting MAPK is insufficient, yet SHP2 loss blocks PDAC development, we hypothesized SHP2 has both MAPK dependent and independent functions. Initial studies revealed that SHP2 inhibition with SHP099 in murine KPC [K8484: KRAS<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>, p53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup>, Pdx1<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup>] cells required concentrations exceeding 50 &#956;M to elicit a minimal ERK inhibition. This led us to predict that there may be a tumor suppressive mechanism of SHP2 inhibition that is KRAS\/MAPK independent. We utilized available RNAseq data (NCBI GEO: PRJNA558508) of PDAC MiaPaCa2 cells treated with the MEK inhibitor, Trametinib, or SHP099 to compare the direct effects of inhibition on transcriptional outcomes. We identified inositol phosphate signaling as a candidate target, whose downstream consequence is Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> flux. We measured IL-1&#946; induced Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> flux in a panel of human PDAC cells exposed to MEK or SHP2 inhibition. Trametinib treated cells showed no effect on Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> flux, however, SHP099 led to a drastic depletion of free Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> and response to stimulus. We then validated the Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> response to IL-1&#946; stimulus in Crispr-Cas9 SHP2-knockout K8484 cells. While we did not observe a difference in basal free calcium, we still found a reduction in response to IL-1&#946; stimulus. Because Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> is an important co-factor for mitochondrial metabolism, we then interrogated metabolic effects. We tested mitochondrial function using a Seahorse Mito-Stress test and found that while MEK inhibition failed to affect mitochondrial metabolism, SHP2 inhibition ablated it. A Glycolysis-Stress Test revealed that SHP2 inhibition led to glucose consumption primarily through anaerobic respiration. TMT-labeled phospho-proteomic analysis comparing SHP2KO and MEK inhibited K8484s revealed SHP2 dependent deficiencies in mitochondrial proteins, among others, involved in mitochondrial fission and lipid metabolism. Western diets have been shown to promote tumor progression in GEM models of PDAC, so we used KRAS<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup>, SHP2<sup>fl\/fl or wt.\/wt<\/sup>, Ptf1a<sup>Cre\/+<\/sup> (SKC and KC) mice to demonstrate that while diet-induced obesity affects KC tumor burden, the lack of SHP2 in SKCs prevents the diet associated discrepancy in tumor progression. Collectively, these data led us to conclude that while SHP2 has been studied as a contributor to KRAS signaling in PDAC, the outcomes of its role specifically on mitochondrial metabolism have yet to be appreciated or thoroughly investigated, opening the path for a new approach to its contribution to tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,KRAS,Proteomics,SHP2 (PTPN11),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>R.

In this study, we explored the intricacies of amino acid metabolism within UASCC, revealing an unexpected observation that distinguishes UASCC among all human cancers, having the highest methionine levels, driven by the overexpression of its transporter LAT1. Notably, LAT1 exhibits peak expression levels in UASCC, regulated at the transcriptional level by UASCC-specific promoters and enhancers, co-regulated by SCC master regulators TP63\/KLF5\/SREBF1.Surprisingly, our unbiased bioinformatic screen identifies EZH2 as a pivotal downstream target of the LAT1-methionine pathway, establishing a direct link between methionine metabolism and epigenomic reprogramming. This cascade emerges as crucial for the survival and proliferation of UASCC patient-derived tumor organoids. Furthermore, we find that LAT1 expression closely correlates with cellular sensitivity to inhibition of the LAT1-methionine-EZH2 axis.Significantly, the newly discovered LAT1-methionine-EZH2 cascade emerges as a promising target for intervention, with effective outcomes achievable through both pharmacological approaches and dietary interventions <i>in vivo<\/i>. In summary, this research unveils a novel mechanistic crosstalk connecting epigenomic reprogramming with methionine metabolism, revealing its biological significance in UASCC.

Switching between OXPHOS and glycolysis can promote tumor progression. The mechanisms governing oncogenic metabolic reprogramming are largely unknown, but recent data has suggested that Notch1 dysregulation in cancer cells can contribute to altered metabolic phenotypes. We hypothesized that Notch1 signaling supports metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We established a Notch1-knockout pNET cell line (BON-N1-KO) by deleting Notch1 at exon 3 in a pNET cell line (BON) using CRISPR\/Cas9. Proliferation over time was measured using a trypan blue exclusion test. Seahorse Glycolytic Rate Assay and Mitochondria Stress Test were used to measure the glycolytic and mitochondrial activities of cells. A glycolysis deprivation assay was employed to determine cell viability at varying glucose concentrations. Single end RNAseq was performed using the Illumina NGS platform, to a read depth of 50M.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Over time, pNET cells lacking Notch1 (BON-N1-KO) proliferated slower than wildtype (WT) cells (p=0.034). Compared to WT BON, the BON-N1-KO cells had reduced basal oxygen consumption rate (28.2 &#177; 1.3 vs. 40.7 &#177; 1.4; p=0.02, ATP production (21.9 &#177; 1.0 vs. 29.6 &#177; 0.98; p=0.04), and maximal respiration (39.4 &#177; 1.7 vs. 63.7 &#177; 2.1; p=0.004). BON-N1-KO cells also had a reduction in basal glycolysis, as measured by proton efflux rate, compared to WT (48.7 &#177; 2.6 vs. 57.7 &#177; 6.2; p=0.2). To further test metabolic reprogramming, WT and BON-N1-KO cells were starved of glucose (0mM), compared to normal glucose (17.5mM) and viability was measured over time. By day 5, the BON-N1-KO group had a viability of 0%, whereas 12.8% of WT cells were alive (p=0.038). To determine if Notch1 loss was associated with altered expression of established metabolic genes, we performed RNAseq. Differential gene expression analysis found that OXPHOS-related genes (<i>UQCC2, COX15, COX20<\/i>) and glycolysis-related genes (<i>Slc1a1, Slc2a4, Hk1, Hk2<\/i>) were significantly down-regulated in BON-N1-KO cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our study shows that Notch1 signaling facilitates metabolic reprogramming as a survival advantage in pNET cells.

FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically but its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored.

Additionally, we showed that FDX1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1\/2 pathway. Specifically, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, including cholesterol, triacylglycerides, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phospholipids and lysophospholipids.

Gal-1 may act through CD147, a potential Gal-1 receptor. CD147, also known as Basigin or extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in various cancer cells. An analysis utilizing the Gliovis database and encompassing 667 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients segregated based on median CD147 expression levels delineated cohorts with above-median (n=339) and below-median (n=328) CD147 expression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves unveiled a significant association between heightened CD147 expression and reduced overall survival (OS) in this patient population. Experimental approaches employing immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques on shGal-1 treated cell lysates and mouse brain samples exhibited decreased CD147 expression compared to respective controls. Additionally, immunocytochemical studies corroborated an augmented colocalization of Gal-1 and CD147, with a subsequent reduction in this association following shGal-1 treatment. Next, we used AC-73, a selective CD147 inhibitor, to determine the levels of CD147 and Gal-1. Treatment with 20&#956;M AC-73 and siRNA for CD147 showed reduced CD147 levels in GSC33 and GSC20 cells while maintaining unaltered Gal-1 expression. Inhibiting CD147 did not affect Gal-1 levels, further suggesting Gal-1 acts upstream. CD147 activates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and CD147 knockdown reduced MMP9 levels, elucidating a Gal-1-CD147-MMP9 pathway. Overall, Gal-1 appears to act upstream of CD147 to regulate MMP9, integrins, and other factors important for glioma progression. Further elucidation of these pathways will provide insights into glioma biology and potential therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Metabolism,MMP9,Galectin-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M.

Dietary fats contain various structures of fatty acids, each impacting cell lipid metabolism in unique ways. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to induce breast cancer cell death through ferroptosis. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids trigger ferroptosis have yet to be fully elucidated. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved lipid chaperones, facilitating the transport and utilization of fatty acids within cells. Notably, FABP5 is highly expressed in breast cancer, especially in the most aggressive form, triple-negative breast cancer. We hypothesized that FABP5 acts as a lipid sensor, mediating the ferroptosis induced by omega-3 fatty acids in triple-negative breast cancer cells. To test this, we created Fabp5 stable knockout cell lines in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231, two commonly used triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology. When treated with docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), these Fabp5-knockout cells exhibited reduced ferroptosis compared to their wild-type counterparts. Interestingly, blocking the surface protein CD36, either with inhibitors or antibodies, also reduced DPA-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, mutations in Fabp5 decreased maximal mitochondrial respiration in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting a crucial role for FABP5 in mediating oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during DPA-induced ferroptosis. Additionally, mice fed a high-fat diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids showed reduced tumor size and lung metastasis. Collectively, our data indicate that FABP5 is a key molecular sensor mediating oxygen consumption and ROS production, thus contributing to ferroptosis induced by omega-3 fatty acids in triple-negative breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Triple negative breast cancer,Ferroptosis,Fatty acid binding protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Solid evidence has now suggested that tumor growth is driven by subpopulations of tumor cells with less differentiated cell states, called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which govern therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Therefore, characterization of CSCs and their associated oncogenic signaling pathways is crucial to the development of more specific and sensitive HCC prognostic markers and to the design of novel targeted therapies against CSCs for HCC treatment. In search of the altered genes and pathways that are tightly associated with cancer stemness trait in HCC, we exploited the stemness and oncogenic dedifferentiation signature to mine the HCC dataset of the Cancer Genome Atlas. Phosphoinositide signaling was identified to be enriched and downregulated in the transcriptomes of HCC patients with strong stemness and dedifferentiated signature. Subsequent clinical correlation analysis found inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase B (INPP5B) to be the top downregulated gene in phosphoinositide signaling with its expression correlated with poor survival in HCC patients. Functional studies showed that INPP5B overexpression reversed the oncogenic and stemness properties while INPP5B knockout promoted tumor growth in immunocompetent mice. Subsequent RNA sequencing and molecular assays revealed INPP5B deregulation to be associated with lipid metabolism remodeling. Collectively, our results suggest an intricate relationship between phosphoinositide signaling and lipid metabolism through the regulation of INPP5B in HCC. The findings may open new avenue for future research aimed at devising targeted therapies to interfere with liver CSCs and enhance the prognosis of HCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Lipid metabolism,Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>L.
