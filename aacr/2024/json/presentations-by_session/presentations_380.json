Given their rarity and diversity, a fundamental understanding of the genomic underpinnings for many sarcoma subtypes is still lacking. Studies are often limited to one or several of the more common subtypes or a narrow evaluation of a broader sampling. We therefore report on one of the largest comprehensive omics evaluation in sarcomas to date, including whole exome sequencing (WES; n = 1170) and RNA-sequencing (n = 983) of tissues from 29 different sarcoma histologic subtypes collected at 13 institutions in the US as part of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). We identified recurrent somatic mutations previously identified in sarcomas (e.g. <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KIT<\/i>) as well as other cancer types (e.g. <i>BRCA1<\/i>). The burden of putatively pathogenic driver point mutations was higher in metastatic samples (median = 3) as compared to primary tumor samples (median = 2; p &#60; 0.001). We observed frequent copy number alterations including whole genome doubling more commonly in metastatic compared to primary tumors (23.4% vs. 16.9%; p = 0.0.25). Inspection of gene expression dimensionality reduction (UMAP) showed separation of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), leiomyosarcomas, myxoid liposarcomas, and well\/de-differentiated liposarcomas from the other histologies. Differential expression analysis for these four histologies with gene set enrichment analysis highlights the diversity of disease-specific pathways and need for sarcoma subtype-specific translational focus. Estimation of immune cell abundances based on RNA-seq followed by hierarchical clustering identified five immune subtypes. The subtypes ranged from low (clusters A, B) to high (clusters D, E) immune infiltration with higher abundance of T, B, Natural Killer (NK), and myeloid cells (FDR &#60; 0.01). Intermediate immune group C was predominantly composed by GISTs and marked by an enrichment for NK cells (FDR &#60; 0.01) compared to all groups except the immune &#8220;hot&#8221; group E; however, this immune group exhibited modest infiltration by other immune cell types. Notably, we observed significant differences in the overall survival of patients with sarcomas in immune enriched (C, D, E) compared to immune depleted clusters (A, B; p = 0.002). In summary, we report the genomic and expressional landscape of over 1000 sarcomas, representing one of the largest comprehensive profiling efforts in this disease. We identify the mutational and copy number variation landscape and observe differences between primary and metastatic samples. We highlight expression pathways that are enriched in histologic subtypes that cluster most distinctly from others, providing a subtype-specific roadmap for further translational efforts. Finally, we define immune enriched or depleted sarcoma subgroupings that carry a prognostic impact.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Whole exome sequencing,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Over the past decade, significant strides in comprehending the pathobiology of the disease and tumour dynamics have greatly enhanced treatment options, particularly in industrialized nations. Regrettably, SSA countries have witnessed only marginal, if any, improvements, with mortality rates surpassing incidence rates. Unfavourable outcome, early onset and high-grade tumours are predominant in SSA. Despite these challenging clinical phenotypes, there is currently a limited understanding of the primary molecular drivers, primarily due to a dearth of reliable data. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research conducted in, and pertinent to, the challenges of the disease in low-income countries (LICs), despite a rising incidence and higher mortality-to-incidence ratios. We thus established an international translational cancer research consortium in five distinct African countries. This initiative has contributed to the creation of a high-quality repository of biomaterials. Additionally, we have conducted whole exome sequencing on the initial 100 cases of breast cancer, comparing the molecular architecture of these tumors with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We examining and compared the clinical disease phenotypes between indigenous African women and Western patients. A higher proportion of grade III tumors was observed in African patients aged between 30 to 59 years as compared to other patients within the same age group. In comparative molecular analyses, we found a significantly elevated tumor mutational burden in African patients (median of &#62;15\/MB) in contrast to other populations within the TCGA (median ~ 0.7\/MB). Gene sets featuring co-occurring mutations, predicted to be associated with survival using the TCGA dataset, showed high mutation rates in the African cohort. Notably, co-occurring mutations between <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and genes linked to genomic instability, such as <i>BIRC6<\/i> (HR: 11.7, p = 2.7e-05), <i>KMT2C<\/i> (HR: 4.7, p = 4.01e-04), <i>NEB<\/i> (HR: 3.84, p = 0.48), and <i>PCLO<\/i> (HR: 4.9, p = 0.016), among others, strongly correlated with poor overall survival and were highly mutated within the African cohort. Interestingly, within the TCGA, patients with early breast cancer onset exhibit twice as many mutations in <i>KMT2C<\/i>, a gene known for its association with DNA damage repair, genomic instability, and showed an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibition. These initial findings suggest that breast cancer genomics in indigenous African populations may exhibit substantial differences, potentially warranting consideration for distinct therapeutic modalities for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Genomic instability,Therapeutic target,The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>S.

Although the clinical relevance of genomic and molecular subtypes of GAC has been demonstrated, differences in classification methods have made it difficult to use these findings in clinical applications. We aim to examine a consensus of genomic subtypes and correlate them with clinical outcomes.<br \/>Method: We collected genomic data from 2527 GAC tumors and divided the data into discovery (n = 1427) and validation sets (n = 1100). A cluster of clusters approach (COCA) was used to find consensus subtypes of gastric tumors. We constructed the GAC predictor of the integrated consensus subtype with 120 genes (GPICS120) and applied it to the validation data set in order to validate the clinical significance of the new subtypes. By analyzing genomic and proteomic data we evaluated each subtype's potential response rate to standard and experimental treatments such radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy and further validated their functional significance in cell line models.<br \/>Results: We identified 6 clinically and molecularly distinct genomic consensus subtypes (CGSs) by integrating 8 previously established genomic subtypes. CGS1 is characterized by worst prognosis, remarkably high stem cell characteristics, high IGF1 expression, and low genomic alterations. CGS2 showed canonical epithelial gene expression patterns. CGS3 and CGS4 are characterized by high copy number alterations and low immune activity. CGS5 has highest mutation burden and moderately elevated immune activity that is characteristics of MSI-high tumors. The majority of CGS6 tumors have extremely high methylation, high immune activity, and are EBV-positive. The most intriguing finding is that CGS1 is the most responsive to immunotherapy whereas CGS3 is significantly associated with benefit of chemoradiation therapy due to high basal level of ferroptosis. Furthermore, we showed that ferroptosis inducer statin sensitized radiation-resistant GAC cells to ionizing radiation, suggesting that statin can be used to enhance the efficacy of chemoradiation in GAC and it would warrant further investigation in preclinical models.<br \/>Conclusion: Consensus subtype is robust classification system and can serve as the basis for future clinical trials as well as pre-clinical research into targeted subtype-based therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Consensus subtypes,Clinical subtypes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Y.

Specifically, we identify four subgroups of ER+ disease (IC1, IC2, IC6, IC9) with a persistent risk of lethal distant relapse up to two decades after diagnosis, each with focal copy number drivers and two distinct subgroups of triple-negative disease (Curtis et al. Nature 2012; Rueda et al. Nature 2019). These findings nominate new therapeutic strategies, however, it is not known how mutational processes and genomic architecture differ across the ICs to sculpt the development and evolution of disease, nor how their microenvironments differ. To interrogate the genomic and immune landscape of breast cancer throughout the disease continuum, we established a meta-cohort of 2,873 breast tumors spanning pre-invasive (ductal carcinoma in situ), primary invasive, and metastatic breast cancer, including 1,865 with whole-genome sequencing, 1,738 with whole-transcriptome sequencing, and 730 with both modalities. We developed a fully containerized bioinformatic workflow to interrogate copy number alterations, complex classes of structural variation, and neoantigens. Analysis of this large clinically curated compendium identifies highly concordant mutational signatures and higher order genomic features in high-risk ER+ (IC1,2,6,9) and HER2+ (IC5) tumors, including distinct patterns of structural variation. In contrast, triple-negative tumors (predominantly IC10) were characterized by global genomic instability and tandem duplications, whilst a third group is largely genomically stable. These distinct genomic architectures were associated with specific tumor microenvironments. As expected, triple-negative tumors were immune-enriched. In contrast high-risk ER+ and HER2+ tumors demonstrated immune-depleted profiles, as compared to typical risk ER+ tumors. These microenvironment classifications were maintained from primary tumors to metastatic lesions, except triple-negative tumors that exhibited increased immune depletion during metastasis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that complex structural alterations established early in breast cancer contribute to immune evasion, and persist throughout the life history of the tumor through metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Breast cancer,Whole genome sequencing,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lise Mangiante<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kathleen Houlahan<sup><\/sup>, Cristina Sotomayor Vivas<sup><\/sup>, Alvina Adimoelja<sup><\/sup>, Seongyeol Park<sup><\/sup>, Aziz Khan<sup><\/sup>, Sophie Pribus<sup><\/sup>, Zhicheng Ma<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Caswell-Jin<sup><\/sup>, Christina Curtis<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c4180daf-4eaa-4eb5-a956-2240e474ebe3","ControlNumber":"4222","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Despite an overall decline in mortality, the Hispanic\/Latino (H\/L) population in the Los Angeles area exhibits mortality rates up to 20% higher than their Caucasian American counterparts, often with diagnoses at a younger age and advanced disease stages. Few studies have utilized substantial H\/L sample sizes and integrated comprehensive clinical and multi-omics data to conduct integrative translational analysis of reported genomic alterations and their implications for colorectal tumorigenesis.<br \/>Methods: We collected clinical, DNA, and RNA sequencing data from 36 primary CRC Tumor\/Normal (T\/N) samples and 82 primary CRC T\/N samples within the H\/L population in the Los Angeles area through the Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network and the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN), respectively. Additionally, we retrieved two CRC samples with spatial transcriptomic (ST) data from the 10xGenomics database. This data underwent Whole Exome and RNA sequencing analysis. Furthermore, we conducted global and local genomic ancestry analyses to establish correlations between self-ancestral identification and the five main superpopulations. ST data was analyzed using recently released bioinformatics tools. Clinical and genomic data were integrated.<br \/>Results: In these studies, distinct age-of-onset, Amerindian (AMR), and survival patterns were observed, with significant mutations identified in key genes, including APC, TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA. Cancer heterogeneity was evident, influenced by mutation type, microsatellite instability, subsite, and ethnicity. Ancestry analysis indicated genetic diversity, with a predominant AMR heritage and cases showcasing substantial European genetic proportions alongside AMR ancestry. Additionally, RNA sequencing has been conducted, with ongoing transcriptomic analysis in both studies, and the results are set for presentation at the annual meeting. The ST analysis generated initial maps, delineating diverse cellular populations and revealing the samples' distinct immunological and inflammatory signals.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study has delved into the molecular profiling of CRC tumors among H\/L patients, contributing essential insights into the DNA and RNA level characterization of CRC tumors and the multifaceted clinical and genomic heterogeneity within our aimed population. It also provides crucial insights into CRC tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. These findings serve as the cornerstone for forthcoming sample analyses within our PE-CGS project to potentially lead to the development of personalized treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Molecular profiling,Whole exome sequencing,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.

This is in part due to the fact that mtDNA has a limited ability to repair itself when it is damaged. Although a buildup of somatic mutations in mtDNA has been associated with increased cancer risk, the role of mtDNA alterations in malignant transformation of lung adenocarcinoma has not been addressed. Therefore, a clear understanding of changes in mtDNA along the pathway of lung tumorigenesis is critical for identifying molecular biomarkers related to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Like all solid tumors, lung adenocarcinoma is thought to be initiated and to progress through a series of genetic alterations, including changes in mtDNA. Lungs resected for primary adenocarcinomas often harbor minute discrete foci of cytologically atypical pneumocyte proliferations designated as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). Evidence suggests that AAH represents an initial step in the progression to adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and ultimately fully invasive adenocarcinoma (ADA). In this study we used a unique cohort of 52 patients with matched specimens (n=133) representing different steps of disease progression (AAH, AIS, and MIA) coupled with novel ultra-deep mitochondrial sequencing (mtDNA-Seq) method to assess the mtDNA mutational landscape throughout the continuum of lung adenocarcinoma development. Utilizing a custom bioinformatics workflow, somatic mutations were detected in a subset of the premalignant non-invasive lesions, with overall higher mutational load observed in MIA and ACA specimens. Additionally, large degree of inter-patient heterogeneity were observed for mtDNA copy numbers in conjunction with the clonal histological evolution of pulmonary neoplasia. Moreover, an appreciable number of coding and non-coding mutations from regulatory regions of the mtDNA were detectable in the precursor AAH lesions and the continuum of LUAD progression. Majority of shared mutations showed heteroplasmic transition with increase in fractional abundance in ADA, compared to the AHH lesions, thereby indicating spatial clonal expansion as they progressed histologically. Here we report the first comprehensive characterization of mitochondrial mutational landscape in dynamic evolution of lung adenocarcinoma, and provide insight into the heterogeneity of clonal events associated with the progression from noninvasive to malignant disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Malignant progression,Mitochondria DNA,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Many studies have highlighted how mutagens from cigarette smoke promote specific mutations such as G12 mutations in <i>KRAS<\/i>, contributing to clonal evolution that leads to lung cancer. Despite the indisputable correlation between smoking and lung cancer, people who have never smoked account for the 7<sup>th<\/sup> leading cause of cancer mortality. Given the differences in predominant exposures, we hypothesize that the clonal evolution between people with and without smoking histories are markedly different. Therefore, we analyzed lung samples from people with different cigarette smoking exposure to elucidate smoking&#8217;s effect on the somatic mutational landscape in the progression to lung cancer. To observe somatic mutations subjected to different exposures of smoking, we used a rare-mutation detection technique called DuplexSeq to analyze somatic variants from 200+ lung samples. We acquired DNA from cells from bronchoscopy brushings and lung punches of histologically normal tissue from people with and without lung cancer and who currently, formerly, or never smoked cigarettes. Through collaborations, we characterized mutations using bioinformatic pipelines, various databases, and statistical methods. In samples from people who smoke, we observe an enhancement of mutations with higher variant allele frequencies and pervasive positive selection acting on mutations in many cancer-associated genes. From our bronchoscopy brushings, <i>NOTCH1<\/i> mutations show the most definitive increase of protein-altering variants, while <i>NF1<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i> show a predominance of driver mutation in lung punches. Unexpectedly, people without lung cancer who never smoked had a notable presence of pathogenic mutations in <i>PTEN<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA.<\/i> Furthermore, multiple punches from the same individual highlight how expansions of mutations have stronger similarity within an individual than across individuals regardless of smoking status. This association points to the importance of the inherent lung microenvironment in influencing the mutational landscapes in lung cancer progression. Altogether, these results show how smoking increases the oncogenicity of observable mutations in the lung but does not preclude the presence of oncogenic clones, emphasizing the value of precision diagnoses and prevention. Ongoing research will be centered around functional assays to determine the impact of observed mutations on tissue function and longitudinal studies using mutational landscapes as a proxy for lung cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Mutations,Clonal evolution,Smoking,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>E.
