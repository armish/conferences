This paradigm shift underscores the intricate interplay between the nervous system and cancer cells, revealing a complex network of interactions that promote cancer growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. This panel highlights the emerging role of both peripheral and central nervous systems in the regulation of cancer, delineating how neurons, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophic factors contribute to the tumor microenvironment and influence cancer cell behavior. Specifically, we discuss the mechanisms through which neuronal signaling facilitates cancer progression, including the modulation of cancer cell proliferation, evasion of apoptotic pathways, and enhancement of metastatic potential. Moreover, we explore the burgeoning field of cancer neuroimmunology, which integrates the neuroinflammatory response and immune system modulation in the tumor milieu, providing insights into how nervous system-immune interactions can either support or inhibit cancer progression. The elucidation of these mechanisms opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting neuronal signaling pathways. We examine current and potential therapeutic strategies that leverage this understanding, including the use of neuroprotective agents, neurotransmitter blockers, and neuromodulation techniques to disrupt cancer-neuronal signaling interactions. By unraveling the role of neuronal signaling in cancer, we are not only redefining the biological underpinnings of cancer but also unlocking novel therapeutic paradigms with the potential to significantly impact patient outcomes. This panel posits neuronal signaling as a new hallmark of cancer, advocating for a broader, integrative approach to cancer research and treatment that encompasses the neurobiological axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moran Amit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

A cure remains undiscovered. Therapy effectiveness varies by patient and tumor type and can have negative side effects. The immune system, designed to eliminate abnormal cells, including cancer cells, is often impaired. For example, in skin cancer, extended activation of certain receptors can exhaust immune cells, reducing their cancer-fighting ability. Our lab found that cancer cells trigger nociceptor neurons in tumors, leading to neuropeptide release that exhausts CD8+ T cells. To explore their interactions, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on tumor-related sensory neurons, leukocytes, and cancer cells. We found a distinct group of tumor-related neurons expressingATF3, Sox10, Sprr1a, and galanin. In our study, mice with injury-resistant nociceptor neurons (NaV1.8&#916;ATF3) developed smaller melanoma tumors and had reduced galanin levels compared to controls. These mice also showed stronger anti-tumor immune responses, especially in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Restoring galanin in mice with ATF3-deficient nociceptor neurons resulted in tumor growth similar to normal mice. We observed that galanin increases exhaustion, reduces the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T-cells, and leads the cells to a state of immunoparalysis. Higher galanin levels in melanoma patients were linked to worse outcomes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing from melanoma patients, we also found that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with the galanin receptor 1(GALR1) were more exhausted than those without it. In summary, ATF3-modifiedtumor-related sensory neurons that release galanin can weaken anti-tumor immunity, suggesting cancer cells may use this aspect of neuro-immunity to promote tumor growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tuany Eichwald<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohammad Balood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maryam Ahmadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karine Roversi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dylan Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Mandl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moutih Rafei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nader Ghasemlou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paola Vermeer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moran Amit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sébastien Talbot<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This process involves the aberrant activation or suppression of neuronal signals that can significantly influence cancer cell behavior, including proliferation, migration, and resistance to therapies. The concept of repurposing drugs originally designed to target the nervous system for use in clinical oncology offers a promising therapeutic strategy, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment. By intercepting neuronal pathways that cancer cells exploit for their growth and survival, these drugs could modulate the tumor microenvironment, enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies, and potentially reverse drug resistance mechanisms. Moreover, targeting neuronal signaling in cancer could lead to improvements in patients' functional outcomes, mitigating cancer-related neurological deficits and improving quality of life. Importantly, this approach may also have profound implications for survival outcomes, as modulating the neuro-cancer interface could slow tumor progression and reduce metastatic spread. The repurposing of neuroactive drugs for cancer treatment thus opens a new avenue for personalized medicine, where the intricacies of neuronal reprogramming are leveraged to tailor therapy, improve response rates, and ultimately, enhance patient survival and well-being.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Resistance,Head and neck cancers,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Moran Amit<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
