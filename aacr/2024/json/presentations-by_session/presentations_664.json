De-escalation approaches are being studied as benefits of chemotherapy in the HER2-enriched subset of EBC, but they have been inconclusive thus far. Preclinical studies suggest synergistic effect of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and HER2-directed therapy. This study hypothesizes that biologically directed HER-2 targeted therapy with Trastuzumab (T) and Pertuzumab (P) together with ICB (Durvalumab, D) will obviate the need of chemotherapy in HER2-enriched EBC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this single arm, open-label phase II study, previously untreated, stage I-III, ER\/PR negative, HER2-enriched breast cancer (BluePrint&#174;, Agendia) patients were treated with D (1120mg IV, q3w), T (8mg\/kg IV loading dose, 6 mg\/kg IV q3w), and P (840 mg IV loading dose, 420 mg IV q3w) for 6 cycles. Response was assessed at end of 6 cycles with breast MRI and possible biopsy if residual disease was present. Responders (MRI and\/or biopsy negative for residual cancer) proceeded to surgery, while patients with biopsy-proven residual disease were offered salvage standard chemotherapy (TCHP) before surgery. Primary end-point was pathological response rate defined as residual cancer burden (RCB)-0 and RCB-1. Patients who achieved RCB 0\/1 received adjuvant DTP for 1 year.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 51 patients were screened; 39 patients have been enrolled and received at least one cycle of treatment. Of these, 35 patients are evaluable for pathologic response, and 2 patients are still receiving treatment. One patient died of unrelated myocardial infarction, and one patient was lost to follow-up. The median age was 55 years (range 29-85). Thirty-one (79.5%) patients were white; 4 (10.3%) African American, and 4 (10.3%) Asian. Twenty-nine (74.3%) patients had &#62;=T2 tumors; 21 (53.8%) patients had N1\/N2\/N3 disease. Six patients (15.3%) had biopsy-proven residual disease after DTP therapy, and they received salvage standard neoadjuvant TCHP chemotherapy. The combination was well tolerated; 5 (18.8%) patients had G3-4 adverse events. Twenty-seven of thirty-five patients (77.1%) had pathologic RCB 0\/1 (RCB0, 20\/35; RCB1 7\/35), of whom only 3 patients had received salvage chemotherapy. Correlative studies, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, immune-related gene signatures and PD-L1 expression are underway.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Chemotherapy-free neoadjuvant regimen with DTP in HER2-enriched EBC showed high pathologic response rates comparable to that with chemotherapy. This DTP regimen may provide an effective, relatively non-toxic, and biologically driven alternative to standard of care chemotherapy in this HER2-enriched subset of EBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HER2,Immunotherapy,Neoadjuvant treatment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>J.

To address this, we performed a multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled, biomarker-stratified phase 1 trial in patients with ICB-na&#239;ve unresectable or metastatic melanoma using SER-401, a bacterial consortia enriched for Firmicutes spores and Ruminococcaceae.<br \/>Methods: MCGRAW was a multi-center, randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled phase 1b study in patients with advanced melanoma. Patients were randomized 2:1 to the SER-401 active or placebo arm, respectively, and stratified by baseline stool Ruminococcaceae abundance. Patients received an oral vancomycin (vanco) preparative regimen+SER-401 (vanco+SER-401 arm), versus placebo antibiotic+placebo (Placebo arm), followed by nivolumab. Stool, blood and tumor samples were collected at baseline and on treatment. The primary endpoint was safety, with additional secondary endpoints (SER-401 microbiome engraftment, overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and other translational endpoints). The study was not powered for comparison between arms.<br \/>Results: 14 patients were randomized (n=8 vanco+SER-401, n=6 placebo). In the vanco+SER-401 arm, ORR was 25.0% and DCR was 37.5%, with no Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE); in the placebo arm, ORR was 66.7% and DCR was 83.3%, with 1 (17%) TRAE. Notably, pre-conditioning with vanco was associated with significant shift in the microbiome taxonomic composition, with depletion of target families such as Ruminococcaceae (p=0.008, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and other spore-formers, followed by their recovery post dosing with SER-401. There was a significant increase in multiple ICB-resistance associated pathways (e.g. butyrate synthesis, p&#60;0.0001), and a decrease in response-associated pathways after vanco preconditioning; these changes did normalize by nivolumab initiation. There was corresponding increase in systemic proteomic markers of inflammation after vanco, which also normalized by first dose of immunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: This first-of-its-kind, placebo-controlled, randomized biomarker-driven microbiome modulation trial demonstrated that SER-401 and anti-PD1 are a safe combination in melanoma patients. The study was limited by poor accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, important insights were gained via translational analyses, suggesting that antibiotic preconditioning and interventional drug dosing regimens should be carefully considered when designing such trials. Additional placebo-controlled biomarker-driven microbiome trials are needed in this age of precision medicine.

Perioperative strategies of PD1 inhibitor combinations have shown promise in many malignancies. The A021501 trial established modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) as a reference neoadjuvant regimen for patients (pts) with borderline resectable pancreas cancer (BRPC). Here, we present clinical and pathologic results from a phase 1\/2 investigator-initiated study investigating the safety and efficacy of mFFX and Nivolumab in pts with BRPC.<br \/>Methods: Pts with ECOG PS 0-1 and BRPC confirmed by qualified surgeons were treated with a maximum of 6 cycles of mFFX (oxaliplatin 85 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, irinotecan 150 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, leucovorin 400 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and infusional 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> over 46 hours) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle and Nivolumab (480 mg Iv q 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was safety (including post-operative fistula formation) and pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). RNA sequencing was performed on 16 post-treatment resected tumors, 5 patient-matched diagnostic pre-treatment biopsies, and 9 resected tumors from non-trial patients treated with mFFX alone.<br \/>Results: Overall, 28 pts (median age 68, M: 16, F, 12) were enrolled. 26 (93%) pts completed at least 3 cycles of mFFX and Nivo and 24 (86%) pts underwent surgery (23 R0\/1R1). There were no grade 2 post-operative fistulas observed and the rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 55% with all being related to mFFX and none attributed to nivolumab. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the median PFS was 34.8 months, and the median OS was 35.1 months. Among pts who underwent pancreatectomy, the 18-month OS rate was 90%. There were 2 pathologic complete responses and 2 near complete responses. Compared to pre-treatment biopsies, RNA sequencing from resected specimens revealed higher CD8 (P=0.018) and Granzyme A (P=0.024) expression. In patients with pathologically node negative disease (n=11), elevated Granzyme A expression was associated with significantly improved PFS (P=0.046). Adenosine-related gene expression increased in 50% (n=8) of post-treatment samples (P&#60;0.022) and correlated with expression of adenosine-generating CD73 (P=0.008).<br \/>Conclusions: Neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX and Nivolumab was associated with favorable rates of R0 resection, PFS and OS relative to historical data in patients with BRPC in this pilot trial. The addition of Nivolumab did not increase rates of G3 AE&#8217;s and there were no unexpected safety signals. The addition of Nivolumab to neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX may benefit some patients by enhancing cytolytic T cell function and decreasing immunosuppressive adenosine. This is the first trial reported with a PD1 inhibitor in neoadjuvant pancreas cancer and a Phase II trial is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Nivolumab,Adenosine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>Z.

However, combination therapies comprising pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, tiragolumab, or lenvatinib have not demonstrated superior efficacy in this patient group. This study explored the effectiveness of the novel combination of pembrolizumab and necitumumab as first-line therapy in patients having advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher.<br \/>Methods: Patients with untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher received pembrolizumab and necitumumab every 3 weeks up to 35 cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. The sample size was calculated using 80% power with a one-sided alpha error of 10%, a threshold ORR of 39.0%, and an expected ORR of 54.8%.<br \/>Results: From December 2020 to March 2023, 50 patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics were as follows: male\/female patients: 38\/12; median age: 72 years (range: 51-90 years); histology, adenocarcinoma\/squamous cell carcinoma\/other: 35\/15\/5; and PS, 0\/1: 20\/30. At the time of the primary analysis, the ORR was 76.0% (95% CI: 61.9%-86.9%), with 2.0%, 74.0%, 10.0%, and 8.0% of the patients showing complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. The median PFS was 15.7 months (95% CI, 10.3 to not reached) and the median OS was not reached. Common toxicities included rash (86%) and hypomagnesemia (60%). Grade 3 interstitial lung disease was noted in 5 patients (10%) and grade 5 cardiac arrest in 1 patient (2%).<br \/>Conclusion: Combination therapy comprising pembrolizumab and necitumumab demonstrated a 76.0% ORR, meeting the primary endpoint, with manageable toxicities. The regimen showed promising clinical activity in patients with NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression, warranting further investigation.

However, a significant proportion of patients with TLS-positive tumors do not respond to ICI when used as a single agent and may therefore benefit from combination therapy. The multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, deplete regulatory T cells, an immune population associated with resistance to ICI in TLS-positive tumors. We report the results of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab combined with regorafenib in patients with mTLS-positive advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: &#8216;Regomune&#8217; is an open-label, multicenter phase II study assessing the combination of avelumab (10mg\/kg IV every 14 days) with regorafenib (160 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle) in patients with advanced mTLS-positive solid tumors. The mTLS status was centrally assessed as previously described (Vanhersecke et al Nature Cancer 2021). All patients had confirmed progressive disease at inclusion, based on a central review of imaging. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 6-month non-progression rate using RECIST v1.1 based on blinded central review. 29 assessable patients were deemed necessary, and to meet the primary endpoint, at least 8 patients needed to be progression-free at 6 months.<br \/>Results: Between January 2021 and July 2022, 132 patients (5 centers) underwent mTLS screening. Of these, 55 (41.7%) were identified as mTLS+, and 38 were included in the study. The top five histological subtypes were MSS colorectal cancer (15.8%), sarcoma (13.1%), oesogastric (10.5%), biliary tract (7.9%), and pancreatic cancer (7.9%). The most frequent grade 3\/4 adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (23.7%), maculo-papular rash (18.4%), fatigue, and oral mucositis (7.9% each). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Of the 34 patients assessed for efficacy, 16 (47%) showed tumor shrinkage, with 9 achieving a partial response (26.7%) and 7 having stable disease (20.6%). The median duration of response was 6 months. Twelve patients (comprising various tumor types including MSS colorectal cancer, small bowel carcinomas, biliary tract cancer, sarcomas, thyroid and gynecological tumors.) were progression-free at 6 months, marking the study&#8217;s primary endpoint achievement. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.6 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of tumor tissues, and comprehensive plasma proteomics analysis have collectively uncovered critical biomarkers that significantly determine both sensitivity and resistance to treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first histology-agnostic clinical trial employing mTLS as a biomarker for patient selection for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen. Durable responses were recorded, even in cases typically resistant to immunotherapy, confirming the predictive value of mTLS.<br \/>Trial Registration NCT03475953","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,B cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":null,"AllowAttendeeRating":null,"AttendeeRatingAvg":null,"AttendeeRatingCount":null,"AuthorBlock":"<b>A.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) can upregulate PD-L1 expression and promote immune-mediated response, which may increase the efficacy of anti&#8210;PD-(L)1&#8210;based therapies. The randomized, double-blind (and in-house blinding), phase 3 KEYLYNK-008 study (NCT03976362) evaluated addition of ola (PARPi) as maintenance therapy for metastatic sqNSCLC with SD or CR\/PR after 1L pembro + chemo.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods:<\/b> Eligible patients (pts) aged &#8805;18 y had previously untreated stage IV NSCLC, confirmed squamous histology, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and ECOG PS 0-1. Pts with CR, PR, or SD after 4 cycles of Q3W induction therapy with pembro 200 mg, carboplatin AUC 6, and paclitaxel 200 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> were randomized 1:1 to ola 300 mg BID or placebo (pbo), both given with &#8804;31 cycles of pembro 200 mg Q3W. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PD-L1 TPS (&#60;50% vs &#8805;50%), and response to induction treatment (CR\/PR vs SD). Primary endpoints were PFS (RECIST v1.1 by BICR) and OS. Final PFS testing occurred at interim analysis (IA) 2 (data cutoff, Feb 23, 2023); other endpoints were assessed at IA3 (data cutoff, Sep 21, 2023). Efficacy boundaries based on actual observed events were 1-sided <i>P<\/i> = 0.003202 for PFS (IA2) and <i>P<\/i> = 0.014647 for OS (IA3).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 851 pts who received induction treatment, 591 were randomized to pembro + ola (n = 296) or pembro + pbo (n = 295). Median PFS (95% CI) was 8.3 (6.7-9.7) mo for pembro + ola and 5.4 (4.1-5.6) mo for pembro + pbo (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.93; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0040). 24-mo PFS rates (95% CI) were 27.5% (21.9%-33.4%) and 21.1% (16.1%-26.5%), respectively. Median follow-up to IA3 was 33.4 (19.0-46.8) mo. Median (95% CI) OS was 19.1 (15.9-22.2) mo for pembro + ola and 18.6 (16.0-21.6) mo for pembro + pbo (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.83-1.24; <i>P<\/i> = 0.5481). 24-mo OS rates (95% CI) were 40.9% (35.1%-46.5%) vs 41.2% (35.4%-46.8%). ORR (95% CI) was 25.0% (20.2%-30.3%) for pembro + ola vs 15.3% (11.3%-19.9%) for pembro + pbo. Median DOR (range) was 21.0 (2.1 to 42.8+) mo vs 26.0 (1.2+ to 39.6+) mo. 225\/294 pts (76.5%; grade 3-5, 29.6%) had treatment-related AEs in the pembro + ola arm and 190\/292 (65.1%; grade 3-5, 12.7%) in pembro + pbo arm. 2 pts (pneumonitis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) in the pembro + ola arm and 1 (thrombocytopenia) in the pembro + pbo arm died due to treatment-related AEs.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>In KEYLYNK-008, the addition of ola to pembro as maintenance therapy after 1L pembro + chemo for metastatic sqNSCLC numerically prolonged PFS vs pembro + pbo, but neither PFS nor OS met the prespecified statistical significance boundary.

While apoptosis is mainly immunologically silent, necroptosis is immunogenic and can more efficiently initiate an adaptive immune response that could be augmented by immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI).<br \/>Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins are key gatekeepers of how a cell dies, and frequently overexpressed in cancer. ASTX660 (tolinapant) is a triple blocker of cIAP1\/2 and XIAP, sensitizing cancer cells to death ligands through ripoptosome formation, activating &#8216;danger&#8217; co-stimulatory signals and dendritic cell (DC) maturation required to prime a potent antitumor response.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> We assessed the safety, pharmacodynamic (PD), and clinical activity of 7 days of oral ASTX660 given prior to pembrolizumab 200 mg (Q3W), in patients (pts) refractory to standard therapy. TITE-CRM was used to explore ASTX660 doses 90-180 mg. Serial paired blood and tumor samples were analyzed to interrogate the effect of ASTX660 on cell death, tumor microenvironment and host immune system.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> 22 pts have been enrolled; median age 55 years (range 38-81); male:female 5:17; all ECOG PS &#61603;1; median 4.5 prior therapies. Tumor types included breast, head and neck (HN), hepatocellular, cervical, pancreatic and cholangiocarcinoma.<br \/>Combination ASTX660-pembrolizumab is currently recruiting at highest dose 180 mg without any dose limiting toxicities (DLT) seen within the 6-week DLT observation period. Most common adverse events (AE) were G1-2 rash, nausea, and asymptomatic increases in amylase, lipase and transaminases; all reversible and easily manageable.<br \/>Four iRECIST confirmed partial responses were seen in 10 efficacy evaluable pts treated at biologically active dose levels 120 and 150 mg (Overall response rate 40%), including 2 pts with ER+ HER2- breast cancer, 1 cervical adenocarcinoma pt (exceptional response following initial pseudoprogression) and a HN cancer pt refractory to ICI monotherapy. 3\/4 responders are ongoing. Efficacy data from pts treated at highest dose level 180 mg is pending.<br \/>FACS of paired blood samples from responders shows a significant rise in %CD57+\/CD3+ cytotoxic effector T cells [mean 11.90% (pre-) vs 14.25% (post-ASTX660); p=.0176]. These changes were not seen in the non-responders group. Full PD from paired blood and tumour sampling will be shared at the meeting.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion:<\/u><\/b> ASTX660-pembrolizumab is is well-tolerated with durable antitumor responses in pts with immunologically cold tumors, providing the first clinical proof-of-concept of immunogenic cell death induction leading to effective adaptive immune response when combined with ICI.
