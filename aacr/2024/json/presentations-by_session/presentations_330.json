MHC-I normally acts as a marker of &#8220;self&#8221; and cells that lack MHC-I are recognized and killed by innate immunity. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of innate immune evasion in tumors with MHC-I antigen presentation defects.<br \/>Methods: Integrating functional genomics, big data, and artificial intelligence, we discovered that IGSF8 expressed on cancer cells is an evolutionarily conserved innate immune checkpoint. IGSF8 is normally expressed in neuronal tissues and is not essential <i>in vitro<\/i> or <i>in vivo<\/i>. However, knockout of IGSF8 in B16-F10 melanoma cell line decreased tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. For clinical relevance of IGSF8 in tumor immunity, we analyzed genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed an antibody (GV20-0251) against IGSF8 and tested its function to induce immune cell killing of cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and inhibit tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: IGSF8 has receptors on both natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DC) to strongly suppress NK cytotoxicity and antigen presentation. In the TCGA tumor profiles, IGSF8 has highest mRNA expression in melanoma and is significantly overexpressed in many cancer types. IGSF8 also shows frequent copy number amplifications. In addition, IGSF8 expression is associated with low antigen presentation, low immune infiltration, and worse overall survival in patients with low MHC class I expression. Immunohistochemistry staining of various cancers showed that IGSF8 expression was primarily observed in malignant cells with low MHC-I. We developed a cross-species reactive antibody against IGSF8 (GV20-0251) which blocks IGSF8 interaction with NK and DC. Flow cytometry of the tumor infiltrating CD45+ cells revealed that IGSF8 inhibition significantly increased NK and dendritic cell infiltration. GV20-0251 enhances NK killing of cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and increases antigen presentation, NK-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell signaling <i>in vivo<\/i>. In multiple syngeneic tumor models (B16-F10, CT26, LLC, 4T1 and EMT6), anti-IGSF8 shows single-agent efficacy and is synergistic with anti-PD1 in controlling tumor growth.<br \/>Conclusions: IGSF8 is a novel innate immune checkpoint and cancer immunotherapy target. A phase 1 study is ongoing to explore the IGSF8 inhibitor GV20-0251 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT05669430).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Antibody,Natural killer cells,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>X.

Here, we present the first preclinical disclosure of BMS-986442 (AGEN1777), a novel and fully human Fc-enhanced bispecific antibody against TIGIT and CD96 co-receptor, that demonstrates superior pharmacological activity compared to conventional TIGIT monospecific antibodies (mAbs).<br \/>Gene expression of TIGIT, CD96, and the co-stimulatory counter-receptor CD226 in tumor samples from patients with cancer was identified using bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing. To target this interaction, Fc-engineered knob-in-hole bispecific antibodies against TIGIT and CD96 were developed and affinity optimized to achieve potent and complete blockade of TIGIT and CD96 ligand interactions. BMS-986442 and corresponding monospecific anti-TIGIT and anti-CD96 monoclonal antibodies were evaluated with or without anti-PD-1 in a variety of human T and NK cell stimulation assays. Mouse surrogate TIGIT\/CD96 bispecific antibodies were developed and evaluated as monotherapy or together with anti-PD-1 in colorectal CT26 and breast orthotopic 4T1 tumor bearing mice.<br \/>In CT26 and 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models, the Fc-enhanced TIGIT\/CD96 bispecific antibody demonstrated superior tumor control compared to either anti-TIGIT, anti-CD96, or the combination of anti-TIGIT and anti-CD96 mAbs. Tumor control was dependent on co-engaging activating Fc&#947; receptors, as an Fc-silent bispecific antibody lacked anti-tumor activity. In the tumor microenvironment, efficacy was associated with increased frequency of CD226+ effector and TCF-1+ GrzB- memory precursor CD8 T cells, increased frequency and activation of cytotoxic NK cells, and increased activation of professional APCs, including B cells, MHC Class II monocytes, and dendritic cells as determined by expression of CD40, CD83, and CD86. In primary human <i>in vitro<\/i> assays, BMS-986442 potently enhanced T cell responsiveness and activation compared with conventional anti-TIGIT mAbs alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 (nivolumab). Lastly, BMS-986442 promoted superior NK cell activation in tumor co-culture assays.<br \/>In conclusion, BMS-986442 demonstrated a differentiated Fc&#947;R-dependent mechanism-of-action to enhance innate and adaptive immune responses compared with anti-TIGIT or anti-CD96 mAbs. BMS-986442 is currently advancing in phase I clinical studies in patients with advanced solid cancers (NCT05543629).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,Cancer immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"R.

PMN-MDSCs are mostly immature granulocytes but coexist with mature neutrophils, complicating their precise targeting. While PMN-MDSCs highly express CXCR4, recent clinical trials suggest that CXCR4 antagonists may provide limited additive efficacy to PD-1 blockade. This study explored the efficacy of a secreted CXCR4 partial agonist, trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2), in the context of anti-PD-1 refractory gastric cancer.<br \/>Methods: We fused mouse TFF2 with murine serum albumin to generate a novel TFF2-MSA peptide with extended half-life, and evaluated its therapeutic effects with or without anti-PD-1 antibody. As histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is expressed in immature neutrophils, we used the HDC-GFP transgene to track PMN-MDSC <i>in vivo<\/i>. The HDC-GFP mice received subcutaneous or orthotopic implantation of murine syngeneic gastric cancer cells and subsequent treatments. Additionally, human blood was assessed for both serum TFF2 and immune profiles.<br \/>Results: The combination of TFF2-MSA plus anti-PD-1 antibody displayed remarkable synergy, boosting intratumoral cytotoxic CD8 T cells by 50-fold, leading to tumor regression or eradication, 80% reduction of distant metastasis and 2-fold extension of mouse survival. The immunosuppressive HDC-GFP<sup>+ <\/sup>PMN-MDSCs expressed the highest level of CXCR4 among immune cells, and TFF2-MSA treatment systematically reduced HDC-GFP<sup>+<\/sup> PMN-MDSCs in the tumor, blood, spleen and their myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. In contrast, CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 in combination with anti-PD-1 failed to restrict tumor growth or PMN-MDSCs. Further single-cell RNA-seq and functional assays revealed that combination of TFF2-MSA plus anti-PD-1 induced a skewing of remaining tumor HDC-GFP<sup>+<\/sup>PMN-MDSC compositions from highly immature CD300ld<sup>+<\/sup> subsets to less immature subsets expressing interferon-stimulated genes, accompanied by reduced immunosuppression and increased antigen presentation functions. Rather than local reprogramming, this compositional shift stemmed from an IRF1-driven interferon response in splenic HDC-GFP<sup>+ <\/sup>PMN-MDSCs.

Therefore, depletion of TAM has been one of the main strategies to break the ceiling of efficacy in cancer treatment. However, to date, TAM depletion strategies have not been successful in clinical trials<sup>1<\/sup>. Here, we introduce an approach to target TAM by employing Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO), a class A scavenger receptor, as a novel immune checkpoint. Previously, we showed MARCO to be the most upregulated mRNA in murine and human dendritic cells following their uptake of dead tumor cells (TP-DC)<sup>2<\/sup>. We also showed ex vivo treatment of TP-DC with anti-MARCO mAb (ED31) led to enhanced anti-tumor responses in vivo<sup>3,4<\/sup>. The aim of this current study was to explore whether targeting MARCO using ED31 could improve the efficacy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in murine models of melanoma. In C57BL\/6 mice with B16F10 tumors, adding ED31 to anti-CTLA4 mAb (&#945;CTLA4) resulted in enhanced tumor regression and longer survival (p=0.001, p&#60;0.05 vs &#945;CTLA4 monotherapy; p&#60;0.05, p&#60;0.01 vs ED31 monotherapy, respectively). To explore the immune mechanism of ED31 with &#945;CTLA4, we focused on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by flow cytometry. TME immune-profiling consistently revealed that one time treatment with this combination resulted in a rapid increase in the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) including CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T (2.8-fold) and CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells (2.9-fold), NK cells (2.5-fold), activated CD11c<sup>+<\/sup>DC (2.2-fold) and F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>M&#966; (2.5-fold), compared to &#945;CTLA4 monotherapy (all with p&#60;0.0001; vs &#945;CTLA4 monotherapy, vs ED31 monotherapy, vs control, respectively). As measured by chemokine production using murine bone marrow-derived, in vitro M-CSF induced M&#966; phenotypes (M1: polarized by IFN&#947; and LPS, M2: polarized by IL4, TAM-like M&#966;: polarized by a supernatant from B16F10 cell line culture), ED31 exposure switched the pattern of chemokine productions from M2 and TAM-like M&#966; into an M1 pattern. In vivo depletion of each immune cell type had a diminishing effect on the treatment efficacy (p&#60;0.001 for CD8 depletion, p=0.01 for CD4<sup> <\/sup>depletion, p&#60;0.01 for NK1.1 depletion). However, M&#966; depletion had a more profound impact by completely abrogating the anti-tumor efficacy and the associated survival benefit, in addition to completely reversing the increase in TIL infiltration and canceling the increase of M1 chemokines in vivo (all with p&#60;0.05 vs M&#966; depletion). These preclinical data support the proof-of-concept that a combination strategy of targeting MARCO along with &#945;CTLA4 can lead to enhanced anti-tumor responses through utilizing TAMs rather than their depletion. <sup>1<\/sup> Immunity 2023;56:2188. <sup>2<\/sup> J Immunol 2003;171:2879. <sup>3<\/sup> Cancer Immunol Immunother 2010;59:875. <sup>4<\/sup> PLoS One 2013;8:e67795.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor associated macrophages,Immune checkpoint,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

Strategies to inhibit macrophage accumulation to suppress tumor growth by blocking their recruitment from circulation have been only partially effective, leading to the identification of roles in tumor progression for tissue resident macrophages that are seeded during embryonic development. We examined the origins of lung tumor associated macrophages using lineage tracing, flow cytometry, and single cell sequencing. By comparing gene expression profiles of resident F4\/80hi Lyve1+ Ly6C- macrophages and Ly6C+ F4\/80lo CCR2+ recruited macrophages in subcutaneous, lung, central nervous and renal normal and tumor tissues, we identified generic tissue resident macrophage and recruited macrophage transcriptomic signatures, revealing that resident macrophages are characterized by signatures of Myc driven proliferation, fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and immune suppression, while recruited macrophages are characterized by signature of inflammation and immune stimulation. Resident macrophages were associated with worse outcomes in cancer patients than recruited macrophages. Single cell sequencing and flow cytometry of genetically engineered mouse models of CC10-Cre KrasG12D;p53-\/- and SPC-Cre KrasG12D lung cancer revealed that lung tumor progression was characterized by extensive expansion of immune suppressive, Ki67+ resident alveolar macrophages and loss of T cells in the lung. Single cell transcriptomics identified IL-34 expressed exclusively by tumor cells as a possible driver of alveolar macrophage proliferation and IGF1 expressed by tumor associated alveolar macrophages as a possible regulator of tumor cell proliferation. Accordingly, blockade of IL-34 profoundly reduced tissue resident macrophage proliferation, stimulated recruitment of activated T cells, and suppressed growth of KrasG12D driven tumors. Analysis of TCGA data sets revealed that expression of IGF1 or IL34 was associated with reduced survival in lung, kidney, liver, head and neck and ovarian cancer. These studies identify key roles for IL-34 and IGF1 in solid tumor progression and suggest new therapeutic targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to stimulate anti-cancer immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Macrophages,Immuno-oncology,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>H.

The binding of ILT3 to its ligands induces an immunosuppressive phenotype in myeloid cells, mediates the inhibition of T cells activity and generates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) which supports tumor growth. The inhibition of ILT3 can restore the anti-tumor activity of myeloid cells and T cells, and thus remodulate the TME from immunosuppressive to pro-inflammatory. Here we describe preclinical characterization of BND-35, a humanized IgG4, ILT3 antagonist antibody developed for the treatment of solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: BND-35 binding to ILT3 was evaluated by flow cytometry, ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. We investigated the ability of BND-35 to block ILT3 interactions with APOE and fibronectin, to enhance the pro inflammatory activity of various myeloid cells and reverse ILT3-mediated immune suppression of T cells by different suppressive myeloid cells using ELISA and in vitro and ex vivo cell-based assays. The anti-tumor activity of BND-35 was also evaluated in vivo in hILT3 transgenic mouse tumor models as well as in tumoroid systems generated from cancer patients.<br \/>Results: BND-35 binds ILT3, but not other ILT-family receptors, with low nanomolar affinity and blocks its interaction with APOE and fibronectin in a concentration-dependent manner. ILT3 blockade with BND-35 restored the pro-inflammatory activity of FcR-stimulated DCs and THP1 cells inhibited by fibronectin. BND-35 was also shown to restore an M1 phenotype in cancer patients&#8217; derived monocytes differentiated in the presence of autologous tumor cells. In addition, BND-35 restored T cell activity (both, CD4 and CD8 T cells) inhibited by either DCtol, MDSCs or M2 cells as a single agent and in combination with anti PD-1. BND-35 enhanced immune activity in a unique system of patient-derived tumoroids as evidenced by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, blocking ILT3 activity with BND-35 resulted in decreased tumor growth and induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in tumor resident T cells and myeloid cells populations as a single agent and in combination with anti PD-1.<br \/>Conclusions: BND-35 is an anti-ILT3 antagonist antibody that was shown to induce potent pro inflammatory activity of myeloid cells and enhance T cells activity inhibited by ILT3 expressing myeloid suppressive cells in multiple in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. By doing so, BND-35 can lead to TME remodelling from immunosuppressive to proinflammatory. Safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of BND-35 will be explored in a first-in-human clinical trial in cancer patients with solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>T.
