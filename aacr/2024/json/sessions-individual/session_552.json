Abstracts will be released at the time of presentation. This is one of three Chemistry in Cancer Research (CICR)-sponsored New Drugs on the Horizon Sessions. These sessions offer the opportunity for Annual Meeting attendees to see the first disclosures of twelve innovative agents, both small molecules and biologics that have recently entered, or imminently will enter, into phase I clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. All presentations will reveal the chemical or biologic structure of the agent under investigation, key highlights of the drug discovery program, and ongoing clinical development plans. The New Drugs on the Horizon sessions have always proven to be an excellent opportunity to learn about the next wave of innovative cancer drugs progressing in the clinic.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"552","Key":"88de11b0-a878-491a-888b-16ff9de158c7","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":null,"MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DDT01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":"https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-view-content-embargoed.png","PlayerUrlReason":"Session embargoed at this time.","PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DDT01.
