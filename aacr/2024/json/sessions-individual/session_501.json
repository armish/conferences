As the throughput of these technologies and the number of molecular modalities that they assay continue to grow, datasets are becoming larger and more complex, necessitating novel statistical tools to analyze the data efficiently. Bench-based and clinical scientists should understand how to use the latest analysis methods to effectively interpret their data, extract novel insights, and apply biological intuition to guide analysis. Moreover, it is important to avoid common misconceptions and statistically questionable practices that have been propagated in the field. This workshop introduces the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and provides guidelines for a bench scientist to begin analyzing their own data. We will cover state-of-the-art methods and best practices for data normalization, visualization, clustering, and cell typing. All code used in the workshop will be made freely available so that participants can adapt it for their own setting.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"501","Key":"b2154189-38bc-478e-8817-b44938313109","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW01.
