To this end programmatic population-based cancer screening is advocated by the WHO and many countries have implemented such programs for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, while approaches to multi cancer early detection are emerging. <br \/>\u000d\u000aAn important issue in cancer screening is how to optimize the tradeoff between benefits and harms for both the individual and society at large. Answering this question is not just about translating new biological or technological knowledge into new tests, but very much also about knowing who are at risk and should use such tests, when and how often, and how to mitigate risk of overdiagnosis and to guard affordability, as well as access to the health system in case of a positive test. <br \/>\u000d\u000aIn this context the session will address the path of new test development, the exposome as the quantifiable sum of environmental drivers of health and disease, and health technology assessment for an integral analysis of the contribution of the respective components of cancer screening programs to costs, effectiveness, and long-term impact.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"517","Key":"d0c6a5a2-3f4d-4723-9b60-eb9327561bbe","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED37","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED37.
