The technological requirements to support different tissue types and applications are very diverse, and platform versatility has thus become paramount. Much-needed adaptability in assay design and sample compatibility for spatial biology research is now enabled by CellScape&trade; Precise Spatial Multiplexing. This symposium highlights recent technological developments that expand the capabilities of the CellScape platform and provides illustrations of cutting-edge cancer research that leverages this technology in studies that explore the spatial relationships underlying heterogeneous cell migrations and the role of lipocalin-2 in promoting breast cancer metastasis.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"569","Key":"256a9b0f-d11f-4c79-9b89-e472c4d68038","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Canopy Bio","Number":"ESP5C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP5C.
