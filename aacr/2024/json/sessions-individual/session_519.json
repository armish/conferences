This session will cover the current state of clinical genetic testing, the distribution of pathogenic and uncertain variants and the management of results at the U.S. population level; discoveries from paired tumor and germline sequencing that inform cancer risk stratification and treatment selection; and genetic testing for high-penetrance syndromes such as Li Fraumeni and the challenge of clonal hematopoiesis in results interpretation.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"519","Key":"0bfdcf7a-ccd1-416f-a93f-887ea7e0fa9e","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED18","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED18.
