Second, understanding of the impact of these agents on the immune microenvironment continues to evolve, with recent data indicating effects not only on T-cell activation but also on immune memory, carrying implications for safely optimizing combinations with immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma and beyond.&nbsp; Finally, CDK4\/6 inhibitors are promising combinatorial partners with inhibitors of signal transduction, with multiple preclinical studies now translating to clinical trials in a variety of tumor types.\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"134","Key":"35a307a3-e221-4185-af59-8bd7a06ef3d5","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY20","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY20.
