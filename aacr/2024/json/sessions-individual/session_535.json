For the past 2 decades, precision medicine in oncology has relied nearly exclusively on genomic precision medicine, which has produced many successes, but has also left many cancer patients without benefit. A commonsense approach to discovering if a drug is likely to benefit a cancer patient is to put that drug on the patient&rsquo;s tumor cells and measure a parameter that predicts clinical response. Related approaches were pioneered over 30 years ago, but since that time there have been major technological improvements as well as an explosive broadening of the cancer pharmacopeia. The result is that there now exist a wide variety of tools to accurately measure the effects of cancer drugs on patient tumors ex vivo. There are exciting clinical trials showing benefit that have been completed, and many more in progress, as well as a burgeoning functional precision medicine commercial industry. In this session we will present several examples of how functional precision medicine is being used to assign active drugs to cancer patients in varied distinct contexts and by varied methods.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"535","Key":"e51165d8-6f8e-48ca-bc39-1faac2118096","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED33","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED33.
