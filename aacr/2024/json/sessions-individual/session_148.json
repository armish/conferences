These cancer cells are considered dormant, yet, have the potential to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; to trigger disease recurrence in patients previously deemed cured. Cancer dormancy therefore represents a significant clinical challenge. This session will cover the biology of cancer dormancy, underscoring the critical roles of tumor-host interactions and of cellular plasticity in determining whether cancer cells remain dormant or are awakened. The session will cover cancer cell intrinsic, microenvironmental, and systemic factors regulating dormancy, including the involvement of immune cells, aging, and stress. Furthermore, the session will explore the clinical implications arising from the understanding of the biology of cancer dormancy, such as the potential for identifying cancer survivors at risk of cancer reactivation and the opportunities for developing therapies that target the dormant cancer cells and prevent awakening.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"148","Key":"0879bf64-6e58-40f1-8b84-3f05acb3e64e","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY34","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY34.
