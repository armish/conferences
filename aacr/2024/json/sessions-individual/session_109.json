Several factors may contribute to the limited effectiveness of T cell bispecific antibodies in solid tumor treatment. Some of the key challenges include lack of tumor specific targets, limited number of T cells in tumors, immunosuppressive TME and lack of co-stimulation. The session reviews recent clinical advances in targeting solid tumors as well as ongoing strategies aiming to enhance activity and safety of CD3-bispecifics in solid tumors. &nbsp;&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"109","Key":"0debc5ee-fd02-4e49-9053-9cc1c645ff50","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT09.
