For the first time, use a single sample to simultaneously perform genomic and DNA methylation profiling in one target enrichment workflow. Additionally, Transcenta Therapeutics will discuss their clinical work with Osemitamab (TST001, anti-Claudin 18.2 monoclonal antibody) in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In collaboration with Transcenta, Agilent is developing an IHC companion diagnostic for Claudin 18.2. The assay is being used for patient selection in Transcenta&rsquo;s clinical phase 3 program.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"653","Key":"cf4af0bd-7279-45b6-9fe3-9bd61c67e8d8","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Agilent","Number":"ESP2E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP2E.
