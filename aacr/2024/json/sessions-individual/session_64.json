Speakers will talk about the opportunities, challenges or implications these advanced technologies can bring in the field of oncology, cancer research and precision medicine. The session will cover various topics, such as the benefits of moving from qualitative to quantitative practices, leveraging computational pathology and AI tools for improving diagnostics or prognosis and, subsequently, clinical decision-making. In addition, the speakers will present various ground-breaking recent discoveries on the utilization of Generative AI, LLM, and FM models and their impact on advancing precision medicine and clinical research. The session will present some new promising examples of exploring virtual clinical trials and diagnosing cancers of unknown origin.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"64","Key":"bd39d2db-7ea5-42fb-ada5-7c2b1c7817a4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AT02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AT02.
