There is strong existent evidence that MRD detection predicts clinical relapse, thus opening opportunities for interception studies to eradicate microscopic residual disease and increase cancer cures. Using various solid tumors as examples, including head and neck squamous cell cancer, breast cancer and melanoma, the design, implementation and challenges of cancer interception clinical trials are discussed.  Important concepts to consider in such trials including patient selection, limits of detection and other performance characteristics of ctDNA assays, tumor fraction, interception strategies, endpoints (e.g. ctDNA clearance, relapse-free survival, etc), multidisciplinary collaboration and trial logistics.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 5:45:00 PM","EndTime":"17:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"675","Key":"d86fc8b4-acec-41e2-abc0-f60fa8dc3d89","LastUpdated":"2024-03-11 15:09","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":null,"MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME01.
