Moreover, the disease is already metastatic to distant sites at initial presentation in a third of the cases reducing the possibility of definitive cure. Pathological characteristics of the disease include tumor emboli within the dermal lymphatics associated with expression of E-cadherin and markers of mesenchymal differentiation responsible for treatment resistance and metastatic dissemination. Molecular studies with next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified predominant genomic alterations in cell-cycle regulation and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in IBC irrespective of breast cancer subtype. Recent findings suggest a critical role of tumor microenvironment, DNA methylation and post-translational modifications in preclinical models with potential new therapeutic opportunities. The session will review novel information regarding clinical diagnosis, including role of imaging, predictive biomarkers, and use of preclinical models to design more effective therapeutic strategies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"116","Key":"a32fb052-3c58-464b-ad33-70256267d588","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 16 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS01.
