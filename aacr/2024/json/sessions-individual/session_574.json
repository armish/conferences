FcResolv&trade; NOG mice, designed with targeted knockout of these receptors, improve the accuracy of antibody-based drug studies by eliminating significant confounding variables, providing clearer, more translatable results. Learn how super immunodeficient and humanized immune system (HIS) FcResolv&trade; NOG models eliminate false negatives and positives that occur when an antibody-based therapeutic&#39;s Fc domain interacts with murine Fc?Rs. The new FcResolv&trade; huNOG-EXL extends utility of this portfolio as a HIS mouse with human myeloids and lymphoids.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"574","Key":"f6f8cbc0-833b-44fe-8e8c-dbc3c88fa332","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Taconic Biosciences","Number":"ESP2D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP2D.
