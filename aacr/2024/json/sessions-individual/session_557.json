Cancer researchers can play a vital role in quelling misinformation among the public, educating patients and caregivers about important scientific advances, helping policy makers make informed decisions in passing health care legislations and supporting research funding, and assisting reporters in communicating accurate science to the public. <br \/>\u000d\u000aIn this session, experts will provide an overview of the importance of communicating science to non-scientists and strategies to achieve this effectively. Attendees will receive useful tips on ways to simplify complex, technical information about their scientific findings into readily understood messages for the media, the policy makers, and the public, will have the opportunity to participate in a panel discussion, and will receive information about how the AACR will support these efforts.<br \/>\u000d\u000a ","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"557","Key":"2a286024-5750-46f7-aaef-a43982ffcc16","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SS05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SS05.
