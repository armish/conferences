This gap represents a major barrier to translating microbiome research into clinically actionable biomarkers and therapies. This session will highlight cutting-edge genomic, immunologic, and translational studies that are dissecting the mechanistic interplay between the microbiome and cancer development, progression, and treatment response. Speakers will present metagenomic and functional data illuminating how microbiome-derived signals influence modulate native and adaptive anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, these findings provide an updated conceptual framework for defining microbial contributions to cancer progression and treatment response. Unraveling these mechanisms is crucial for realizing the transformative potential of microbiome-based precision oncology approaches.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"504","Key":"0916222c-184e-457e-b6e8-889dda01c3f3","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED50","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED50.
