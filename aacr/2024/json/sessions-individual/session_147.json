Major advances in single cell technologies have led to the realization that, in addition to genetic heterogeneity, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in tumor cell states. These can reflect cellular hierarchies from stem to more differentiated compartments or other processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Plasticity, the ability of cells to rapidly convert from one state to another, is important for normal tissue homeostasis and repair, and is exploited by tumor cells. This session will discuss recent data on how plasticity also contributes to many aspects of tumorigenesis, from initiation to progression, metastasis and response to therapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"147","Key":"c90afaa1-49e1-41af-bd3b-09d276c5dc25","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY33","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY33.
