This is due to many factors including the complexity and cost of manufacturing &amp; distributing these extensively regulated autologous cell products, the need for specialized in-patient care, complex reimbursement models and the dense intellectual property landscape. Alternative manufacturing &amp; delivery models, for example the &quot;Point of Care&quot; model, where CAR-T products are prepared locally in the hospital setting, present unique challenges but also potential benefits, including the potential for increased patient access. This model is being successfully implemented in several different counties. The objectives of this session will be for invited speakers to discuss barriers to CAR-T access and\/or relate their experiences along non-conventional paths from CAR-T pre-clinical development and manufacturing set-up, to early stage clinical trials and eventual regulatory approval. The session will provide the opportunity for increased collaboration among investigators active in this area and provide useful information for others considering alternative models.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"528","Key":"6ebe994b-8207-4ed0-8590-456203d546e0","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED27","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED27.
