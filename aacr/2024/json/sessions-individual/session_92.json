In response to various cell signals, transcription factors activate or repress gene expression to determine cell identity and function. Regulation of transcription factors is important for processes such as normal development, but when transcription factors are deregulated, they can drive a cell to become malignant. For decades, transcription factors have been sought after as therapeutic targets. Until now, researchers have pursued transcription factors as isolated proteins &ndash; resulting in little success. This session will focus on a variety of strategies to perturb oncogenic transcriptional programs, including direct perturbation of transcription factor function or interactions and degradation of key transcriptional targets.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"92","Key":"930b815b-cdc9-41d9-89e9-a2432dc663a1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-12 15:21","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 29 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT04.
