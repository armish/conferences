These structures are therapeutically compelling targets for the modulation of RNA function. Most current therapeutic agents that bind directly to RNA are either antibiotics blocking bacterial ribosome function or oligonucleotides with their attendant pharmaceutical limitations. Directly targeting RNA with cell-permeable small molecule therapeutics offers an opportunity to intervene more broadly in the RNA biology that drives disease phenotypes. In this session, we will cover some of the unique challenges and considerations in discovering RNA-targeted small molecules, including therapeutic target choice, RNA structure, RNA-protein interactions, and chemical libraries. We aim to provide an introduction to the RNA-targeted small molecule field and potential opportunities to apply this modality to treat oncological diseases, and beyond.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"476","Key":"bc9284aa-2a6f-43df-a52c-8151e084bb57","LastUpdated":"2024-03-08 14:42","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED05.
