Robust animal models should thoroughly explore translational aspects, clarify the mode of action, and provide comprehensive understanding of the relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). In this presentation, you will learn from NUVISAN scientists how you can maximize the impact of your next animal study. The speakers will showcase various applications of our in vivo pharmacology and analytical platforms, including studies in immuno-oncology and investigations using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"575","Key":"f280fdd0-54a5-49d0-9999-e4ca3b1b81c4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Nuvisan<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP8D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP8D.
