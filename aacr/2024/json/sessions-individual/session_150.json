Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled studies into the mutational landscapes of normal tissues, providing insight into the earliest stages of cancer evolution. In this session, we will discuss the factors and contexts that promote clonal evolution in normal tissue, and the implications for the risks of cancer and other diseases. Presentations will <b>i.<\/b> discuss support for a model whereby aging and contexts like smoking can promote selection for cells with adaptive mutations, which can contribute to not only cancer risk but also tissue aging, <b>ii.<\/b> provide new insight into the extent and consequences of somatic mutation and clonal selection in normal tissues, and <b>iii.<\/b> discuss the origin of somatic mutation in the hematopoietic system, the rate of mutation acquisition and factors impacting that, and environmental factors such as infection, age, and drug therapy that influence clonal expansion.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"150","Key":"decca040-b06b-4174-968c-f1817eddcbd1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY36.
