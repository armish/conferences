Consequently, there has been long-standing interest in leveraging pet dogs as a bridge between rodent model systems and subsequent human clinical trials, with the goal of improving translational success.  Until recently, a lack of the necessary reagents and tools, particularly with respect to genomics, remained a barrier to effective utilization and integration of the dog cancer model into therapeutic interrogation.  With the most recent iteration of the canine genome (Canfam4), new platforms for multi-omics analytics, a data repository housed in the NCI (Integrated Canine Data Commons), among other advances, the breadth of canine cancer studies has markedly increased.   This session will provide a brief overview on the resources available for conducting clinical research in pet dogs, describe how canine cancer can be used to rapidly explore novel therapeutic combinations,  detail advances and challenges associated with canine cellular therapies, and explore the use of dogs as a model to better understand the links between aging and cancer risk.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"480","Key":"dcb5dd8d-c2e0-4c96-8e4d-9432cd075797","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 29 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED07.
