There are emerging strategies to maintain and improve QoL yet they are not routinely integrated into standard care. Furthermore, what defines quality of life can also vary across the lifespan and thus intervention strategies to maintain and improve QoL may need to be tailored to the life stage. In this symposium, speakers will talk about the impact of cancer and treatment across the lifespan from survivors of childhood cancer to young adults to older cancer survivors. Speakers will address what QoL means, how it is defined, how it varies across the lifespan and how it is impacted by cancer. They will then focus on new and emerging strategies and opportunities for interventions aimed to improve QoL and long-term outcomes.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"96","Key":"55e8ca87-f21f-41bb-9a6e-77978ecf7efe","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 11 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY10.
