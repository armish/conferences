As we have learned more about the biomarker and the disease, we have come to realize that much of what we thought we knew about PSA screening is wrong. Our improved understanding has led to major changes in how we screen for prostate cancer. Today, PSA screening is focused on identifying only those cancers that need to be found and treated. How do we do this and how well are we doing? The session will review novel prostate cancer biomarkers and imaging tests that are now an integral part of the screening process, discuss how these tests are being used along with PSA for smarter screening, and share how metrics of diagnostic performance for novel tests can be translated into long-term projections of population benefit and harm.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><br \/>\u000a&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"515","Key":"07537f85-fee4-415b-937d-cbb25c5bdf20","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED39","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED39.
