As such insights into the biology of clonal hematopoiesis can be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies to both prevent and better treat leukemia. It is increasingly clear that clonal hematopoiesis alters the immune system with wide reaching implications on health. Given the link between the immune system and both carcinogenesis and response to cancer-directed therapy, clonal hematopoiesis has the potential to influence cancer risk and outcomes. However, recent studies have yielded conflicting results. In this session we will address new insights into the drivers clonal hematopoiesis progression and how this might influence therapeutic approaches for hematologic cancers. Furthermore we will address the potential link between clonal hematopoiesis and solid tumor development and response to therapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"505","Key":"04d7e31f-db28-444d-bf09-b98210840808","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED49","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED49.
