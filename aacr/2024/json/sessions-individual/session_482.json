Current cancer therapy regimens applying treatment agents at Maximum Tolerated Dose continuously until progression are usually not evolutionarily optimal for either cure or control of metastatic cancers. The speakers will present evolutionary principles and practical examples of clinical cancer treatments designed to prolong control in a palliative setting and increase the probability of cure when that is an achievable outcome.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"482","Key":"06525df0-68a6-4598-ac56-026d90beb33c","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED09.
