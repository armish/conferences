Many of the same factors and pathways critical to lineage commitment in normal embryonic development have been implicated as determinants of lineage plasticity in cancer. Plasticity contributes to intratumoral heterogeneity and to metastatic competency. With the advent of highly effective targeted therapies, lineage plasticity is increasingly recognized as a primary mechanism of therapeutic resistance. Studies analyzing histologic transformation from lung adenocarcinoma to small cell lung cancer, and from prostate adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine prostate cancer, have demonstrated remarkably convergent biology â€“ resulting in high grade neuroendocrine tumors sharing many key characteristics despite disparate origins. This session will review aspects of our current understanding of lineage plasticity in cancer, at bulk and single cell levels, based primarily on human and mouse model systems of lung and prostate cancer. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"507","Key":"a53914c9-5030-4daa-baf7-b10ee793b30d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED47","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED47.
