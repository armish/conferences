However, significant obstacles exist in the tumor microenvironment that limit the responses to ACT. Dr. Ruella will discuss the recent clinical results of commercial CART-19 and CART-BCMA and review the current evidence on the known resistance mechanisms. He will then present his recent work on the use of CART19 in minority health populations, novel results on the occurrence of T-cell lymphomas after CAR, and strategies to enhance CART efficacy and safety. Dr. Koya will provide an overview of T Cell Receptor (TCR)- engineered adoptive transfer of T cells and immunosuppressive factors in the TME that affect the efficiency of the therapy, as well as,  strategies to overcome them. Dr Savoldo will discuss strategies and challenges of modulating myeloid cells to create a more permissive environment for T cell function, with the ultimate goal of improving the success of CAR T cell-based therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"525","Key":"c242b631-9531-4df8-9706-89ebc3adbb46","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED24","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED24.
