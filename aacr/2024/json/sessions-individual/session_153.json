However, the limited response rates to ICB across multiple cancer types suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed in order to increase the population of patients achieving durable cancer remission (cure). The symposium will focus on recent breakthrough discoveries in the field, including new immune modulatory mechanisms and checkpoints, and on unleashing the therapeutic potential of B cells- and G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)-targeting strategies as part of novel, multimodal precision immunotherapies enhancing the response of ICB for a myriad of human malignancies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"153","Key":"673b698f-c2f0-47a1-a403-9853669ab383","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY39","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY39.
