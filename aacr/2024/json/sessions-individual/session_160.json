The DNA damage responses coordinates numerous factors to rapidly detect and repair myriad genomic lesions. Similarly, cytoplasmic DNA and double-stranded RNA species are detected by a host of receptors to activate inflammatory cytokine driven transcriptional programs.  Such pattern recognition systems can be activated by either bacterial or viral pathogens, as well as be endogenous nucleic acids in a response known as ‘viral mimicry’. Interestingly, genomic DNA damage is an established cause of inflammatory signaling by activation of both DNA and double-stranded RNA dependent pattern recognition receptors. Recent findings by investigators speaking in this session provide a framework to understand the basis for communication between the respective DNA damage and inflammatory pattern recognition receptor responses. This session will explore specific mechanisms of DNA damage induced inflammatory responses and how each impacts immune microenvironment changes in cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"160","Key":"b9aa721d-9bbf-4179-bc47-9e7dea69f22f","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY46","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY46.
