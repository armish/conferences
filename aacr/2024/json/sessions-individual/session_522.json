Less immunogenic tumors without such infiltrating T cells, called ‘cold’ tumors, need a way to induce an immune response that can be enhanced by CPI.  Cancer vaccines can fill that need.  Conversely, cancer vaccines have failed when the elicited immune responses are inhibited in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and can benefit from CPI and blockade of regulatory cells and cytokines.  Cancer vaccines can also boost activity or persistence of ACT.  Vaccines can also be designed to overcome\/exploit other aspects of tumor biology.  A high burden of somatic mutations in tumors often leads to greater immunogenicity and ‘hotter’ phenotype, suggesting a role for mutation-derived neoepitopes.  Evolving technology has now made it practical to identify patient-specific neoepitopes and develop custom cancer vaccines to exploit these.  Also, tumors often suppress dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen-presenting function. Developing cancer vaccines using autologous DCs matured away from these suppressive factors can bypass this resistance mechanism, making DC cancer vaccines a promising strategy.  Overall, better understanding of tumor biology is facilitating development of more effective cancer vaccine regimens and their use in synergy with other immunotherapy modalities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"522","Key":"a0190b23-2238-467a-aa39-a777b1191ed1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED21","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED21.
