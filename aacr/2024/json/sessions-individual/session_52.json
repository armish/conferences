In today&rsquo;s information age, public awareness of high and often durable objective response rates from early single-arm trials of such targeted therapies, coupled with their persuasive mechanistic rationales, can lead to a perceived loss of equipoise between the experimental targeted therapy treatment arm and standard of care control arm in a randomized control trial. In addition, the granting of accelerated approvals prior to the full accrual of pivotal randomized confirmatory trials can add to the perceived loss of equipoise. These factors can lead to behavior changes from different trial participants, including investigators and patients, as demonstrated by asymmetric early dropout, discrepancies between investigator and independent central review of disease progression data, and other issues that impact the results and interpretability of clinical trials. As drug development continues to focus on precision oncology, the loss of equipoise and its consequences will likely be recurrent issues. This panel session brings together key stakeholders to discuss what happens &ldquo;when equipoise is lost.&rdquo; We will discuss the effects of such a (perceived) loss, how they impact study results and interpretability, and study design considerations to potentially mitigate these effects.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"52","Key":"e74baa3d-d0ae-4d8a-93dd-b0e367b6e12c","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC09.
