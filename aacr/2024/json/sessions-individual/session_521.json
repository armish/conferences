With increasing knowledge of solid tumor immunology, advances in genetic engineering that lead to improved design of CAR, TCR, and manufacturing lessons learned from hematological malignancy cell therapies, the next phase in solid tumor cell therapy has been evolving. In this session, we will discuss the recent advances and upcoming trials in solid tumor cell therapies -by use of TILs, TCRs, and CARs.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"521","Key":"03830848-cb97-46a9-9d49-35fd7f025a87","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED20","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED20.
