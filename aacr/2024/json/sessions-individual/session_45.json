The endpoint of overall survival (OS) is universally accepted as a gold standard for oncology clinical trials because it reflects both efficacy and safety of new therapies. Additionally, understanding whether a new drug will prolong patients&rsquo; lives is a clear and widely understandable indicator of clinical benefit. Powerful breakthroughs in cancer treatment have thankfully helped millions of cancer survivors live long and fulfilling lives. While these successes should be celebrated, they have increased the challenge of timely demonstration of safety and efficacy for new therapies and therefore led to growing use of early endpoints like progression-free survival or response rates for regulatory applications. However, early endpoints do not always correlate with OS, and the quality of OS data collection has been decreasing. Project Endpoint intends to improve the rigor of OS data collection and analysis in all registrational clinical trials, as well as support early endpoint innovation to continue the timely pace of developing new treatment options for patients who need them. This session will include insights from a 2023 workshop co-organized by FDA, AACR, and the American Statistical Association regarding trial designs, prospective and retrospective OS analyses, subgroup considerations, and risk-benefit assessments.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"45","Key":"41aae585-6726-4737-a11c-2d0410066920","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC02.
