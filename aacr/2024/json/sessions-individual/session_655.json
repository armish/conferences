When developing solid tumor immunotherapies, organoid-based syngeneic preclinical models provide a valuable testing platform. Dr. Braverman will discuss building an organoid platform to study cytokine signaling in colon cancer using these methods.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>Patient-derived organoids have revolutionized precision medicine approaches for pancreatic cancer treatments. The predictive power of these models is robust and remains consistent across passage, different sources and lots of basement membrane extract. Dr. Engle will cover how to use patient-derived organoid models to intercept pancreatic disease.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"655","Key":"e3f429cf-c08c-4e0b-9774-d7c0ee77a847","LastUpdated":"2024-03-08 12:50","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Corning Life Sciences","Number":"ESP3C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP3C.
