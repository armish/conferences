These mutations are prevalent in a significant proportion of gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and various malignancies. In this symposium, speakers will address pre-clinical mouse models concerning IDH-mutant hematological cancer and gliomas. Furthermore, insights into recent clinical trials will be discussed, exploring their implications for IDH-mutant glioma treatment. The session will also delve into the functional significance of genetic alterations in the initiation, progression, and potentially therapy response of IDH-mutant gliomas. Overall, the session will provide a comprehensive examination of the molecular intricacies and clinical implications surrounding IDH mutations in cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"103","Key":"60dbaa45-0a3d-4eea-abb8-a6873de3757a","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 17 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY16","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY16.
