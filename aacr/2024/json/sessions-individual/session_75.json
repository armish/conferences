We will discuss how progress has been achieved using both high-quality conventional, reversible inhibitors and also the exciting new classes of covalent inhibitors and degraders &ndash; both PROTACs and molecular glues. Yet, despite the exciting advances made, recent studies have emphasized the important need for the research community to agree and disseminate consensus best practice, both for the development and characterization &ndash; as well as in the selection and use &ndash; of small-molecule tools. By applying consensus best practice we can further enhance the application of small-molecule protein modulators in fundamental research, target validation and therapeutic discovery, while avoiding the pitfalls (especially concerning selectivity, off-target effects, controls and concentration range ) that can generate non-robust fundamental findings and mislead translational development. Brief presentations will be designed to stimulate a lively panel discussion with active audience participation.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"75","Key":"9883d502-fd0c-4183-bea8-9866ba6f75b5","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO02.
