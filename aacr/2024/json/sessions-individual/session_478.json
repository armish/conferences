Many fundamental questions pertaining to cancer complexity remain unresolved. For example, how to identify functional sequence aberrations in cancer at large scale? How do signaling and transcriptional networks undergo rewiring upon genetic or environmental perturbation? What are the molecular determinants at the DNA, RNA and protein regulation levels across cancer types? To begin to address these questions, in this special session, we will discuss recent advances in cancer research via systems genetics and multiomic networks to better understand cancer complexity across different scales, from single cells to systems networks.<\/p>\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a<p>The goal of this special session is to create an opportunity and highlight an emerging era of cancer research. We highlight the state-of-the-art technologies to tackle cancer complexity and heterogeneity at systems scale, and discuss the modeling and analysis of multiple mechanistic effects in the context of molecular and signaling networks across scales. <br \/>\u000d\u000a <\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"478","Key":"8969cb68-8814-45a1-a1f5-18561a851457","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW12.
