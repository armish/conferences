Emerging research suggests that nutritional and exercise interventions can be delivered concurrently with cancer treatment, and may improve tolerability to treatment, body composition, physical function, wellbeing, metabolic health, and cancer-related outcomes, although insufficient data is currently available. Promising approaches under investigation include high-fat low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, resistance training and various combinations of nutrition and exercise. In this major symposium, we discuss recent findings from interventional studies evaluating various interventional strategies among patients receiving chemotherapy and\/or radiation for colon, rectal or breast cancer in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting including the Lifestyle, Exercise and Nutritional Early after Diagnosis (LEANer) study, the FOcus on Reducing dose-limiting toxicities in Colon Cancer with resistance Exercise (FORCE), the Time-Restricted Eating study in cancer patients and the ongoing work from the consortium on Exercise and Nutrition Interventions to Improve Cancer Treatment-Related Outcomes (ENICTO). Each trial focuses on evaluating relative dose intensity or toxicity as well as quality of life, adherence, and health behaviors. In addition, changes in biomarkers of interest are assessed to evaluate hypotheses regarding the underlying biological effects of diet\/exercise on tumor growth, body composition and\/or physical function. We will also discuss the methodological challenges and lessons learned for future studies. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"95","Key":"50e430f7-33e2-4274-8c33-8edfbb3b976e","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 16 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY09.
