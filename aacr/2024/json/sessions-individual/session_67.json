This session will present research focused on leveraging PDOs as tools to investigate functional genomics, tumor dependencies, T-cell activity, and personalized medicine.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><br \/>\u000aDr. Rios will present a 3D imaging and integrated transcriptomics platform (BEHAV3D5) developed to exploit immune-organoid co-cultures for understanding mode-of-action of engineered T cells in a personalized manner. Dr. Soragni will introduce a workflow for systematic high throughput screening of heterogeneous PDOs established from rare benign and malignant tumors and applications to functional precision medicine. Dr. Garnett will discuss the development of the Organoid Cancer DepMap including systematic PDO derivation and genomic characterization and chemical and genomic functional perturbation studies to map cancer dependencies in organoids.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"67","Key":"449cab05-997a-44c6-8721-1e1912f8a1df","LastUpdated":"2024-03-12 18:23","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AT05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AT05.
