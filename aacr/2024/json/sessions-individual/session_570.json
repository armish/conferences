To discover novel biomarkers of cancer and identify potential causal pathways, we measured 7,000 aptamers using the SomaScan&reg; 7K Assay in a case-cohort study of ~20,000 participants within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). This presentation will describe early insights from the study including potential new biomarkers of specific cancers and mortality, as well as highlight common sets of predictive proteins across cancer types.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"570","Key":"168b2733-531c-4947-8e4f-6b0c09d3eceb","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"SomaLogic","Number":"ESP1E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP1E.
