Dr. &nbsp;Sandrine Roulland will cover critical aspects of the heterogeneity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She will also describe how recent single-cell studies provide new insights into the intratumor heterogeneity of DLBCL beyond the Cell of Origin, with major opportunities for predicting therapy response and improving precision medicine approaches. Dr. Jessica Okosun will cover recent insights into the biological heterogeneity of the most common indolent lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, enabled by technological advances in bulk and single-cell characterization. She will also review potential routes to translate these findings into clinical applications such as risk stratification, therapy selection and disease monitoring. Dr. Margaret Shipp will discuss new insights into the biological heterogeneity and genetic bases of immune evasion in Hodgkin lymphoma, associated immunotherapeutic strategies in relapsed\/refractory and newly diagnosed disease and mechanisms of response and resistance to these treatments.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"114","Key":"d22d35e1-6438-4c2a-999b-3aa1f723eabc","LastUpdated":"2024-03-11 19:25","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 14 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AHM05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AHM05.
