However, further examples of synthetic lethality in the clinic have been difficult to come by. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still under investigation. The first talk by Thanos Halazonetis will explore the mechanisms by which PARP inhibitors target HR-deficient cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that inhibition of PARP1 activity suffices for lethality of HR-deficient cells, while PARP1 trapping leads to toxicity. The second talk by Jasgit Sachdev will present preclinical and early clinical data on a PARG inhibitor, which is being developed for treatment of HR-deficient cancers including those resistant to PARP inhibitors. The PARG inhibitor being developed by IDEAYA Biosciences has shown preliminary efficacy in a Phase I clinical trial and has received fast track designation by the FDA. The third talk by Zev A Wainberg will explore the efforts to develop WRN inhibitors for the treatment of mismatch repair deficient cancers. WRN inhibitors being developed by Novartis and Vividion\/Roche are entering clinical trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"486","Key":"cfd297f4-d311-4ea1-bd67-1d4645ed2147","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 11 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED13.
