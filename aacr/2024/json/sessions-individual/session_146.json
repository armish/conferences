Parsing the wound-healing signals and cell types that restrain from those that support tumor initiation and progression is crucial for development of rationally designed therapies targeting immune or non-immune stroma. The talks in this session will focus on heterocellular interactions and contextual cues within solid tumor microenvironments, and how diverse signals in normal and tumor tissues influence cancer initiation and evolution. These talks will illustrate the importance of spatial and anatomic considerations in our efforts to understand requirements for tumors to form and grow, and highlight mechanisms of cellular crosstalk that may represent therapeutic targets.<\/span><\/span><\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"146","Key":"ff8f9c33-d346-4210-b609-86459ffc6415","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY32.
