However, the number of available chemicals to choose from is often vast and information about a given compound can be hard to find. Thus, selecting the best compound for your experiment and how to use it is not always easy. Here, we present tools and resources to help with these decisions, provide guidelines which will assist in avoiding misinterpretation of data, and propose best practices to ensure you really are investigating the right protein target. We will showcase best practice research and using a combination of genetic and small molecule approaches for fundamental and target validation studies to advance cancer and rare disease research for drug discovery.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"470","Key":"8728b038-3bf4-4f82-a699-3794deb079b8","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED02.
