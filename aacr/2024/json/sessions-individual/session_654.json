Extensively studied in cancer, clonal mosaicism also exists across normal and diseased non-malignant human tissues. The ubiquity of somatic clonal expansions and outstanding questions about how outgrowths of clones contribute to aging and disease mark somatic mosaicism as a frontier in human genetics. Deciphering the origin and dynamics of somatic evolution requires phylogenetic reconstruction of somatic single cells with phenotypic annotation. Phylogenetic reconstruction requires using native lineage barcodes, like single nucleotide variants through single-cell whole genome sequencing, developing statistical frameworks to connect lineage with phenotype, and increasing scale and throughput.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"654","Key":"6c275db3-57a4-4fa9-9731-f646cfcde412","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"BioSkryb","Number":"ESP7C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP7C.
