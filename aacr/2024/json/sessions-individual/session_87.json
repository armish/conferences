We will highlight recent advances in targeting chromatin regulatory assemblies in several cancer model systems using newly-emerging small molecule therapeutics targeting ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers such as mammalian SWI\/SNF (mSWI\/SNF or BAF) complexes. We will highlight state-of-the-art findings regarding the roles for altered chromatin architecture and accessibility as key determinants of cancer maintenance and therapy resistance, as well as the roles for biomolecular condensates in gene regulation. Finally, we will discuss new mechanisms by which chromosomal instability (CIN) promotes epigenetic reprogramming and heterogeneity in cancer. Importantly, this session will weave together mechanistic functions of chromatin regulatory entities at the biochemical, chemical and cell functional levels, with an eye toward new opportunities for drug discovery and clinical translation.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"87","Key":"a7a6b764-23b3-46aa-9da9-a535f3147607","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY03.
