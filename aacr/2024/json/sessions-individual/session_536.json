Starting with an introduction to precision medicine and the transition from a one-size-fits-all approach to genomically-tailored cancer care, we will review the evolution of this field leading to the current landscape of genotype-driven therapies. In tandem, we will discuss how data analytics and genomic variant interpretation have led to breakthroughs in cancer treatment together with advances in genomic technologies and their potential impact. We will conclude with a critical discussion of the challenges with the adoption of precision oncology, using molecular tumor boards as a use case, together with emerging efforts leveraging informatics approaches to support genotype-driven treatment decisions. By integrating knowledge learned across the pillars of personalized medicine, the session seeks to empower cancer researchers at all levels with the knowledge to contribute to the advancement of precision oncology. As part of this educational activity, key publications and online resources will be shared for further exploration.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"536","Key":"c0cc9ea6-cda3-4266-9b64-628b04f877ca","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 29 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED34","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED34.
