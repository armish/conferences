Although many of these trials were designed to investigate the efficacy and safety in the overall population, a positive risk:benefit assessment was not established in the biomarker negative population. This session will discuss these FDA approvals and considerations for approval in a biomarker defined population versus approving for the overall population with information on differential efficacy for biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative populations included in drug labeling; study designs to adequately power assessments of both biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative patient populations; and differences in assessment based on whether the biomarker is a discrete test versus one that is tested on a continuum. This session will also incorporate patient and clinician perspectives on the importance of precision oncology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"51","Key":"4a9829a8-6321-42db-a2c1-15ba36c2d1c1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC08.
