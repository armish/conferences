However, speed and throughput are major bottlenecks for these critical studies. Here, we present data from a novel in-situ sequencing system, with sub-micron resolution and ultra-high throughput capacity, employing rapid 4-color SBS chemistry to profile RNA transcripts and proteins in FFPE tissue. The system also generates virtual H&amp;E images, producing multi-modal spatial images of 40 cm^2 of tissue in &lt;24 hours.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"576","Key":"d41077c4-acc1-4170-b93f-473087aecc86","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Singular Genomics","Number":"ESP8E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP8E.
