Models exhibiting a human immune system are widely used, but the composition of the human immune system developed remains a concern. Here we report the use of a model exhibiting functional human lymphoid and myeloid compartments. Human immune cell recruitment and activation into the TME is tumor-dependent, evidencing the functionality of the immune response. Assessment of TCE&rsquo;s safety revealed that myeloid and dendritic cells enhance therapeutics-induced cytokine release syndrome features in the model. Moreover, the model enables therapeutic&rsquo;s MoA investigation.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"587","Key":"ee13ebfd-0c11-4136-9164-708451cbce0d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"genOway","Number":"ESP7D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP7D.
