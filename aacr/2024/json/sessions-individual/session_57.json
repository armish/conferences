As part of the Moonshot, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has outlined a bold roadmap, the National Cancer Plan, to advance research and intervention strategies to improve cancer prevention, detection, and treatment, and to reduce cancer inequities. However, the historic bipartisan support in Congress for federal biomedical research funding has tragically eroded. As a result, biomedical researchers are currently facing a crisis. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget is stagnant for the first time in eight years, jeopardizing further progress against cancer and a multitude of other diseases and health challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>This session at the AACR annual meeting will provide an opportunity for NCI leadership to discuss recent breakthroughs in cancer science and the promise of the National Cancer Plan. This will be followed by a discussion by several leaders in the field about the enormous opportunities in cancer research and the need for a concerted effort to inform Congress about the importance of continuing robust investments in NIH and NCI.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"57","Key":"6c9a021b-d33b-49ed-beaf-0e6b4c5939b8","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC14.
