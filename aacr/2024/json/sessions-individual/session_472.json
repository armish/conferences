Animal models remain the gold standard in immunology for studies in cancer immunology, but too often the results in models do not match up with the results from patients, which has led some to question the utility of animal models for cancer immunology research. In part, this disconnect can be tied to deficiencies in our understanding of what insights models can provide and where more appropriate models might be chosen to result in more insightful results. In this session, we will discuss some of the cardinal features one might want to study in cancer immunology, some of the tradeoffs for using different models to address these questions, and opportunities that are provided by genetically engineered models for studying complex biologies like impact of a native tumor microenvironment and tumor associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS).&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"472","Key":"6948efd2-9115-4658-8330-9b7feec2e75f","LastUpdated":"2024-03-12 16:52","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW15","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW15.
