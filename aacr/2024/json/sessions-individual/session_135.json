For example, cysteine is critical to redox metabolism by generating the universal antioxidant glutathione, while methionine catabolism produces the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine needed for the methylation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. NRF2, a transcription factor frequently deregulated in lung cancer, controls the expression of key serine\/glycine biosynthesis to support glutathione and nucleotide production. Moreover, appropriate generation of intracellular pyrimidine pools also sustain DNA synthesis and repair. This session will evaluate all three aspects in a series of presentations designed to reveal how these pathways might be exploited to develop new cancer therapies, especially for difficult to treat tumors.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"135","Key":"6f0e6056-3388-48ff-925d-6b0702b7801b","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY21","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY21.
