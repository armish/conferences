A number of agents inhibiting microtubule dynamics, mitotic kinases and motors have been clinically tested; however, their efficacy has been limited in practice, primarily because mitosis is a fundamental process for every cell and its disruption damages normal proliferating cells. How can we circumvent this narrow therapeutic window and find means to intervene cell division predominantly of cancer cells? In this symposium, we will highlight recent studies devising unique approaches on the basis of cancer-specific cellular responses. Although in early phases of development, the basic understandings of cell division in both physiological and pathological contexts should pave the way for innovative anti-cancer therapeutics targeting the mitotic cell cycle.\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"136","Key":"12697eba-feb9-4b7b-8204-4dadbbf7c2c0","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY22","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY22.
