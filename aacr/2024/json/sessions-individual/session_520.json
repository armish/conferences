Although ignored for many years as “Junk DNA”, recent work has uncovered an intricate role of transcribed non-coding regions and their protein products in senescence, aging, DNA damage and chronic inflammation. The expression of RE and HERV is suppressed in normal adult tissues but are ectopically re-expressed in many cancers. This Education Session will introduce what non-coding regions in cancer are and their mechanisms of action in driving cancer initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. We will present new concepts on how RE and HERV activation may be a common mechanism between senescence, aging and chronic inflammation processes and cancer susceptibility and initiation. In addition, non-coding elements in cancer and their protein products like reverse transcriptase may be new therapeutic targets in oncology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"520","Key":"4abd6b91-2a1e-4556-8b6f-bdb363e18f39","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED19.
