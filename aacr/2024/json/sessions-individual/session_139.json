Within individual pediatric cancer entities, diverse molecular subgroups exhibiting discriminatory genetic and epigenetic landscapes have been uncovered, implicating subgroup-specific developmental origins, distinct core regulatory circuitry, and selective dependencies that represent attractive therapeutic vulnerabilities. This session aims to spotlight recent advances pertinent to clinically aggressive childhood cancers, covering the cellular origins of medulloblastoma, novel epigenetic subtypes of osteosarcoma, and determinants of malignant transformation, disease progression, and treatment response in the pediatric setting. Strategies for rapid translation of these novel molecular and mechanistic insights into improved diagnostics and treatments for affected children will also be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"139","Key":"3dfb09c1-ce3e-47f5-a5e9-725f9753fd30","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY25","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY25.
