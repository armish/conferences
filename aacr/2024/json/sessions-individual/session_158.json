Based on these findings, we&rsquo;ll discuss the development and application of next generation strategies designed to improve TCR gene therapy through engaging CD4 T cells, co-opting or tethering a Signal 2 or Signal 3.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Dharma Master Jiantai,<\/strong> for whom this Session is named, was a brave young Abbess who dedicated her life to dharma teaching. She was a never-smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although not available to her at the time, targeted treatments are now available for the mutation that was identified in Dharma Master Jiantai&rsquo;s cancer. According to her wishes and in memory of Dharma Master Jiantai, her family established an endowment to support the Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Lung Cancer Research Session, Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Targeted Therapy, and Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Biomarkers Session. The family&rsquo;s goal is to foster cancer research that leads to new drug development, so that patients with cancer will live longer, have better quality of life, and potentially reach a cure in select cases.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"158","Key":"6b887e4b-6f58-457d-8df6-f53955495396","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY44","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY44.
