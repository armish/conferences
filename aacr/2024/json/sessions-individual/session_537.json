However, despite numerous studies introducing innovative methodologies to address this pivotal challenge, the translation of these predictors into clinical practice remains a challenge.<br \/>\u000d\u000a <\/p>\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a<p>In this Educational Session, we will explore new approaches to develop predictors of drug response using preclinical and clinical data while maximizing their potential for successful translation into clinical settings. We will present best practices and outline the key features of robust biomarker development while discussing the current obstacles and challenges in the field. <\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"537","Key":"964bdfdb-741f-4f96-84c1-eefeb33b9036","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED35","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED35.
