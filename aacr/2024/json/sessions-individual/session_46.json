Tobacco use causes approximately 20 percent of all cancer cases and 30 percent of all cancer deaths across more than 18 types of cancer. While the U.S. adult cigarette smoking rate is at a historic low of 11.5 percent, further significant reductions are necessary in order to achieve the Moonshot&rsquo;s goal of halving the cancer death rate in 25 years. Following the reignition of the Cancer Moonshot in 2022, FDA released proposed regulations that would prohibit menthol-flavored cigarettes and all flavors of cigars, which have been submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget as part of the final stage of the rulemaking process. Additionally, FDA has taken unprecedented enforcement actions in the past year across the supply chain, including against e-cigarette and other tobacco product firms importing and selling unauthorized products; these actions included fines and product seizures worth millions of dollars. During this session, Brian King, PhD, MPH, the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products will share FDA&rsquo;s priorities for reducing tobacco-related illness and death.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"46","Key":"4f4d7ed4-417f-4322-ba31-c03d4243b304","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 5 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC03.
