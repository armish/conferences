These agents may have advantages over traditional small molecule inhibitors due to their elimination, rather than inhibition, of disease-causing proteins, ability to disrupt scaffolding functions, potential to act on classically “undruggable” targets, and iterative\/catalytic mechanism of action. However, there are also specific challenges with systemic delivery of heterobifunctional degraders. First, such degraders exist in a chemical property space beyond that typically associated with orally bioavailable drugs. Second, for wild-type proteins, narrow therapeutic windows may emerge from broad, systemic degradation. Approaches to oral and CNS delivery of heterobifunctional degraders will be discussed, alongside an overview of potential mechanisms for delivery to specific tissues, cells, or intracellular compartments. Antibody-degrader conjugates (ADCs) in particular will be highlighted given their high potential for near-term clinical translation.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"474","Key":"678f74b8-3d0d-44cc-bd37-7800fbb792f1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED04.
