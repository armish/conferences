Amino acids have emerged as critical nutrients for sustaining the proliferative and survival demands of cancer cells. In this session, we will explore how understanding the metabolic rewiring in cancer not only can shed light on tumor biology but also provide cancer treatment opportunities. Experts will discuss the critical amino acid dependencies of cancer cells, highlighting the roles of glutamine and cysteine in tumor growth and survival. The session will delve into how cancer cells can adapt to and compensate for varying nutrient availability, and how such responses can be harnessed to design novel therapeutic modalities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"506","Key":"fc377225-111d-445d-bc0b-f190d0b32add","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED48","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED48. &nbsp; Metabolic Dependencies and Adaptations in Cancer","SearchResultCalendarDisplayBlock":null,"SearchResultFooter":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","SearchResultHeader":"Apr  6 2024 12:30PM","SecondaryCategory":"","SecondaryCategory_keys":"","ShowChatLink":null,"Start":"4\/6\/2024 12:30:00 PM","StartTime":"12:30","Status":"Active","StreamingConfiguration":null,"StreamingKey":null,"ThumbnailUrl":null,"Title":"&nbsp; Metabolic Dependencies and Adaptations in Cancer","Type":null,"TypeKey":null}
