However, it is not feasible to observe the evolutionary process directly, and so the dynamics remain incompletely characterised. In this session, we will discuss recent advances in human in vivo lineage tracing methodologies, where heritable somatic mutations or epimutations are utilised to reveal the evolutionary history of cancer cells. Speakers will cover the use of whole genome sequencing data (Raheleh Rabari), single cell multi-omic data (Dan Landau) and bulk DNA methylation data (Trevor Graham), with applications that span somatic evolution in healthy tissues, in solid tissue cancers and in haematological malignancies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"466","Key":"fc15efb4-4f50-4149-b9d8-6364f56013a6","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW18","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW18.
