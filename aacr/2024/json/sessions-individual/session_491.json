The workshop will educate participants about novel and state-of-the-art laboratory techniques and analytical methods in genome sciences, including computational and statistical approaches to study complex structural variation, with the goal of equipping researchers with the knowledge to use these techniques in their research. The three lectures of this workshop will introduce approaches to imaging, single-cell genomic sequencing, long-read sequencing as well as computational genomics aiming at deciphering the complex processes of genomic rearrangements in cancer. Cancer evolutionary aspects of these rearrangements will be addressed and techniques allowing to explore mechanisms that drive patterns of chromosomal instability and genomic rearrangement in micronuclei presented.Â ","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"491","Key":"29e5ec3e-2d5f-4807-a29e-6d392aaf7859","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW11.
