In cancer, AR is known as a critical driver of prostate cancer pathogenesis. This session will provide novel insight into the evolution of the AR gene and how these alterations impact its transcriptional program and attract co-factors that cooperate with AR to drive it from differentiation to an oncogenic transcription factor.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"122","Key":"2cf8b970-7f60-41ce-94d4-32011123d3ea","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 15 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS07.
