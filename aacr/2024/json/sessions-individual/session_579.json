Accurate and comprehensive sequencing is required to characterize all types of somatic mutations, which includes not only small variants, but also structural variants, RNA isoforms, and fusions. In this session, you will learn how accurate long reads enable researchers to explore the complete genome and transcriptome, while highly accurate short reads lower the limit of detection for very rare variants in applications like liquid biops","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"579","Key":"4e3d9133-c102-4399-b1de-3fdaf6992c4b","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"PacBio","Number":"ESP4A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP4A.
