This forum will detail two different approaches &ndash; one being a multi-level, community-based intervention aimed at reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption as a means of primary prevention and the other being a minimal touch, internet-based approach to improve multiple behaviors among cancer survivors across the U.S. &nbsp;These approaches will be contextualized within the extant body of lifestyle interventions that are aimed at cancer prevention and control &ndash; calling-out the challenges that need to be surmounted in future research and current funding opportunities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"80","Key":"cfcfe447-4f5b-44ed-9e90-0564d0828a2a","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO06.
