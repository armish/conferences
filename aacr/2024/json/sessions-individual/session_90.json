This symposium features presentations from three leading researchers in the field, each focusing on the critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. Dr. Bradley Bernstein&#39;s talk addresses the identification and targeting of epigenetic drivers in cancer, discussing the potential for developing novel treatments. Dr. Christina Leslie presents on advanced single-cell genomic techniques, exploring their use in understanding the 3D genome architecture and its role for tumorigenesis. Dr. Bing Ren examines tumor heterogeneity and evolution through single-cell epigenome analysis, providing insights into the disrupted epigenome and chromatin architecture in tumor cells and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The combined presentations highlight the importance of epigenome analysis in enhancing our understanding and treatment of cancer, representing significant advancements in the field.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"90","Key":"c2221f6f-6b10-4890-b6db-2b6c849fedc2","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY06.
