This stagnation can be attributed to a myriad of barriers including demographics, socioeconomic factors, physician attitudes and knowledge, overly restrictive inclusion\/exclusion criteria, lack of protocols, and patient apprehensions such as mistrust and fear. In this session, we delve into the current landscape of patient enrollment in clinical trials sponsored by the NCI, not-for-profit entities and industry. Additionally, we explore documented barriers that hinder participation, aiming to identify n strategies to improve access to clinical trials and Â diversify participation. By tackling these challenges head-on, we illustrate how strategies to overcome enrollment barriers have yielded positive results, ultimately helping to ensure that all individuals have an opportunity to benefit from investments in cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"496","Key":"2eb3db53-ede3-4aea-bc4c-424cfcbb9c33","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW06.
