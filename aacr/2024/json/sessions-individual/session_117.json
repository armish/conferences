However, targeted therapeutics and improved biological understanding and innovation are changing the landscape of possibilities in the field. This session will &nbsp;illustrate the breadth of approaches and innovation currently under investigation in the clinic as well as recent progress in IDH mutant and BRAF fusion gliomas &nbsp;(P. Wen). We will discuss preclinical modeling of glioblastoma for improved intratumoral drug delivery and challenges of &nbsp;translating discoveries from the lab to the clinic (S. Lawler). Insights from studies of epigenetic regulation in IDH mutant glioma (M. Castro) will provide an overview of the major challenges and promise in the field at this time.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"117","Key":"0a0c9bf7-7097-4264-98de-654684db4a47","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 15 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS02.
