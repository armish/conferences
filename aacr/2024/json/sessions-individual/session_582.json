The 6-base genome enables an understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic?variations, the discovery of novel biomarkers, and the ability to derive insight into gene expression, chromatin architecture, and gene regulatory mechanisms. We will explore how this novel technology is being applied to unlock transformative insights into current and future states of disease.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"582","Key":"fe2dbccf-2356-4735-8f19-8fe111e4c090","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Biomodal","Number":"ESP5E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP5E.
