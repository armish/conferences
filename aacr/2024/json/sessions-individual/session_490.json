Tumors with mutations in or pharmacologic inhibition of enzymes that promote chromatin compaction exhibit higher interferon signaling due to de-repression of genomic repetitive elements. In addition, epigenetic repression of genes important for T cell activation response can be reversed by inhibition of epigenetic regulators in cancer. This session will cover the immune effects of targeting epigenetic regulators, both through their actions on genes and repetitive elements. In addition, we will discuss how best to combine epigenetic with immune therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade and cellular therapies. Lastly, we will cover epigenetic correlates of immunotherapy response and resistance to cellular therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"490","Key":"b4d2721e-57ec-4bf2-a662-dd41e98d91fb","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED17","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED17.
