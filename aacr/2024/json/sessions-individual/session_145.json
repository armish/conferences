While the field of cancer neuroscience is still in its infancy, it has already made significant impact on cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical oncology. Foundational discoveries on how the nervous system regulates cancer, informed us on the potential role of targeting nervous system&ndash;cancer interactions; and its potential to become a pillar of oncological therapy, joining traditional approaches such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy and recently, the pillar of immunotherapy. Just like the immune system, the nervous system has an evolutionary role in host protection. In this session we will discuss how neural regulation of normal organ and immune development, homeostasis, and plasticity\/regeneration, are hijacked by cancer; and importantly, how those can be targeted. We will report recent advancement in systems biology that allowed studying these complex interactions between the cancer cells, nerves, and other components of the tumor microenvironment, that established nerves as a new actionable hallmark of cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"145","Key":"a5a0a1ff-b7aa-4c73-bef8-4cabae9573e3","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 5 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY31","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY31.
