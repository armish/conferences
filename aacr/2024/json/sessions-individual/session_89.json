These changes affect multiple layers of chromatin organization, such as histone modifications, chromatin loops, domains, and compartments. These layers are not independent, but modifying one will likely affect the others. Thus, to understand the role of chromatin alterations in cancer development and response to therapies is necessary to decipher the interplay among various layers of chromatin organization. In this session, we will discuss the effect of histone post-translation modifications mediated by cancer alterations, how changes in chromatin 3D organization impact in tumor evolution, and how chromosomal rearrangements and extra-chromosomal DNA contribute to chromatin remodeling. Integrating these different perspectives will help us understand how cancer cells exploit chromatin architecture to establish oncogenic phenotypes.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"89","Key":"08c7a207-cf30-448f-8b3e-ede7cdd9aa7c","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY05.
