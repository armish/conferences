Testing drug responsiveness of primary cells from tumors with no or limited passaging offers the capacity to evaluate a far greater and more diverse repertoire of therapies than can be tested in a clinical setting. This information can be combined with omics data to discover novel applications of drugs and drug classes within specific disease subsets. Ex vivo drug sensitivity data can also directly inform therapeutic strategies for individual patients in a way that is agnostic of and complementary to other approaches, such as genomics. This session will feature presentations that will showcase the development of cutting-edge ex vivo tumor organ models for both liquid and solid tumors, highlight different assay formats and readouts for drug activity, provide examples for use of ex vivo data to drive biomarker and mechanistic discovery for response and resistance to single-agents and drug combinations, and illustrate the power of functional precision medicine to drive personalized therapeutic decisions.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"76","Key":"86965f36-94dc-4d35-9a96-8b09ae6b12e4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT03.
