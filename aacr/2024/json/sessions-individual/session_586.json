HANG can easily embed various substances, and after subcutaneous inoculation, it migrates to lymph nodes and enables activation\/proliferation of infused cells through activated APC. In mice models conducted as preclinical studies, we observed robust proliferation\/activation of infused cells in various organs including tumor tissues and complete eradications of established tumors. Intensive analysis revealed the induction of host long-lasting immune responses against various neo-antigens other than vaccinated antigens, that is, &ldquo;Antigen-Spreading&rdquo;. The HANG vaccine is expected to maximize the efficacy of cell therapy, and preparations for combinatorial clinical trial are underway.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"586","Key":"18044e0b-f75d-4e09-a22b-2015e08cacf4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Asahi Kasei Corp.","Number":"ESP6D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP6D.
