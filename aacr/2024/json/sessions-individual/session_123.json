In this session, we will first present new avenues of discovery to set the stage for improvements in risk assessment and early detection using an innovative platform design, and describe advanced technologies to understand the presence, burden and responsiveness of patient tumors to treatment using plasma whole genome sequencing. We will also present a detailed molecular analysis to discern treatment responses and mechanisms of resistance in BRCA-mutant pancreatic cancer, as a model for the evolution of precision oncology in this disease.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"123","Key":"7ffa949a-b63c-4c6a-baa3-e6b4c0c8ef11","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS08.
