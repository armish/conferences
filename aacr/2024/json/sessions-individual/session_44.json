FDA has historically contended that LDTs are in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), which it regulates as devices, but generally applied regulatory discretion. Over the past four decades, LDTs have grown from simple lab tests to advanced assays sold commercially. As the complexity of LDTs advances, it is critical that patients and providers receive accurate and effective tests, regardless of the manufacturer. This session will feature an historical overview of diagnostic regulation in the United States and discuss how FDA&rsquo;s existing pilot program and regulatory framework on diagnostics can facilitate the development of personalized medicines and targeted therapies in oncology. This session will bring together key stakeholders to discuss implementation related to submitting LDT performance data during clinical studies, establishing minimum performance characteristics, and engaging clinical laboratories. Presentations will be followed by an interactive discussion between attendees and speakers to discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing this new regulatory framework for LDTs. &nbsp;&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"44","Key":"ff4a52ff-d96e-4f67-98f2-0c09c9a9a0e4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC01.
