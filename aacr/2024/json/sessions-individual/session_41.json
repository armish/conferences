Eligible candidates must continue to be active in cancer research, have a record of recent, noteworthy publications, and be conducting ongoing work that holds promise for continued substantive contributions to progress in the field of cancer. The award is intended to honor an individual scientist. However, more than one scientist may be co-nominated and selected to share the award in the event that their investigations are intimately related in subject matter and have resulted in work that is worthy of the award and a joint nomination.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 12:45:00 PM","EndTime":"12:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"41","Key":"c8797fcc-2e85-49ff-b109-be255c74eb1d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"LE19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"LE19.
