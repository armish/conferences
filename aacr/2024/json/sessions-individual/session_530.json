In particular, ctDNA analyses play a crucial role not only in detecting treatment resistance and therapeutic targets but also in monitoring therapy response and identifying high-risk patients by detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) after surgery or other treatments.Â <\/p>\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a<p><br \/>\u000d\u000aIn this educational session, benefits and challenges of ctDNA analyses in both advanced and early cancers will be presented. The speakers will discuss how clinicians can make informed decisions regarding treatment adjustments by tracking changes in tumor genetic profiles and how ctDNA molecular response can be used as an early endpoint of response focusing on immunotherapy. Existing and emerging liquid biopsy approaches to monitor therapy response, to identify high-risk patients with early stage cancer at diagnosis, in the neoadjuvant setting, and in the postoperative setting to more accurately assess prognosis and the need for adjuvant therapy will be reviewed. The speakers will also focus on how these concepts could and are being translated into clinical trial designs.<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"530","Key":"5d9e6f9c-b543-4855-af04-facd0cc6db60","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED28","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED28.
