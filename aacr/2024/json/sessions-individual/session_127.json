The session will describe the short-term and long-term effects of changes in screening rates as a result of the pandemic and describe mitigating factors to address any shortfalls in screening among the major cancers as a result of the pandemic. The session will also highlight racial and ethnic disparities that occurred before the pandemic and how the pandemic and any recovery of cancer screening rates post-pandemic might be different for racial and ethnic groups. With any continue disparities for cancer screening post pandemic, mitigation approaches will be discussed.<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"127","Key":"42c2c5a8-ddc5-4bfc-8fcb-2b66c65f2b7b","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APS02.
