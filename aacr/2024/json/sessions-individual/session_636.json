Within the overall research mission, DCP has several priority areas: 1.) cancer early detection biomarker development and screening; 2.) intervention development for cancer prevention; 3.) precision cancer prevention; 4.) symptom science and management; and 5.) workforce development.  In this session from DCP, we will share funding mechanisms and research resources that span these priority areas and signature programs within the Division.   \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThis information includes the combination and synergy of the Cancer Prevention-Interception Targeted Agent Discovery Program (CAP-IT), PREVENT Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program (PREVENT), and Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (CP-CTNet) designed to collectively support the discovery and development of new molecularly and immunologically targeted agents and bring these agents to individuals at high-risk for developing cancer through early-phase clinical trials.  DCP also oversees large clinical trials through NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) designed to bring clinical trials with the most promising prevention, treatment, and symptom management regimens to patients in their communities and serve as a key pathway for translation of research results into practice.  The reach of NCORP is extended through opportunities for individuals to submit investigator-initiated research proposals (i.e., R01s) that leverage the NCORP network, with preapproval.    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThis presentation will also include DCP’s interests in symptom science across areas such as: defining basic mechanisms of cancer treatment-related toxicities and symptoms; characterizing symptoms and chronic toxicities from cancer treatment in the clinic; and developing, verifying, and validating endpoints for assessing symptoms and chronic toxicities in symptom management clinical trials.  DCP’s research and programs are supported through a variety of mechanisms, including grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts.  We will highlight and explain these and other targeted funding opportunities throughout the presentation. We will conclude with showcasing efforts to expand and enhance the cancer prevention research workforce through programs such as: DCP’s Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, a postdoctoral fellowship program on-site at NCI with over 35 years of experience training leaders in cancer prevention research; the newly created NCI Worta McCaskill-Stevens Career Development Award for Community Oncology and Prevention Research K12 award; and a new opportunity to highlight early career scientists conducting research within the mission of DCP.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"636","Key":"090d25a6-c073-47c1-84e9-440db3a30429","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH11.
