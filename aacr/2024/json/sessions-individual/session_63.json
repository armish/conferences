These breakthroughs yield profound insights from patient samples, such as tumor biopsies, which are instrumental in the selection of cancer treatments and the comprehension of treatment responses. However, the vast and complex datasets produced by spatial experiments call for sophisticated computational tools to effectively interpret the spatial distribution and function of cells within tissues. This session aims to address the computational hurdles in spatial biology and will highlight how machine learning algorithms are being applied to decode tissue structure and cellular organization, specifically within the realm of cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"63","Key":"2b8cf174-c517-4abb-9b9a-ad23c6007312","LastUpdated":"2024-03-08 20:10","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AT01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AT01.
