Importantly, the use of spatial omics and comprehensive NGS discovery techniques can now address the complexity of the cellular network and tumor microenvironment using various high-dimensional exploration of both tissue and blood samples, at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic, level to ascertain overall treatment responses. Our presentations will showcase the utility of innovative next-generation solutions focused on cancer biology while also addressing markers that may help in predicting clinical responses and mechanisms of resistance to therapy.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"652","Key":"87725124-a33f-4057-966b-4219b7ce6dec","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"NeoGenomics","Number":"ESP4E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP4E.
