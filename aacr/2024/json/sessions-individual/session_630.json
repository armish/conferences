Successfully competing for NIH\/NCI funding requires up-to-date knowledge regarding funding and review policies. In this session, NCI and NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR) staff will provide an interactive session to update basic and translational researchers on current policies and funding opportunities. This session provides an opportunity for early-stage and established investigators to interact directly with NCI and CSR staff.  \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aSpeakers for the 2024 NIH Grants Session include Dr. Dan Gallahan, the Director of the Division of Cancer Biology (DCB), Dr. Amy Rubenstein, the Chief of the Basic and Translational Cancer Review Branch within CSR, and Dr. Shannon Hughes, DCB Deputy Director. Topics to be covered include current funding trends in foundational cancer biology research, new grants policies (such as the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy), and changes in CSR review (including the upcoming change in NIH review criteria). Significant time will be conserved for questions from the audience. Additionally, NCI program staff will be in attendance to speak with participants after the session to answer further questions.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 1:00:00 PM","EndTime":"13:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"630","Key":"15b3ea2a-55d8-4b12-bb1d-2e75a78a340d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH05.
