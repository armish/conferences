Darwinian adaptation applied to somatic cell evolution in the human body is the best conceptual framework we have to describe how adult tissues change over time. Whether evolution is predictable is an old question in evolutionary biology, but whereas in the context of species this is almost a philosophical inquiry, in oncology predicting and potentially controlling or delaying evolution would have an enormous impact on treatment and prevention. In this session we will discuss what are the forces and dynamics that influence tumor initiation and evolution, and to what extent the predictability argument is valid for cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"86","Key":"10dfb6f6-367b-4f79-9152-d86f21eea7cb","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY02.
