The functional state of T cells however is directly regulated by myeloid cells. While dendritic cells can impact T cell activation as well as restimulation in the lymph node and the tumor, macrophage populations are instrumental in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment. Myeloid cells are highly enriched in the tumor, thus making it an ideal yet underused target for combination immunotherapy. In this session we will discuss how dendritic cells and macrophages affect the functional state of T cells throughout the cancer immunity cycle and how this cell population can be perturbed therapeutically.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"151","Key":"c20607f3-65b2-4003-abc4-bd2bb7787442","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY37","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY37.
