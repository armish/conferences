Moreover, the panel stated that efforts to reach diverse racial\/ethnic (R\/E) and underserved populations should be prioritized. Towards these goals, NCI launched the Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network. The goals of this network are to promote and support research on direct participant engagement approaches and to use such approaches to address knowledge gaps in the genomic characterizations of tumors in areas including R\/E minority and other underserved populations. The engagement of these populations may be facilitated using community liaisons. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aTo enhance genetic education and research participation among R\/E diverse populations in the PE-CGS network, NCI launched the Community Health Educator supplement program to support utilization of community liaisons, e.g., community health educators (CHE) and lay health advisors (LHA), to implement culturally tailored genetic education interventions, increase genetic counseling and risk assessment participation among R\/E populations, and increase participation in genetic research.  Supplements were awarded to support engagement of Hispanic\/Latino patients with osteosarcoma, patients\/communities with low-grade glioma and colorectal cancer, as well as African American patients with colorectal cancer and patients with multiple myeloma. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThis session will include a panel of investigators that will provide an overview of the strategies, challenges, and lessons learned that may be applied to the broader research community to support genetics research and clinical implementation genetic testing in underrepresented communities.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:15:00 AM","EndTime":"11:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"633","Key":"13613526-6a73-4be9-afcb-d38181b37cbf","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH08.
