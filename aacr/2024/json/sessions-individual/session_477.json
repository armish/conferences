On the other hand, companies are beginning to use knock-out cells for antibody characterization - the “gold standard”.  Using a protocol agreed to by 10 different companies, we characterized >1,000 commercial antibodies for 100 neuroscience targets in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation applications using knock-out cells as controls. Our study revealed that for these human proteins and for these applications, there is at least one selective, renewable antibody already on the market. Unfortunately, these best performing antibody are often not used in publications, as scientists continue to refer to the literature or Google to select antibodies for their experiments. This consensus “knock-out cell characterization” protocol should be applied to proteins implicated in cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"477","Key":"d0fd5fab-46bd-441f-be73-65af0e06112d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW13.
