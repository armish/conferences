We will highlight existing resources including aggregated information about existing cohorts that can be found through the NCI Cohort Consortium. The UK Biobank will be described as an existing cohort with rich exposure information and mature cancer outcomes. For emerging cohorts, the rationale, current recruitment metrics, and future data sharing policy from the Connect for Cancer Prevention Study will be shared. The value of combining experimental data together with cohort data for cancer etiology discoveries will be exemplified with the DISCERN study. From this session, attendees can expect to know where to find more information about existing cohorts, what to expect from currently recruiting cohorts, and how to utilize cohort data for future discoveries.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"534","Key":"075b79ea-3571-40cc-a6d0-17e24d46d2db","LastUpdated":"2024-03-08 17:28","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 11 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED32.
