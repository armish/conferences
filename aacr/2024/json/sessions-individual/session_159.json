During the discussion, Dr. Katy Rezvani will explore new engineered NK cell designs and novel combination therapies emerging from ongoing clinical trials. Dr. Jurgen Kuball will delve into the latest insights in g9d2T cell biology, highlighting how this knowledge shapes the creation of engineered immune cells and bispecific engagers utilizing defined gdT cell receptors. Additionally, Dr. Michel Klichinsky will expand upon the recent clinical data involving engineered macrophages, shedding light on innovative designs based on these insights.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"159","Key":"b7af2e3d-347f-4877-945f-2c458a929dbc","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 A - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY45","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY45.
