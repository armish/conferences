To better use cancer research data, new analysis methods are being rapidly developed. This session will provide an overview of three emerging areas of data analysis in cancer research. First, single-cell spatial omics analysis methods, together with artificial intelligence approaches, will be discussed. Single-cell spatial omics analyses can provide a deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and help identify candidate biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Second, analysis methods for tumor phosphoproteomics will be presented. Tumor phosphoproteomics is a novel area of cancer analytics used to quantify kinase activities and its relationship to therapeutic response. Third, an overview of the ITCR Training Network will be shared. The ITCR Training Network is a collaborative effort of researchers around the United States to support cancer informatics and data science training through resources, technology, and events. Collectively, the presentations in this session will introduce important data analysis methods that are playing an increasingly large role in cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"493","Key":"df1641bc-b468-4ebf-9701-bea2d10baf73","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW09.
