Single cell analysis has provided new vistas on the diversity, interplay in the TME, diagnostic and therapeutic significance of tumor-associated myeloid cells. Indeed, myeloid cells are double edged swords in the host-tumor cell interaction. They include diverse populations in terms of origin and function and these can serve as cancer propellers and mediate resistance to immunotherapy. Conversely, appropriately activated myeloid cells ortheir subsets can elicit or be part of mechanism of antitumor resistance. The session will provide an overview of the diversity, functions and therapeutic targeting of myeloid cells in cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"524","Key":"a55ac91f-836e-423a-9b00-e711a6e57601","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED23","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED23.
