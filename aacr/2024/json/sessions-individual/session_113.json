Despite this progress, targeted therapeutic approaches for many frequent molecular subtypes of AML are lacking and developing immunotherapeutic approaches for AML has been challenging. This session will present exciting research aimed at overcoming these barriers to AML therapy.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000aWe will begin with an overview of current strategies for AML with a focus on increasingly individualized treatment options by Dr. Courtney DiNardo (MD Anderson Cancer Center). This will include a discussion of several promising approaches in clinical development.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000aDr. Gabriele Casirati (Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital\/Dana Farber Cancer Institute), a 2024 AACR NextGen Star, will then present state-of-the-art gene editing approaches to develop novel cellular immunotherapies for patients with AML. Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) will follow with presentation of novel cell surface targets to effectively discriminate malignant from normal cells in patients with myeloid neoplasms.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000aFinally, the session will conclude with exciting research from Dr. Ravi Majeti (Stanford University) on pre-leukemic stem cells and approaches to correct somatic mutations in AML to assess impact on leukemia stem cells.<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"113","Key":"dc50ce07-c1d5-45cd-9efa-4e9cb51742f3","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 14 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AHM04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AHM04.
