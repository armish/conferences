In early tumorigenesis cell competition&nbsp;acts both as a tumour suppressive factor, eliminating transformed cells, and as&nbsp;a tumour promoting force, highjacked by cells that acquire oncogenic&nbsp;mutations,&nbsp;such as mutations in p53 or Apc. Tumour heterogeneity can lead to intratumor&nbsp;cell competition and drive the dissemination of locally less dominant clones. As&nbsp;such, metastasis is not necessarily driven by&nbsp;dominant clone but could be&nbsp;driven by a non-dominant loser clone within the primary tumor.&nbsp;Clonal cooperation&nbsp;instead is emerging as a strategy for transformed cells to evade their out-competition&nbsp;by non-tumour&nbsp;neighbours. Throughout, we will discuss current insights into the&nbsp;mechanisms of cell competition and how these can be leveraged as therapeutic&nbsp;opportunities in cancer.<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"91","Key":"4dabf610-68bf-44f6-95c4-aa4d869e597d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY07.
