The session will focus on new mechanisms regulating the G1\/S transition, the crucial step in committing cells to division, and the conceptual and molecular links to the field of cellular senescence. The speakers will highlight their new work that challenges traditional models of the cell cycle, emphasizing novel regulatory mechanisms that may be targets for new therapeutic strategies or revise how we think current therapies function. For example, while the large cell size typical of senescent cells was thought to be a simple consequence of cell cycle arrest, we now see how large cell size per se can promote the senescent state. This likely relates to the function of cytostatic cancer therapies including CDK4\/6 inhibitors targeting breast cancer. Key technologies that are enabling this research revising the cell cycle include single cell imaging and analysis, AI-driven structural approaches, and high-throughput screening technologies.Â ","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"531","Key":"570bd24a-6334-4632-b025-4e709373bb83","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED29.
