Advanced particle delivery systems, breakthroughs in the genomics of radiation biology and an enhanced understanding of the interaction of the immune system with radiotherapy for response and delivery have given us unprecedented opportunities to advance patient care. This session will highlight novel approaches to understand each of these advances, tying them into treatment planning approaches available to us today. A robust discussion of both tumor and normal tissues responses based on genomic biomarkers, as well as new findings in T-cell and tumor microenvironment interactions with radiation will set the stage for a synthesis that will provide a roadmap for new understanding of the biology and opportunities for tomorrow&rsquo;s patients as well.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Dharma Master Jiantai,<\/strong> for whom this Session is named, was a brave young Abbess who dedicated her life to dharma teaching. She was a never-smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although not available to her at the time, targeted treatments are now available for the mutation that was identified in Dharma Master Jiantai&rsquo;s cancer. According to her wishes and in memory of Dharma Master Jiantai, her family established an endowment to support the Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Lung Cancer Research Session, Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Targeted Therapy, and Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Biomarkers Session. The family&rsquo;s goal is to foster cancer research that leads to new drug development, so that patients with cancer will live longer, have better quality of life, and potentially reach a cure in select cases.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"143","Key":"d9bba32a-2066-47c0-874d-727a18b0852d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 14 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY29.
