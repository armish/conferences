This allows the identification of single nucleotide variants, structural variants, and epigenetic modifications on a haplotype level &mdash; from a single dataset. In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore how these technical benefits open up a new window of understanding into cancer genomes, featuring projects ranging from cancer whole-genome sequencing to cell-free DNA with methylation, and single-cell sequencing.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"650","Key":"bdb5fc98-61d5-4b9f-bbd7-01fccbd33f6d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Oxford Nanopore<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP4B","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP4B.
