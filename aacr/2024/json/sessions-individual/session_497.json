The family-wise error rate (FWER) will be contrasted to the false discovery rate control.  The importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will be discussed, and approaches presented for improving our use of PROs as endpoints in clinical trials.  Novel phase 3 trial designs will be presented, including basket, umbrella, platform, and enrichment designs.  ","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"497","Key":"b88f0f6e-14a1-4591-8663-0ddeba82a361","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 29 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW05.
