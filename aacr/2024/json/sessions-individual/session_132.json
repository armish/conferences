The human microbiome has been found to interact with the host in various body sites. While few microbes directly cause cancer, many appear to be complicit, and some may even promote the host&#39;s antitumor immunity. The microbiome&#39;s influence on cancer is multifaceted, involving aspects such as immune responses, genotoxicity, and metabolism. This session will focus on ongoing research to evaluate the clinical utility of understanding the roles of microbes in cancer and to explore potential therapeutic implications. While the field of microbiome and cancer research has grown significantly in recent years, further studies are needed to fully characterize the human microbiome and its relationship with cancer risk, including the study of fungi, protists, and viruses in addition to bacteria and archaea.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"132","Key":"36aaacba-b9e0-4dd2-886e-2620211852c4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 28 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY18","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY18.
