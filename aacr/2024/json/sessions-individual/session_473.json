The use of mass spectrometry spans all stages of therapeutics discovery from understanding fundamental biology and metabolism, to hit discovery, target deconvolution and profiling of advanced leads. In this session, we will discuss widely used chemo-proteomics approaches spanning a broad range of applications. Importantly, we will not only discuss the advances and powerful use cases but also some of the limitations and how these approaches fit into the larger picture of drug","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"473","Key":"71dda717-a74b-4e80-9684-b3f0f9847c33","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED03.
