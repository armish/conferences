This abnormal cell cycle control not only directly contributes to tumorigenesis, but also provides unique therapeutic opportunities. Indeed, cell cycle pathways are rich in potential drug targets, as exemplified by the successful development of specific CDK4\/6 inhibitors that target the cyclin D-Rb pathway. However, CDKs with broader cell cycle functions than CDK4\/6 are also emerging as important and promising therapeutic targets, including CDK2 and CDK1. This session will focus on strategies that target these other CDKs in cancers with new CDK inhibitors, or by CDK agonists that inhibit normal checkpoint controls(e.g. Wee1, Myt1) and cause inappropriately high CDK activity.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"133","Key":"f38126ef-b675-444f-957d-0b51c7403211","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY19.
