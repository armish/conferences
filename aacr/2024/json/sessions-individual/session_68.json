In this session, we will introduce various, unbiased, functional approaches that go beyond identifying the presence of these alterations to understand how they affect the behavior of cancer cells, contribute to the disease&rsquo;s development and progression, and lead to the emergence of new vulnerabilities. We will present how we use large-scale CRISPR viability datasets to identify context-specific dependencies. PRIME editing to identify resistant mutations at scale. Innovative CRISPR-based strategies to systematically identify drivers of copy number alterations. Finally, we will present single-cell functional approaches to systematically examine the influence of the tumor microenvironment.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"68","Key":"3c837776-45ca-4e1e-ad32-5a49e23a9f6d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 CF - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AT06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AT06.
