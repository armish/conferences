But cancer is complex, presenting a daunting task. We introduce two novel applications to more easily interpret cancer heterogeneity. First, Navignostics is breaking ground as the first institution to translate spatial insights into the clinic. They are leveraging spatial proteomics into actionable reporting within 72 hours of sample receipt, which is revolutionizing treatment decisions. Second, the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute is pioneering rapid whole slide imaging, scaling multiplexed histopathology measurements with simultaneous detection of immune cells, metabolic states, disease-specific pathways and biomarkers.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"578","Key":"64271578-b0fb-42d2-9f8a-9cfc3b8f1dbf","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Standard Bio","Number":"ESP4D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP4D.
