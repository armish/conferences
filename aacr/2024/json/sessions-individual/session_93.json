Increasing evidence suggests that exercise, physical fitness, and adhering to a prudent or &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; diet may deter or delay cancer progression through multiple pathways including direct effects on tumor intrinsic factors, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects, etc. However, the majority of data come from studies focused on breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, and the question remains under-studied in other cancer types, as well as among racially\/ethnically and other socio-demographically under-represented populations. We will summarize epidemiologic evidence and recommendations and highlight plausible biological mechanisms by which physical activity or diet affect cancer progression and death. We will also discuss challenges and lessons learned around how to motivate health behavior changes at an individual and community level. We will discuss gaps, solutions, and recommendations for the future.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"93","Key":"6fd99815-09e6-4190-9765-b7414570b706","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY08.
