As such, considerable attention has turned to the application of these findings to immunotherapy. Dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies as well as conventional dendritic cell modulating compounds are a quickly evolving field within cancer therapy. In this session, we will highlight new discoveries in the field of dendritic cell biology and anti-tumor immunity and discuss their implications for cancer immunotherapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"527","Key":"7d631084-38b7-4668-a3dd-b3acd3670544","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED26","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED26.
