This increase varies by cancer sites, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Factors responsible for this rise are unclear and may not be driven by increased screening. Several risk factors documented to have a co-incident increase with early onset cancers have been identified, including changes in diet, commercial food processing, microbial dysbiosis, early antibiotic exposure, environmental pollutants (e.g., estrogen disrupting chemicals, air pollution) higher rates of obesity and decreased physical activity; however, further research is needed to elucidate the role of these factors in the etiology of EO cancer. If the trends in EO cancers continue, the prevalence of younger cancer survivors will also be increasing with unknown impact on cancer survivorship and outcomes in adults at the prime of their life. Overarchingly, there are research gaps in the areas of etiology, prevention, and survivorship of EO cancers. This NCI-sponsored session, with representation across the DOCs, will provide a brief overview of the scientific problem, highlight relevant NCIâ€™s notice of funding research opportunities, activities and resources, and outline research gaps in etiology, prevention, and survivorship. The objectives of the session include (i) sharing knowledge and programmatic information and (ii) identifying research\/resource needs to address the alarming pattern of EO cancers.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 3:30:00 PM","EndTime":"15:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"627","Key":"61255d77-c731-4774-ab6f-3c2b080b8b1f","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH02: ","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH02: .
