One major question that will be addressed is how we can identify the causes (environmental, genetic or both) that underlie these differences. Another major question is to what degree do these differences affect outcomes and\/or treatment responses. Concepts from human population genetics (genetic ancestry and genetic admixture) will be reviewed. The session is intended for both population scientists and molecular oncologists interested in understanding more about this topic.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"483","Key":"613a7e04-e628-4377-8544-53abecb497ce","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED10.
