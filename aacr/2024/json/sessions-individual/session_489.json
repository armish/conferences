These highly repetitive sequences include long and short interspersed elements (LINEs and SINEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Recently we have come to understand that cancers show epigenetic dysregulation and altered transcription of these elements as compared to normal tissues. This includes the expression of LINE-1 retrotransposons, elements with protein-coding and mutagenic potential, as well as other repeats that can produce tumor antigens or immunostimulatory RNAs. In this session, we will provide a primer on interspersed repeats and transposable elements, describe their epigenetic landscape, and contributions to the transcriptome in malignancies. We will provide an update on studies aimed to leverage LINE-1 biology for novel approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment. We will consider approaches to develop an integrated perspective on repeat expression and immune responses to cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"489","Key":"ea81237f-ccd0-4e34-ac2d-c71a6f3283af","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED16","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED16.
