In our presentation, scientific experts will introduce new liquid biopsy workflows and describe the identification of neoantigens from various cancer types. Session 1: Preanalytical workflows for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are well established for plasma but are lacking for urine samples. This session will walk you through urine cfDNA workflows, focusing on sample stabilization. Session 2: Neoantigen-based immunotherapy as a vaccine strategy can potentially provide personalized cancer treatment. This session will present the identification and validation of immunogenic neoantigens from RNA fusions across cancer types using NGS technology.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"571","Key":"48f95d5c-d112-40e0-9da8-9deda44e58f1","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"QIAGEN","Number":"ESP3D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP3D.
