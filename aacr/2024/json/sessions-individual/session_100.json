These innovative medicines act as molecular matchmakers that work by inducing proximity between disease targets and powerful biological effectors. Instead of trying to grapple with difficult targets on their own, proximity-based therapeutics mobilize biological mechanisms or cellular effectors to do the heavy lifting. Proximity-based therapeutics can yield a variety of outcomes on disease targets, including degradation, inhibition, activation, or relocation. This symposium on Emerging Induced Proximity Therapeutic Modalities will bring together academic and industry scientists to share the most recent advances in this exciting and innovative area of drug discovery and chemical biology with important impacts on cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"100","Key":"0f5229dd-230d-45ff-9b96-c2c25edf96f7","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY13.
