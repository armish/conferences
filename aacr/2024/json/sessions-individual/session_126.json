Many early-onset cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with unique molecular signatures. Such concerning trends underscore the urgency to investigate contributing risk factors throughout the life course, as well as the need to prioritize prevention in early life stages, early detection, precision treatment, and patient outcomes. In this session, we aim to cast a spotlight on the rising incidence of early-onset cancers and forge a path forward. We will highlight advances in risk factor identification, molecular signatures, mechanistic understanding, and treatment of early-onset cancers, using colorectal cancer and breast cancer as exemplars. A key part of our discussion will involve addressing the conceptual and methodological challenges faced in the field, underscoring the imperative for innovative, collaborative, and inclusive research efforts needed to address the major gaps in evidence. We will also highlight the pivotal roles of community and patient engagement from diverse populations in advancing our collective efforts to reduce the impact of early-onset cancers on the younger population and future generations.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"126","Key":"56a80b74-a6c0-4b7b-9230-9d11c2a5fa83","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 14 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"APS01.
