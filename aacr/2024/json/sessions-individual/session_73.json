It is a multifactorial wasting syndrome associated with loss of muscle and\/or fat mass, poor performance status, intolerance to cancer therapies and poor clinical outcomes. Despite efforts in the field to investigate the tumor and host factors underlying cancer cachexia, there are thus far no globally approved therapeutic interventions, and we have a limited understanding of its exact biological and mechanistic underpinnings. This session will focus on recent advances in the field from pre-clinical to clinical studies endeavoring to profile the cachexia phenotype, develop functional insights, and discover novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"73","Key":"6caf31fa-8ee4-4be6-b555-7fada2adb37d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 16 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT01.
