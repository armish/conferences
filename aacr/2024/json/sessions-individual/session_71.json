Some of the largest-magnitude differences in breast cancer burden are observed between populations subsets with African ancestry compared to those with predominantly European ancestry, and between impoverished versus affluent communities. Germline genetic variants linked to western sub-Saharan African ancestry have been shown to influence hereditary susceptibility for distinct breast cancer subtypes. The context of social and environmental exposures as well as access to oncology services will also impact breast cancer risk. This session will explore the complex interactions of these various factors on breast cancer risk in admixed populations and diverse communities. We will address questions of how and when genetic ancestry should be assessed in breast cancer research; we will also address the utility and limitations of existing models for quantifying socioeconomic status in breast cancer disparities research. All of these factors will be relevant in next generation applications for functional genomics and precision medicine in oncology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"71","Key":"33e95360-ed40-4675-9ac6-06202f93e438","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ASD02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ASD02.
