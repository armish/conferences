Therefore, it should come as no surprise that doctors, scientists, and regulators have personal and caregiver experience with a variety of cancers which inform their perspectives on advancing safe and effective cancer therapies. FDA panelists will discuss their personal experience after receiving a cancer diagnosis or caring for a family member with cancer. This session will explore how being a patient or caregiver has impacted how drugs and clinical trials are reviewed within FDA. The session will also explore how being a physician or a regulator impacted being a patient or caregiver and provide perspectives from those impacted by this devastating disease including diagnosis, treatment, grief, and survivorship. Join us for this session on the personal intersection of cancer and regulatory science.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"47","Key":"563c1725-4b6a-487a-b25b-47181037cee4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC04.
