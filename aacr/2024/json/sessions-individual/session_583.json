While the method has presented numerous challenges, speakers from Indiana University and Cellecta will delve into how they have used this technique to obtain a greater understanding of patients&#39; adaptive immune responses in squamous carcinoma and other diseases. They&rsquo;ll share data generated using the DriverMap AIR assay, a multiplex-RT-PCR and NGS-based assay, highlighting its utility and promise. Don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to learn the state of the art in adaptive immune profiling!","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"583","Key":"c8089a2e-4116-4640-94eb-84b7691f40d4","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Cellecta","Number":"ESP8B","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP8B.
