Dr. McCoy will introduce how the microbiome and microbial metabolites can modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Dr. McCoy will also show experimental data on the interactions of the microbiome on CAR-T cell therapy responsiveness. Dr. Jenq will discuss studies linking the microbiome to immune checkpoint inhibitor-related colitis and graft-versus-host disease. Dr. van den Brink will discuss clinical and preclinical studies demonstrating how changes in the intestinal microbiome can affect outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation and CAR T cell therapy. He will also discuss how diet and drugs can affect the microbiome and can be targeted for therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"131","Key":"46bdf26f-cbd6-4b1f-a32b-c5391f1016a9","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 16 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY17","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY17.
