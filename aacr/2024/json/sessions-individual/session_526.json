Despite being central orchestrators of the tumor immune response, our understanding of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in tumors and the ways in which they can be harnessed therapeutically continues to lag our understanding of CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells. This session is focused on the status of what is known about CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells in tumors and highlights the exciting avenues being explored for their therapeutic targeting. Topics to be discussed will include emerging evidence of sex-based differences in tumor associated regulatory CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells; the indirect ways in which CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells mediate antitumor immunity and cell-based therapies targeting these functions; and the ways in which cytotoxic CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and their TCRs can be harnessed to mediate direct tumor cell killing.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"526","Key":"763a58bb-f2ff-435f-965d-a58c2ec261bb","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED25","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED25.
