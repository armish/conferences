Radiation-induced metabolic rewiring that takes place in the tumor cells ultimately impacts the tumor microenvironment, its immune landscape and immune response. Studies will be presented showing that metabolic rewiring is enabled by key, targetable metabolic regulators and promotes radiation resistance in glioblastoma and other tumors. Specifically, radiation therapy reprograms lactate metabolism in multiple types of cancers, including adenocarcinomas, and intracellular lactate levels alter radiation response. In glioblastoma, irradiated tumors reprogram glucose and serine metabolism to boost an antioxidant response that hampers the cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy. Moreover, irradiated glioblastoma cells generate unsaturated fatty acids and accumulation of lipids in the cancer cells prevents immune cell recruitment. Targeting lipid metabolism with focal radiation therapy prolongs survival of glioblastoma bearing mice. Improving our understanding of how metabolic plasticity promotes radiation resistance has the potential to reveal novel radiotherapeutic targets and improve outcomes in radioresistant tumors.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"144","Key":"8309e396-6443-45a6-a8f2-2e9ed4fa7fce","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 17 - Mezzanine Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY30","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY30.
