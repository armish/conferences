Harnessing this innovative approach, we undertook an in-depth study deciphering T cell functional phenotyping using spectral image-enabled cell sorting followed by single-cell epigenomic analyses covering whole transcriptome sequencing and in-depth characterization of the chromatin landscape using an ATAC-seq assay. In analyzing ~200,000 T cells sorted from an in vitro model of T cell activation, we have now compiled in-depth molecular and cellular dynamics data unveiling novel insights about T cell activation and biology. \u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"658","Key":"95314556-28d1-4569-b196-8dd6690567d9","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"BD Bio","Number":"ESP5D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP5D.
