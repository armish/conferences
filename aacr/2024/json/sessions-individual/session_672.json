Comprehensive characterization of multiple layers of biology at once, and at many levels of resolution (bulk, single cell, spatial, liquid biopsy), is therefore crucial to enable the entire cancer research continuum: from discovery through clinical research. This session will highlight sequencing methods, such as &gt;2M cell single cell sequencing and liquid biopsy-based profiling of multiple omes, that are now possible due to unprecedented sequencing power at historically low cost.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"672","Key":"47746044-dbdb-4c05-9fd6-27ab632c572a","LastUpdated":"2024-03-01 14:01","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":null,"MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Illumina","Number":"ESP1C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP1C.
