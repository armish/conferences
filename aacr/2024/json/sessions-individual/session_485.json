There is increasing interest from researchers to understand how best to incorporate these measures in their research. During this educational session we will discuss these concepts and constructs and relevant conceptual frameworks for understanding their impact on health. We will share approaches for measuring structural and social determinants of health in research studies (structural racism, persistent poverty, rurality, and attributes of the social and built environment), as well as how these drivers intersect with race, ethnicity, and other characteristics to impact cancer health outcomes, and disparities\/inequities in outcomes.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/5\/2024 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"485","Key":"fff9172f-03da-4449-ab54-e66618d6d27d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 6 DE - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED12.
