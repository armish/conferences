The variability in trial designs has created challenges in the interpretation of efficacy data, with implications for regulatory decision-making and clinical practice. A major challenge is the inability to attribute the treatment effects of ICIs administered in neoadjuvant settings, ICIs administered in adjuvant settings, and attribution of surgery. These limitations have generated uncertainty as to what constitutes the optimal perioperative regimen in clinical practice and what regimen(s) should comprise the control arms of the next generation of perioperative randomized trials. This session will bring together key stakeholders to discuss the challenges and opportunities for perioperative trial designs in solid tumors.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"53","Key":"938269c2-45ad-4b5b-ac0d-6bdbe5c234a2","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC10.
