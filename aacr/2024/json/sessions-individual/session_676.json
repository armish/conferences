Despite cumulative evidence from multiple quantitative and qualitative research studies documenting specific inequities, change remains elusive. The recent emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion is already facing a backlash. Part of the challenge is to determine how to make inequities, both large and small, visible. Creating space at work where people can record or share their experiences and observations of inequities, free from retaliation and shame, is challenging. In conjunction with normalizing challenging conversations, the lack of institutional data limits our ability to identify, track, and assess potential interventions designed to mitigate inequities. I will present the findings of a qualitative research study where I conducted in-depth, semi-structured, in person interviews with 52 women and 52 men who were medical school faculty members at 16 institutions across the United States in 2019. Institutions were recruited to seek diversity in geography, ownership (private or public), and prestige. Within institutions, purposive sampling was used to recruit equal numbers of women and men and to seek diversity in degree type (MD, PhD), age, and career stage. A coding scheme was developed through iterative analysis of the interview transcripts. All interview transcripts were then coded with the goal of identifying intersections between features of the academic medicine ecosystem and experiences of and responses to gender inequities. In this session, I will explore the institutional metrics that should be iteratively assessed. We cannot solve a problem we donâ€™t see and we cannot correct inequities we cannot measure.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 5:45:00 PM","EndTime":"17:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"676","Key":"1ce7a709-d22c-4759-b941-68752248d300","LastUpdated":"2024-03-11 12:02","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":null,"MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME02.
