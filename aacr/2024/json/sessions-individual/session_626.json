Recognizing the imperative for data availability, the National Institute of Health (NIH) Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy was announced in 2023 to promote broad and equitable scientific data sharing through open data practices that enable results validation, dataset accessibility, and data reuse, by supporting the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for digital assets.&#8239;&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aTo enable the successful sharing and use of multi-modal data, the NCI developed the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), providing access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer data. The CRDC is a cloud-based data science infrastructure that enables analysis where data resides. Over the past 10 years, the CRDC has made significant progress in providing access to data and tools, training, and outreach to support the cancer research community. The CRDC makes cancer datasets available to accelerate cancer research by facilitating data submission, sharing, access, interoperability, and integrative analysis of multi-modal data from multiple sources and data types. The CRDC combines biomedical and clinical data, cloud computation, analytics, and visualization tools to enable the cancer community to create and leverage new, more powerful ways to study cancer prediction, diagnosis, and treatment.&#8239;&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aCurrently, in Data Commons across the CRDC nearly 7 petabytes of cancer data is available for public data access, search, visualization, and analysis from over 350 studies including TCGA, HTAN, and CCDI. To analyze petabytes of CRDC data without the burden of downloading, NCI’s Cloud Resources bring data together with on-demand computational analysis tools and workflows in secure, collaborative cloud workspaces. Many researchers have utilized the resources available across the CRDC to result in important scientific success stories, ultimately leading to an impact on and improved outcomes for patients.&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aIn this session, we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the CRDC and provide an overview of the history and the impact of the CRDC on open science, as well as future plans to further promote data sharing, data accessibility, reuse, and interoperability.&#8239; \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"626","Key":"07545c02-8dcc-49bb-9d26-e2ed08c6a744","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 2 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH01.
