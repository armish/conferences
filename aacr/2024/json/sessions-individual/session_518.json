A substantial proportion of cancer patients do not benefit from these intensified treatments and are currently overtreated. This results in unnecessary toxicity and costs and reduced quality of life. It is time to enter a new decade of personalized medicine and investigate how we can further personalize treatment and reduce overtreatment. In this educational session, we will focus on the importance and key challenges associated with de-escalation studies. We will discuss the clinical needs, the importance of biomarkers and innovative trial design in order to generate practice changing evidence in this field. Examples of different biomarkers and innovative de-escalation studies for both systemic therapy and surgical treatment will be presented. The session aims to empower cancer researchers at all levels with the knowledge to contribute to this next step in precision oncology.&nbsp;<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"518","Key":"c3acc2e4-e089-40e7-834d-dd3fedb5aaac","LastUpdated":"2024-03-11 23:48","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED36.
