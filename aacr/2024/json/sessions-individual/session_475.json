Finally, the user should think about the use case and select their antibody reagents with that in mind. &nbsp;This session will focus on antibody use in spatially informed visualization of targets (immuno-histochemistry and immunofluorescence). &nbsp;We will discuss considerations for antibody selection and usage in the context of High-plex discovery, low-plex quantitative applications, and finally introduce trainees to the considerations for use of antibodies in the clinical setting, including CAP\/CLIA context validation.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"475","Key":"0ce3af8b-94c1-4aa7-9d72-075808612bac","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 11 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW14.
