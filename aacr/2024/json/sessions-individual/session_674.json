These advancements contribute to more accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment strategies, and improved patient outcomes in cancer care. We have adapted the micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system for scanning of whole tissue samples and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks alongside whole slide imaging (WSI) to re-construct various 3D models. It can provide valuable additional information for cancer research and diagnosis","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"674","Key":"44818b96-72fe-404c-bb75-177338621450","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>3dhistech<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP8C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP8C. 3D Nuclear, Cellular, Tissue Imaging and Quantification Techniques","SearchResultCalendarDisplayBlock":null,"SearchResultFooter":"Spotlight Theater C - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","SearchResultHeader":"Apr  9 2024  3:00PM","SecondaryCategory":"","SecondaryCategory_keys":"","ShowChatLink":null,"Start":"4\/9\/2024 3:00:00 PM","StartTime":"15:00","Status":"Active","StreamingConfiguration":null,"StreamingKey":null,"ThumbnailUrl":null,"Title":"3D Nuclear, Cellular, Tissue Imaging and Quantification Techniques","Type":null,"TypeKey":null}
