Presentations will identify mechanisms that contribute to the success of immune therapies as well as methods being pursued to broaden development. Areas to be explored include combinatorial approaches, antigen presentation machinery, and multiple immune effector mechanisms. Presentations will include deep computational analyses revealing immune pathways as well as the roles of innate immunity.\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"156","Key":"9004f7ea-eeae-4afd-928e-4fa0eca9e6f6","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Hall GH - Ground Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY42","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY42.
