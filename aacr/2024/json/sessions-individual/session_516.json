Early steps in carcinogenesis are driven by interactions between genetic background and environmental triggers, which range from specific environmental toxins to diet to ageing. &nbsp;Recent advances in the field &ndash; made possible by technological advances in nucleic acid sequencing, organoid models, and other areas - have revealed novel biological mechanisms underlying such gene-environment interactions, opening unexpected insights into cancer biology, and promising advances in cancer prevention.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>The objectives of this session will be to: (a) provide attendees with expert perspectives that illuminate recent conceptual and mechanistic advances in this area, (b) discuss the technological progress that has made such advances possible, and (c) pose unresolved questions and future research trends concerning gene-environment interactions, and their potential impact on cancer prevention or interception.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>In this session, Dr. Ed Giovannucci (Harvard University) will speak on how molecular and epidemiologic understanding opens new avenues for early intervention in colorectal cancer, Dr. Inigo Martincorena (Sanger Institute) will explain new insights into early carcinogenesis from studies of somatic mutations in normal and premalignant tissues, and Dr. Ashok Venkitaraman (Cancer Science Institute of Singapore) will discuss gene-environment links between metabolism and cancer evolution.<br \/>\u000a&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"516","Key":"5f922cb5-f66e-4101-a7cc-823e71e3c196","LastUpdated":"2024-03-11 14:06","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED38","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED38.
