Neoantigen burden has been associated with response to immunotherapy leading to the development of platforms of neoantigen vaccination which have verified that neoantigens are immunogenic, elicit strong T cell responses and in early phase trials can be associated with improved outcomes. However, there remain challenges with respect to optimal neoantigen prediction, selection and sources, and elicitation of high potency anti-tumor T cells that will elicit a broadly protective and durable clinical effect. Experts in the field will review how tumor neoantigen detection and quality can be enriched through (i) improved mass spectrometry approaches, (ii) advances in immunogenomics identifying dark matter derived antigens and (iii) application of new biophysical models to predict quality neoantigens through the evolutionary dynamics of neoantigens.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"82","Key":"153ee8f0-faa2-49dd-9598-d7b5f3165d43","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Hall GH - Ground Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO08.
