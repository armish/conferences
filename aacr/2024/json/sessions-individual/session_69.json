This session will focus on new technologies and applications that have emerged to analyze molecular changes in the circulation of cancer patients, including tumor-specific methylation profiles, mutational signatures, and genome-wide fragmentation of cfDNA. &nbsp;Machine learning models of these muti-feature cfDNA data have been used to develop improved methods for cancer detection and characterization. &nbsp;The presentations will provide insight into the biological basis of changes in cfDNA and approaches for early cancer detection, therapeutic stratification, and non-invasive detection and monitoring of response to targeted or immune therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"69","Key":"22eb6091-8d85-4b75-af47-487f2201115d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 CD - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AT07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AT07.
