Despite these gains, the multiple components of these agents result in unique challenges that differ from small molecule drug or typical biologic considerations. The history of ADCs in preclinical and clinical development can provide important insights into designing the next generation of effective agents, and our improved understanding of these drugs opens the door for novel approaches. In this session, we will cover how this knowledge can and is being applied to the development of new agents and strategies. These include choosing the right target, linker, conjugation technique, and payload. Several unique strategies to improve payload delivery to the tumor and reduce delivery to healthy tissue will also be presented. Together, these approaches can advance the development of new clinically effective compounds.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"74","Key":"482a4032-290b-4c4e-b25d-79ff08492b0e","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT02.
