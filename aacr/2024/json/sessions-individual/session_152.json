The growing incidence of obesity in the population (currently 39% in the US) and it&rsquo;s profound and pleiotropic physiologic effects on cellular processes, including the cancer, necessitate understanding its role in cancer progression and treatment outcome. This session will cover how obesity is defined and studied\/modeled, with particular emphasis on cancer immune interactions and the meta-inflammatory stated associated with it. Both preclinical modeling and clinical data will be presented detailing the existence of an &ldquo;Obesity Paradox&rdquo; in the context of some immunotherapies such immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) where surprisingly increased efficacy and outcomes were associated with obesity but how other immune stimulatory approaches can result in greater toxicities\/off target effects. The effects of other key parameters such as sex, age, and co-morbidities and their associated treatments on obesity-immune interactions and outcomes will be explored. Data on effects of obesity directly on the cancer cell itself versus on immune and other cell-types, including immune, will be shown. Finally, the potential mechanisms by which obesity can exert these effects, including altering the microbiome and diet, will be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"152","Key":"ba3abb3c-d49b-4078-8e8f-6aba6681d093","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY38","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY38.
