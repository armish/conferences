Genomic instability has been shown to be a critical enabler of tumorigenesis, intra-tumoral heterogeneity and treatment resistance.  Cancer metastasis is a complex multi-step process culminating as the final common lethal pathway of most malignancies.  Through profiling of matched and unmatched primary tumors and metastases a number of genetic features have been implicated in metastatic proclivity, but none are restricted to metastases.  These data suggest that genetic-epigenetic instability during primary tumor evolution ultimately contribute to metastatic competency.  Chromosomal instability has recently been shown induce a cytoplasmic response to DNA leading to activation of metastatic pathways. Finally, aneuploidy or an unbalanced genetic complement, is an independent predictor of tumor aggressiveness and survival in patients treated with immunotherapy.  This symposium will share emerging evidence supporting relationships, in some cases casual, between different types of genomic instability and metastasis.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"88","Key":"3be500d0-c4ae-46c9-86a4-69855019e9bf","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 30 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY04.
