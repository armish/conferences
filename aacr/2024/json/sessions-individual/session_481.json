Understanding the stresses and the adaptive mechanisms that maintain survival of drug-treated cancer cells can inform rational therapeutic approaches. Currently, treatment strategies are reactive and directed at treating the resistant state after it occurs.  Solving the problem of drug resistance would require creation of a framework that dissects and partitions resistance into its biological determinants.  For example, developing reliable predictive models for targeting the molecular programs that restrain anti-tumor immunity, applying computational and systems biology tools for distilling genomic and experimental data to biologically and therapeutically meaningful information.\u000d\u000aThis session will provide an overview of new technological and pharmacological advances for enumerating the basic determinants of resistance and considering their implications for the development of successful therapeutic strategies. \u000d\u000a Keywords: cancer, resistance, druggability\u000d\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"481","Key":"6aa15f63-87da-4b49-bda0-b6b60f2ae84a","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 6 B - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED08.
