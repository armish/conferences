There are many complexities to considering how blood-based assays are translated into practice. One such complexity is how we think about risk in a multi-cancer setting versus a single cancer setting. Risk is considered as part of guideline-based single cancer early detection (SCED) programs like mammography and low dose CT screening for lung cancer. However, how those same risk factors translate to a multi-cancer setting is unclear. For example, absolute measures of risk may be more useful than relative measures in this new context where both SCED and multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests are being used to screen populations for cancer. In addition, terminology, and notions of &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; may be different for individualized clinical care (e.g., risk prediction needing special cancer screening) or public health benefit (e.g., maximizing the number of cancers detected in a population). Understanding how we think about risk in these settings will enable better targeting of tests to the patients and populations with the highest pretest probability of cancer who may stand to benefit the most. This will require novel thinking about cancer risk and risk assessment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/6\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"49","Key":"eb56634b-4416-44f2-967f-257edaed243c","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 1 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC06.
