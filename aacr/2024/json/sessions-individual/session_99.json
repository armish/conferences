Clinical success of a degrader was first demonstrated by Revlimid, an immunomodulatory (IMiD) molecular glue drug, which has now been used for treatment of thousands of multiple myeloma cancer patients. Following upon this, numerous molecular glues as well heterobifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed and are poised for approval in the coming years with several in late-stage Phase II and III studies.  Degraders continue to rapidly evolve as the field expands to drugging challenging targets, seeks to treat resistant populations, and targets disease drivers not otherwise approachable by conventional inhibition. Along with this evolution, tailored approaches are being explored including degrader drug composition, delivery, and dosing strategies. In this session we will hear exciting preclinical advances for up-and-coming new oncology targets and their respective indications, all of which have the potential to benefit significant numbers of cancer patients with high unmet need.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"99","Key":"312c885d-5743-4999-bd45-1e9b8622ae27","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 31 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY12.
