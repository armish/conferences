Dr. Huntsman will describe how the discovery in 20O1 that the precursor lesions for the most common ovarian cancer were in the fallopian tube and not the ovary has led to prevention strategies including opportunistic removal of fallopian tubes in women of average risk and trials of targeted removal in high risk individuals. Dr. Ftizgerald will describe how Barrett&#39;s oesophagus, the precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, has become an ideal epithelium in which to study spatial and temporal cell and molecular aspects of cancer development. She will also discuss how this information is being used to inform new tools for earlier cancer detection and monitoring. There are distinct melanoma subtypes and their evolutionary trajectories from different families of precursor lesions is known. Dr. Bastian will describe the varying sequential order in which specific mutations become selected between these &lsquo;pathways&rsquo;; &nbsp;indicating unappreciated differences in which tumor suppressive mechanisms are engaged and how they are phased during tumor evolution.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"128","Key":"09400f3a-c611-43ac-9307-6972173242b9","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV01.
