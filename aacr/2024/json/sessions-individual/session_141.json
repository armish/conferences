This session will focus on both fusion driven and non-fusion driven aberrant transcription as a key driver of pediatric cancer. We will explore novel approaches for identifying these events, for generating accurate tumor models  faithfully recapitulating the developmental context where the tumors arise, and will address challenges and opportunities in designing drugs for these targets.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"141","Key":"226e3fee-ced4-4f36-b883-e6e75a6e86ae","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 33 - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":null,"MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY27","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":"https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-view-content-embargoed.png","PlayerUrlReason":"Session embargoed at this time.","PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY27.
