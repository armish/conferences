We&rsquo;ll discuss emerging small molecule strategies, focusing on the development of cutting-edge covalent G12D reactive compounds and the intricate mechanisms of tri-complex cyclophilin recruiting molecules. Alongside, we will examine the synergy between these molecular advances and immuno-oncology, highlighting the role of mutation-associated neoantigen-specific antibodies in orchestrating powerful immune response against K-Ras mutant driven cancers.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"104","Key":"b9cf9969-6104-4aee-8bf2-77396804cfdc","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Ballroom 20 AB - Upper Level - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT06.
