The diagnostic odyssey starts with extraction of cfDNA from a blood sample, come hear how our Seraseq ctDNA Extraction Reference material is enabling unprecedented insight into preanalytic sample extraction performance. We will then move on to demonstrating how our pan-cancer ctDNA v4 reference material is enabling liquid biopsy validation and cross platform concordance measurement at greater resolution than previously possible for druggable mutations. The story will continue as we present recent solutions ideal for performance monitoring and discuss what&rsquo;s next.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/7\/2024 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"580","Key":"ea402d9a-6334-4291-a8cb-65d378c7944d","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"LGC Clinical Diagnostics","Number":"ESP1D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP1D.
