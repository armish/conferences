This field focuses on understanding the complex protein alterations and interactions in cancer cells, which are pivotal in disease progression and treatment resistance. Studies have utilized various proteomics methods to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer growth, metastasis, and drug resistance, providing valuable insights for personalized therapy. For example, proteomics has revealed specific protein markers and pathways in tumor microenvironments, such as those influencing cell proliferation and metastasis. These discoveries not only aid in the development of targeted therapies but also offer potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response and drug resistance. Moreover, proteomics approaches have identified characteristics of drug-resistant cancer cells, suggesting new therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome resistance. This presentation will delve into the latest proteomic technologies and findings, emphasizing their role in enhancing cancer immunotherapy outcomes.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2024 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"572","Key":"94fa23d0-ba94-4456-8ae8-d7d889d21bba","LastUpdated":"2024-03-07 22:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A - Sails Pavilion - Conv Ctr","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"Olink","Number":"ESP8A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP8A.
