Most women present with advanced disease and develop recurrence after primary therapy.  Evolving data highlight ovarian cancersâ€™ heterogeneity, molecular and genetic landscape, and tumor microenvironment.   Novel early detection strategies hold promise to intercept disease before it becomes widespread and thereby improve cure rates.   Treatment guidelines based on genetic testing reinforce recommendations for universal germline testing, however underutilization persists for many reasons including limited patient identification, limited genetics workforce, unconscious bias, and other systemic reasons.  Resistance to current treatments remains a major barrier to improving survival although new insights are allowing more rational targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches.  These advances and others will allow patients to realize the full potential of precision cancer treatments and detection.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"45","Key":"95b6e41e-fbb0-403e-a6be-29588bf1f54e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 260-262, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS10.
