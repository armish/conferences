Patients with tumors containing ecDNA have worse clinical outcomes compared to those with other types of focal amplifications, corroborating the functional status of ecDNA elements. Two features explain ecDNA as a unique and potent vehicle of proto-oncogene amplification: 1) Their size and circular structure enable unique transcriptional regulation mechanisms such as ecDNA hub formation, resulting in increased proto-oncogene expression compared to linear amplifications; and 2) Relieved from chromosomal positional constrains and lacking centromeres, ecDNA are unevenly segregated into daughter cells, enabling rapid increases in ecDNA copy number and driving intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, ecDNA represents an important vehicle for oncogene amplification in cancer with distinct molecular features, most of which are currently not fully understood. This session will present fundamental concepts and cutting-edge developments in understanding of extrachromosomal DNA amplifications in cancer.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"81","Key":"4de15bb9-8eae-4c37-bf27-d010305e49e9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY03.
