Mechanism-based biomarkers of ICB response\/resistance have the potential to improve overall treatment efficacy and minimize treatment-associated risk, by identifying patients most likely to benefit. Such markers also hold the key to developing effective combination treatment regimens to overcome ICB resistance. Available unidimensional markers of ICB sensitivity, such as PD-L1 expression and TMB-H, have limitations and are still being refined. More complex markers now under development may have enhanced sensitivity and predictive value and may also guide novel treatment strategies, for instance, by leveraging the immune system&rsquo;s intersections with metabolic pathways or the microbiome. This Forum will address the state-of-the-art opportunities and challenges in enhancing sensitivity and mitigating resistance to ICB. It will include presentations and discussion among experts in the underlying biology and clinical application of this form of cancer treatment, and in cutting-edge scientific tools that are supporting the next wave of biomarker discovery.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"56","Key":"8e4bac1f-19b9-454b-b656-5aa635a71b57","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO07.
