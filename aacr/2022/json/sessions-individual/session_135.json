However, less than 11% of the US research community are members of underrepresented groups.  Recent studies in both the academic, industry and clinical research settings demonstrate that a culturally and gender representative workforce enhances outcomes.    When physicians, researchers, and health care professionals from diverse racial and ethnic populations develop research concepts and provide care it helps to build trust and expands the community involvement in the research process.  This session will explore innovative strategies to recruit and train minority physicians and scientists in cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"135","Key":"29055238-4a95-4a83-9c62-7949a14bcdee","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED011","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED011.
