Evaluation of tolerability is vital to achieve dose optimization, and patient-generated data are essential to an assessment of tolerability. This session will review the importance of clinical trial design and clinical data in assessing tolerability, discuss types of patient-generated data which can support dose optimization, examine how to incorporate patient-generated data into trials intended for dose optimization, and include case examples. This session is a collaboration between FDA OCE’s Patient-Focused Drug Development program and FDA OCE’s Project Optimus.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"488","Key":"c58eb702-6516-4d24-86e3-ff949c471320","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC04.
