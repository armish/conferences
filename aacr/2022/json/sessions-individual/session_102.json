Many protein classes have hereto been deemed “undruggable”, but there is light on the horizon. With the explosion of new therapeutic modalities, better structural understanding of protein complexes and their regulation, and advances in computational techniques including molecular dynamics, progress is being made against many targets previously considered “undruggable”.  This session will highlight several novel therapeutic approaches to regulate key oncogenic drivers and resistance mechanisms, and provide stimulation for the community in our quest to tackle additional challenging drug targets.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"102","Key":"b49ca08d-bb54-44fa-9683-f9d1ef4fa24e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY36.
