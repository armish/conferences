Agonist CD40 antibodies of varying formulations have been evaluated in the clinic and found to be tolerable and feasible, mild to moderate (but transient) cytokine release syndrome readily managed in the outpatient setting. Major tumor regressions have been observed in patients with melanoma, pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, and other tumors alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy plus CD40 mAb, with or without PD-1 mAb, has shown particular promise in patients with untreated, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and a large, randomized phase 2 study has just been completed. Deep translational profiling of patient samples are aimed at understanding mechanism. Evidence to date suggests that CD40 activation is a critical and nonredundant mechanism to activate the immune system in cancer, sensitizing to checkpoint inhibition.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"678","Key":"509a6e3f-9e9b-4ec9-b420-7ff549d63bbc","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME49","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME49.
