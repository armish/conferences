Therefore, understanding cell death in cancer will advance not only our fundamental understanding of tumor suppression mechanisms but also our ability to design novel effective therapies in cancer treatment. This session will focus on the role of different forms of regulated cell death (apoptosis, ferroptosis, and other cell death mechanisms) in cancer. The speakers will also discuss recent advances in preclinical and clinical studies on how to target cell death in cancer therapy, including identifying cell death vulnerabilities in specific cancer contexts and combining cell death inducers with other therapies in cancer treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"129","Key":"2a6cb097-1766-4e80-a0da-46b288eab3a6","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED005","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED005.
