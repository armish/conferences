The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that there are important structural root causes of disparities agnostic to the type of threat to health and well-being.&nbsp; The pandemic has laid bare the links between our fight against infection and non-communicable disease, the complexity and fragmentation of our health systems, and sadly, the inequities present amongst the most vulnerable.&nbsp; A recent perspective in PLoS Medicine posits a role for implementation science in addressing the &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; problems that have contributed to health inequities. In this session, we explore in detail (1) why applying a health equity lens to implementation science is crucial to achieve maximum impact on cancer control, (2) how taking a systems approach in designing implementation research can illuminate high leverage, cross-cutting implementation strategies, and (3) how rigor and reproducibility can be maintained using pragmatic designs.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"136","Key":"1a6d4bf4-e8ec-4ace-8406-22f8e75e9f51","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED012","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED012.
