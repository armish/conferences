Thalidomide and related IMiDs provide the clinical proof of concept, while significant progress has been made towards chemically induced targeted protein degradation using heterobifunctional small molecule ligands. Molecular glues, such as thalidomide, not only exhibit better overall properties due to the relatively small size compared to bifunctional molecules but have recently also emerged as a strategy to modulate protein-protein complexes beyond applications in targeted protein degradation. In this session, the speakers will provide an overview to molecular glues and discuss specific applications and strategies for the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that leverage similar principles to pursue previously hard to drug targets.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"185","Key":"6d0f4e4c-7fa6-44b5-8777-17336c8abebb","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW013","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW013.
