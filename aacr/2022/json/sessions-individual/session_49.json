Although biology plays a role in all types of cancer, a person’s “ZNA,” or the zip code where they live, is just as important to consider and may play an even greater role in health outcomes than the genes they were born with. A person’s ZNA contributes to whether they have access to clean water, healthy food, accessible transportation and social support systems. Recognizing these underlying issues is the first step toward addressing structural causes of health disparities. It’s imperative to ensure that those who live in underserved areas have the same type of treatment and access to medical breakthroughs as those who live in favorable communities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"49","Key":"201d06fc-3b14-4131-a076-1becabd97549","LastUpdated":"2022-04-03 16:55","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APS01.
