The challenge, using an intention-to-treat lens is that only 8% received a precision-matched treatment, a sobering statistic that is consistent with other recent precision strategies in PDAC. Ongoing studies aim to improve on COMPASS by adding tumor model pharmacotyping and earlier access to drug trials or other precision pathways, all incorporated into our new PASS-01 trial (NCT04469556). &nbsp;We also demonstrated that expression of the GATA6 transcription factor can identify the main RNA subtypes which may be a clinically relevant biomarker for response to chemotherapy (2). This hypothesis is further being explored in resectable PDAC in the NeoPancONE trial (NCT04472910).&nbsp; The COMPASS dataset is rich for discovery leading to 26 abstracts and 12 manuscripts to date, 3 ongoing new trials and over 80 international collaborative agreements. &nbsp;","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"685","Key":"fd2080bd-8ffe-4024-a6da-e87aa3241ca0","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME05.
