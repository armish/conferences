Investigators have made significant progress recently in understanding how normal neurodevelopmental pathways are corrupted to establish the malignant state at single cell resolution, and how neuroblastomas adapt to the selective pressure of therapy. This session will focus both on the basic mechanisms underlying neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and cellular plasticity and on leveraging these insights into novel therapeutic strategies.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"46","Key":"c5139389-a347-4ce6-acd7-76b50d30ad4a","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS12.
