Apart from cancer susceptibility, putative aberrations in the germline may predict for antitumor responses and resistance to different anticancer therapies, as well as their toxicities. We now have FDA-approved therapeutics for patients with germline alterations and hereditary syndromes. This includes poly(ADP-Ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with germline alterations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, as well as a hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor for patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In this session, we will cover the therapeutic potential of targeting alterations in the germline genome, with a focus on how we can build on the success of developing novel therapeutics in hereditary kidney cancers. We will also discuss emerging areas of interest, such as the therapeutic targeting of Cowden Syndrome and other promising opportunities that may be pursued in the clinic in the future.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"95","Key":"1bc4cc0c-9054-4b7d-9e61-ca4c372fea50","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY34","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY34.
