A significant challenge is that such models are &quot;black boxes&quot;&ndash; devices concerned only with predicting outputs from inputs without shedding light on the biological mechanisms underlying such outputs. This is a missed opportunity, as causal mechanistic insights are key to advancing biomedical knowledge. Knowledge of mechanism is&nbsp;also critical to building trust in model predictions; otherwise one can only have faith in the wizard behind the curtain. Towards these challenges, this session presents a collection of predictive oncology models that can also be directly interpreted, mechanistically and clinically. These models capture both functional outcome and the mechanisms leading to that outcome, so that these can be understood and manipulated through drugs, genes or environment.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"26","Key":"848b0824-ee21-4f74-8b7a-93af512e0a4f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT07.
