Although most drug discovery efforts have focused on mutated oncogenes, several lines of evidence indicate that promising new classes of cancer targets involve genes that are not directly somatically mutated in cancers. In particular, pediatric cancers generally exhibit low mutation rates yet initial efforts indicate many potential non-oncogene targets. This session will highlight progress in defining new classes of cancer targets.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"117","Key":"a8e93fcb-c3b5-43e3-a16d-745cd244391b","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 278-282, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY27","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY27.
