Cancers occurring in individuals with inherited predisposition are usually, but not always, attributable to the gene containing the germline variant.&nbsp; In the MSKCC IMPACT program, recent evaluation of paired somatic\/germline specimens addressed this question in detail across a large cohort, and further assessed the impact of the findings on therapeutic response to targeted therapies.&nbsp; New results from the CAPS5 multicenter pancreatic cancer screening study, a standardized regimen of MRI and endoscopic ultrasound for early detection of pancreatic cancer in very high-risk individuals with genetic predisposition and family history of PDAC will be discussed.&nbsp; Finally, data from the evaluation of whole-body MRI and other approaches to surveillance for the diverse neoplasms for which risk is increased in several inherited cancer syndromes will be presented.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"35","Key":"4932b039-bc3e-48de-9df1-a5a15f1e14d0","LastUpdated":"2022-03-30 19:13","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT16","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT16.
