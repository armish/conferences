Inhibitors of the cell cycle CDKs 4 and 6 have revolutionized the treatment of ER+ breast cancer and rapidly emerging data are now addressing predictive biomarkers to define populations most likely to benefit, as well as mechanisms of resistance leading to new combinatorial approaches.  Additionally, transcriptional CDKs have recently emerged as promising anti-cancer drug targets, with unexpected selectivity in killing cancer cells.  This session will highlight recent progress impacting CDK4\/6 inhibitor-based therapy and review the transcriptional CDK network targeted by selective small molecule inhibitors and degraders.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"141","Key":"54e2d750-ad81-4f2e-9a3d-dc2adcbbf111","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED017","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED017.
