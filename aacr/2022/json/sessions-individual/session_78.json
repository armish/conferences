This metastatic propensity can be attributed to tumor-intrinsic properties and\/or their interaction with organ-specific microenvironment.  In this session we will discuss: 1) the role of the neural niche in brain metastasis, 2) signaling pathways regulating the immune response in early lung metastasis, and 3) the use of pre-clinical models to assess the role of biochemical and physical regulation of organotropism. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of these processes will help identify targets and treatment strategies to benefit metastatic patients.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"78","Key":"c07abd18-25af-42f8-b20b-027305eb675f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY32.
