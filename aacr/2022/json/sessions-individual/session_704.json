In this session, attendees will learn about informatics tools and educational resources from the Informatics Technologies for Cancer Research (ITCR) program and opportunities for early-career data scientists through the Big Data Scientist Training Enhancement Program (BD-STEP).&nbsp;<br \/>NCI&rsquo;s ITCR program supports the development of open-source tools to collect, process, visualize, and\/or analyze cancer research data. These tools can be found at https:\/\/itcr.cancer.gov\/informatics-tools. To help cancer researchers integrate informatics approaches into their research, including citizen scientists from underrepresented populations, the ITCR Training Network (ITN) was established in 2020. We will highlight the free online and hands-on courses from the ITN and present examples of how ITCR-supported tools have advanced cancer research.<br \/>To further develop the research workforce, NCI and the Veterans Health Administration support postdoctoral data scientists to conduct research addressing patient-centered health challenges through BD-STEP using VA and NCI data. We will present eligibility requirements and opportunities to collaborate with the program.&nbsp;<br \/>The session will conclude with a panel discussion focused on how these components connect to leverage data to advance cancer research.<br \/>&nbsp;","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"704","Key":"1988bbe4-f147-49d5-8a9a-f89eae5bf72b","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH03.
