As such, their stem cells must continually generate and rejuvenate their tissue, but also self-renew to maintain the reservoir of stem cells. When the barrier has been breached, for example by wounding, the stem cells must not only repair the damaged tissue but also call to the immune system to help guard against pathogen entry. All the while the stem cells must protect themselves from a variety of assaults, including not only injury but also mechanical stress, noxious chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, and allergens that stimulate an inflammatory response. How do epithelial stem cells equip themselves to respond to these different stresses? My laboratory discovered that these cells keep memories of their stressful encounters within their chromatin and unleash them upon subsequent encounters. Our discoveries have now been shown to have broad implications across many tissue stem cells, and while evolutionarily advantageous in healing wounds and encountering subsequent pathogens, these epigenetic memories can be maladaptive in cancers.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"692","Key":"aa9800fc-de8f-414f-9af7-df194beee926","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME13.
