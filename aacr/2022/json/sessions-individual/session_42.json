Integral features of pediatric cancer etiology include critical contributions of disrupted development, unique genomic drivers, and epigenetic dysregulation.  This session will feature current research highlights in pediatric glioma, leukemia and solid tumors to illustrate several facets of pediatric cancer pathobiology including the contribution of cell state in tumor origins and pathogenesis, and epigenetic regulators as disease drivers. Therapeutic opportunities including recent advances in precision medicine approaches showing great promise for specific subgroups of pediatric cancer will be featured.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"42","Key":"5490df5e-19c3-4199-92de-8bc4f527e418","LastUpdated":"2022-03-30 21:56","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS07.
