However, recent studies have revealed that several bacteria can variably manipulate their infection host cells and such bacterial manipulations can contribute to the development of specific types of cancers. Especially, the oncogenic relationship between bacteria and humans has been shown in <em>Helicobacter pylori<\/em> and <em>Salmonella typhi <\/em>infections. Chronic infection with <em>H. pylori<\/em> plays a critical role in the development of most, if not all, human gastric cancers. <em>H. pylori <\/em>can also induce MALT lymphoma in infected individuals. <em>S. typhi<\/em> infection has been associated with the development of gallbladder cancer. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms by which certain bacteria&nbsp;can transform human cells remain largely ununderstood. In this session, mechanisms by which a particular bacterial infection leads to neoplastic transformation of infected host cells will be discussed.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"67","Key":"c60e0b8d-8ce6-4518-a501-89b13a8b2c1c","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV01.
