Understanding specific signaling factors in the context of tumor control and normal tissue injury can be used to optimize radiotherapy. In this educational session, we will review the potential of such signaling to oppose tumor control by regulating DNA damage repair, to promote tissue regeneration in the salivary gland, and to mediate recovery following intestinal epithelial DNA damage.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"167","Key":"331170b6-539d-41b1-bd3a-224b1d2e5a5a","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED044","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED044.
