In this session, the speakers will present a broad overview of implementation research priorities in global oncology and will make an evidence-informed case for embedding an equity lens into implementation research methods. Selected case studies will be described that span the cancer continuum and will include pragmatic examples from a variety of contexts including different resource settings and world regions. Challenges and opportunities to advance the role of implementation science in cancer health disparities research will be explored in the Q&A session.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"75","Key":"02035dcd-9607-4947-891a-1941c9767a2c","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 278-282, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADR02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADR02.
