This system--a desktop partitioning engine and benchtop analyzer--uses highly concentrated (5x) master mixes to support a wide array of assays with fast, easy workflows. Three configurations of consumables are available to meet varied application needs, including high sample volume for cfDNA screening or a greater number of partitions for high-resolution CNV analysis. We will also present data that demonstrates the sensitive performance of the Digital LightCycler&reg;.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"839","Key":"5549a110-565e-472c-8d96-97763eda9356","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP31","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP31.
