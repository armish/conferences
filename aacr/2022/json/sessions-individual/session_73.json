Taking a clear approach with mixed methodologies that unravel the distinct impacts of social constructs and biological determinants in the genetic landscape of tumors. From stress due to racial discrimination, to genetic ancestry, we will have a thought-provoking discussion on utilizing multifactorial analyses in racial disparities research, all of which predicated upon inclusion of diverse populations in cancer research.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"73","Key":"ffc63ab6-4d52-43eb-a8c4-7bdd087079a9","LastUpdated":"2022-04-03 16:54","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADR01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADR01.
