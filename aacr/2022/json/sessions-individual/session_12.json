The central focus of this session is to highlight the manifold drug discovery challenges that we are facing in defeating RAS addicted cancers and to showcase some of the emerging preclinical approaches and therapeutic modalities to inhibit additional RAS oncogenic hotspots beyond KRASG12C.  This will include the latest innovative medicinal chemistry and chemical biology strategies and progress towards directly targeting the KRASG12D, KRASG12R, KRASG13C and K\/NRASQ61X oncogenes.This three-part series provides attendees with foundational knowledge of critical elements of the drug development process, such as lead optimization, identification of targets, and drug modalities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"12","Key":"5a3f5e4a-01d2-4446-b1f4-a094195e9c10","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED027","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED027.
