Progress was slow during the candidate gene\/candidate polymorphism era of the 1990’s and early 2000’s but the advent of affordable high-throughput genotyping technology together with developments in our understanding of the range of common genetic variation across the genome and large-scale international collaborations heralded the era of genome-wide association studies.  Since the publication of the results of the first cancer GWAS in 2007 there have been rapid developments with the identification of a large number of common variants associated with many different cancers.  The importance of these findings both in terms of their contribution to our understanding of the biology of cancer as well as the clinical relevance has been widely debated with some suggesting a new era of personalized prevention is just around the corner while others have criticized the field as an expensive failure.  In this session our speakers will put both these viewpoints in context by considering what has been discovered so far and what further developments might occur in the future.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"51","Key":"91fb6803-706d-4630-ae47-6b6248ffe7da","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO02.
