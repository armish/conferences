This session will include presentations from speakers with expertise in the preclinical development and testing of theranostics, the translation of theranostics into the clinic and patient management, and the commercialization and FDA approval of radiotherapeutics. The topics covered will include the types of radiotheranostics currently available as well as under development, challenges associated with the development and adoption of theranostics, dosimetry and a perspective on the future of theranostics.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"27","Key":"c60e721c-dc56-41d5-b3c3-48288f5c3169","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT08.
