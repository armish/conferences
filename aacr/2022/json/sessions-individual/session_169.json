This microbiome is known to be a strong modulator of immune function throughout life and has now been shown to be important in anti-cancer immunity. In this session, we will discuss how external factors such as the diet can modify the microbiome and how this can impact on downstream immune responses. We will also discuss how T cells that are specific to the microbiota can influence anti-tumor immunity and modify the intra-tumoral environment. Lastly, we will discuss how microbial produced small molecules influence anti-tumor immunity and how this can regulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"169","Key":"2323a867-8cfa-4f70-a2b3-dd8ce638ccea","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED047","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED047.
