Those guidelines shaped present-day qPCR, which is considered a gold standard technique in molecular biology. Fast forward to 2013, dPCR also took advantage of the publication of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments (dMIQE) guidelines to ensure global standardization. A new version of the dMIQE guidelines was published in 2020, considering the increasing number of applications and the introduction of new platforms.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Speaker<\/strong>:&nbsp;Afif M. Abdel Nour&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Liquid Biopsy Digital Scoring Assay for Noninvasive Quantification of Tumor Transcriptomic Signatures<\/strong><\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>With the advent of transcriptomic profiling technologies and bioinformatics pipelines during the past decades, performing transcriptomic profiling on tumor tissues have introduced large transcriptomic data sets, which can be leveraged to enable individualized diagnostic assessments. Despite the robustness of these individualized molecular classification approaches, the procurement of tumor tissues represents a major hurdle because of the requirement of invasive procedures. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are regarded as a noninvasive alternative to tumor tissues, offering the opportunity to gain insight into the underlying cancer. In my presentation, I will introduce our &ldquo;Liquid Biopsy Digital Scoring Assay&rdquo;, which is composed of an upstream liquid biopsy purification system for enrichment of either CTCs or EVs from blood, and a downstream digital PCR system for quantification of tumor-specific genes. Using clinical blood samples, we have validated the potential of &ldquo;Liquid Biopsy Digital Scoring Assay&rdquo; for diagnostic applications in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prostate cancer (PCa), showing the feasibility of translating tissue-based transcriptomic profiling into a liquid biopsy setting<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Speaker:&nbsp;<\/strong>Hsian-Rong Tseng, Ph.D.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"840","Key":"213eda7b-dd23-4ea7-b41d-7b064f8e5443","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP32.
