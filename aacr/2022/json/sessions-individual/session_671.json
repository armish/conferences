Statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors) are the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs in the United States and are used by 25% of adults aged 45+ years. In addition to their cardio-protective actions, statins have anti-inflammatory effects and have demonstrated anti-proliferative and apopotic properties in cancer cell lines, supporting a potential role in chemoprevention. I will focus on summarizing emerging evidence suggesting that anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering medication may provide important benefits in terms of chemoprevention for gynecologic cancers as well as outline important unanswered questions and future research directions.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"671","Key":"ac86b071-7871-4570-b0d1-54ec59e749ad","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 278-282, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME29.
