In this session we will focus on the many new connections that are being discovered between the microenvironment, the immune system and cancer stem cells. We will explore not only how the microenvironment is essential for providing support to cancer stem cells, but also how cancer stem cells in turn can influence the microenvironment and immune system for their survival, their growth and ultimately, their ability to evade therapies.  These studies will form the foundation for developing more effective strategies to erode the programs that drive the most aggressive, therapy resistant cells in leukemias and solid cancers.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"110","Key":"5cab827e-6363-4460-8e29-e781e26a9ca5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY42","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY42.
