We will have three lectures given by experts in the field discussing different strategies to identify myeloid pathways that impact therapeutic antitumor immunity. Dr. Brown will open the session and discuss a novel spatial functional genomic screen that he recently developed to identify tumor cues that control the spatial distribution and cellular interactions of immune cells in the TME with a focus on myeloid cells. Dr. Mellman will discuss recent studies,&nbsp;including novel screens that revealed myeloid cells and T cell interactions as key drivers of effective cancer immunity, while Dr. Merad will discuss recent results from clinical immunotherapy trials and mice studies that revealed&nbsp;how the same myeloid target can either significantly dampen or enhance tumor specific immunity depending on the&nbsp; tumor context.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"100","Key":"e8da4254-c1bd-4706-aeff-84d971ae1eda","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY19.
