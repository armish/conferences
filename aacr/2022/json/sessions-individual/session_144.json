Alterations of epigenetic processes have recently been shown to be at the core of several intractable malignancies and represent a previously unsuspected new paradigm of cancer. We will describe herein the general principles through which epigenetic alterations lead normal cells to transform into malignant entities, changing cell fate and trajectory. As examples, we will provide new insights into how mutations in the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes lead to cancer (Roberts), how normal immune cells transform into malignant lymphomas (Melnick), and how histone 3 mutations stall development and further differentiation promoting oncogenesis (Jabado). Insights gained from how these studies point to novel precision therapeutic approaches for patients, ultimately providing hope of improved care at the bedside. &nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"144","Key":"91ee103f-aa89-44a2-b754-8a2564f4a9a6","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED020","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED020.
