Networking Hubs are an informal night of discussion at one of four themed Hubs that provide attendees an opportunity to speak face-to-face with potential colleagues and collaborators. Junior investigators are especially encouraged to take advantage of this unique opportunity to mingle with respected senior investigators and meet fellow junior investigators with similar research interests. It is our hope that discussions started during the Networking Hubs will be continued throughout the Annual Meeting and beyond.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>Please register at: https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/r\/Hubs22<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>This year&#39;s topics include:<\/p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a\u0009<li>Computational Cancer Science and Bioinformatics<\/li>\u000a\u0009<li>Hematological Malignancies<\/li>\u000a\u0009<li>Cancer Prevention and Interception<\/li>\u000a\u0009<li>Pathology<\/li>\u000a<\/ul>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 8:00:00 PM","EndTime":"20:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"189","Key":"3c294971-be60-4b7d-8331-670dede2c31f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Mosaic Room Foyer, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SS03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SS03.
