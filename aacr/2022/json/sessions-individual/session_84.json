This realization, coupled to the expansion of tumor genome sequencing and the development of highly robust functional genomic tools, has sparked many efforts to search for additional genetic dependencies that can be tractable therapeutically. This session aims to provide a cross-section of such activities and their translation to the clinic. The session will cover large-scale drug profiling efforts, the use of CRISPR\/Cas9 screens to identify new cancer drug targets and the clinical development of new therapeutic agents that exploit genetic vulnerabilities associated with a defective DNA damage response.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"84","Key":"e2558053-f5e4-4178-b8d0-cd0a0a217b70","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY06.
