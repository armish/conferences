First-line androgen deprivation therapy, while initially effective, ultimately gives rise to castration-resistant prostate cancer, which is often metastatic (mCRPC). Second-line treatments, including second-generation anti-androgens and taxol-based chemotherapy, improve survival but are generally not curative. Moreover, the increased use of second-generation anti-androgens has led to the emergence of more aggressive forms of mCRPC following treatment failure, include those with features of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC). Further adding to the complexity, these heterogeneous aggressive variants are thought to arise, at least in part, via lineage plasticity, an adaptive mechanism for tumor cells to reinvent themselves to avoid treatment. Our session will feature talented new investigators who are using new approaches and technologies to tackle the complex problem of targeting advanced prostate cancer.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"43","Key":"afc19d7e-ea7f-45f7-b335-3c0168450670","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS08.
