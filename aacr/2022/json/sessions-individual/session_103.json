Bone metastasis is associated with characteristic modulation of the bone microenvironment, resulting in the formation of “metastatic niches” that facilitate the seeding and expansion of tumor colonies in bone.  Reciprocal signaling between metastatic tumor cells and stromal cells in bone niches results in epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cells with enhanced malignant features as well as pathological consequence in host tissues, including bone loss and muscle weakness. This session will focus on novel molecular mechanisms of bone metastasis and their implications for clinical management of bone metastasis.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"103","Key":"136deb77-62ca-45fb-b3bc-263e90f957b0","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY37","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY37.
