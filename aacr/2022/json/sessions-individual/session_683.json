I will&nbsp; provide a demo of FAVOR (favor.genohub.org), a variant functional annotation online portal and resource that provides multi-faceted functional annotations of genome-wide 3 billion locations, and FAVORAnnotator, a tool that can be used to functionally annotate any WGS\/WES studies. Cloud-based platforms for these resources will be discussed. The presentation will be illustrated using ongoing large scale whole genome sequencing studies and UK Biobank and FinnGen,&nbsp; with applications to several cancer and common disease quantitative, case-control, and time-to-event phenotypes.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"683","Key":"582029c8-b6fc-422d-8a00-ac0546d6d650","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ME01.
