The first presentation will focus on how obesity impacts adipose tissue function in a depot-specific manner. This will be followed by studies of the impact of obesity and adipose tissue on breast cancer development, including in women who carry germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Finally, we will hear about the local and systemic effects of obesity on inflammation, and the consequences for cancer metastasis.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"76","Key":"c178f92b-5a70-439a-88e6-381320306860","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADR03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADR03.
