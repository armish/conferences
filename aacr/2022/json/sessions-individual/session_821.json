Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising indicator of minimal residual disease (MRD) following curative-intent treatment, which identifies patients at an increased risk of relapse who may benefit from further adjuvant therapy. After initial treatment, serial monitoring of ctDNA is a highly sensitive approach to detect tumor recurrence, creating an opportunity for earlier intervention. This session will introduce the Inivata RaDaR, a highly sensitive and specific ctDNA detection test, and present recent data demonstrating the validity and utility of ctDNA testing for MRD and disease recurrence.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"821","Key":"ea7514e3-08b1-433e-80c8-b0b8c8902a61","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP17","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP17.
