Recent studies have shown that these cells evade immune detection by exerting effects on tumor associated macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, T cells, and NK cells. This session will provide insights into unique mechanisms whereby cancer stem cells evade anti-tumor immune responses and strategies. Three lectures from experts in the science of cancer stem cells, cancer immunology and molecular cancer biology will provide novel insights into mechanisms by which CSCs evade innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel therapeutic strategies to activate immune responses that target cancer stem cells will also be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"124","Key":"1868c864-8ae6-4d20-8c8b-6952da679910","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY40","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY40.
