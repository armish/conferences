International experts will discuss transformative impact of these technologies at all levels of oncology - from basic science to the future of medical care.  First, the session will address the challenges of interpreting genomes, with the goals ranging from patient classification, treatment guidance, and cancer gene and drug discovery.  We will then discuss the wealth of information single cell genomics data brings to oncology, and how AI-based approaches are critical for full interpretation of these datasets.  Finally, we will consider the future of medicine and how AI is an integral part of such future for oncology.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"79","Key":"497ce6d8-41dd-4b36-baa4-bb2af5dabc01","LastUpdated":"2022-03-29 09:57","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY01.
