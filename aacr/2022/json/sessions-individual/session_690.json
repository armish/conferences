But red\/blond pheomelanin is measurably carcinogenic, and likely amplifies UV. The pathway through which UV stimulates melanin synthesis includes production of endorphin which induces opiate-like UV seeking behaviors. And MITF, the master transcriptional regulator of melanocyte differentiation, is also a functional relative of Myc.&nbsp; MITF is an amplified or mutated oncogene in certain melanomas, a member of a family (MiT) of oncogenic transcription factors implicated in numerous other cancers, and MITF regulates the epigenetic state of melanoma cells to influence their vulnerability to both targeted and immune therapies.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"690","Key":"ce81abd7-b191-495d-9804-76bb0a240c53","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME11.
