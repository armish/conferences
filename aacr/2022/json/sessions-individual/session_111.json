A stiff, fibrotic stroma fosters tumor progression and metastasis, predicts cancer aggression, and compromises drug delivery and anti-tumor immunity. Nevertheless, therapies designed to inhibit ECM receptors, prevent ECM remodeling, degrade the ECM, prevent ECM crosslinking or impede deposition have proven challenging. In this session, speakers will present new unpublished findings that clarify the complex role of the ECM in malignancy. Data will be presented that describe novel approaches to target the tumor promoting effects of the ECM and how the ECM could be exploited to target primary and metastatic cancers.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"111","Key":"12f08f64-d629-4e02-b2ed-890360f7f9a5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY23","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY23.
