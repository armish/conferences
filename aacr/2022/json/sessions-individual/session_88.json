This session will showcase new transdisciplinary findings from human and mouse studies on adipose tissue types, their distribution and potential to drive obesity-associated carcinogenic progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immunosuppression, as well as the role of adipose tissue as a bioactive tumor microenvironment.  Presentations will focus on breast and colorectal cancer and highlight innovative ways to discern the black box surrounding the role of adipose tissue in driving cancer, plus point to opportunities for interception.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"88","Key":"49b38d55-54e7-4797-b5d0-778d1bf11394","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY10.
