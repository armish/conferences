The focus will be on recent clinical trials and drug approvals based on exploiting&nbsp; biologic vulnerabilities in unique subtypes of sarcoma, including GIST, PVNS, PEComa, angiosarcoma and other subtypes. We will also discuss recent large negative trials in the field and how this may impact future study designs.<u1:p>&nbsp;<\/u1:p>","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"686","Key":"a9c636f7-67e1-45c4-b27f-5ef7982ee8cc","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME06.
