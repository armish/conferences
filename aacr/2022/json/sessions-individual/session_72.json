In recent years, the immune microenvironment has emerged as an essential contributor to the pathogenesis of cancers, including hematological malignancies. However, efforts towards improving disease treatment or disease interception by preventing transformation are hindered by our incomplete understanding of the immune mechanisms associated with progression (e.g. inflammation, immune suppression, etc). In this session we will discuss about ongoing efforts to define and dissect the mechanisms that shape the immune landscape across various hematological malignancies. We will explore how such changes eventually promote malignant transformation and disease progression and how the gained knowledge can be exploited to devise rationally designed strategies to improve patient outcomes.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"72","Key":"cba650a1-7208-495e-b633-7a634001163f","LastUpdated":"2022-04-08 21:56","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS11.
