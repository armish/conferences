While extensive-stage disease can include the liver and bone, multiple lines of evidence have shown that SCLC has a propensity to metastasize to the brain&mdash;an estimated 50-60% of patients will develop brain metastases during the course of their disease.&nbsp; As such, we have developed 3D lung- and brain- organoid models to study the formation and proliferation of SCLC brain metastases.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"820","Key":"ff23a509-8a5e-4e1a-bdf0-ecac04e6be5d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP16","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP16.
