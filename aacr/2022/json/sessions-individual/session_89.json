This session offers an opportunity to highlight recent advances in the identification and characterization of pathogen-associated cancers using modern next generation sequencing technologies. In particular, current data on new biological subtypes of pathogen-associated cancers and their clinical implications will be presented. Novel therapeutic opportunities arising from these recent discoveries will also be discussed.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"89","Key":"0f0b9ff2-7b2a-4a67-a6b8-7052265664f0","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY11.
