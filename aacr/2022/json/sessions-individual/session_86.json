Such “liquid biopsy” analyses have the potential to change clinical practice by exploiting blood as complement to invasive tissue biopsies as a source of information how to treat individual cancer patients. Here, we will address the current state of the art and open questions in this fast-evolving field of liquid biopsy research with emphasis on clinical applications for personalized medicine.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"86","Key":"9ecb37df-0f8b-4d36-8038-c57f5543ed92","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY08.
