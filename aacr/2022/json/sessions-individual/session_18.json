Although only a subset of the responding patients exhibits these long-term responses, they have been shown to correlate with the persistence of tumor-specific T cells suggesting that the formation of long-lived memory T cells is essential for prolonged tumor control. Efforts are ongoing to fully dissect the mechanisms that regulate the activation, expansion, and differentiation of anti-tumor T cells into functional durable memory T cells in tumors. Recent evidence that targeting the PD1\/PDL1 pathway may often be insufficient to recover durable memory differentiation of exhausted T cells supports investigations of new therapeutic strategies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"18","Key":"40733aee-3538-4282-9459-420bb036b217","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED019","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED019.
