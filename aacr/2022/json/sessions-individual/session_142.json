There are many underlying mechanisms of resistance within the same heterogenous tumor that contribute to drug resistance. Solving the problem of drug resistance would require creation of a framework that dissects and partitions resistance into its biological determinants. Assessment of the physical properties of the tumor and deep analysis of tumor drivers, druggability, dependencies, and vulnerabilities, early detection of emergence of resistance, precise monitoring and powerful analytics that factor in clinical experience represents a challenging task. This session will provide an overview of new technological and pharmacological advances for enumerating the basic determinants of resistance and considering their implications for the development of successful therapeutic strategies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"142","Key":"3fc1bd4a-54a7-4fc2-9657-054e169daef3","LastUpdated":"2022-03-30 19:13","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED018","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED018.
