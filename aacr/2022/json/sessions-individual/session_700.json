Use graphics! A picture is worth a thousand words.  Data visualization let the data speak of itself.  Statistical graphs have long been established as useful tools for exploratory data analysis and data summary.  Standard graphs such as dot plot, boxplot, violin plot, histogram, waterfall plot, scatter plot, spaghetti plot, heat map, Kaplan-Meier plot, event chart, forest plot, trellis plot, etc. are routinely used to depict the data distribution. They are also highly effective for quality check and can reveal patterns and hidden structures in the data. The use of dynamic tools such as interactive graphics, 3-D spinning graphs, and animations will also be illustrated. In this session, guidelines will be provided for effective data visualization.  Do’s and Don’ts will be given to further assist the best use of data visualization.  Commonly used commercial and free data visualization tools will also be discussed.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"700","Key":"22a7837d-0fe7-4d5d-9498-a08728390dec","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME52","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME52.
