This progress has been facilitated by the establishment of resources such as TCGA, providing data for researchers to explore and improve our understanding of tumor biology which could inform precision medicine. However, the diversity of available resources is limited, which has contributed to a disparity in the amount of knowledge being produced that can be generalized to all patients. To reduce this gap in resources and knowledge, multiple efforts are underway, many of them led by investigators in other countries and some involving international collaborations. This session will include presentations from investigators conducting breast cancer genetics and genomics studies in Latin America who will share their findings and vision for future research collaborations.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"39","Key":"fd11029a-7f28-44e9-b0bd-3e19f67e7dbf","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS04.
