How tumors are pathologically diagnosed, classified, graded and staged; 2. Recent advances in machine learning and A.I. provide new tools to turn pathology slides into large, PathOMICS datasets. In this presentation, we will explore different ways by which PathOMICS data are generated and used for cancer detection, grading and prognosis. Using prostate cancer as an example, the discussion will focus on clinical applications of pathology A.I. and on the integration of PathOMICS and transcriptomics data; 20223. Tissue based genomic studies can be powerful tools for studying and understanding molecular pathogenesis, therapeutic targeting and drug resistance mechanisms in cancer. This presentation will focus on prostate cancer precursor and advanced lesions to showcase molecular pathology-based tools and approaches used to inform, guide and complement such genomic approaches.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"170","Key":"40a504f5-14f9-4905-89ce-77b7bb4df5af","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED048","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED048.
