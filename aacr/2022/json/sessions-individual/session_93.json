Frequently, individuals living in a stressful environment have less access to preventive and interventional medical care, while simultaneously suffering from an increased exposure to carcinogens. In addition to these considerations, a stressful environment can disrupt our circadian rhythm, induce chronic inflammation, and promote obesity; and these have been associated with increased cancer risk. In this symposium, we will discuss potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress and cancer, and consider how premature tissue aging may participate in an intrinsic and\/or extrinsic fashion.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"93","Key":"4a225dca-fa0f-4502-98d8-25006be6aad9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY33","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY33.
