Although only a small fraction of patients derives benefits, the anti-tumor responses tend to be complete and durable.<span><span> However, IL-2 therapy is limited by severe toxicities and unwanted Treg expansion.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Several cytokines have shown to enhance the immune response against cancer by acting on different phases of the cancer immunity cycle and on different immune cells resulting in increased T cell priming, proliferation, differentiation, migration and effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. For these reasons there is a recently renewed interest in the development of novel engineered cytokines and various cytokine-based therapies are currently explored in clinical trials. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The next-generation cytokine-based therapies in preclinical and clinical development include fusion proteins and targeted immunocytokines with increased half-life, mutations to reduce the peripheral sink or overcome targeting of T regs and novel mechanisms of action due to the preferential delivery of these cytokines to the desired immune cells. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In this session we will provide an overview of the novel trends in the cytokine immunotherapy.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"139","Key":"e4dd186d-19d0-479e-9490-c1373c5d0956","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED015","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED015.
