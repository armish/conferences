She is the director of Breast Cancer Translational Research and codirector of the Molecular Tumor Board at the Stanford Cancer Institute, and a Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator at Stanford. She is being honored for her paradigm-shifting research on tumor evolution, including the Big Bang model which explains how treatment-na√Øve cancers grow in the absence of therapeutic influence. She further developed this fundamental milestone in cancer research to explain the tendency that some cancers have to disseminate and metastasize, with implications for improved patient stratification and emergent diagnostic approaches for early cancer and pre-cancer detection.<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:00:00 PM","EndTime":"18:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"619","Key":"93eed0e2-246c-476d-bdfb-2f7e03c7399c","LastUpdated":"2022-05-02 12:44","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"LE12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"LE12.
