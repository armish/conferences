The field of systems biology has emerged to develop the experimental and theoretical methods required to understand how these diverse biological components work together to determine the form and function of the tumor ecosystem. Importantly, the resultant systems biology frameworks enable prediction of the behavior of the tumor ecosystem and can be used to provide insights into: adaptive tumor cell states, the molecular interactions between different cell types, the organization of the immune and stromal microenvironments, and therapeutic response and resistance. Presentations in this session will cover the various ways in which cancer systems biology approaches are used to predict the behavior of cancers, including changes in cell signaling, the role of the microenvironment, and the impact of tumor heterogeneity. We will also discuss the role of systems biology approaches to identify more effective treatment strategies and to improve clinical trial designs.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"149","Key":"9ee4d487-8b8c-4f84-937e-21ab33b9f1fd","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED025","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED025.
