Dick, PhD, FRS, FRsC, FAACR, is a senior scientist and the Canada Research Chair in Stem Cell Biology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network; and professor, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto. He is being honored for his groundbreaking discovery of leukemic stem cells and for developing the first hematopoietic xenograft assay using human hematopoietic cells transplanted into immune-compromised mice, a technique that has become the gold standard hematopoietic stem cell assay. His discovery of a leukemia stemness gene signature has since been used to predict survival rates and response to treatment and lays the groundwork for identifying actionable targets for drug development.<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 5:30:00 PM","EndTime":"17:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"612","Key":"51e8d2c6-100d-4a6d-aa0e-d796c7b6b157","LastUpdated":"2022-05-02 12:42","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"LE05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"LE05.
