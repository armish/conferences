However, lack of support from healthcare providers and insurance coverage gaps prevent many patients with cancer and survivors from receiving evidence-based smoking cessation therapies. This session will highlight research from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to understand how smoking influences cancer treatment outcomes, identify barriers to utilizing effective smoking cessation interventions for patients with cancer, explore ongoing research needs, and discuss implementation models, such as the NCI Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I). Starting in 2017 with funding from the Cancer Moonshot, C3I has supported 52 cancer centers to integrate smoking cessation into their high-quality oncology practices. This initiative has reached more than 63,000 patients with cessation services, which are provided to all the patients served in C3I centers. The funded programs provide models and resources for other cancer treatment settings.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"481","Key":"15cd7bd8-05be-482b-9a7b-1f7462624943","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC01.
