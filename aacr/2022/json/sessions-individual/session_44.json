Perhaps the most exciting application of these models lies in rare cancers, which are rarely well-understood biologically, often lack targetable drivers, and are generally associated with poor clinical outcomes. In this session, we will seek to capture the current state-of-the-art on the use of patient-derived models for rare cancer research and treatment. The session will cover a variety of approaches for modeling rare cancers, from tumor organoids to patient-derived xenografts, examples of utilization for precision medicine where high throughput drug screening and in vivo validation leads to promising new treatment options, as well as studies providing new insights into biological pathways driving fundamental principles in rare cancers, such as clonal selection and drug resistance. Numerous challenges and future directions will also be addressed, from the creation of immune-competent models to novel precision medicine strategies and the broad sharing of models across institutions.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"44","Key":"5c8211fa-b722-4432-a191-cb5c28d35391","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS09.
