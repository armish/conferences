Our organoid based ADIO (Autologous Organoid based Discovery for Immuno-Oncology Drug) platform has the advantage of highly mimicking a patient&#39;s immune system by obtaining tumor organoid and immune cells from the same patient. Here we present successful development of the triple co-culture platform which contains both organoid and immune cells for the in vitro evaluation of T-cell and macrophage-based immunotherapy which provides verification and prediction of drug efficacy at the level of the individual patient.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"803","Key":"3d6f39f9-c309-4859-8a42-2220d9841932","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP02.
