Interestingly, these variants are commonly observed in oncology allowing fantastic opportunities to repurpose cancer drugs for these patients. The recent example of alpelisib and PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum opens, indeed, new perspectives. In this session, you will learn more about the genetic causes underlying overgrowth syndromes, sporadic vascular malformations and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. You will understand the mechanisms of disease progression and finally, the therapeutic opportunities for drugs repositioning. Donâ€™t miss one such opportunity!","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"96","Key":"ee81607d-7fcb-45f7-9b9a-70a7bbcc7d81","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY35","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY35.
