Despite inhibiting PPIs with small molecules is considered a challenging task for drug discovery, there is a tremendous progress in this field as demonstrated by the FDA approval of BCL2 inhibitor Venetoclax and ongoing clinical trials with multiple PPI inhibitors. This session will cover methodological advancements in targeting PPIs, such as prediction of protein druggability, application of fragment screening and discovery of covalent inhibitors. Several successful examples of preclinical inhibitors blocking challenging PPIs, including transcription factors and epigenetic proteins such as PRC1, will be discussed. The session will be concluded with a panel discussion.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"29","Key":"858b5c6a-b72c-40a8-b829-085787ffc792","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT10.
