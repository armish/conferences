Current genomic tools are limited for this application because of low resolution (karyotype, FISH) or low sensitivity (NGS, chromosomal microarray). &nbsp;Accurate high-resolution genome-wide approaches to comprehensively assess SVs including copy number variation, translocations, gene fusions, aneuploidy, and loss of heterozygosity are needed. Optical Genome Mapping the only technique providing sensitive, precise, and high-resolution structural variation analysis for clinical oncology research.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"835","Key":"11b0c376-60bc-4dab-a77f-c7420b8d4331","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP29.
