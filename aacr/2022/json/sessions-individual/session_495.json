Experts in pediatric brain tumors, solid malignancies and leukemia will provide a high-level review of existing evidence addressing the contribution of&nbsp;molecular profiling to clinical care. A selection of ongoing sequencing programs will be presented. International perspectives including a consideration of low resource care settings will be addressed. Presentations will be followed by a discussion allowing initial exploration by attendees and panelists of challenges in integrating tumor molecular profiling into clinical care and priority questions for ongoing research in pediatric precision oncology.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"495","Key":"b55c655b-9bbb-4d82-ae12-0e5c5488e0f4","LastUpdated":"2022-04-04 15:14","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC11.
