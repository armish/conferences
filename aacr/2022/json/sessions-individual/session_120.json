It has been found that T cell priming status is a crucial factor in determining the sensitivity for CPI activity.  Proper priming of CD8 T-cells is a fundamental strategy for reversing resistance to CPI.  Accordingly, sequencing of immunotherapy is crucial for the success of such therapy.  Radiation therapy functions as an in-situ priming agent and immune-modulator and hence can be used to enhance the effect or reverse the resistance to immunotherapy and the sequencing of such approach is paramount","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"120","Key":"4d64c116-9181-4141-a659-bfb8df5d64b5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY43","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY43.
