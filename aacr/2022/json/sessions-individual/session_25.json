In order to sustain durable T cell responses they rely on an additional signal 2 from co-stimulatory receptors expressed constitutively (CD28) or expressed upon T cell activation (4-1BB\/CD137). For the clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies the use of signaling domains providing co-stimulatory 4-1BB and\/or CD28 signals has been instrumental. In this session we will introduce the rationale, engineering and mechanism of action of next generation costimulatory receptor agonists that result in T cell co-stimulation upon binding to tumor antigens or the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. The preclinical properties of these costimulatory receptor agonists will be discussed as they translate to the clinic, both as a monotherapy and combined with checkpoint inhibitory and T cell engaging bispecific antibodies.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"25","Key":"2323cc01-8f79-4164-8063-cf018d2907fd","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT06.
