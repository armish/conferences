Speakers in this session will illustrate how machine learning can be applied to multi-omics data combined with clinical data to predict patient outcome. Deep graph AI approaches (graph neural networks or geometric deep learning) are a new class of AI methods that can train powerful predictors on networks allowing analysis of complex biological network. We will discuss how graph AI can help identify drug repurposing opportunities for cancers, identify response and resistance mechanisms to therapy and predict response at patient and cell type level. The audience will also learn about the Therapeutics Data Commons (<a href=\"https:\/\/tdcommons.ai\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/tdcommons.ai<\/a>), an AI\/ML-ready public dataset for drug discovery. We will also touch on the limitations of machine learning due to the large patient-to-patient heterogeneity that exists in molecular data and the combinatorial challenge that this resents.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"32","Key":"89715f12-ebef-4e30-828b-142746cf15b7","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT13.
