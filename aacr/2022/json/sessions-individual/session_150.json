Now that CARs and other T cell engaging therapies are being developed for other hematologic and solid tumors, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind CRS and how best to manage it is of paramount importance.  Dr. June will discuss the current preclinical models and mechanisms of CRS in this context; Dr. Lee will then discuss how best to recognize, grade and manage CRS including the use of alternative agents for tocilizumab-refractory toxicity; and, Dr. Hutchings will provide his perspective on how the presentation and management of CRS differs between CAR T-cell and bispecific antibody-based therapeutics.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"150","Key":"3c088188-efec-4403-82e2-27d24c2722c7","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED026","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED026.
