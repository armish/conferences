Most of them were funded on the idea that education and awareness programs are most effective if built in partnership with the community. To create these partnerships relationships had to be in place, requiring multiple instances of in person interaction that would lead to trust and the desire to collaborate. From there, materials would be developed and then programs implemented often via community health educators or navigators. However, Covid19 lockdowns and restrictions required that investigators, physicians, and community partners adapted their approaches to the new reality of full-time virtual communication, reaching out to patients or community members via their phones and their computers. This session will present strategies developed by different outreach and education programs and discuss progress, what lessons have been learned and what new practices will stay even after &lsquo;in-person&rsquo; activities become possible again.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"137","Key":"14a3bfc0-6e6c-4202-864a-c60a45708232","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED013","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED013.
