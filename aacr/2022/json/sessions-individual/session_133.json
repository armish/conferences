Considered &#39;undruggable&#39; over three decades, SHP2 is now a potentially druggable target with the advent of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors. These agents hold promise for improving patient outcomes, showing efficacy in preclinical cancer models, where SHP2 is critical for either oncogenic signaling or resistance to current targeted agents. SHP2 inhibition may also induce immunomodulatory effects in certain tumor microenvironment cells to help cultivate antitumor immune responses. The first generation of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors is under clinical evaluation to determine safety, appropriate tolerability management, and antitumor efficacy, investigations that will dictate future clinical applications. This session will explore SHP2 biology and therapeutic approaches to modulate SHP2 in the clinic as a means to target RAS-driven cancers.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"133","Key":"51c8117d-14a9-4473-961d-7dfe56d9230f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED009","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED009.
