It has become clear that CSCs are maintained in the niche microenvironment comprised of surrounding tumor cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and factors and the extracellular matrix emanating from them. Recent advances have highlighted the dynamic crosstalk between CSCs and their niche microenvironments in tumor formation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Such crosstalk mechanisms provide an evolving paradigm for the development of novel strategies for diagnosis and durable therapies for multiple advanced cancers. In this session, we will discuss the CSC niche specific mechanisms underlying malignant progression and drug resistance and a conceptual framework for a quantitative understanding of the cellular interactions.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"162","Key":"2b826ec8-ec7d-46f8-863a-bf927daf3a58","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED039","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED039.
