Epigenetic therapies converge with cancer immunotherapies through &ldquo;viral mimicry,&rdquo; a cellular state of active antiviral response triggered by endogenous nucleic acids often derived from aberrantly transcribed endogenous retrotransposons. This presentation will discuss our current understanding of epigenetic modifications as therapeutic targets, the role of endogenous retroelements in trigger antiviral response and their potential physiologic roles in cellular homeostasis.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"648","Key":"616c594e-0347-41f1-8934-4761213331a5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME32.
