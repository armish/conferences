Using a PCR-based molecular barcoding NGS approach with high multiplexing, QASeq enables accurate, absolute quantitation of CNVs down to 5% heterozygous single copy gain or loss (ploidy=2.05\/1.95). Additionally, we will introduce NuProbe&rsquo;s custom assay development and validation solutions for oncology research applications.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"813","Key":"549bc237-9274-4b11-8091-e6d09f501a22","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP09.
