Since then, we have continued to expand our knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of key biological, transport and delivery challenges, prompting the emergence of a new wave of cancer nanomedicines. This session will thematically highlight advances at this frontier. The speakers will illustrate how nanotechnology at the convergence of chemistry, synthetic biology and cell engineering is being harnessed for applications such as early cancer detection, spatially controlled delivery, and discovery of new therapeutics. These presentations will underscore how new engineering approaches will help drive the next wave of cancer nanomedicines.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"183","Key":"dcd1390b-90fd-4c70-abf0-c71575de61ff","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW011","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW011.
