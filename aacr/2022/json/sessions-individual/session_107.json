In addition, stem cell properties such as long-term self-renewal, dormancy, or stem cell-specific metabolic programs play important roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. In this session, new data will be presented on the basic mechanisms of cancer stem cell metabolism and their role in therapy resistance and metastasis. For example, AML stem cells employ various metabolic strategies to escape treatment with chemotherapy or the BCL2 Inhibitor Venetoclax.  Recent studies have shown that nutritional factors such as palmitic acid, serine, or tryptophan can influence cancer and metastasis including their microenvironment.  Remarkably, metabolites can induce stable transcriptional and chromatin changes with long-term effects on metastasis. The session will discuss how nutritional strategies could be combined with pharmacological therapies to enhance the metabolic vulnerabilities of various cancers, including AML, pancreatic and oral carcinomas.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"107","Key":"5ff51566-10ab-49b8-9c63-84976305d498","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY41","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY41.
