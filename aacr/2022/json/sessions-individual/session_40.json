Gut microbiome is a critical environmental factor for the maintenance of host intestinal homeostasis through the interactions with host immune system. Perturbation of symbiotic relationship between host and gut microbiota leads to immune dysregulation and susceptibility to diseases including CRC. Recently molecular and cellular mechanisms have been proposed to understand how gut dysbiosis initiates epithelial cell transformation and tumor progression. The studies on the interactions between microbiome and host immune system in CRC will provide a new opportunity to identify biomarkers and drug targets for immunotherapy.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"40","Key":"ef892007-3f9b-4f03-a99e-13f54eda4a61","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS05.
