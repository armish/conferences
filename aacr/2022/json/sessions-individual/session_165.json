Cancer is a disease with significant sexual dimorphism in the incidence, treatment response, and outcomes. Despite this epidemiological evidence, the systemic incorporation of the biology of sex differences is largely overlooked and poorly understand in a wide range of basic and clinical cancer research. In this session, presenters will highlight how sex differences in the gut microbiome, immune cell function, and immunotherapy outcomes should be considered as key variables in the investigation of cancer risk, intervention, the tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic outcomes.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"165","Key":"c0856371-6df7-4276-9991-9f25fb89f50f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED042","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED042.
