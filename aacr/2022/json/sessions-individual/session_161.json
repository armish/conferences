In particular, new approaches at the interface of single-cell sequencing, computational methods, and the incorporation of spatial information now supply multilevel information that enable dissection and characterization of tumors with unprecedented precision. Application of these approaches increasingly benefits from integration of expertise in cancer biology, bioinformatics, statistics, and data science. In this session, we will provide a summary of emerging concepts and technologies in this rapidly developing area. We will review recent technological developments in the area of single-cell biology and spatial genomics, with a focus on methods that permit highly scalable characterization of tumor and other cells that contribute to the tumor microenvironment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"161","Key":"9e989eaf-6654-4900-a3a4-2f754dc59e26","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED038","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED038.
