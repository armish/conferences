In this session, the speakers will reflect on lessons learned as they relate to direct patient care, to clinical trials, and to the clinician experience. We will focus on patient-centered solutions through the lens of quality and health equity, on best practices to measure progress, and on necessary elements to accelerate innovation. From our lived experience, we will assemble our best thoughts for a path forward.&nbsp; We will outline our understanding of the risks, benefits, and opportunities that the active digitization of medicine can bring to our patients, to our profession, and to the development of new models of healthcare delivery from screening, risk reduction to treatment, survivorship, and palliation.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"54","Key":"3d4a36b2-f843-4831-b669-ab30ea068ce7","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO05.
