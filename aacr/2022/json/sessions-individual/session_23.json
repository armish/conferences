Application of these novel technologies to patient tumors and cancer models provides unprecedented insights into the complex and dynamic biology of the genetically, epigenetically, and phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cell clones that are present within a tumor, as well as into the various stromal and immune cells that promote or restrict cancer cell growth. These insights at single cell resolution hold great potential for better understanding the drivers of disease progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. This session will discuss the development and application of novel technologies for single-cell profiling, computational methods for exploring the cancer genome and anti-tumor immunity in an evolutionary framework and highlight novel approaches for functional lineage tracing using advanced molecular barcoding.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"23","Key":"072a0e9e-fdfa-463c-8227-f4d288340e0c","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT04.
