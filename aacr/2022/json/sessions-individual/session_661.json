We will review critical lessons learned from animal models of these tumors, and discuss how such models could be harnessed for the purpose of performing physiologically accurate experimental therapeutics studies. We will discuss how these insights could lead to therapeutic regimens aimed to maximize efficacy of immunotherapy approaches through combinatorial therapies using precision molecular targeted therapies","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"661","Key":"32feb7e6-b4e5-4c3a-90b3-ea9f17422bf4","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME21","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME21.
