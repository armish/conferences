Currently, there are over 17 million cancer survivors in the United States. In this session, we highlight the burden of morbidity carried by cancer survivors; understand the etiology and pathogenesis of the long-term chronic health conditions; and discuss opportunities for interventions to reduce this burden of morbidity. For the more than 3.8 million female breast cancer survivors, the 5-year relative survival is now greater than 90%. However, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than women from any other racial\/ethnic group are. In this session, we will present an overview of various contributors to inequities in breast cancer survival, highlighting published and ongoing research seeking to understand and address these inequities. Finally, in 2005, authors of the Institute of Medicine released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Survivor: Lost in Transition. In this session, we will briefly describe progress in the healthcare of cancer survivors since that report and discuss methods to integrate primary care providers in the process.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"163","Key":"bd54d879-29f7-4833-bf16-e45053f9fcc9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED040","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED040.
