In this session, the speakers will discuss approaches to improve vaccine antigen selection, immunogenicity and identify determinants of efficacy. Additionally, they will assess the mode of action of various cancer vaccine platforms, discuss differences between spontaneous and vaccine-triggered T-cell responses in cancer immunotherapy and propose combinatorial approaches to enhance cancer vaccines to provide therapeutic benefit.","Duration":65,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:20:00 AM","EndTime":"11:20","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"99","Key":"982ed609-8d5b-49bb-bbab-f62f98a0aad8","LastUpdated":"2022-04-04 18:46","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY18","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY18.
