There are now several bispecific antibodies being evaluated as investigational agents in the clinic for solid tumor malignancies. This session will explore early discoveries, lessons learned from hematologic malignancies, and challenges unique to developing these agents in solid tumors. Experimentation with half-life extension to promote longer persistence will be reviewed, as well as clinical data in prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer. Best practices for management of CRS and neurotoxicity will also be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"108","Key":"0b7d653a-8952-4d1f-8b43-02f433ce10ac","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY21","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY21.
