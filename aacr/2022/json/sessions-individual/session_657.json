Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis allows personalized disease monitoring of tumor dynamics and treatment response from a simple blood test that is easy to perform at regular intervals during therapy. Serial analysis of ctDNA provides a unique opportunity to study the evolving genomic landscape of a cancer during therapy, identify the early emergence of treatment resistance and guide targeted therapeutic decisions. A summary of current approaches and challenges related to ctDNA analysis will be presented, together with an overview of clinical applications for the use of liquid biopsies in cancer management.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"657","Key":"466f84d8-52cb-4ab7-a23c-db5a8f715340","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME41","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME41.
