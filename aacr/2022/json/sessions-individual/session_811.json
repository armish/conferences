Cancer is a multifactorial and complex disease that involves systemic interactions across the tumor, the microenvironment and the immune system. Through innovations in single cell and spatial multiomics, solutions from 10x Genomics help researchers unravel intratumoral heterogeneity, dissect the immune and tumor microenvironment, and uncover mechanisms of therapeutic response and resistance. Join 10x Genomics to learn how researchers are using our single cell and spatial tools to gain a multidimensional view of cancer.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"811","Key":"70acdf93-e22b-4d44-b5ce-c439b22734ea","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07. 10x Genomics: Forging the Future of Cancer Research with Single Cell and Spatial Multiomics","SearchResultCalendarDisplayBlock":null,"SearchResultFooter":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","SearchResultHeader":"Apr 10 2022  3:30PM","SecondaryCategory":"","SecondaryCategory_keys":"","ShowChatLink":null,"Start":"4\/10\/2022 3:30:00 PM","StartTime":"15:30","Status":"Active","StreamingConfiguration":null,"StreamingKey":null,"ThumbnailUrl":null,"Title":"10x Genomics: Forging the Future of Cancer Research with Single Cell and Spatial Multiomics","Type":null,"TypeKey":null}
