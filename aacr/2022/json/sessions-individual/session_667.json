In this session, Dr. Ruben Mesa will discuss current and evolving therapies for ET (new 2L trials with LSD1 inhibition and interferons), PV (newly approved interferons and hepcidin agonists), and MF (new JAK inhibitors, combination front line therapies, new agents in second line alone or in combination) that aim to address the various disease manifestations\/disease burden of MPNs.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"667","Key":"b76cc45d-b0af-4470-8e0e-ad3f0228178d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 278-282, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME44","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME44.
