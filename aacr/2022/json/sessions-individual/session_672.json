We showed that TAA are self-molecules that change their expression during acute inflammatory events that accompany viral or bacterial infections, and in the process of malignant transformation, marking diseased cells for elimination.  Immune memory specific for these “disease associated antigens (DAA)” forms early in life and is boosted throughout life by successive infections. We modeled this process in vitro, in mouse models, and in retrospective and prospective human case – control studies. We defined specific DAA\/TAAs as targets of successful immunosurveillance of both pathogens and cancer and suggested that boosting that immunity could strengthen cancer immunosurveillance and strengthen immune defenses in general. One such DAA\/TAA is MUC1 that is abnormally expressed on diseased epithelia and on epithelial premalignant and malignant lesions. Results will be discussed from clinical trials testing a preventative MUC1 vaccine.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"672","Key":"ac871a88-027c-4b92-a96f-ec4d9dc42c80","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 260-262, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME30","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME30.
