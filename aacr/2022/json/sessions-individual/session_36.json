This is partly because of tumor heterogeneity with cells harboring diverse variant profiles. This session will discuss recent advanced in single cell omics allow direct examination of heterogeneity in human tumors and describe unique populations with specific alterations and clinical characteristics. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the genesis and biology of specific variants will be discussed with specific emphasis on the role of PPARgamma. As an emerging technology leveraging knowledge on tumor variants, liquid biomarkers have great clinical and research potential and their discovery and utility to guide treatment decisions will be discussed. In summary, this session will encompass novel technology leading to scientific discovery, mechanistic and translational work, highlighting the potential clinical impact for bladder cancer patients.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"36","Key":"cceaf233-5760-4efe-94b9-8dd4b7947b09","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS01.
