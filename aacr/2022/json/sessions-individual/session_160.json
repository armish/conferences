This session will discuss altered RNA splicing that may activate oncogenic signaling and facilitate initiation and progression of human cancers. Cellular RNAs are chemically modified in a variety of different forms. RNA modifications can significantly regulate gene expression. Aberrant RNA modifications could contribute to cancer progression. Tuning cellular RNA modification network can also affect tumor microenvironment and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This session will also summarize clinical successes of two major RNA therapies (siRNA and mRNA) for genetic and infectious diseases, and overview RNA-based therapies in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Opportunities and challenges of systemic delivery of RNAs to solid tumors will be discussed with highlights of a few recent work of mRNA nanoparticles-based cancer immunotherapy.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"160","Key":"de823ad9-e002-403c-aa67-42f2a867f58d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED037","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED037.
