Obesity is tightly linked with EC, and is associated with younger age at diagnosis. Approximately 20% of ECs occur in premenopausal women and 57% of all ECs are believed to be attributable to overweight\/obesity. While the link between obesity and EC is strong at the population level, we cannot yet translate this into individual EC risk assessment. Earlier research predicted that obesity-associated EC risk was caused by excess estrogen produced in adipose tissue, but studies now show that hyperestrogenism alone does not account for increased EC risk. Further, epidemiologic studies show that obesity is associated with both endometrioid and serous EC subtypes. We will discuss current data suggesting complex mechanisms underlying obesity-associated risk for EC. We will also highlight substantial disparities for Black women and key unanswered questions that could identify opportunities to prevent EC and reverse these trends.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"688","Key":"5477244e-3ea2-4e18-9a42-d3b958165010","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 293-294, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME09.
