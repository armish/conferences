These programs have significant differences that affect how a drug is approved under these pathways and how approval is maintained. These include: 1) approval based on a benefit-risk assessment vs. early clinical endpoints, 2) approval of new molecular entities (NMEs) alone vs. NMEs and supplemental applications, and 3) approvals with strict time limits (conditional\/provisional approval) vs. agreed-upon milestones (AA). In this session we aim to explore these differences and discuss the relative strengths and limitations of each program. The virtual option for AACR in 2022 offers a unique opportunity to partner with international regulators who may not otherwise be able to travel to the conference. We anticipate this session will help inform the discussion around AA in the US and provide insights into future harmonization of these programs. Following the presentations, Angelo De Claro of the U.S. FDA will join the speakers for two roundtable discussions on \"Evidence to support expedited approvals\" and \"Time limitations for expedited approvals.\"","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"487","Key":"e138c449-f350-4865-8804-79098db91ac9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC03.
