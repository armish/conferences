Join us to learn how spatial and temporal changes in DNA organization impact tumorigenesis. This session will feature Matija Snuderl, MD, of NYU Langone Health and School of Medicine, who will share the results of a collaboration between Arima Genomics and NYU to identify the genetic drivers of previously undiagnosable tumors. Anthony Schmitt, PhD, SVP of Science at Arima Genomics, will host this spotlight and share exciting new developments towards advancing discoveries in cancer biology.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"805","Key":"e6c2faca-3d00-483a-8f5f-f53cf985cf7f","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP04.
