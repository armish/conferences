In this session several recent studies evaluating the clinical impact of sequencing and targeted therapy in pediatric malignancies will be presented. The speakers will highlight lessons learned. Approaches to molecular tumor profiling, targetable molecular alterations commonly identified in relapsed\/refractory pediatric cancer and outcomes after receipt of matched molecularly targeted therapy will be presented. Attendees will better understand how to put precision oncology into clinal practice after this session. In addition, priorities for future research in pediatric precision oncology will be highlighted.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"64","Key":"0246a937-b34a-4bcf-acd7-646adbd71b24","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO13.
