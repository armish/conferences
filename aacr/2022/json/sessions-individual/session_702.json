To analyze petabytes of CRDC data without the burden of downloading, NCI’s Cloud Resources (CRs) bring data together with on-demand computational analysis tools and workflows in secure, collaborative cloud workspaces. All three CRs make CRDC data (e.g., genomic, proteomic, imaging) available from projects including TCGA and TARGET. In this session, each CR (ISB’s Cancer Gateway in the Cloud, Seven Bridges’ Cancer Genomics Cloud, and Broad’s FireCloud) will present research success stories and demonstrate how to take advantage of their portals and tools.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"702","Key":"1310cc03-5dec-49a7-ba6a-6c4fc928b6a3","LastUpdated":"2022-03-31 08:08","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH01.
