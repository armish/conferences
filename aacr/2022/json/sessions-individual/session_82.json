In contrast to oncogenic genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones are reversible, and targeting specific epigenetic players is an emerging area of therapeutics.  While broad epigenetic changes in cancer cells have been identified, distinguishing epigenetic changes that drive cancer is critical to identifying therapeutic targets. This includes how epigenetic mechanisms control chromatin topology and oncogenic gene expression; how the epigenetic control of transposable element expression affects cancer immunity; and epigenetic mechanisms of immune cell exhaustion. Therapeutic approaches include targeting oncogenic gene products aberrantly expressed in response to epigenetic changes, the development of next generation epigenetic enzymes inhibitors, and using epigenetic approaches to augment immune therapies.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"82","Key":"0ac957c4-56b8-409a-ac92-2c942c7b2f4e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY04.
