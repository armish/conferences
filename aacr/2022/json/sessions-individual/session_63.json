This session will cover recent advances and provide a future perspective on treatments to improve survival and overcome resistance, with perspectives from patient advocacy, industry, and academia. Dharma Master Jiantai, for whom this Forum is named, was a brave young Abbess who dedicated her life to dharma teaching. She was a never-smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer.  Her cancer was found to have a mutation, which nowadays can be treated by targeted agents. Unfortunately, those targeted agents were not available to her at the time. According to her wishes and in memory of Dharma Master Jiantai, her family established an endowment to support the Dharma Master Jiantai Forum on Advances in Lung Cancer Research. The family’s goal is to foster cancer research that leads to new drug development, such that patients with cancer will live longer, have better quality of life, and potentially reach a cure in select cases.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"63","Key":"18e32764-608b-489c-886a-dae7c4619ebd","LastUpdated":"2022-04-03 16:53","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO12.
