Growing evidence suggest a critical role for clonal hematopoiesis in driving the complications associated with oncological care through systemic inflammation. Dr. Takahashi will discuss the current evidence supporting the role of clonal hematopoiesis in driving cancer treatment complications and potential strategies mitigating those effects. Moreover, emerging data has taught us much about the mechanisms at play in the initiation and evolution of clonal hematopoiesis.&nbsp; Dr. Bolton will review our understanding of the relationship between oncologic therapy and clonal hematopoiesis and how this teaches us important lessons about the potential for oncologic therapy to cause hematologic malignancies.&nbsp; Dr. Levine will then review how these insights might lead to novel therapeutic approaches which aim to intercept clonal expansion and prevent hematologic malignancies.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"21","Key":"b4d80833-119e-424c-99bc-60c86452ec9e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT02.
