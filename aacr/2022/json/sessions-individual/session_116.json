Differential response rates across disease settings has been attributed to impaired T cell fitness, limited immune cell trafficking and a dearth of compelling targets in solid tumors versus B cell malignancies. This session will review current approaches underway to overcome these barriers, review results from clinical trials and provide participants with a balanced view of the basis for optimism in this field while also highlighting the challenges that remain.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"116","Key":"eeeedc47-739a-4a35-9ff7-edf08b520c82","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY26","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY26.
