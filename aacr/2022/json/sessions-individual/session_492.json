The &ldquo;AACR\/HBS\/MMRF Summit: Reducing Disparities and Democratizing Cancer Care&rdquo; brought together dozens of health care leaders in the cancer space, including leaders from cancer centers, government (NIH and FDA), nonprofit organizations, health systems, and industry (pharmaceutical and biotech companies). The Summit was focused on some of the possible ways to close the racial gaps that continue to persist in cancer care, including diversifying clinical trials, making trials more streamlined, and creating a health system-wide market exchange. This session will continue the discussion, including the possibility of establishing a more formal public-private partnership to address cancer disparities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"492","Key":"799828ef-23bb-4779-87df-db8225f79ecf","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC08.
