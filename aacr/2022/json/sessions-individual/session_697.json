Obesity is associated with increased risk for post-menopausal breast cancer, but few studies have examined breast cancer molecular subtypes separately. Obesity is often complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the possible association of T2D with specific breast cancer subtypes remains unclear. In this presentation, we will discuss our recent work exploring the association of disparities in obesity and T2D with the risk of specific subtypes of breast cancer among Black and White patients in Louisiana. We will also describe our immunogenomic characterization of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) from a subset of these cases, which revealed significant differences by race, stage and obesity status in genes linked to immune infiltration and metabolism.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"697","Key":"93ae43b1-fd15-4f1a-a769-ea3139e45d48","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME50","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME50.
