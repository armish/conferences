Recent advancements in deep learning focus on informative histological patterns through a hierarchical learning process, providing robust predictions in cancer and creating risk profiles signatures. In addition, novel imaging technologies, such as 3D microscopy, tumor scanning microscopy, and multiplex immunophenotyping have come to the forefront. The analysis of these complex data require the design and implementation of machine learning workflows, which lower the barrier of entry to this work for both data scientists and pathologists. The repertoire being added to oncologic research by pathologists is incremental and leverages the depth of knowledge acquired for over a century by our discipline.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"653","Key":"ba93323a-a284-4f2d-8fee-4e9cd6b45da6","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME37","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME37.
