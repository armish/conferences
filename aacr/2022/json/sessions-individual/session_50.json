This session will discuss some of the pivotal clinical and preclinical advances made in pancreas cancer over the past two decades, but also highlight significant challenges that remain in both realms. Examples of successes in the clinical arena include the availability of agents targeting defined molecular subsets such as DNA repair and microsatellite defective cancers, as well as the recent emergence of direct inhibitors of mutant KRAS. On the contrary, pancreas cancer remains stubbornly refractory to immunotherapy, and recent innovative &ldquo;platform trial&rdquo; models have been instrumental in evaluating novel combinations to better understand the mechanistic basis for treatment resistance. Additional challenges to progress include the availability of preclinical models that reflect the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of the cognate human disease, and the failure to define what constitutes a significant threshold for transitioning to advanced phase clinical trials. Our panel will also discuss the importance of team science and building the pipeline of a diverse investigator workforce that can implement a &ldquo;Manhattan project&rdquo; for meaningful progress in this disease.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"50","Key":"3dc6bd27-349d-4de5-8328-e4019dadec52","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO01.
