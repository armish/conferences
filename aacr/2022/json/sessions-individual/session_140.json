The first talk will provide a brief overview of ADCs, followed by an introduction of antibody-linked radioimmunoconjugates and their potential for the treatment of solid tumors.&nbsp; The second talk will discuss BCL-XL inhibitors as warheads for ADCs, including the development of ABBV-155, a BCL-XL&nbsp;inhibitor linked to an anti-B7H3 targeting antibody.&nbsp; The final speaker will address the challenges and opportunities with selecting patients for ADC therapeutics, including how such approaches may differ when ADCs with non-chemotherapy payloads are administered.&nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"140","Key":"120890d6-7320-41f3-95c2-e86de220a801","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED016","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED016.
