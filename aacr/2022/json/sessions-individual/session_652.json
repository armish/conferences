This talk will review the biological profile of treatment-refractory glioblastoma, and will profile the rationale, preclinical data and clinical application of current immunotherapeutic approaches that hold promise for GBM patients. &nbsp;We will assess the specific challenges of immunotherapeutic applications to brain tumors, including target discovery, delivery of therapies across the blood-brain barrier, targeting the tumor immune microenvironment, and persistence and trafficking of therapies into the solid tumor. We will explore the application of an integrative multi-omics target discovery platform for human GBM which incorporates DNA cellular barcoding, glycocapture profiling of the cell surface proteome, RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing and genome-wide CRISPR screening of primary and recurrent GBM. Finally, we will review the rationale for combinatorial polytherapy for targeting intratumoral heterogeneity and therapy-driven clonal evolution found in GBM recurrence.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"652","Key":"84965a2b-16f7-4f79-b132-270502a54470","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 295-296, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME36.
