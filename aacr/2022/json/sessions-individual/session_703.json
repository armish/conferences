The NCI funds training at extramural institutions across the nation, using funding mechanisms that include fellowships, career development awards, and institutional training grants. The NCI also offers fellowships in the intramural research programs at the Bethesda, Frederick, Shady Grove campuses for the study of all aspects of cancer. This session will provide a broad overview of this wide range of opportunities. Presentations will describe the extramural funding mechanisms managed by CCT&rsquo;s Cancer Training Branch, including new initiatives aimed at early-stage investigators transitioning to independence, as well as training opportunities in NCI&rsquo;s intramural research programs.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:15:00 AM","EndTime":"11:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"703","Key":"4a51c5e4-e923-4272-b16f-61265155ebda","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH02.
