It is a known driver of intratumor heterogeneity and creates a genetically diverse substrate upon which cancer evolution can occur. Ongoing efforts in exploring the molecular basis of genomic instability have the potential to shed light on the biological underpinnings of cancer evolution and help identify potential therapeutic strategies that can leverage these. This session will explore the mechanisms, relevant to genome instability, that tumors may adopt in the process of cancer evolution, and how these can relate to tumorigenesis, development of drug resistance and poor outcomes. Mechanisms involving DNA damage, whole genome doubling, and chromosomal instability will be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"105","Key":"4777dbc3-661a-4120-a433-097d23dc6358","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY39","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY39.
