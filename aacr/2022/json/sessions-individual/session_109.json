Interdisciplinary approaches including real-time imaging of cells in vivo, soft matter physics, and cellular\/tissue engineering have advanced understanding of how the physical microenvironment regulates the pathogenesis of cancer across multiple length scales and have elucidated new mechanisms that may be targeted for treatment. This session will highlight how innovative technologies can be used to measure, model, and predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of tumor-microenvironment interactions and their regulatory role in cancer. Concepts and approaches will be presented in the context of challenges and opportunities in the physical sciences of oncology field.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"109","Key":"29abfd14-6fe3-424d-8da2-e92f7dc1a544","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY22","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY22.
