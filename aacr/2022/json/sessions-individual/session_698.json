BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove damaged bases.  After processing of abasic sites, DNA polymerase beta (Pol &#61538;) fills in the single nucleotide gap, and XRCC1-DNA ligase3&#61537; seals the nick.  Aberrant BER results in genomic instability that is linked to the development of cancer. Germline variants in BER genes, including genes encoding the NTHL1 and MUTYH DNA glycosylases, have been associated with increased risk for human cancer.  In addition, germline variants in other genes encoding enzymes of the BER pathway are suggested to be linked to cancer development and may also impact cancer therapy.  An overview of the BER pathway will be presented along with evidence suggesting that germline variants in this pathway are associated with human cancer","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"698","Key":"c325985d-868f-4c57-bcdf-9ca4279ff5fd","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 278-282, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME51","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME51.
