The workshop will begin with an overview centered on common applications, including how artificial intelligence can be applied at various steps in the image-analysis pipeline, including image reconstruction, segmentation, and subsequent uses of image-derived biomarkers for prognosis, treatment recommendation. Potential advantages and disadvantages relative to manual or semi-manual methods will be highlighted. In addition, the workshop will include detailed examples of applications of artificial intelligence for prognosis, based on image-derived biomarkers; these biomarkers may be derived from neural network features, or from radiomics. An example application, to risk stratification for prostate-cancer patients, will illustrate this approach.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"173","Key":"c9a43d65-826b-435f-82e3-d3abcf966950","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW001","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW001.
