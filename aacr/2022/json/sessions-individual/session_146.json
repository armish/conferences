This session will highlight approaches such as machine learning methods for prediction with high-dimensional data generated by these technologies. The promise and practical limitations of these approaches will be discussed. Should we be surprised when a model trained in a single study fails to generalize to an external study? How can we integrate pre-analytical and technical sources of variation between studies as part of model training and validation? Translation of these predictors to clinically useful tests requires a roadmap that encompasses consideration of the ultimate clinical use, careful experimental design, and rigorous application of statistical procedures to evaluate performance.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"146","Key":"ebc9da38-2701-49ac-a0b4-d270b897ef28","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED022","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED022.
