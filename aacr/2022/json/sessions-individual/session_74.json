Population-based approaches for early detection can enhance screening by targeting the guidelines and policies that shape how specific services are delivered but recent reports have illustrated the importance of ensuring that screening criteria reflect multilevel determinants that contribute to cancer risk and outcomes in disparity populations.  The purpose of this symposium is to describe emerging approaches that are being developed and implemented to enhance the precision of early detection for cancer in disparity populations through translational research, community-based strategies, and multilevel interventions.  Speakers in this symposium will present examples of research and interventions being conducted to enhance the precision of early detection for lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer in disparity populations.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"74","Key":"e4516ffd-95eb-423a-827a-9fb39dfb15b5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY30","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY30.
