Part of this challenge is due to the inherent complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including the ability to differentiate various components and accurately identify their interactions, phenotype, and function. To address this challenge, multiplexing spatial imaging technologies can be used to maximize the amount of data collected in the TME, thereby answering more questions from fewer samples. Dr. David Rimm will discuss these approaches and highlight his recent work to improve response prediction to immunotherapy.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"827","Key":"122a4373-810d-4eb8-8406-66fff792fbc5","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP23","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP23.
