Some biomarkers have been validated  to enable targeted interventions (i.e. EGFR mutations in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer patients) and other are currently undergoing validation. <br \/><br \/>Biomarker-discovery in radiation oncology is also ongoing, to enable better sequencing with systemic therapy, dose de-escalation or intensification. Elucidation of distinct mechanisms of cancer immune-evasion are also generating markers to best harness the immunogenicity of ionizing radiation. This session will introduce some of the ongoing work on biomarkers for precision radiation oncology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"118","Key":"b9c755a2-cd1c-431c-b0c8-b633519e0e61","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY28","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY28.
