A new generation of biotin labeling methods (such as BioID and APEX2) are enabling deeper exploration of a variety of protein: protein, protein: DNA, protein: RNA interactions with heightened specificity and precision, particularly when coupled with quantitative proteomic techniques. Novel fusions of labeling enzymes with Cas variants have substantially expanded the repertoire of targets that can be interrogated in vivo. In this session we will review the current state of the field and delve into recent advances into applying these techniques to study dysregulated signaling in cancer.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"94","Key":"9a02a45d-3067-4912-8847-d49c0ff41a8e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 13:34","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY15","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY15.
