These vaccines benefited from the scientific foundations provided by longstanding efforts to generate effective vaccines to target malignancies, and lessons learned from the current crisis now serve to further stimulate progress in the area of cancer vaccines. At the same time, we are learning about the variable effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with diverse cancers, ranging from solid tumors to hematologic malignancies, which we will discuss. We are also learning about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the context of treatment with PD-1 blockade and other cancer-directed treatments.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"60","Key":"083ff905-1146-4d2f-a739-1dc3977640c2","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO09.
