Dr. Nick Navin, who leads the CPRIT Single Core at MD Anderson Cancer Center, will share his experience with Tapestri and discuss his latest findings and recommendations for moving into single-cell DNA sequencing. Tapestri accurately detects SNVs, indels, focal amplifications and loss of heterozygosity in chromosomal copy number at the single-cell level, allowing investigators the resolution needed to profile thousands of individual cells or nuclei to elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance through mutation acquisition, how cells transform from benign to malignant states, and the genomic changes enabling cancer cells to metastasize.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"823","Key":"4d2a6db7-8f26-4943-a7b7-c9536150f160","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP19.
