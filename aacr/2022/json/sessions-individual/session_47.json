As a non-metastasizing tumor, recent research has increasingly revealed the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity and the local microenvironment as key factors underlying GBM biology and therapeutic resistance.  This AACR tumor-focused session will explore aspects of this biology through a survey of new single cell genomic techniques to further understand the heterogeneity glioma cellular states and immune cell interactions. We will also discuss ways in the which the environment of the aging brain effects glioma biology and clinical behavior and delve into cutting edge functional imaging techniques for interrogating intratumor metabolic heterogeneity.  Finally, we will see how new ex vivo model systems, incorporating aspects of the brain microenvironment, recapitulates aspects of GBM intratumoral heterogeneity and cellular states to more closely resemble the human disease;  both for studying GBM biology and for screening for more effective therapies.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"47","Key":"4b0bfd32-b9a5-4109-ace1-1f4ae74ae27d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-28 15:31","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS13.
