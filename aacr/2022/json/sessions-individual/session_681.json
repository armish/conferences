The most common type is characterized by VHL inactivation with consequent HIF2 activation. Subsequent inactivation of BAP1 or PBRM1 determines tumor grade and aggressiveness, metastases tropism, and patient survival. Empirical analyses of the tumor microenvironment and gene targeting in the mouse revealed an association between BAP1 loss and inflammation vs. PBRM1 loss and angiogenesis. Inflammation and angiogenesis play a role in the response to immune checkpoint blockers and angiogenesis inhibitors, the main RCC therapies, and therapeutic response may be modulated by BAP1 and PBRM1. Drugs are now also available to target HIF2. Previously regarded as undruggable, HIF2 represents a core dependency, and resistance mutations arise. Second generation HIF2-targeting drugs, including RNA-based, are being developed. As new therapies and combinations emerge, precision medicine approaches will be accelerated by biomarkers (molecular, pathologic and imaging-based), including HIF2 and PD-L1 PET, which are currently in clinical trials.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"681","Key":"40da6651-0494-4421-aee0-6ed32672a808","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 288-290, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME07.
