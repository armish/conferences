Medicaid programs cover a disproportionate share of racial\/ethnic minority and low income populations, often diagnosed with late-stage cancer disease. Research using Medicaid data can inform community, health system, and policy strategies to improve cancer care quality and cancer outcomes in marginalized populations. This educational session will cover: 1) Medicaid as a critically important resource in cancer disparities research, 2) Data and Measurement challenges in assessing caner outcomes in Medicaid populations, and 3.) Opportunities for using Medicaid data to address care delivery gaps through qualitative and mixed methods research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"155","Key":"5b9b4efc-b87a-42ad-b7e5-54fafb42a3d3","LastUpdated":"2022-04-06 10:04","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED032","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED032.
