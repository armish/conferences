A newly recognized form of resistance to AR targeting agents is lineage plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood; no effective treatments exist to reverse the NEPC phenotype or prevent it. Our prior work demonstrated that enzalutamide treatment of the AR activity-low LNCaP derivatives promotes NEPC lineage plasticity. To identify cellular features with enzalutamide-induced NEPC lineage plasticity, a cell painting high-content assay was developed using Yokogawa Life Science high-content analysis instruments, coupled with machine learning single-cell morphologic profiling.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"824","Key":"cf400a9c-e106-46be-a22b-fbb81dde9f9e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP20","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP20.
