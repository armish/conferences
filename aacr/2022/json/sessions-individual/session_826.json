To reduce the time, it takes to go from discovery to the clinic, it is imperative to make discoveries happen faster and at scale. Join us for an invigorating spatial discussion, where we show the latest data using the PhenoCycler&trade;-Fusion system, the fastest single-cell spatial biology solution. The speakers will also discuss how spatial phenotyping can enable different applications, whether studying cellular neighborhoods or developing spatial phenotypic signatures that correlate with clinical outcomes.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"826","Key":"f445024e-feaa-4a49-9c03-8b445f179d68","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP22","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP22.
