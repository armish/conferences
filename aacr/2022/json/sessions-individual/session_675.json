Our goal was to perform the same type of genomic analysis in a different group of women, diagnosed with the same breast cancer subtype, but with a different ancestral fraction, to find similarities and differences in the expression profile of the tumors. Using samples from women from Puerto Rico, we performed RNA-seq in PAM50 confirmed luminal B breast cancer and found that the size of the tumors was associated with differential gene expression. We also found that BMI, ancestral fraction and tumor size correlated with the predicted infiltration of  different types of immune cells.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"675","Key":"7fe2504f-f5c3-4ba9-9146-00a9294dc09e","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 295-296, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME46","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME46.
