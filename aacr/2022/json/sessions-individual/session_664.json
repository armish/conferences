The number of Latino cancer cases are&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;rise&nbsp;142% in coming years, and Latinos suffer disparities in&nbsp;liver, stomach, and cervical cancer incidence, and worse outcomes in other cancer types.&nbsp;These disparities are driven by&nbsp;structural&nbsp;inequities&mdash;from a lack of healthcare access to unreliable housing&mdash;that have been built into&nbsp;governmental laws,&nbsp;economic policies,&nbsp;school systems, neighborhoods, businesses, research, and&nbsp;healthcare. Also, the pipeline of Latino healthcare workers&nbsp;and leaders&nbsp;does not reflect national population demographics.&nbsp;We&nbsp;need&nbsp;to create&nbsp;and translate&nbsp;research advancements&nbsp;into clinical best practices,&nbsp;system changes,&nbsp;effective community interventions, professional training programs, and advocacy actions to&nbsp;address&nbsp;Latino&nbsp;health inequities and&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;their resulting cancer disparities, thus saving&nbsp;lives.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"664","Key":"2bfbd6a0-5dbc-4798-8b43-3a18ab6b4d17","LastUpdated":"2022-04-02 02:26","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 288-290, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME23","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME23.
