Use of immunotherapy for earlier stage surgically resectable cancer has the potential to maximize the antitumor immune response and reduce rates of cancer relapse. In this session the clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibition in three recently approved earlier stage malignancies will be examined with potential molecular correlates of benefit. Next steps in the development of novel treatments for earlier stage cancers will be discussed including opportunities and pitfalls","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"28","Key":"afd4e381-608d-444e-9dda-f2396a86dbe0","LastUpdated":"2022-04-01 14:37","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT09.
