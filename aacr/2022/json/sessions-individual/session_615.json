Shokat, PhD, is professor and chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), professor in the Department of Chemistry at University of California, Berkeley, and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He is being recognized for his seminal discoveries in the field of chemical genetics, solving the fundamental selectivity challenge for protein kinases by engineering a unique ATP binding pocket and matched chemical inhibitor to exploit and selectively target individual protein kinases. His breakthrough discoveries include the development of the first covalent inhibitors of KRAS G12C, leading to clinical trials to target a once thought undruggable oncogene.<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 3:45:00 PM","EndTime":"15:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"615","Key":"36e19cd9-6212-4ec6-b6fa-49f2c9d953e2","LastUpdated":"2022-05-02 12:43","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"LE08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"LE08.
