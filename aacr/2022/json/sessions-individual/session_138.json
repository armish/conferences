Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) are considered the source of metastasis and they remain in a reversible non-proliferative state of dormancy resisting anti-proliferative therapies during the extended and asymptomatic periods of the minimal residual disease.Expanding our knowledge on how DCCs survive in a dormant state in their new microenvironments before and after treatments, how DCC interact with the immune system, and what are the signals that trigger their reactivation programs may likely improve predicting patient survival rates and increase the opportunities to design therapies that will extend the remission phase.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"True","Id":"138","Key":"218134f7-b0ec-4e06-977a-584280cb3057","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED014","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED014.
