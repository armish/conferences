Immunotherapy is highly effective in a subset of patients, in some cancers more than others. Therefore, the prediction of response is critical to enrich the patient population in both the neoadjuvant and advanced disease settings to determine who requires additional therapy and who can stop treatment.&nbsp;This session will address ways to determine risk vs. benefit as well as the difference between prognostic vs. predictive biomarkers. Both tissue-based and blood-based biomarkers will be addressed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"127","Key":"273de1cb-cc11-4481-9a46-b68c922b2f3b","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED003","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED003.
