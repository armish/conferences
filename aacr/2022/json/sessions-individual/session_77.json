During these remission periods it is now clear that patients can carry minimal residual disease that persists dormant, undetected and asymptomatic. In this major symposium we focus on important advances on: the evolutionary origin and transcriptional programs of dormant cancer cells, models to study dormancy, immune regulation of cancer cell dormancy and metabolic regulation of dormant metastatic cells in the brain. These advances provide new insight into how to control dormancy and target the seeds of metastasis before they manifest.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"77","Key":"1a95368b-ca6f-49bb-b61e-8e5849eea5e9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY31","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY31.
