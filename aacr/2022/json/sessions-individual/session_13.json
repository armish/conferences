Large molecules (antibodies and oncolytic viruses) have illuminated the path for immuno-oncology therapies to be transformative. This session will highlight three small molecule approaches currently under development. Specifically, we will hear how small molecule approaches to anti-tumor immune response have been brought forward with insights into mechanisms for T cell activation, targeting Tregs (disclosed for the first time), and a clinical stage program targeting immune suppressive adenosine. This three-part series provides attendees with foundational knowledge of critical elements of the drug development process, such as lead optimization, identification of targets, and drug modalities.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"13","Key":"f880e7c3-4463-4863-a67b-375f112ffb62","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED024","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED024.
