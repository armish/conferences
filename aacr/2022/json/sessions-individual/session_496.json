Focus is placed on how to write when writing isn’t your top skill-set (or even if you hate writing), how to structure an aims page to make help the reviewer “get” all the information you want them to “get” and also to help them think you are well organized and smart, and how to write an aims page that makes a reviewer excited about your grant. Here we will focus on crafting an Aims page, show how to set up a crowd sourcing group over Zoom (with the help of 3-4 scientific friends and one senior person), and unveil the mysteries of the NIH “pink sheet”.This session is open to AACR members who are postdoctoral fellows and new faculty. Pre-registration is required to participate and you must be registered for the AACR Annual Meeting 2022 in order to participate in this session.","Duration":180,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 12:00:00 PM","EndTime":"12:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"496","Key":"ea971a6e-3d58-45f0-ada9-5c1a6457cdc1","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Bissonet Room, New Orleans Marriott","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"PAS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"PAS02.
