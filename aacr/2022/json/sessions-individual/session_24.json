The field of cytokine therapeutics has been re-energized by recent efforts to focus the activity of cytokines on cell populations in the tumor microenvironment or on target circulating lymphocytes enriched in tumor-specific cells. This session will cover recent approaches in various stages of preclinical-to-clinical translation aiming to focus cytokine activity in tumors, localize cytokine activity to target tumor or immune cell populations, and increase both the safety and efficacy of cytokines as immunotherapy drugs.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"24","Key":"b49310ba-4fe3-4934-ac6b-dfd4388aefbf","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT05.
