This may reflect use of newer drugs for non-approved indications; re-purposing of older drugs, including drugs originally developed for non-oncology indications; and drug treatment in supportive\/palliative care, where few medication clinical trials (and consequentially few FDA-approved medication indications) are found.  To enhance quality of care and improve patient outcomes, it is critical to understand when and why off-label therapies are used.  This session will examine population- and hospital-level factors that may influence off-label use of cancer therapies; data resources that can help assess re-purposing of older medications for cancer care; and opportunities and challenges in off-label drugs for supportive\/palliative care.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"65","Key":"11eeae93-be74-4466-80fe-95c34035dd98","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APS02.
