Hankinson, ScD, is associate dean for research and Distinguished Professor of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Hankinson is being honored for her remarkable contributions to the fields of cancer epidemiology, biomarkers, prevention, and the etiology of breast cancer. Additionally, she is being recognized for leading the first large-scale blood and urine collections in women for biomarker discovery utilizing novel biospecimen collection protocols she developed, including one that collected samples timed for a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle. Her seminal work revealed profound insights into the association of sex hormones, and other hormones, with breast cancer risk, and cumulatively has provided critical new knowledge into the hormonal etiology of breast cancer in both pre- and post-menopausal women.<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"613","Key":"ed2752f1-113e-43c9-8fab-2ed66a1a36a2","LastUpdated":"2022-05-02 12:42","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"LE06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"LE06.
