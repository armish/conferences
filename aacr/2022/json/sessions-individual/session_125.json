Nevertheless, cancer patients over the age of 65 account for only 25% of clinical trial participants; patients over 75 are represented at only 10%. Those facts raise several questions: Why does our risk of cancer increase as we age? Do real-world outcomes reflect clinical trials, which typically enroll younger patients? Do we need to develop age-stratified cancer therapies? Clinical, pre-clinical, and basic cancer research efforts are being made to answer those challenging questions. Deeper insights into age-related processes and how certain tissues change with age should provide a platform for understanding cancer progression and designing better age-stratified therapies. The objective of this education session is to share current knowledge about how age is being considered in cancer research and learn about the tools and models that are currently used to account for age. We will focus on the manifestations of age in 3 important solid tumor tissue categories: tumor epithelium, the tumor stroma, and the tumor immune microenvironment. We will also discuss the benefits and limitations of current models of aging.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"125","Key":"74f1d6ef-fd7d-4155-8953-48e37ed3a683","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED001","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED001.
