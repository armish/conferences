Nutrition is a major environmental factor that influences health, and dietary interventions are commonly used to treat metabolic diseases. This session will explore some of the recent work in the field connecting diet and cancer metabolism and its effects on anti-tumor immune responses that are shedding light on how metabolic pathways in cancer are influenced by nutrients available in the host and tumor microenvironment, potential mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"115","Key":"ab3a55a1-9f83-4991-87bb-4fdc17a88d33","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY25","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY25.
