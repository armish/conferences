Therefore, establishing BIG data resources is essential to enable the iterative cycle of discovery on a research cohort, implementation of precision treatments prospectively in the clinic, study of the molecular features associated with clinical outcome, and the investigation of new therapies to improve the quality of life for survivors. To engage a multi-disciplinary community involving data scientists, oncologists and basic researchers, we will present an overview of existing major data resources in pediatric cancer, discuss challenges on data sharing and integration and highlight opportunities for data science research initiatives such as the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"156","Key":"d051c79c-6612-4ca8-836f-2f676351454b","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED033","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED033.
