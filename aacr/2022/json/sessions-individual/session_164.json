The second presentation will discuss the mechanisms of ER quality control and how they are modulated in cancer. Specifically, the targeting of protein disulfide isomerases is emerging as a novel strategy to treat cancers with developed secretory capacity. The third and final presentation will address stress-elicited modulation of ATF4 and the type I interferon pathways, their impact upon cell adaptation and the tumoricidal activity of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The roles of described mechanisms in anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of adoptive transfer CAR T cell immunotherapies will be discussed.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"164","Key":"2a066c39-f99f-4b60-a047-a67a27c87f0d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED041","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED041.
