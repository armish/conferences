Both spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics technologies uncover distinct molecular and cellular features, which can be spanned through multi-omics technologies. Translating the high-throughput data generated from these technologies into interpretable molecular mechanisms for cancer biology and clinical research requires complementary advances to computational methods for data analysis. In this session we discuss new technologies for spatial profiling, computational methods for their interpretation, and applications to cancer biology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"180","Key":"639cc900-8def-41bd-a043-ce201964fed7","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW008","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW008.
