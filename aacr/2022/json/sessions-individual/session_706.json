Several initiatives were launched in response: The Cancer Moonshot Biobank; the My Pediatric and Adult Rare Tumor (MyPART) network; the Comprehensive Oncology Network Evaluating Rare CNS Tumors (NCI-CONNECT); and the Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) network. Each of these programs adheres to the principle of patient engagement, defined as an ongoing, bi-directional and mutually beneficial interaction between patients and researchers, where patients are included as an integral part of all phases of the research process including the identification of research priorities and the design, conduct and uptake of research (Fergusson et al., 2018). This session will be a panel discussion including investigators and patient advocates associated with each of these programs. The session will provide an overview of the programs, describe the concept of direct patient engagement, the various forms it can take, and the value of engagement to patients and research. It will also discuss the importance of and strategies to engage with diverse populations (including racial, ethnic, geographic, cultural and economic diversity). Advocates, patients and researchers are encouraged to attend this session.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"706","Key":"f0fd2c5a-9003-4bc7-8d01-6dc0ba5aa980","LastUpdated":"2022-04-01 23:10","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH05.
