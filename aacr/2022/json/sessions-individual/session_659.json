Alterations in the cancer genome and dysregulation of RNA splicing factors lead to mis-splicing, splicing alteration-dependent gene expression, and, in some cases, generation of novel splicing-derived proteins. These are amongst the most common genetic alterations in leukemias and non-cutaneous forms of melanoma. In this session we will review recent advances in our understanding of aberrant splicing in cancer pathogenesis and present strategies to harness cancer-specific aberrant splicing for therapeutic intent. This will include discussion on the intersection of aberrant RNA splicing and the immune response in cancer as well as novel synthetic RNA therapeutics for cancer.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"659","Key":"b8d94cc8-3387-4fe1-adef-13d7025bb769","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME19.
