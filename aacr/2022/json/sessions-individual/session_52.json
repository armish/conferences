Next, we will outline current clinical trials – both ongoing and completed – in the oligo metastatic space and compare and contrast these trials differ regarding endpoints and histology (Chmura).  We will examine emerging biomarkers that may drive future trials (Tran). Finally, we will look at the questions of timing of metastatic directed therapy (MTD) as it relates to oligoprogression (Tsai).","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"52","Key":"47ccd6c9-efca-40f9-b854-55424e425da1","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall BC, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO03.
