Human-guided biology, including cancer cell line dependency profiling and genome-wide association studies, often point to transcription factors as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. However, outside of nuclear receptors, transcription factors have proven challenging for drug discovery due to significant structural disorder and lack of traditionally defined small-molecule binding pockets. This session will highlight successful direct and indirect targeting strategies, including disruption and stabilization of protein-protein interactions with an impact of transcription factor activity. Additionally, strategies to modulate the stability of transcription factors will be discussed, including molecular glue-based approaches. Finally, the session will explore a wide range of targets, including master regulators, developmental factors associated with rare disease, and factors that regulate T cell activity in cancer.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"30","Key":"936a9c97-82dd-48a5-9197-29f0224ec6bd","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT11.
