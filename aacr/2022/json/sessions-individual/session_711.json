The lab&rsquo;s biomedical technologies and repositories are available for free or at-cost, for government, academic and industry investigators to facilitate their own important research. The presentation will discuss the variety of opportunities for investigators to partner with the laboratory, and how to access technical services including assays, cell lines, and other products for HIV, cancer, and biomedical research.&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;The NPNPD is a Cancer Moonshot funded program designed to greatly increase the efficiency of natural products chemistry and empower researchers to engage in the discovery of anticancer agents from natural product sources. The NPNPD has developed an automated, high-throughput robotics platform which is generating a library of &gt;1,000,000 partially purified natural product fractions for screening. Both the plated fraction library and automated secondary purification and structure elucidation capabilities have been created and are being provided to cancer researchers at no cost.<br \/>&nbsp;","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 3:30:00 PM","EndTime":"15:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"711","Key":"f9414d99-e24e-4457-a6cc-e0609e49cf9d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH10.
