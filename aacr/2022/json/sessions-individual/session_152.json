Topics will include their use in cancer biology, drug discovery, and health equity research. The talk by Dr. Carvajal-Carmona will present an overview of the utility and use of organoids in cancer research. Dr. Welm will then present her research on the use of organoid panels to discover new and effective combinational targeted therapies for breast cancer. The last presentation, by Dr. Coggins, will focus on using organoids models to advance gastric cancer biology and therapies, with an emphasis on cancer health equity-oriented research.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"152","Key":"7378f6ed-1aa5-48c8-ae77-31aeb393a9d7","LastUpdated":"2022-11-14 17:33","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 208-210, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED029","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED029.
