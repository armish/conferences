Rewiring of normal metabolism to create cancer metabolic phenotypes may lead to resistance to radiation therapy, which can be targeted to improve radiation response. In this session, the speakers will investigate metabolic vulnerabilities in soft tissue sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma. Using different approaches that include unbiased in vivo and in vitro metabolomic tracing and CRISPR\/Cas9 screens, the presenters will show the potential to enhance response to radiation therapy by targeting metabolic pathways using genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, in vitro cell lines, PDX models, and human samples from ongoing clinical trials.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"31","Key":"b329ac52-8bb1-4f84-863c-9ba7be6ab551","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT12.
