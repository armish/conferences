Dr. Hawk will discuss:1) Merits and pitfalls of precancer discovery,2) Challenges in predictive analysis\/interpretation, and3) High-risk cohorts.Dr. Papadopoulos will address and discuss:1) Technical and biological challenges for the detection of precancerous lesions,2) Examples of detecting precancerous lesions, such as adenomas and pancreatic cysts, and 3) Merits of detecting precancer lesions and the challenges with follow-up and intervention.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"68","Key":"7a4cae91-e070-496b-a126-8e862e926ae1","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV02.
