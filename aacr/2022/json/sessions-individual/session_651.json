However, these scientific advances are hampered by the inadequate representation of African American (AA) and Latinx populations in research studies and clinical trials; thus, it is important to identify effective engagement strategies and to &ldquo;navigate&rdquo; cancer patients and those at risk for cancer to participate in cancer research. The inclusion of diverse populations will help us understand the genomic contributions of cancer, increase AA and Latinx populations in research and clinical trials, and thereby reduce cancer health disparities. Not doing so perpetuates long-standing cancer health disparities, stifles equity and scientific progress, and limits generalizability of scientific advances. &nbsp;Preliminary findings will be presented relative to the implementation of this novel and innovative outreach approach in the southern United States.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/13\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"651","Key":"29c57b68-e52e-45af-bb0d-f734708e5034","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 260-262, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME35","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ME35.
