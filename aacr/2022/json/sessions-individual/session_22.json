However, challenges arising from regimen-related toxicities, and both T cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors limiting efficacy and long-term protection, have mitigated broader application of CAR-T and T cell-based therapies, in general. In this session, we learn how discoveries in basic research and innovations in molecular engineering address some of these challenges and re-energize the promise of a cell-based modality for treating more cancers for more patients.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"22","Key":"199845c9-bbd8-4b11-a734-855ace4ae7ec","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Hall B-C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT03.
