A total of 60,430 new cases and 48,220 deaths in the United States were estimated in 2021 (SEER Cancer Stat Facts). The five-year survival continues to be dismal and stands at approximately 7?11%. An earlier diagnosis offers an opportunity to improve the 5-year survival rates, compared with diagnosis at later stages. At present, there are no reliable biomarkers or imaging technology that can detect early-stage pancreatic cancer or accurately identify precursors that are likely to progress to malignancy. This 60-minute special session will provide an overview of the scientific efforts and advances in early detection of pancreatic cancer made under the auspices of NCI Division of Cancer Prevention&rsquo;s Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) and the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC) programs. EDRN provides valuable infrastructure support to many of the sister programs for biomarker validation and informatics. A series of short talks (8 minutes each) will provide a broad programmatic overview for early detection, resources, opportunities for funding, opportunities to collaborate, and a few vignettes to showcase some scientific advancements\/new frontiers in the field. The speakers will take questions from the audience at the end of all talks (12 minutes).","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 3:30:00 PM","EndTime":"15:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"709","Key":"8c3b2881-7a11-4efe-a43a-ec4ab3698e09","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 298-299, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH08.
