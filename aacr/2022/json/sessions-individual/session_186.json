Furthermore, structural variations (SVs), including inversions, deletions, duplications, and translocations, are a hallmark of most cancer genomes. SVs can disrupt the 3D genome structure and induce the misregulation of critical cancer genes through the formation of &ldquo;neo-TADs&rdquo; and &ldquo;enhancer hijacking.&rdquo; In this session, we will discuss the latest progress on the methods and our understanding of the role of altered 3D genome organization in cancer.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"186","Key":"7eeea3c5-f6ab-483d-8dac-6a9203f662be","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW014","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW014.
