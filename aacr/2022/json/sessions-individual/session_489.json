Antibody-drug conjugates are large molecules which contain a monoclonal antibody, a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. Although ADCs are designed to be targeted to limit the toxicity of the payload, a spectrum of on-target and off-target toxicities associated with both the entire ADC and the payload still occur. This session is presented by FDA OCEâ€™s Project Optimus and will focus on reviewing the distinct properties of ADCs and discussing unique considerations for dose optimization. Topics will include how to incorporate nonclinical data, how to evaluate clinical pharmacology data, and how to develop an understanding of the safety profile including the potential for on- and off-target toxicities to optimize the dose. The session will include case examples to highlight key points.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"489","Key":"bbce1583-14b8-4d11-b13a-6e5760963b92","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC05.
