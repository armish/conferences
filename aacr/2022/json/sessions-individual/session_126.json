This session provides an overview of these impacts, with a particular focus on how ML is poised to enable (or has already enabled) quantum leaps in analysis of cancer 'omics and imaging data sets. Specific applications include identification of driving cancer somatic mutations and germline risk factors; analysis of copy number aberrations and epigenetic modifications; data fusion techniques for integrating multiple layers of data; approaches to understand the molecular systems under selective pressure for mutation; and multi-scale approaches which recognize that cancer-causing events can occupy a wide range of physical scales spanning many orders of magnitude. Of direct relevance to these topics, this session will also highlight late-breaking work of the three speakers, who run well-recognized research programs in AI\/ML oncology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"126","Key":"51aa9014-53a0-4901-be06-b1d089c95dc1","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED002","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED002.
