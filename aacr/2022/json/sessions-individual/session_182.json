Despite this, rigorous and quantitative mitochondrial analysis can be challenging. In this Methods Workshop on Mitochondrial Dynamics, we will explore in detail several newly described methods for quantitative analysis of mitochondrial structure and function in vitro and in vivo, including high-throughput single cell analysis of mitochondrial network structure, 3-dimensional analysis of mitochondrial structure and function in vivo, and quantitative live cell analysis of mitochondria inter-organelle contacts.  The presenters will provide detailed descriptions of methodology and required materials as well as examples of how the methods can be used to address the role of mitochondrial dynamics in tumor biology.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"182","Key":"2ea9f1a3-bcd6-424a-b227-2c6cccbe02f9","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW010","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW010.
