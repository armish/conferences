We invite a discussion of how the pandemic has affected the scientific community and career progress and how to address the rebuilding and resumption of worldwide scientific enterprise and the role that female scientists will play in this process.  A survey study published in July of 2020 (Myers, K.R., Tham, W.Y., Yin, Y. et al. Unequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientists. Nat Hum Behav 4, 880–883 (2020). https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41562-020-0921-y) documented that COVID-19 has not affected all scientists equally. A survey of principal investigators indicates that female scientists, those in the ‘bench sciences’ and, especially, scientists with young children experienced a substantial decline in time devoted to research. This could have important short- and longer-term effects on their careers, which institution leaders and funders need to address carefully, with strategies such as tenure clock extensions for junior faculty.  After a keynote address, panelists of all career stages and backgrounds will share their insights and stories on how the pandemic has affected their lives and the adaptations to their careers that may range from positive to negative, to transformational or surprising\/unexpected.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"728","Key":"ea61e819-e841-4bae-98ab-734a7018771f","LastUpdated":"2022-04-11 14:00","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Bissonet Room, New Orleans Marriott","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"CDF02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"CDF02.
