The talks will include a discussion of the mathematical and computational foundations of specific algorithms (GSEA\/GSVA, MARINa, and TR-2-PATH) as well as their implementation. A guided walk-through of a Cytoscape workflow for cancer genomics and proteomics will be presented. The session will also cover examples of the functional validation of findings from a co-essentiality network analysis platform.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"175","Key":"0e1d650d-06a9-4825-8957-fa7bcd26d346","LastUpdated":"2022-12-05 04:55","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 220-222, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW003","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW003.
