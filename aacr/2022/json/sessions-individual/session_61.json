We have not realized these goals as uptake of these three pillars is not uniform nor widespread in two at-risk\/vulnerable populations &ndash; minority and rural women in high income countries (HIC) and all women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This session will provide an understanding of the causes of cervical cancer disparities in both HIC and LMIC, including&nbsp;a description of the populations at risk for cervical cancer in each type of country, as well as strategies to address these disparities, with specific attention to context, social determinants of health and culture.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"61","Key":"929e91b7-7fd6-4cf0-b2a2-b7723914ea15","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO10.
