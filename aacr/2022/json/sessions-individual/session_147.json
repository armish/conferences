The major advantage, as compared to adjuvant therapy, is the patientâ€™s individual response evaluation and thus the potential possibility for adjustments (escalation, de-escalation) of surgery and adjuvant therapy. In addition, and this holds true especially for neoadjuvant immunotherapy, pathologic response after the few weeks of neoadjuvant therapy can serve as excellent surrogate marker for long-term relapse free survival and overall survival. This not only helps patients to manage their future life expectation, but also allows early safety and efficacy read-outs of novel drug (combinations). Several questions remain, that the experts in this session will discuss: Do we have the right animal models to address perfect timing and combinations of neoadjuvant therapies? Can we find baseline or liquid markers predicting pathologic response and subsequent long-term outcome? Can we personalize neoadjuvant immunotherapy and follow-up? And how do we improve the quality of life of the cured patients? This session aims to provide a comprehensive overview of basic research, translational research, and recent clinical developments for neoadjuvant immunotherapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"147","Key":"06ec067f-c745-41cd-841b-4ee9b4f5e088","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Great Hall AD, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED023","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED023.
