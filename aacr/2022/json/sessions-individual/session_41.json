Chronic inflammation in the stomach, often due to H. pylori infection, initiates preneoplastic changes as well as alterations in the tissue microenvironment that includes the recruitment of immune suppressor cells. H. pylori inflammation also induces aberrant DNA methylation not only in epithelial cells but also fibroblasts, which creates an ecosystem conducive to cancer development. Finally, chromosomal instability is a hallmark of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, and often involves early inactivation of p53, which can account for much of the structural genomic complexity and intratumoral heterogeneity.  The relevance of these studies to the development of biomarkers, cancer prevention, epigenetic and genomic profiling,  and novel therapies will be discussed.","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"41","Key":"83ae9c7f-1bdc-4b70-8107-39cc6fed0845","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 353-355, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS06.
