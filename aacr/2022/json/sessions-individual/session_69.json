These devices deliver emissions produced by processes not involving combustion and hence are proposed as harm-reduction alternatives to combustible cigarettes. However, the overall impact of these change in tobacco products on public health remains uncertain and controversial, particularly because of the consequences of their availability for initiation of using tobacco products.  This session provides an overview of evidence on risks of combustible and non-combustible products and the complex challenge of understanding the public health consequences of the changing tobacco marketplace.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"69","Key":"9345515f-6766-4976-9280-153079cbcf38","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 260-262, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV03.
