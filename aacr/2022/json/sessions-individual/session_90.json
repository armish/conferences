The role of neuronal activity has recently been found to be an important regulator of disease progression in a variety of molecularly distinct malignancies. Here, we will discuss how cancers hijack processes of normal development for their own growth. The nervous system facilitates tumor progression both through direct influences on malignant cells, as well as through remodeling of the immune system. By appreciating the functional crosstalk between the nervous system and the tumor microenvironment in various cancers, the field has already identified innovative therapeutic avenues to attack this lethal disease. The goal of this session will be to bring together neuroscientists, cancer biologists, clinicians, and trainees to learn, discuss, collaborate, and brainstorm new directions to achieve further mechanists in this exciting area of research.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"90","Key":"a67cd579-a4af-4c9e-84d1-385384b1d6b4","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 260-262, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY12.
