We will share how ML\/DL tools can be used to (1) process live-cell imaging datasets to measure and predict cell organization in human stem cells towards creating a baseline of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cell states; (2) analyze next generation histopathology and spatial proteomics image stacks from patient samples for cancer systems biology and precision oncology; and (3) enable discovery of diagnostic and predictive markers that are both quantitative and reproducible from analysis of whole slides of tissues. The session will highlight cutting-edge ML\/DL tools and approaches for a wide variety of imaging applications as well as the challenges of using deep learning for analysis and interpretation of biomedical datasets","Duration":105,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"33","Key":"cefce59a-f2b9-4b02-ab99-faa289179451","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT14.
