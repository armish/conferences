This workshop will showcase different types of biobanks and their importance in elucidating disease etiology and identifying early detection and predictive biomarkers across the spectrum of cancer research. In particular, given the great power of multi-omics in clinical and translational cancer research, the presentations will emphasize the importance of biobanks in enhancing the implementation and rigor of multi-omics studies. Finally, the session will highlight the unreplaceable role of biobanks in precision cancer prevention and treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"174","Key":"0a50658d-b4dd-49ed-9fa9-611604f1329b","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW002","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW002.
