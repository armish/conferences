A type of molecule that has huge potential for this purpose is the glycan. Glycans are everywhere in the body &ndash; covering cell surfaces, decorating proteins and lipids, and populating intercellular fluid spaces. They play structural, signaling, immunological, and metabolic roles, among others. They also reflect the complex interplay within the cell of functional and energetic\/metabolic demands, thus providing unique insights into the status of the cells from which they derive.How do we tap into this information? The key is having practical ways to analyze these molecules in the course of routine research. Researchers historically have faced a roadblock in such studies, but now they may have real options due to new methods with greater practicality. This talk will survey promising methods, highlights of discoveries about glycans in cancer, and opportunities for future research. The objective envisioned here is to establish glycan analysis as an integrated part of the study of tumor biology and the development of anti-cancer strategies.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"654","Key":"ac3683a6-9187-4221-b4dd-f1fe3ee22040","LastUpdated":"2022-03-30 02:24","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME38","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME38.
