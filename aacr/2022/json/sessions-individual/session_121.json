One vaccine targets an infectious etiology, while the other two do not.  The HPV vaccine is directed against several HPV types whose long-term infection causes cervical cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, and several other types of cancer.  The experimental Lynch syndrome vaccine targets a range of mutations that frequently develop in cancers in patients with this syndrome, a familial predisposition to develop colorectal, endometrial, and other types of cancer because of defective DNA mismatch repair.
