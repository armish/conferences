Surgeon scientists, as part of the multi-disciplinary oncologic team, maintain functional knowledge of all aspects of a patientâ€™s care. Their unique relationship with the patient inculcates an emphasis on clinical application and capitalizing on opportunities for bedside to bench discovery while advancing translational science. Surgical oncologists have specialized clinical and research training, providing the fund of knowledge to either become an independent investigator and\/or take on the role of a strong (non-passive) clinical collaborator. A number of factors are contributing to this under-utilized and unique phenotype.  In this session, we will have talks from established surgeon scientists and a non-clinician scientist (PhD) who has worked closely with surgeon-scientists to discuss the importance, the obstacles, and the future of engaging surgeon scientists in the field of cancer research.  We aim to stimulate a dialogue that will encourage both scientists and surgeons to work together towards a common goal of advancing impactful translational science.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"171","Key":"481ecdc5-31ff-4c4a-91fb-87e822726eb3","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED049","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED049.
