Through interactive discussions and presentations, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the nuanced differences among these descriptors, as well as the implications of their use in research and clinical genetics. As new ways of conceptualizing population diversity emerge, attendees will develop an intuition about how to revise existing protocols and adopt more precise and informative frameworks in their own research studies moving forward.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"179","Key":"7b3030f9-0150-4632-a4e1-1a0c18da5392","LastUpdated":"2022-04-07 06:58","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 217-219, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW007","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW007.
