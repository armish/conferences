While pre-clinical data suggests that rational combinations can reverse adaptive resistance and block parallel activated pathways, clinical trials demonstrate the difficulty of safely delivering combinatorial targeted therapy. To achieve effective results from combination therapy, one must take into account the impact of the genomic, transcriptomic and immunological context upon which any targeted genomic aberration is inscribed and utilze the best-in-class agents. We will also discuss precision medicine trials in the minimal disease setting using ctDNA as marker of response.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"680","Key":"1de76397-e5e5-4e4e-a6ca-6d87fabdd7a6","LastUpdated":"2022-03-30 02:22","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 243-245, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME03.
