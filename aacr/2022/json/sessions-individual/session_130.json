However, currently the number of selective pharmacological agents available to target cancer pathways  is woefully inadequate to achieve precision medicine goals. We therefore must test  and validate many more cancer targets. This session focuses on selective pharmacological inhibitors - chemical probes - as a major strategy to validate specific cancer targets. Chemical probes are highly complementary to genetic knock-out or knockdown methods and more closely mimic therapeutic drug treatment. The growing availability of pharmacological tools has established chemical probes as increasingly essential reagents in cancer research and target validation.  We will discuss important principles to consider when choosing and using high-quality chemical probes with examples from the speakersâ€™ research including cancer targets spanning epigenetics, signaling, stress and DNA damage responses, splicing and innate immune response.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/8\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"130","Key":"5a414142-ee74-4472-b438-52f16f852ac2","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater C, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED006","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED006.
