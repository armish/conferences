Like any ecosystem, changes to the constitutive parts can dramatically impact the entire system. This session will break down some of those important parts by not only highlighting the different cell types present within a tumor but also how they are functionally altered by different therapeutic regiments.  In addition, the session will compare how a metastatic ecosystem in the bone versus the lung versus a primary site differ not only in the cell types present but their functions. Indeed, a fibroblast in a bone or lung metastatic lesion versus a primary tumor differs in phenotype as does the immune response to the tumor.  Understanding how the different stromal cells impact tumor progression at specific sites will be  critical to the design of durable anti-cancer therapies deployed in the future.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"172","Key":"4c0c6c0d-6ffa-4614-838c-59b5badd68eb","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED050","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED050.
