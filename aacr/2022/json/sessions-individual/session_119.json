Pathologists can now view, analyze and share WSI with oncologists and even patients. Many laboratories currently using WSI have made headway at integrating their digital slides with laboratory information system (LIS) and started streamlining their “digital workflow” with the intent of moving to a “slideless” laboratory. We are also witnessing an increased use of computational pathology and artificial intelligence tools in cancer diagnostics.  Together, these technologies are transforming cancer diagnostics and have the potential to change the practice patterns in the years to come. This symposium will focus on where we are with this transformation journey and what are some of the future directions in using digital and computational pathology for cancer diagnostics.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"119","Key":"e8763bb7-8aae-4ad6-9ee8-376ac2741b51","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 343-345, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY29.
