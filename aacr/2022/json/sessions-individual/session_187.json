With non-randomized studies, study design may not be relied on to support causal inference; thus, statistical methods must be back-loaded in the data analysis to address the bias inherent in real-world data and generate reliable, reproducible findings. In this session, three speakers will focus on the key features that can improve the scientific rigor of non-randomized real-world studies.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"187","Key":"f7a2c05f-ac83-4a1a-9c0c-aaa0c14b1b25","LastUpdated":"2022-12-05 04:53","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW015","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW015.
