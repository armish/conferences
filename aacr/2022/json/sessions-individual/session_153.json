Although these therapies have led to exceptional successes, only a minority of cancer patients benefit from these treatments, highlighting the need to identify new cells and molecules that could be exploited in the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the crucial role of innate immune responses in immunity, harnessing these responses opens up new possibilities for tumor control. Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that can exert strong anti-tumor activity. We will review in this session how the anti-tumor properties of NK cells can be exploited by antibody-based NK cell engagers and by infusion of genetically-engineered NK cells, in comparison to T cell-based therapeutics.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"153","Key":"8c33134f-8d9b-415c-a4b1-d761afbd3938","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED030","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED030.
