Speakers are experts on evolutionary studies focusing on genes, chromosomes, cells, and tissues respectively, representing both basic researchers and physician-scientists. Following a general description of the various categories and types of cancer evolution, the concept of somatic evolution including clonal expansions will be discussed in both normal tissues and cancer. Furthermore, many new concepts will be discussed, including two-phased cancer evolution (karyotype mediated-macroevolution followed by gene-mediated microevolution), the relationship between diverse molecular mechanisms and common evolutionary mechanisms, genome chaos (a rapid and massive genome reorganization process), and polyploid giant cancer cells. These discussions will explain the genomic and evolutionary roots of cancer, as well as solve some key puzzles in cancer initiation, aggressiveness, and treatment-induced drug resistance. &nbsp;","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/9\/2022 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"145","Key":"8910a4d0-0d93-4eae-ad42-ccff36394fc3","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"La Nouvelle Orleans A-B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED021","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED021.
