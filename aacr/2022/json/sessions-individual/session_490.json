Per legislation, these endpoints must be “reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit”; however, the term “clinical benefit” is not defined by either regulation or legislation. In this session, we aim to explore the definition of clinical benefit using a case example in precision oncology that focuses on recent FDA approvals of two RET inhibitors. We will hold this session in collaboration with principal investigators who led trials to support approval and a patient who participated in one of these trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"490","Key":"027a8de3-3c24-43ca-bff1-28649a5e4030","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 356-357, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC06.
