There are longstanding differences in risk and newer observed changes in risk for specific racial\/ethnic populations for early-onset colorectal cancer. This session will highlight those epidemiological changes, plus explore our current understanding of the causative drivers that have led to the observed increases in early-onset colorectal cancer as a whole and for specific racial\/ethnic groups.&nbsp;","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"59","Key":"80d4a21f-4c0e-4c4c-b737-6ef0bcc06a44","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater A, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO08.
