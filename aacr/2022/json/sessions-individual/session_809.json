In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore how these technical benefits open up a new window of understanding into the cancer genome, featuring projects ranging from new methods of interrogating hereditary cancer predisposition to rapid insights into paediatric leukaemias. Join us to hear the latest from scientists using nanopore sequencing to access new genomic and transcriptomic information, giving an unprecedented view of the mechanisms involved in cancer progression and evolution.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/10\/2022 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"809","Key":"eaa291cb-dd2e-4b6f-b3eb-8ff3fd2f703d","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A, Halls D-H","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ESP05.
