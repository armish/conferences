Recent studies using mouse or human cancer-derived organoids have greatly contributed to expanding our knowledge about the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and malignant progression in variety of cancer types. Moreover, organoid cultures consisting of epithelial cells together with stromal cells recapitulate generation of tumor microenvironment through host-tumor cell interactions, which plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Such next generation organoid culture system is useful for basic research as well as clinical studies like drug evaluation. Moreover, organoid experiments are now applied to variety of research projects including infectious diseases. In this AACR-JCA joint session, we will discuss about recent results obtained from organoid experiments of tumor cells, microenvironment and beyond.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/11\/2022 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"70","Key":"1a92fb13-1c1b-4a1d-9626-575f4dfc58a4","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room 265-268, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SS01.
