However, many of these patients will eventually become resistant to these drugs.   Further, 85% of metastatic cancer patients fail to respond at all to these single agents.  Combinations of these drugs have marginally improved outcomes, but increased toxicities often limit their use.  Future progress will depend on identifying druggable immune resistance pathways that naturally exist or develop with single drug treatment, biomarkers that can be used to define patients who will benefit from combinations, and delivery systems that provide greater local activity with reduced systemic toxicities.  This session brings together experts in the field to discuss the challenges in developing new immune checkpoint drug combinations, highlighting new combinations on the horizon, and novel biomarkers that can facilitate testing and optimizing these combinations for more effective treatment of cancer patients.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/12\/2022 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"62","Key":"c1dbe087-6720-44e1-b33f-839293c4fce4","LastUpdated":"2022-03-25 12:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"New Orleans Theater B, Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO11.
