[{"Abstract":"Neuroblastoma is a highly heterogeneous disease not only in the clinical presentation of individual patients, but also in the cellular composition of any given tumor. Insights into this diversity have only recently been enabled due to advancements in single cell technologies, which have facilitated investigation of this disease at unprecedented resolution and detail. Coinciding with the growing number of scRNA-seq technologies, so too are the number of single cell datasets encompassing neuroblastoma patients across several institutions. However, due to the rarity of the affliction and sample access, the cohort pool in each aforementioned scRNA-seq study is limited to a reduced representation of the spectrum of disease classifications, which limits the ability of any single study to draw conclusions about neuroblastoma as a whole. Moreover, inconsistencies in data acquisition and analytical approaches across these studies have led to diverging interpretations. As such, we decided to amass the entirety of publicly available neuroblastoma scRNA-seq studies, representing a more comprehensive cross-section of patient presentations, towards the goal of conducting an exhaustive meta-analysis of the underlying data. To this end, we have implemented a generalizable non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)-based framework targeted at discovering conserved gene expression programs in malignant neuroblastoma as well as the supporting microenvironment. Using graph-based network analyses for classification of gene expression programs, we have identified conserved signatures of malignant and non-tumor cell types in neuroblastoma. In addition to defining the landscape of expression programs in human neuroblastoma patients, we have also utilized the NMF analysis to assess the alignment of several preclinical models to human signatures. We have identified gene expression programs that align to malignant human expression programs as well as signatures more closely related to non-tumor cell types. These include previously characterized divergent mesenchymal and adrenergic programs, as well as undescribed liver\/metabolic, neuronal, and glial signatures. When considering the affinity of neuroblastoma models to malignant human profiles we observed specific agreement between certain preclinical signatures and subtype classifications found in patient samples. Careful consideration of these results will allow researchers to guide preclinical studies by cross-referencing neuroblastoma models of interest with patient profiles. Overall, we characterize the most updated view of the landscape of neuroblastoma by documenting the full repertoire of gene expression programs across patient and preclinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8c46ca77-3f08-4097-8885-eccdb36f2af4\/@w03B8ZAt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Bioinformatics,Gene expression analysis,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15496"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Richard Chapple<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charlie Wright<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Geeleher<\/i><\/presenter>.

At a histological level, NEPC exhibits heterogeneous pathologies; nevertheless, the molecular features, drivers and therapeutic implications of this heterogeneity are poorly understood. Single cell technology enables the resolution needed to unveil the complex heterogeneity of NEPC that bulk RNA analysis could not previously detect. Therefore, we aim to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of NEPC at a single cell level to detect common phenotypes across patients and identify new therapeutic targets. We performed single cell RNA sequencing on a novel cohort of nine patient derived xenograft (PDX) models that recapitulate the pathological and clinical heterogeneity of NEPC. Downstream analysis of single cell data was first completed on individual samples to identify distinct subpopulations of cells within each tumor. Then, integration analysis was performed to identify common and unique neuroendocrine populations across the different tumors. We profiled the transcriptome of 19,361 cells captured from the eight NEPCs. On an individual sample analysis, we detected 3 to 8 different subpopulations in each tumor, where every subpopulation displayed distinct biological properties such as epithelial mesenchymal transition, quiescence and stemness. Data integration of all samples revealed 16 subpopulations of tumor cells across all patients, of which 10 populations were primarily unique to one patient. Enriched pathway analyses revealed heterogeneous expression of most cancer hallmarks and oncogenic pathways across subpopulations, although some pathways were common to several neuroendocrine subpopulations such as EMT, P53 and KRAS. The detection of heterogeneous subpopulations in NEPC provides novel insight into why finding effective treatments for these aggressive tumors is challenging. Future work should focus on further evaluation of common druggable pathways that are shared across NEPC subpopulations. Alternatively, efforts could look at combination therapies that could effectively target these heterogeneous tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a8f79e7-e262-4098-9f13-a57bc876ae76\/@w03B8ZAt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Single cell,Neuroendocrine tumors,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15485"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rosalia Quezada Urban<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivakumar Keerthikumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashlee K.

Strategies to treat LUAD at its earliest stages heavily rely on improved understanding of its pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that progression of cancers, including LUADs, is tightly linked to a dynamic interplay between cancer cells and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which can block activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs), thereby hindering an effective anti-tumor immune response. Yet, how the TIME is shaped and the mechanisms mediating immune evasion in early-stage LUAD remain poorly understood. To fill this void, we dissected the phenotypic and clonotypic states as well as interaction networks of TILs by performing deep cellular and molecular profiling of 225,641 T cell transcriptomes and their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in 16 early-stage LUADs and matched normal lung (NL) samples using simultaneous single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scRNA\/TCR-seq). Clustering analysis revealed a highly heterogeneous T cell landscape with distinct cell states identified including na&#239;ve, effector, regulatory, helper and exhausted cell subsets, as well as cellular phenotypes indicating stress and interferon response. The landscape of TILs in LUAD tissues was far more heterogeneous when compared to NLs, and the compositions and phenotypes of TILs differed significantly across patients and in association with clinicopathological variables. Relative to NLs, LUADs were specifically enriched with regulatory and stress response subsets, whereas fractions of cytotoxic T cell subsets (e.g., CD4+ CTLs, CD8+ tissue-resident memory\/TRMs, and CD8+ natural killer T\/NKT cells) were decreased. scTCR-seq analysis revealed significantly increased TCR clonotype diversity and reduced clonality in LUADs compared to NLs. We then tracked phenotype transitions of TILs by integrative analysis of TCR clonotypes and transcriptional states. Intriguingly, expanded TCR clonotypes were mostly TILs with effector phenotypes that were largely shared between LUADs and NLs, suggesting that their clonal expansion may not be tumor-specific. Of note, expanded clones were also enriched with immunosuppressive phenotypes (e.g., regulatory, exhausted CD8, and stress response T cells). In contrast, we found that contracted TCR clonotypes were characterized by memory\/effector phenotypes. Together, our results reveal and characterize a diverse TIL landscape in early-stage LUAD encompassing a pre-existing and expanded T cell compartment that is likely tumor-unspecific, as well as switching in T cell phenotypes, and that together comprise viable targets for early immunotherapeutic interception of this malignancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8d7dea75-55af-4fbd-945f-f73fef3d6593\/@w03B8ZAt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,immune microenvironment,T cell repertoire,Tumor infiltrating T cells landscape,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15484"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guangchun Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ansam Sinjab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dapeng Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorena Gomez Bolanos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enyu Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa Maren Solis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Edwin Parra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Swisher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tina Cascone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Sepesi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junya Fujimoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Dubinett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ignacio Wistuba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Stevenson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avrum Spira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Humam Kadara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linghua Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Treatment advancement has improved MM survival remarkably over the past decade. However, despite being managed similarly, there are still patients who had early death while some having long survival. We aim to use single-cell sequencing to build a machine learning-based classifier that could predict patients&#8217; clinical outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Single-cell study evaluating the transcriptomic profile and protein expression, T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor sequencing were performed using droplet-based 10X Genomics 5&#8217; version 2 platform with 60 DNA-barcoded antibodies. We evaluated a total of 26 frozen bone marrow samples from functional high-risk (FHR) group who had early death within 3 years of MM diagnosis and suboptimal response to induction therapy or early relapse within 12 months and long survival (LS) group who are alive for more than 7 years from MM diagnosis and still alive at the time or recruitment. This cohort also included longitudinal samples at presentation, post-treatment, and\/or at relapse from 4 FHR and 3 LS patients. All patients were deemed fit to receive intensive treatment at diagnosis and received proteasome-inhibitor based induction therapy.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: This is a preliminary result of a classifier from 11 patients. We trained the model on all cells from 3 newly diagnosed FHR samples and 5 newly diagnosed LS samples. We then tested our classifier on 3 samples that were unseen during training, which consisted of 2 relapsed FHR samples and 1 refractory LS samples. We showed in a histogram that the number of cells binned by the response predictor score correlated well with patients&#8217; outcomes, in which samples with large numbers of poor scoring cells would respond poorly to treatment. We also evaluated the top 30 most important genes found by our classifier across all cell types in a heat map. For the next steps, we plan to include more samples to build our model. We also plan to run our classifier on selected cell types and identify key genes from these selected cell types, including plasma cells, T-cells, and monocytes. Longitudinal analysis of the samples from the same patient will also be performed to track clonal evolution with treatment and disease progression.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We developed a machine learning-based classifier that allows us to identify MM patients with early death and long survival based on single-cell sequencing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8b4593ed-b34d-43c7-9c58-fb19c9736746\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Multiomics,Single cell,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15487"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cinnie Y.

Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for one third of all CRCs. The treatment options of RC include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Locally advanced RC is treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and subsequent surgery. Less than 20% of RC patients have a complete response to nCRT. Our previous work demonstrated that RC subclones respond differently to nCRT. However, the resistance mechanisms remain elusive. To explore the mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in RC, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify and characterize the therapy-resistant RC cells. We generated patient-derived xenograft model in athymic nude mice with primary tumor cells collected from pre-treatment advanced RC patients. The compete treatment for xenograft animals includes 2 weeks of chemoradiotherapy and 1 week off. Tumor tissues were collected from mice for scRNA-Seq at a series of time points: no treatment, 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks after treatment. Single-cell analysis revealed five tumor cellular clusters with distinct gene expression profiles. The marker genes of cluster 1 were related to cell cycle, DNA replication, and p53 signaling pathway based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, which suggests that this cluster of cells are actively proliferating. Marker genes of cluster 3 were related to mineral absorption, PPAR signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. We compared the composition of the five cell clusters at each time point and found that while the cellular fractions of cluster 1 and cluster 3 initially dropped (2 days), they later increased (1 week and 3 weeks), suggesting that these two clusters were therapy-resistant and continued proliferating after the nCRT. Consistent with our previous DNA sequencing results, different cell populations also demonstrated tumor heterogeneity based on scRNA-seq clustering analysis of the RC xenograft model. We further compared the gene expression levels before and after treatment and identified 147 differently expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway enrichment analysis of these DEGs highlighted that signaling pathways of IL-17, TNF, MAPK, and ErbB were up-regulated posttreatment, suggesting that they may be responsible for the therapy resistance of the tumor cell clusters. These results shed light on the importance of these signaling pathways on the mechanisms of rectal cancer therapy resistance. Further work is needed to validate this discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f8c60b4-6225-434d-8725-ea8271d5f59b\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Chemotherapy response,Single cell,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15486"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yu Chen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Regina K.

The 4-year progression-free survival is still only 31%. Current biomarkers are insufficient to predict why certain patients with FLT3-ITD AML relapse and others do not. The development of prognostic biomarkers in FLT3-ITD pediatric AML may help improve the outcomes and management of these patients. We acquired a panel of 37 diagnostic samples with 18 samples from FLT3-ITD pediatric AML patients with poor outcomes (relapse within 3 years) and 19 from favorable outcome patients that did not exhibit relapse for at least 5 years. Next, we performed FACS to isolate CD34<sup>+<\/sup>CD38<sup>dim<\/sup> and CD34<sup>+<\/sup>CD38<sup>+<\/sup> cells. These two populations were then sequenced using 10x Genomics 3&#8217; end single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Using this scRNAseq dataset comprising over 250k single cells, we first investigated if the frequency of specific RNA clusters of AML cells may predict patient outcome. We found 5 clusters had significantly different frequencies between patients with favorable and poor outcomes (p &#60; 0.05). Using these clusters, we performed CIBERSORTx deconvolution on publicly available FLT3-ITD AML bulk RNAseq samples from TCGA (n = 36), BeatAML (n = 47), and the TARGET project (n<sub>train<\/sub> = 72; n<sub>test<\/sub> = 26) to identify the inferred cluster composition present in each AML patient from these datasets. Next we built LASSO prediction models using the inferred scRNAseq clusters by CIBERSORTx and incorporating clinical features including leukemic blast percentage, bone marrow leukemic blast percentage, and WBC at diagnosis. We found these prediction models to be highly specific as a prognostic biomarker for pediatric AML (p &#60;&#60; 0.01). We were unable to train a model directly using genes from the publicly available bulk RNAseq data for pediatric FLT3-ITD AML, highlighting the relevance of using our deconvolution based biomarker. Between the high (&#62; median) and low (&#60; median) LASSO score groups, there was ~50% difference in the number of patients relapsing after 4 years. When we included this LASSO score in a multivariate cox regression (likelihood ratio p value = 0.007), the LASSO score (HR = 6.8, p = 0.026, CI = 1.26 - 37.28) showed additional predictive ability when including FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (HR = 1.83, p = 0.38, CI = 0.47 - 7.15) and MRD (HR = 3.95, p = 0.021 CI = 0.051 - 0.79). These results demonstrate that incorporating rare AML cell populations into a prognostic biomarker could add substantial clinical information to existing biomarkers. This indicates single-cell derived prognostic models can and should be explored further for pediatric FLT3-ITD AML and demonstrates a platform that could be used for other malignancies, including non-hematologic tumors, to create cell-type biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f1bff5a-8db5-4008-8323-7008f3478dcc\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15483"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert Schauner<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zachary Jackson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nethrie Idippily<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheela Karunanithi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivaprasaad Manjappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tae Hyun Hwang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Wald<\/i><\/presenter>.

Aptamers are folded nucleic acid chains that act much like chemical antibodies in that they can bind proteins in a sequence-specific manner. By identifying RNA aptamers capable of seeking and binding to specific cell surface protein receptors, SeekR&#8482; RNA therapeutics can be engineered to self-deliver to a particular receptor defined tissue type. For example, a SeekR&#8482; can be directed to prostate tumors that selectively express PSMA. The combination of two RNA aptamer binders with two siRNA silencers thus enables the selective delivery of the siRNAs to tumor cells expressing the binder target, wherein it directs sequence-specific silencing of cancer target genes. To identify and prioritize the right combination of SeekR targets, we have taken advantage of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets. By analyzing scRNA-seq data, we can identify specific cell populations within tumors to co-target with an aptamer and siRNA. We leveraged several publicly available colon and non-small cell lung cancer scRNA data sets for this analysis. A custom analysis pipeline was applied to these data to identify specific cell types within tumor samples. We then profiled specific cancer targets and determined percentages of target co-expression within a single tumor compared to normal cells. This provides information for cell-type-specific targeting to reduce potential toxicity within non-tumor tissue. In addition to targeting aptamers, we performed ligand-receptor analyses to prioritize specific siRNA targets in particular cell types within the tumor environment. This analysis revealed novel combinations of binders and silencers that will more precisely deliver the right multi-targeted gene silencing to the correct cell types. In summary, scRNA-seq data provide a rich resource of data to direct SeekR&#8482; development and optimization.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd3f6c80-dcd4-4844-a773-ffdfef5325b8\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aptamer,,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15488"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Susan Massey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shweta Yadav<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Azorsa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Spyro Mousses<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jeffrey A.

The number, type and indications of clinical trials for CAR-engineered cell therapies have increased rapidly in recent years (MacKay et al., 2020). However, serious and potentially life-threaten toxicities, such as on-target, off-tumor effects, remain a major limitation of CAR-engineered cell therapies (Dougan et al., 2021; MacKay et al., 2020). To better understand the effects of CAR-directed immunotherapy, a systematic single-cell-level dissection of the expression of divergent CAR targets in various cell types across different normal tissues is urgently required. We analyzed the expression of 591 CAR targets, including 71 that were employed in clinical trials up to January 2021 and 520 that were predicted to have favorable safety profiles (MacKay et al., 2020), in two independent single-cell cohorts, including 342,755 adult cell scRNA-seq data from human cell landscape (HCL) based on Microwell-seq (Han et al., 2020), and 84,363 adult cell scRNA-seq data from adult human cell atlas (AHCA) based on 10&#215; Genomics (He et al., 2020). We used a stringent cutoff by defining a CAR target as a potentially risky gene (PRG) if it was measurable in more than 100 non-immune cells and more than 2% of the total cells in at least three normal tissues. We identified 92 and 88 PRGs from HCL and AHCA by employing this criterion, with 57 PRGs shared in both HCL and AHCA datasets (hypergeometric test <i>p<\/i> = 7.17&#215;10<sup>-29<\/sup>), suggesting the robustness of our analysis. To aid the research community in the design of CAR targets, we developed a user-friendly data portal, CAR target gene toxicity at single-cell level (CARTSC) (https:\/\/hanlab.tamhsc.edu\/CARTSC\/), to allow for browsing and searching the single target and logical &#8216;and&#8217; design switch expressions at the single-cell level.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/57fa7c97-d6a0-4278-9ff7-7be5d5eb7710\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Toxicity,Single cell,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15503"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ying Jing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Leng Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Studies of the CCA tumor micro-environment (TME) and intratumoral heterogeneity have been limited, despite clinically significant interaction between tumor and stromal or immune components across other tumor types. Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNASeq) has emerged as a valuable technique to characterize the TME. Here we present a case study profiling CCA TME at the resolution of scRNASeq, and the first application of a unique OncoTarget (OTar) and OncoTreat (OTr) approach [Alvarez et al. 2018, Zeleke et al. 2020, Mundi et al. 2021] to predict and identify actionable drug targets at the single-cell level. These are both CLIA-certified algorithms for personalized drug prediction, now adapted for the first time to drug sensitivity prediction at the level of individual tumor cells. scRNASeq from a human CCA sample revealed significant tumor immune infiltration, with T-cells comprising the largest population, and fewer than 10% of cells identified as tumor cells, such that transcriptional profiles from RNA-Seq derived from whole tumor samples would be dominated by non-tumor cells. VIPER-based protein activity inference of tumor cells identified three sub-populations, not distinguished by gene expression alone [Alvarez et al. 2016]. These were characterized by upregulation of KRAS pathway, TNFa signaling with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and upregulation of MYC targets, respectively. Consensus OTar\/OTr drug prediction analysis on both scRNASeq tumor cells and bulk RNA-Seq of an engrafted PDX model from resected tumor at the time of biopsy ranked Glasdegib, Plicamycin, Flavopiridol, AT9283, and Dacinostat as the top 5 drugs with best overall tumor cell coverage. Therefore, we administered these drugs to a cohort of 8 PDX-bearing mice per treatment arm. Dacinostat and Plicamycin significantly reduced tumor growth rate (p=0.007 and p=0.03, respectively), with Dacinostat stabilizing tumor size over 28 days of treatment. Both of these drugs significantly extended survival time by Kaplan-Meier regression (p=0.001 and p=0.03, respectively). Furthermore, scRNASeq data of drug-treated PDXs showed that Dacinostat uniformly depleted all three tumor sub-populations compared to Vehicle control, whereas one of the tumor sub-clusters was resistant to Plicamycin, consistent with single-cell drug sensitivity predicted by OTr.<br \/>Given the in vivo activity of these two drugs in inhibiting tumor growth, and the effectiveness of Dacinostat across observed tumor cell phenotypes, as well as the high immune infiltration of this CCA sample, these drugs may be translated into pre-clinical and clinical trials alone and in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4c0df01f-cdcf-4d20-8d40-a1289f144e1d\/@x03B8ZAu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Tumor heterogeneity,Cholangiocarcinoma,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/15504"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lorenzo Tomassoni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandar Obradovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Filemon Dela Cruz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daoqi Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise Fraser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susan E.
