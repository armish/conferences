[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer (PC) currently represents 7.5% of all new cancer cases; notably, the 5-year relative survival rate drops from 100% in localized cases to 30.2% in patients who present with metastases. There are no curative therapies for metastatic PC, and most men develop serial resistance to androgen suppression, resulting in a more aggressive disease state that is much more difficult to mitigate.<br \/>Fibroblasts have been implicated in cancer progression and are thought to intravasate alongside circulating tumor cells and prime metastatic sites for tumor growth. Our understanding of the precise mechanisms by which they contribute to PC, however, is relatively underdeveloped in comparison to other solid cancer types. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) engineered prostate cancer tissue (EPCaT) model comprised of PC-3 castration-resistant (CRPC) or LNCaP androgen-dependent (ADPC) PC cell lines in direct coculture with BJ-5ta fibroblasts. By specifically isolating this cell-cell interaction within a bioinspired poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen (PF) matrix, our EPCaT model introduces the ability to monitor coculture-driven changes at a tissue, cellular, and transcriptomic level.<br \/>Temporal variations in EPCaT growth, cell and colony morphology, cell populations, and cell-mediated remodeling of the PF matrix were assessed. Changes in bulk transcriptomic expression were also quantified and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated between CRPC and ADPC mono- and coculture conditions. Finally, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, EPCaTs were evaluated against normal and primary tumor tissue transcriptomic data acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).<br \/>In comparison to monoculture EPCaTs, both CRPC- and ADPC-fibroblast coculture conditions resulted in an increase in the number of proliferative cells, morphological features of cancer cell migration, and cell-mediated remodeling of the PF matrix, all of which suggest a more aggressive cell phenotype. DEG and gene ontology analysis revealed coculture-driven changes in genes associated with important tumorigenic processes including ECM organization, angiogenesis, and epithelial cell proliferation and migration. Interestingly, fibroblast coculture had a significantly larger impact on the ADPC transcriptome in comparison to CRPC, suggesting that fibroblasts could play an elevated role in less aggressive disease states. Notable DEGs in ADPC coculture that were also clinically significant in the TCGA tumor versus normal comparison included an overexpression of OR51E2 which has been shown to increase epithelial cell proliferation and participate in the ADPC to CRPC switch, thus exacerbating PC progression. Future studies will augment the pathophysiological relevance of our EPCaT model by including patient-isolated cancer-associated fibroblasts from recurring and non-recurring patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/65724977-711b-4462-9804-da869eec8c3c\/@B03B8ZL2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Fibroblasts,Androgen ,In vitro Cancer Model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11469"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"4f3022bc-b0fc-4d9d-894c-00c40cad8154","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4f3022bc-b0fc-4d9d-894c-00c40cad8154\/@B03B8ZL2\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nicole L.

PDAC is characterized by high-density stroma and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that lead to a lack of efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies. Those facts highlight the urgent need for more relevant PDAC <i>in vitro<\/i> models that support the discovery of novel (immuno-)therapies. Here, we describe the establishment of a multiple cell type culture in a microfluidic platform that will be applied for modeling immune and stroma cell interplay in PDAC. Microfluidic platforms such as the OrganoPlate&#174; support 3D growth and inclusion of different cell types cultured under flow conditions. The aim of this project was to determine the involvement of stromal cells such as endothelial cells and pancreatic stellate cells in immune cell recruitment in pancreatic cancer. In order to generate a more relevant culture set up, supporting cells and PDAC organoids were used in the 3-lane OrganoPlate&#174; to study immune cell recruitment. Migration of fluorescently labelled peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vasculature through the stromal compartment to the PDAC organoids was tracked for 72h using confocal microscopy. Migration of immune cells to the tumor cell compartment was significantly inhibited by the stromal compartment, thus confirming <i>in vivo<\/i> immune responses, as the stroma seems to form both a physical as well as a chemical barrier for immune cells to reach the active tumor site. Interestingly, PDAC organoid conditioned medium efficiently attracts immune cells into the tumor compartment, indicating that secreted factors play a relevant role in immune cell recruitment. Despite the positive effect on recruitment and immune-tumor cell interaction, a lack of tumor cell killing is observed. The co-culture of PDAC organoids with stromal and immune cells grown on-a-Chip as described in this study indicates the suitability of microfluidic platforms for generating complex models and its use for dissecting complex cellular interplay and processes involved in the lack of anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ae3d62d6-eed2-4948-8202-deecce72478e\/@B03B8ZL2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Organoids,Stroma,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11471"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marlene Geyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina D'Agosto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Henriëtte Lanz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincenzo Corbo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jos Joore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karla S.

Here we describe a microfluidic organ-on-chip platform that incorporates tissue-tissue interfaces and physical forces to aid in the examination of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. A major advantage of this model is the ability to mimic peristalsis, a physiological process occurring in the gut. Live-cell imaging with a 3D printed organ-on-chip cradle was used to quantify the number of CRC cells that have invaded from the epithelial channel into the vascular channel over time. We determined that peristalsis-like motions in our organ-on-chip model enhanced the invasion capacity of CRC cells, mimicking intravasation. We subsequently examined the effluent media in stretched compared to non-stretched conditions using mass spectrometry based metabolomics and discovered an increase in the secretion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by CRC cells, implicating peristalsis-mediated tumor cell invasion with neurotransmitter release. Inhibitors targeting the GABA-A receptor reversed the observed tumor cell invasion phenotype when cells were subjected to peristalsis-like motions. Interestingly, even in the absence of peristalsis, tumor cell invasion was promoted when GABA agonists were introduced into the organ-on-chip system. This work reveals important interactions between CRC cells and their microenvironment, and that disrupting GABAergic signaling might be an approach to prevent or delay cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/879bf685-6304-4b2c-8566-dec8bd6b48dc\/@B03B8ZL2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Microfluidics,Colorectal cancer,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11472"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carly Strelez<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujatha Chilakala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kimya Ghaffarian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ah Young Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Katz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shannon M.

With distinct mutation signatures in patients, altering pathways is critical to preventing tumor cell dissemination to distant sites. Towards this, we characterized 21 \"trios\" patient-matched brain metastases (BT), primary tumors (LT), and normal samples (LN), revealing a pattern of extracellular matrix remodeling which suppressed immune cell infiltration. Our objectives were to (i) determine if clinically sampled primary lung tumors encode gene expression patterns distinct from normal tissue, suggestive of increased tumor invasiveness including brain metastasis (ii) determine the biologic underpinning of immune-suppressive information carryover from primary lung tumor to brain metastasis and (iii) determine if synchronous and metachronous (time to disease) clinically sample brain metastases tumors converge on a common signaling mechanism. Transformation of the normal lung cells to primary tumor cells suggested a breakdown in ECM axes primarily governed by upregulation of collagen (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL10A1), fibronectin (FN1), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP7, MMP9, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14) genes. Collectively, the primary tumor cells used MMPs to break down the main components of lung ECM and reorganized collagen and fibronectin in the tumor microenvironment to facilitate migration and invasion. With a disorganized ECM present in LT, a chemokine gradient from LT to BT was discernable with sustained FN1 expression that allowed dissemination into the brain microenvironment. Migration and subsequent cell adhesion in the brain microenvironment revealed upregulation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) and phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1). These changes in ECM profiles between LT and BT signify primary tumor cells' adaptation in the brain microenvironment. Further computational deconvolution revealed reduced HLA class II gene expression (HLA-DMA, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPA1, HLADPB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRA) correlated with a lower immune enrichment score of CD4+ T cells in synchronous tumors while metachronous tumors had distinct HLA expression profile. Overall, using the matched sequencing information, we will present the underlying signaling gradients that dictate dissemination of primary lung tumor cells to the brain environment in the background of altered ECM environment using cellular models harboring EGFR, KRAS, and ALK driver mutations cocultured with other cell types such as liver and breast.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Brain metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11473"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Albert R.

CAFs are also highly invasive compared with normal fibroblasts in a 3-D co-culture system with lung cancer cells. Due to CAF heterogeneity, there are various differences in cell motility even within a CAF population. To classify CAFs according to their motility, we named less motile CAFs as &#8220;static CAFs&#8221; and more motile CAFs as &#8220;motile CAFs&#8221;. To separate and isolate these static CAFs and motile CAFs from a 3-D co-culture system, CAFs were transfected with a green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein, Dendra2. Dendra2-transfected CAFs at specific areas (i.e., static or motile CAFs) were UV-irradiated using a confocal microscope. CAFs with red fluorescence were then isolated by flow cytometry and were subjected to RNA sequencing. In gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses, two types of CAFs showed significant differences in global gene expression patterns. These data suggest that heterogeneous CAFs with different motility have distinct roles in the regulation of various signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/06b60bb7-49a0-4547-a11e-507625794da4\/@B03B8ZL2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Gene expression in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Motility,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11475"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sieun Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young-Ho Ahn<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of ICI-based immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) has been extremely limited. Recent studies strikingly revealed that the human gut microbiome controls the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockades. Yet, the effect of the gut microbiome on reinforcing the ICI efficacy in MSS tumors in CRC is unknown. Here, we suggest a microengineered CRC Chip that recapitulates the tumor microenvironment of individual CRC patients by introducing biopsy-derived colonic organoid epithelium. We have built a three-dimensional (3D) lumen-capillary interface under peristalsis-like motions and flow in an oxygen-controlled microenvironment. We leverage this pathomimetic CRC Chip to recapitulate the patient-specific tumor-microbiome-immune axis to demonstrate microbial immunomodulation on the tumor cells and cytotoxic tumor immunity. We co-cultured various human intestinal bacteria in a CRC Chip to assess the immunomodulatory contribution to the tumor epithelium. We found that living <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i> sp. significantly reduces the PD-L1 on the tumor surface, followed by elevated anti-tumor activity after CD8 T cell-mediated cytotoxic interactions. We envision that our CRC Chip model can potentially reduce the knowledge gap between the bench and bedside. Furthermore, our innovative CRC Chip model may potentially offer a platform to validate the &#8220;Druggable microbiome&#8221; and the utility of the patient&#8217;s avatar model for Precision Medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e111afe1-c954-44de-85fd-fa43c51dbd11\/@B03B8ZL2\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Organoids,Microbiome,Bifidobacterium,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11533"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yong Cheol Shin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soyoun Min<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daesung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woojung Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>S.

Advances in technology in the past few years have created unprecedented opportunities to identify biomarkers of disease processes, especially by using multi-omics technologies and datasets to derive valid and useful signatures of disease. Mouse tumor models are widely used tools to demonstrate activity of novel immunotherapies. Despite their widespread use, a comprehensive view of their tumor-immune compositions and their relevance to human tumors has only begun to emerge. The use of specific mouse tissue phenotyping and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) assays offer the unique advantage of preserving the architectural features of the tumor and revealing the spatial relationships between tumor cells and immune cells. The urgency to discover and implement new biomarkers lays bare the need to integrate a variety of advanced pre-clinical tools to probe the dynamic nature of events happening in the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Here, we present an established mIF assay, InSituPlex&#174; technology, now enabled for rapid staining and visualization of dedicated 4-plex murine panels for deep, spatial phenotyping in the tumor microenvironment. Murine specific InSituPlex technology was used to perform singleplex and multiplex immune profiling on mouse FFPE tumor serial sections. Alternating serial sections were stained with a cocktail of four primary antibodies or a single primary antibody, in parallel, using Leica Biosystems BOND RX autostainer. Slides were imaged on the Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 providing high-quality images of the four targets (CD3, CD4, CD8, and FOXP3) in a single workday. The images were exported for downstream analysis with Indica Labs HALOv3.1 software. Concordance of the singleplex to the 4-plex mouse specific InSituPlex assay was assessed by quantifying the percent difference in cellular density of immune cell subtypes from 1-plex to 4-plex. Qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis revealed a high level of reproducibility of the assay, with each single markers&#8217; coefficients of variation falling within an acceptable range. Each single marker tested showed an expected level of expression and expression pattern. The multiplex assay was highly concordant to the singleplex assay. Unique phenotypes from whole slide analysis followed the expected pattern, as indicated by the tumor type. Our protocol of mIF staining on mouse tissue provides an improved workflow to investigate the immune system, including the analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment and mechanisms of action of immune-related drugs in preclinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/01317e15-5398-45c2-bc19-5ea1526cc5ad\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Biomarkers,Image analysis,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11632"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yvette Cajigas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hamer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina Ainbinder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gourab Chatterjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Vasaturo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mael Manesse<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kirsteen Maclean<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Research in the field of immuno-oncology and elucidation of the biological mechanisms by which cancer cells suppress immunological function has led to new biological treatments for cancer, such as pembrolizumab, which have shown great clinical success since their advent. Population-level analysis of immune cell populations is critical for understanding the immune-component of disease progression, and flow cytometry is a commonly utilized technique for this purpose. However, flow cytometry requires dissolution of tissue specimens, and is incompatible with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, the gold standard in tissue archives. In order to allow for cytometric analysis of FFPE tissues, we have developed a digital pathology technique for the quantitative assessment of immune-cell populations within tissue microarrays prepared from archived FFPE clinical tissue specimens from patient biopsies. The technique involves a combination of HALO&#174; image analysis using the Highplex FL, Spatial Analysis, and TMA modules, and custom scripting to develop imaging cytometry scatterplots.

Understanding spatial interactions between various cell types and their activation states in the TME is crucial for implementing successful immunotherapy strategies against various types of cancer. This study demonstrates a highly sensitive and specific multiplexed technique, the RNAscope HiPlex v2 in situ hybridization (ISH) assay for spatial and transcriptomic profiling of target genes to assess immune regulation in human lung, breast, cervical and ovarian FFPE tumor tissues. We have expanded our current RNAscope HiPlex assay capability of iteratively multiplexing up to 12 targets in fixed and fresh frozen samples to include formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. The novel FFPE reagent effectively reduces background autofluorescence, improving the signal to noise ratio. We have leveraged this technology to investigate spatial expression of 12 oncology and immuno-oncology target genes, including tumor markers, immune checkpoint markers, immunosuppression markers, immune cell markers and secreted chemokine RNA expression profile within the TME. The targets were simultaneously registered using HiPlex image registration software v2 that enables background subtraction. We visualized T cell infiltration and identified T cell subsets within tumors using <i>CD3 <\/i>and<i> CD8<\/i> expression and activated T cells by <i>IFNG<\/i> expression. We further identified subsets of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages by <i>CD68<\/i> and <i>CD163<\/i> expression as well effector cells which secrete chemokines and cytokine. We also detected the hypoxia markers <i>HIF1A<\/i> and <i>VEGF<\/i> to elucidate the immunosuppressive state of tumor cells. Preliminary analysis and quantification of the <i>HIF1A<\/i> expression using HALO&#174; image analysis software showed higher copy numbers in the lung tumor as compared to the other tumors, demonstrating the sensitivity of the assay through differential expression. We additionally showed the differential expression of immune checkpoint markers <i>PDCD<\/i><i>1<\/i>, and <i>CD274<\/i> within the TME. Using a highly sensitive multiplexed RNAscope HiPlex v2 ISH assay, we have demonstrated the capability of this technique to spatially resolve 12 targets in four different tumor types. The FFPE reagent efficiently quenched background autofluorescence in the tissues and identified immune cell signatures within the TME. Quantification of immunosuppressive markers further depicted differential expression among various tumors. This technology is highly beneficial for investigating complex and spatial tumor-stroma interactions in basic science and translational research. The assay can also provide valuable understanding of the biological crosstalk among various cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/15ac2bce-cec6-40a3-ac48-eb77af6bd5ed\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"In situ hybridization,Single cell,Immune cells,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11634"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"110e4c0e-2437-4bad-af41-1784c5b551a9","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/110e4c0e-2437-4bad-af41-1784c5b551a9\/@C03B8ZL3\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anushka Dikshit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Sayantani Basak<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ching-Wei Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michaeline Bunting<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Collins<\/i><\/presenter>.

Multi-omics analyses combining protein and nucleic acid biomarkers on a single tissue section can provide a deeper understanding of the complex cellular interactions in the context of the tumor. In this study, we demonstrate the versatility of Ultivue InSituPlex technology (ISP) through an integrated workflow for co-detection of protein and RNA on a single tissue section.<br \/>FFPE tumor tissue samples were processed for protein and\/or RNA detection on a single slide with an integrated workflow using ISP. Briefly, slides were stained for both protein and RNA targets using a Leica Biosystems BOND RX autostainer. Post-staining, the slides were imaged on ZEISS Axioscan.Z1 in five different fluorescent channels and evaluated using IndicaLabs HALO analysis software. In parallel, control serial sections were stained to perform comparative analyses.<br \/>Here we report an efficient and streamlined integrated workflow for co-detection of protein and RNA on a single section, powered by ISP technology. The protein and RNA targets were detected both sequentially (over different imaging rounds) with increased multiplexing capabilities, as well as concurrently (in the same imaging round) for a higher throughput solution, thereby demonstrating the flexibility of the workflow. Comparative analyses between the different workflows confirmed minimal effect on staining performance of individual biomarkers (both protein and RNA).<br \/>The gentle treatment of FFPE tissue sections through ISP technology preserves tissue integrity, and morphology enabling efficient detection of protein and RNA targets on a single section. The integrated workflows presented here demonstrate compatibility of the individual steps in the assay towards co-detection of protein and RNA targets with efficient sensitivity in terms of staining performance for individual biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3ad5b443-d55e-4251-80c0-d6da7b6f1353\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Molecular imaging,Immunohistochemistry,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11635"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Gourab Chatterjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Grace E.

Advances in technology in the past few years have created unprecedented opportunities to identify biomarkers of disease processes, especially by using multi-omics technologies and datasets to derive valid and useful signatures of disease. Advances in multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) staining and imaging technologies that allow for accurate phenotyping of individual cells while also preserving architectural features of the sample are critical to our understanding of the interplay of tumor and immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME).Herein we describe the utility of our new flexible mIF assays (FlexVUE&#8482; panels) to provide the necessary relevant distribution of infiltrating immune cells in tumors coupled to the use of our <i>new<\/i> UltiStacker&#8482; software. This hardware and software package allows a detailed spatial characterization of specific cell phenotypes defined by co- or lack of expression that may help in predicting clinical responses and mechanisms of resistance to therapy. The FlexVUE&#8482; mIF assay was used to conduct 8-plex immunophenotyping of FFPE tumor sections. Slides were stained with a cocktail of eight primary antibodies using Leica Biosystems BOND RX autostainer and imaged on the Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1. Following the first round of imaging, the slides were decoverslipped and the signal was removed. New targets were probed on the same tissue section in a reagent incubation step on the BOND RX, termed &#8216;exchange.&#8217; Slides were re-imaged on the Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 using the same dye channels. The image pairs were automatically aligned using UltiStacker&#8482; software and exported for downstream analysis with Indica Labs HALOv3.1 software. Our approach demonstrates a streamlined off the shelf workflow requiring no assay development time that supports whole slide imaging of a flexible high plex panel. In addition, our assays enable traditional same slide H&#38;E fusion on a single tissue slide for comprehensive tissue immunophenotyping analysis of proliferating cells, tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages or tertiary lymphoid structures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bde45116-401e-4997-92dd-05b451ee6995\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Tumor microenvironment,Fluorescence imaging,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11636"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yvette Cajigas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hamer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alina Ainbinder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Vasaturo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Douglas Wood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kirsteen H.

Remobilisation of exhausted tumor specific CD8 T cells (T<sub>EX<\/sub>) presents a possible therapeutic strategy for driving anti-tumor T cell responses. The success of biologics targeting receptors and ligands associated with exhausted T cells such as PD-1\/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 has spurred an acceleration of research to unravel the molecular processes that drive or maintain the exhausted state with the goal of developing treatments that target them. Effective therapeutic development necessitates reliable human <i>in-vitro<\/i> models that closely mimic disease conditions. To achieve this we adapted an <i>in-vitro<\/i> T<sub>EX <\/sub>model via application of flowing cytometry and time-lapse imaging techniques to kinetically assess T<sub>EX<\/sub> cell phenotype and function. Persistent and repeated rounds of polyclonal human CD8 T cell stimulation recapitulated distinctive characteristics of exhausted T cells including high expression of checkpoint receptors and upregulation of transcription factors known to suppress immune activation. Over 8 days and 4 rounds of stimulation T<sub>EX<\/sub> cells lost effector capabilities, producing lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and became refractory to re-stimulation through the TCR. In functional cytotoxicity assays T<sub>EX<\/sub> cells exhibited substantial deficits in target killing compared to donor matched Teff cell counterparts. Checkpoint receptor blockade partially restored Teff function by enhancing immune mediated target cell death. Overall, this <i>in-vitro<\/i> T<sub>EX<\/sub> assay models key aspects of CD8 T cell exhaustion and offers a versatile and accessible platform to test novel therapeutics targeting exhaustion pathways either individually or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to test if they fully restore effector function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/128916aa-cadd-4b7d-b9fd-1b42539cbbff\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11637"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Paulina Goral<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louise Brackenbury<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Robert Nunan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rhiannon Jenkinson<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the field of immuno-oncology, where access to tissue samples may be limited, there is a need for an accurate interpretation of the sociology and in-depth phenotyping of the cells in the tumor microenvironment that requires a higher level of targets to investigate. Cytotoxic T cells are the main effector cells against tumors. Conversely, T-regulatory cells play a more pro-tumor role by suppressing cytotoxic T cell activation. The importance of the balance and tumor infiltration of these two cell populations has repeatedly been demonstrated in the literature. Due to this, Cerba Research was driven to develop an immunofluorescent multiplex to allow cytotoxic and regulatory T cells detection on the same tissue section for use in solid tumor clinical trials. Following our standard workflow, we developed a CD3-CD8-FoxP3 IHC multiplex (Histoprofile&#174;- T-reg light). This panel allows for analysis of cytotoxic T-cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup>\/FoxP3<sup>-<\/sup>), T helper cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>-<\/sup>\/FoxP3<sup>-<\/sup>) and T regulatory cells (CD3<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>-<\/sup>\/FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>). Then following our standard process, we performed an analytical validation on a range of formalin fixed paraffin embedded solid tumors (including but not limited to Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Colorectal Cancer and Breast Cancer). Specificity was verified by a pathologist on control tonsil tissue. The robustness of the protocol on a range of solid tumors was verified by the pathologist on tissue blocks and tumor microarrays. Precision tests (intra- and inter-assay) demonstrated a high level of panel reproducibility in solid tumor tissues - CD3 (CV 21.24%), CD8 (CV 19.5%), FoxP3 (CV 13.13%). Using Halo&#174; software (Indica Labs), spatial analysis of the populations of interest can be appreciated in the tumor and stroma compartments. Cerba Research&#8217;s Histoprofile&#174;- T-reg light panel passed all the analytical validation criteria for use in clinical studies. Cerba Research can provide this off the shelf panel in solid tumor clinical studies, allowing an elevated analysis of multiple immune biomarkers on a single tissue slide.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5f53f216-173b-4764-b23d-d1bd8d330ed4\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immunohistochemistry,Regulatory T cells,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11651"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marie Gérus-Durand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Baranova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maroua Tliba<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Iglesias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manon Motte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renaud Burrer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Amanda Finan-Marchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

A systematic characterization of the immune microenvironment of ccRCC is important for understanding the disease progression and would be beneficial to predicting disease outcomes. To better understand the cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the interactions among different cell types, and the contribution to disease outcomes, we collected 34 ccRCC tumor samples for single-nuclei RNA-Seq (snRNASeq) profiling. We obtained 161312 cells in total, including 6791 stroma cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts) and 38918 immune cells (lymphoid and myeloid populations).Analysis of cell-cell-interactions suggests tumor cells interact most frequently with stroma and immune cells. Of interest, we noticed some ligand-receptor pair interactions commonly found among all samples, such as VEGFA from tumor cells with VEGFR1\/2 from endothelial cells, suggesting the presence of angiogenesis. Within endothelial populations, we found a common interaction between ANGPT2 and TEK, whose interaction scores are moderately correlated with lymphocyte percentages across samples, suggesting this interaction could contribute to endothelium leakage and lymphocytes recruitment. To better understand the immune cell subtype\/states within each immune cell type, we further distinguished 14 different subpopulations within macrophages according to key marker expressions. The presence of the subpopulations suggest diverse states and heterogeneous functions within macrophages. Of note, the expression of iron uptake receptor TFRC is elevated in higher-grade tumors.

Additionally, testing next-generation immune therapies remains difficult in animal models and requires sophisticated <i>ex vivo<\/i> systems to study human tumor biology and predict treatment response in real time. SCLC comprises approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases and despite recent incorporation of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) into first line treatment, patients with SCLC continue to have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Notably, recent transcriptomic profiling of SCLC has indicated significant inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We have previously demonstrated that neuroendocrine SCLC subpopulations downregulate MHC I, whereas non-neuroendocrine SCLC subpopulations exhibit increased innate immune signaling and robust upregulation of MHC I antigen presentation. Here we interrogate the vulnerability of SCLC populations to NK cells and investigate their trafficking using a novel microphysiological ex vivo model.<br \/>Methods: We developed a 3-dimensional (3D) microphysiological TME model of vascularized SCLC, comprising tumor spheroids embedded in a microvascular network self-assembled by endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts. Real time fluorescence imaging, cell-titer Glo and flow cytometry were used to quantify tumor cell viability in 2D and 3D microfluidic co-culture cytotoxicity assays, using primary NK cells and the NK92 cell line.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated robust targeting of MHC-I low SCLC cells by primary human NK cells and NK92, and found that MHC-I high SCLC subpopulations show resistance to NK cell-mediated killing. To dissect the influence of vascular barriers on immune cell trafficking, we developed a 3D microphysiological TME model of vascularized SCLC, which successfully recapitulated tumor-vascular-immune interactions in a human-relevant platform as evidenced by vascular perfusion by NK cells. Using this model, we were able to demonstrate that the activation of cGAS-STING signaling in endothelial cells results in the secretion of CXCL10 and upregulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin), promoting immune cell recruitment.<br \/>Conclusions: We successfully developed a 3D microphysiological model of vascularized SCLC TME and show proof of principle that this model can be used for preclinical studies of cell therapies. Using this novel microphysiological system, we revealed that co-opting STING signaling can promote NK cell recruitment to the SCLC TME. Taken together, we show that microphysiological systems can be used to identify and test therapeutic vulnerabilities while studying immune infiltration and killing in the TME, offering an accurate and adaptable platform for biologic discovery and therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e55013d3-7022-41d5-b6be-f56fe3e37d91\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Natural killer cells,Microfluidics,Vascular targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11676"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco Campisi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minyue Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nathaniel Spicer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Lizotte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erik H.

In this research, we used Microscoop, a fully-automatic microscope system integrated with a machine learning-based algorithm, to best determine ISs for proteomic mapping. We used Raji B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and induced the formation of ISs by incubating with Jurkat T cells. Multiple IS images were applied to train our algorithm using convolution neural network-based deep learning. A sequential process including fluorescence imaging, deep learning-enabled pattern generation, and photochemical labeling was implemented to achieve spatial-specific biotinylation of the IS proteins. Moreover, Microscoop is capable to repeat the process automatically on thousands of fields of view to label sufficient immune-synaptic proteins with biotin-tag for further enrichment allowing protein identification with mass spectrometry. We have successfully labeled and isolated proteins from spatially reorganized interfaces between T cells and APCs. Following MS-based proteomic analysis, several hundreds of proteins were identified, including the proteins known to be specifically associated with T-cell receptor (TCR) activation such as LCK, one of the major factors involved in TCR signaling at ISs. More interestingly, we identified several proteins novel for ISs, including proteins involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling. Our data showcases the capability of subcellular <i>de novo<\/i> spatial proteomics of the Microscoop technology, revealing novel factors responsible for initiating the immune response of a lymphocyte and shedding light on immune checkpoint signaling and tumor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a17f8425-db65-43bb-b9f8-1e019c16fd69\/@C03B8ZL3\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11689"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>You-Pi Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weng Man Chong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harry Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-De Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Wen Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsiao-Jen Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Wei Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jung-Chi Liao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Glioblastoma tumor masses are highly vascularized and infiltrated with cells mediating both innate and adaptive immunity. The presence and organization of various immune cells within the tumor microenvironment varies between patients and within individual tumors. This variability in the immune landscape influences responses to different treatment modalities, including immunotherapies. Understanding reciprocal immune-tumor cell interactions will enhance design and implementation of novel therapies. Currently, review of GBM patient tissues by neuropathologists is done visually using single or low-plex biomarker panels whose complexity is constrained by limitations of traditional immunohistochemistry, including the lack of well characterized primary antibody clones, limited antibody selection due to species-dependent workflows, and inaccuracies such as false signal intensities introduced by autofluorescence (AF) and spectral overlap from traditional immunofluorescence imaging methods. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and multispectral imaging (MSI) allows for fast, accurate imaging on a single tissue section of up to eight fluorophores (using Phenoptics technology), cell type-specific AF spectra, and DAPI\/Hoechst. It has been shown in other cancer types (i.e. lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma) that spatial biology techniques including multiplex immunofluorescence is necessary to determine cellular densities and interactions in tissue context to better predict outcomes and stratify patient populations. Here, we have used pre-validated mIF kits that use Opal fluorophores together with the Vectra Polaris Automated Quantitative MSI system on human formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded GBM tissue samples to further characterize immune-tumor microenvironments, with consideration for spatial distributions of interacting cells. Pre-optimized immunofluorescent kits targeting immune cell subsets, checkpoint inhibitors, and other biomarkers have been shown to provide clinically relevant information in other cancer types (such as lung cancer and melanoma). Our study indicates that widespread use of these reagents, coupled with spatial analysis and complex phenotyping, would better characterize the complex immune landscape of tumors and enhance design and implementation of therapeutics for GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9a29ccc3-798b-42f0-9582-6f3178bbc7f1\/@D03B8ZL4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,PD-L1,Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11694"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Agnes E.

Technologies like CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), which enable the detection of dozens of protein biomarkers <i>in situ<\/i>, have already transformed immuno-oncology and are expected to play formative roles in future research. To further support the implementation of CODEX in cancer research, we present a comprehensive 100 antibody panel that is aimed at in-depth identification of immune cell lineages, activation states, immune checkpoints, tissue structure, cellular signaling, apoptosis, DNA damage and cellular metabolism. Deployment of this panel is possible at high-throughput on the CODEX platform, which is a fully-integrated spatial biology solution that provides cyclical multiplexed imaging at unprecedented resolution and rapid turn-around time. The key features of this novel spatial biology system include: 1) true single-cell and sub-cellular resolution, 2) unparalleled biomarker imaging depth on whole FFPE samples, 3) wide-ranging compatibility with whole slide FFPE tissues, 4) panel customization and flexibility via dedicated barcodes, 5) uncompromised access to whole tissues, and 6) sophisticated single-cell analytical metrics. In this study, we generate a comprehensive account of the spatial biology in different tumor tissues including lung cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma using the CODEX instrument.

The encoding scheme is enabled by a 20nm hybridization-based optical barcode. The CosMx system uses a fully automated, cyclic microfluidics imaging system, high-resolution optics and 3D capability. The raw cyclic encoded 4-color tissue images are decoded using a robust automated decoding algorithm that detects protein sub-cellular localization and quantifies expression level. CosMx SMI produces protein localization maps for each target, which characterizes tissue microenvironment heterogeneity while providing spatial information. Additionally, accurate segmentation of individual cells enables spatial single-cell protein expression analysis, facilitating further mining and analyses of cellular subpopulations. The CosMx protein assay reagents were validated on multi-organ FFPE tissue microarrays and 35 human FFPE cell lines, including overexpression lines for key targets and cellular activation states, such as GITR, CD278, PD-L1, and PD-1. Benchmarking to multiple orthogonal datasets (e.g., the Human Protein Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and low-plex IHC) demonstrates that the assay is highly sensitive and specific. CosMx SMI protein assay can be coupled with SMI&#8217;s 1000-plex RNA-detection assay; together, such a multi-omics platform can generate an unprecedented information-rich view of spatial biology that could usher in novel discoveries about health and disease.

Still, some patients with an expected good prognosis experience recurrence of disease which dramatically reduces survival rates. Currently, we lack the knowledge to predict which patients will get recurrence. We used Imaging Mass Cytometry to examine 27 proteins in tissue microarrays of 36 primary FIGO IB endometrial carcinomas, of which 17 later recurred. High dimensional images were segmented to extract single-cell information for each tumor. Distinct epithelial-, stromal- and immune cell types of the tumor microenvironment were identified and phenotyped, using protein expression intensities and unsupervised cell clustering. Neighboring cells of CD8+ cells were extracted and phenotyped. In non-recurrent tumors, more cytotoxic T cells were identified adjacent to two epithelial cell populations characterized by high vimentin and<sup> <\/sup>progesterone receptor expression (p &#60; 0.01 and p = 0.02). Tumors that were enriched for vimentin showed significantly better recurrence-free survival than tumors with low vimentin or high alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) signal (p = 0.026). This study reveals distinct characteristics in the microenvironment of low stage tumors that may aid in identifying high-risk patients. Further, the study provides new insight on the pathogenic processes involved in tumor progression of endometrial cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8278760d-cdf7-430b-8e00-f3f64331dc7d\/@D03B8ZL4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11697"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hilde Eide Lien<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hege Fredriksen Berg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erling Andre Hoivik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jone Trovik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingfrid Salvesen Haldorsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Andreas Akslen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Krakstad<\/i><\/presenter>.

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) affects up to 6-8% of patients with localized PCa and up to 30% of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and is predictive of response to PARP inhibitors. The potential activity of ICI in this subset of patients is unknown and the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with HRD is poorly understood. We used PCa tumors of patients with known HRD alterations as a model to study clinically relevant, therapeutically targetable drivers of tumor immunology.<br \/>Methods: Archival tumor tissue of patients with known germline or somatic HRD alterations enrolled in our institutional GU Biobank (n=13) was used for immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of the following immune markers in both tumor cells (TC) and stromal lymphocytes (SL): CD8, adenosine receptor 2a (A2aR), GAL9, IL-2, LAG3, PD-L2, and TIM-3. The same markers were analyzed in untreated (n=104), neoadjuvant hormone therapy treated (NHT) (n=16), neuroendocrine (NEPC) (n=41) and CRPC (n=22) tissue. Two-tailed t-test and Pearson R correlations were performed for analysis.<br \/>Results: Among screened HRD alterations,BRCA1\/2 were the most frequently identified (BRCA1\/2n=6, FANCCn=1, FANCD2=2, PALB2=1, CDK12n=1, ATRn=2). CD8+ cells were primarily localized in the stroma of HRD cohort specimens and were more abundant compared to NEPC (p&#8804; 0.05) and untreated tumors (p&#8804;0.01). The HRD cohort had higher levels of A2aR, in TC and SL (p&#8804;0 .0001 for both) and higher levels of PD-L2 in TC (p&#8804;0.0001) compared to all other cohorts and in the SL (p&#8804;0.05) compared to untreated, CRPC and NEPC cohorts. Lower levels of LAG3 were found in the HRD cohort TC compared to NHT cohort, and in HRD cohort SL compared to all cohorts (p&#8804;0.0001 for both). There was no difference in TIM-3 or GAL9 expression.<br \/>Conclusions: Evaluation of stromal and tumor cell immune profiling indicates that compared to other subtypes, PCa with HRD alteration have a unique immune profile abundant in CD8+ cell, and PD-L2 and A2aR expression. Not only does this indicate an immune active TME but also identifies therapeutically actionable immunotherapeutic pathways which may render clinical benefit in this patient population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fbd3b027-92d9-4dc1-93bf-71da37a4b6bf\/@D03B8ZL4\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Immunomodulation,DNA repair,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11718"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Maryam Soleimani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sonia Kung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neetu Saxena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ladan Fazli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lucia Nappi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
