IV administered GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART) regress DMG in preclinical models, and locoregionally delivered CARs demonstrate enhanced activity in xenograft models of brain tumors.<br \/>Methods: NCT04196413 is a 3+3 Phase I dose escalation trial testing GD2-CART in patients with H3K27M DMG, with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) considered independently for DIPG and spinal DMG (sDMG). Arm A tested escalating doses of IV GD2-CART (DL1: 1e6 GD2-CART\/kg; DL2=3e6 GD2-CART\/kg) following lymphodepletion (LD). After the DLT period, patients with clinical and\/or radiographic benefit were eligible for subsequent ICV GD2-CART (10-30e6 GD2-CART) administered via Ommaya catheter without LD every 4-8 weeks for a maximum of 12 doses. We previously reported early results from 4 patients treated on DL1, which demonstrated clinical activity and manageable toxicity. Here we provide updated results for DL1 and DL2.<br \/>Results: Thirteen subjects were enrolled and 11 treated [n=4 DL1 (3 DIPG\/1 sDMG); n=9 DL2 (7 DIPG\/2 sDMG)]. Two subjects were removed prior to treatment due to rapid progression. No DLTs were observed on DL1. Three subjects experienced DLT on DL2 (2 DIPG\/1 sDMG) due to grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), successfully managed with tocilizumab, anakinra, and corticosteroids. CRS occurred earlier on DL2 vs. DL1 (Day 3 vs 7). On both dose levels, all subjects exhibited transient symptoms related to on-tumor inflammation, termed Tumor Inflammation-Associated Neurotoxicity (TIAN), which was successfully managed with anakinra and, in some cases, CSF drainage and dexamethasone. No DLT due to TIAN has occurred.<br \/>Ten patients have had adequate follow-up to assess benefit. Nine experienced radiographic and\/or clinical benefit after IV infusion, and they received subsequent ICV GD2-CART infusions (median= 4 ICV infusions\/pt, range 1-6). ICV infusions were not associated with high-grade CRS, although some subjects developed transient fever, headache, meningismus, nausea, and\/or vomiting, and several subjects developed TIAN. Four patients continue to receive ICV infusions on study and have experienced continued clinical and radiographic benefit at 11+, 9.5+, 8+ and 7+ months following enrollment. A 31-year-old with sDMG has experienced a near-complete (&#62;95%) reduction in tumor volume and a 17-year-old with DIPG experienced a near-complete (&#62;98%) reduction in volume of a pontine tumor.<br \/>Conclusions: IV treatment of DIPG and sDMG with GD2-CART is safe at a dose of 1e6\/kg, but associated with unacceptable rates of high-grade CRS at 3e6\/kg. ICV GD2-CART without LD, administered following a previous course of IV GD2-CART with LD, has been well tolerated and has mediated impressive sustained clinical benefit in some patients with DIPG\/sDMG. Given these findings, we are launching a new arm to assess safety and activity and to define the recommended phase 2 dose for ICV delivery of GD2-CART without LD. Patients are eligible for up to 12 ICV infusions of GD2-CART administered every 4-6 weeks. Clinical benefit will be formally assessed using patient-reported outcomes. GD2-CART has the potential to transform therapy for patients with H3K27M+ DIPG\/sDMG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Glioma,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robbie G.

In mice, CARVac mediates expansion of adoptively transferred CAR-T cells, improving their persistence and functionality. BNT211 aims to establish CAR-T cell therapy for CLDN6-positive solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: This first-in-human, open label, multi-center trial involves a bifurcated 3+3 design with CLDN6 CAR-T cell dose escalations for both monotherapy (Part 1) and combination with CARVac (Part 2) following lymphodepletion. In Part 2, CARVac is applied q2\/3w up to 100 days post CAR-T cell transfer, including a one-step intra-patient dose escalation followed by q6w maintenance dosing. Patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory solid tumors without further standard treatment options and ECOG 0-1 are eligible for recruitment.<br \/>Results: As of 19<sup>th<\/sup> Jan 2022, 16 patients have been treated, with CAR-T cell transfer performed at dose levels (DLs) 1 and 2 for parts 1 and 2. In total, 37 &#8805;G3 AEs related to the drug product (mainly cytopenia, or transaminase and lipase elevations without clinical correlates) and 2 DLTs (G4 cytopenia at DL2, part 1 and G4 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis at DL2, part 2) were reported (all resolved). Pronounced cytopenia occurred in patients with testicular cancer who had recently received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. For these patients a lymphodepletion-free\/reduced cohort was recently opened. Analysis of CAR-T cell frequency in peripheral blood revealed robust engraftment in all patients, with peak engraftment around day 17. Manageable cytokine release syndrome (G1-2) without any signs of neurotoxicity was observed in 8 patients. Administration of CARVac resulted in transient flu-like symptoms resolving within 24 h. Preliminary efficacy data of 12 evaluable patients 6 weeks after infusion showed 5 patients with PRs (with 39-49% shrinkage of target lesions), 6 with SD and 1 patient with PD (ORR 42%; DCR 92%), with responses seen in testicular and ovarian cancer patients. At 12 weeks, 5 of the 6 patients with PRs showed deepening of responses (50-73% shrinkage). In addition, one testicular cancer patient was treated with a 50% lymphodepletion regime and showed PR after 6 weeks.<br \/>Conclusions: CLDN6 CAR-T cells &#177; CARVac show an acceptable safety profile at doses tested and encouraging signs of clinical activity. Data from the completed dose escalation phase will be presented.

We previously developed a promising therapy using CB-derived NK that were first IL-12\/IL-15\/IL-18-preactivated followed by expansion (P+E) with K562 feeder cells ex vivo and subsequently complexed with ICE&#174; AFM13 (a first-in-class CD30\/CD16A bispecific antibody construct) prior to infusion. These cytokine-induced memory-like NK showed greater in vivo antitumor activity than either P+E NK or AFM13 alone. This single-center phase I-II trial (NCT04074746) evaluates AFM13-precomplexed CB-NK cells in pts ages 15-75 with R\/R CD30+ lymphoma. Pts receive 2 cycles of fludarabine\/cyclophosphamide (days &#8722;5 to &#8722;3) followed by AFM13-CB NK cells (day 0) and 3 weekly intravenous infusions of AFM13 (200 mg, days 7, 14 and 21). Pts were enrolled at 3 dose levels: DL1 (10<sup>6<\/sup> NK\/Kg), DL2 (10<sup>7<\/sup> NK\/Kg) and DL3 (10<sup>8<\/sup> NK\/Kg). 19 pts have been treated to date at DL1 (N=3), DL2 (N=3) and DL3 (N=13); 18 have completed both planned cycles. All pts had active progressive disease at enrollment and no bridging therapy was given. Cords were selected for the 37 cycles without consideration for HLA match, which was 0\/6 (N=16), 1\/6 (N=17), 2\/6 (N=2), 3\/6 (N=1) and 4\/6 (N=1). There were no cases of CRS, ICANS or GVHD; 6 infusion-related reactions (1 G3, 5 G2) in 110 infusions of AFM13 alone and no reactions to the AFM13-loaded NK cells. DL3 was established as the RP2D. There were 17\/19 responses (8 CR, 9 PR, 2 PD). All 13 pts treated at the RP2D responded (6 CR, 7 PR). 2 pts subsequently received an autologous SCT. At median follow-up of 6 (2-16) months PFS\/OS across all dose levels are 58%\/79%. Expansion of CB NK cells occurred as early as 3 days post infusion and persisted for up to a month. In conclusion, the preliminary results of this first clinical trial of ICE&#174;-precomplexed NK cells for R\/R CD30+ lymphoma indicate excellent tolerability and high activity and warrant further investigation of this approach.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{7680C461-8B25-4220-A18A-980B6E899E6D}\"><caption>Baseline patient characteristics (N=19)<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age, median (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">37 (20-68)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Gender (male\/female)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 \/ 6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Diagnosis (Hodgkin \/ T-NHL)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">17 \/ 2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No. prior lines therapy, median (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (1-14)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior brentuximab vedotin<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior anti-PD-1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior SCT (autologous \/ allogeneic)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (8 \/ 5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior cellular therapy (CAR-T)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No. prior relapses\/progressive disease, median (range<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (1-14)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT02-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Bispecific antibody,Lymphoma,Adoptive immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yago Nieto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pinaki Banerjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Indreshpal Kaur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roland Bassett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucila Kerbauy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafet Basar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mecit Kaplan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lori Griffin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Esqueda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Ganesh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Barnett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amin Alousi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chitra Hosing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeremy Ramdial<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neeraj Saini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samer Srour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karenza Alexis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andreas Harstrick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth J.

ZUMA-7, a global Phase 3 randomized study, showed superiority of axi-cel over standard second-line therapy (N=359; event-free survival [EFS] HR 0.398, <i>P<\/i>&#60;.0001; median EFS 8.3 vs 2 months; estimated 2-year EFS 41% vs 16%; objective response rate [ORR] 83% vs 50%, Locke et al. <i>N Engl J Med.<\/i> 2021). Here we report axi-cel pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and product attributes associated with ZUMA-7 clinical outcomes.<br \/>Methods: Samples from patients who received axi-cel (n=170) were analyzed. PK, PD, and axi-cel T-cell composition (naive, CCR7+CD45RA+; differentiated, CCR7-) were assessed for associations with safety and efficacy using previously described methodologies (Neelapu et al. <i>NEJM<\/i>. 2017; Locke et al. <i>Blood Adv<\/i>. 2020).<br \/>Results: The median (Q1, Q3; n=162) peak CAR T-cell level, time to peak, and area under the curve within the first 28 days of treatment (AUC<sub>0-28<\/sub>) were 25.8 cells\/&#956;L (8.2, 57.9), 8 days (8, 9), and 236.2 cells\/&#956;L*days (76.4, 758.0), respectively. CAR T-cell peak and AUC<sub>0-28<\/sub> correlated with higher ORR (<i>P<\/i>=.0224 and .0054, respectively) and increased Grade (Gr) &#8805;3 neurologic events (NEs; <i>P<\/i>=.0006) but not with durability of response (<i>P<\/i>=.4894). Rapid transient increases in serum analytes, including granzyme B, ferritin, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL-10, IL-15, ICAM-1, and GM-CSF, occurred early (median peak &#8804;7 days) and were associated with increased Gr &#8805;3 NEs and Gr &#8805;3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS; <i>P<\/i>&#60;.05). Infusion products richer in naive-like T cells expressing CD27 and CD28 associated with increased EFS, ORR, and complete response (<i>P<\/i>&#60;.05). In contrast, infusion products richer in differentiated T cells (CCR7-) and with lower % of CCR7+CD45RA+ T cells associated with higher postinfusion peak levels and AUC<sub>0-28 <\/sub>of several proinflammatory and immunomodulatory serum analytes (eg, IL-15, ferritin, IFN-&#947;). Increased rates of Gr &#8805;3 NEs were found in patients who received axi-cel richer in CCR7- T cells (above median: 30% vs below median: 10%). Similarly, a trend of higher rates of Gr &#8805;3 NEs and CRS were observed in patients who received axi-cel that secreted higher levels of IFN-&#947; in co-culture with CD19-expressing targets.<br \/>Conclusions: Preinfusion axi-cel features and postinfusion PK\/PD profiles in the randomized phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial were associated with safety and efficacy outcomes and supported that optimizing product composition towards a juvenile T-cell phenotype (CCR7+CD45RA+) may improve axi-cel therapeutic index. These findings could result in future trials to evaluate if preemptive interventions, including enrichment of naive T cells in the product, could improve outcomes.
