[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer affects over 2,000,000 women worldwide, with more than 680,000 deaths per year. Increased breast density is one of the risk factors for breast cancer, albeit less than the risk associated with increased age and genetic mutation. It has been suggested that high breast density accounts for 15% of the breast cancers diagnosed. On radiographic examination, breast density appears as opaque regions associated with increased cellularity and matrix, which in some circumstances contribute to difficulty observing small tumors. Dense regions in the breast have been associated with both morphological changes as well as molecular changes in the tissue. How these changes may play a role in increased risk for tumorigenesis are not well described. In this study, we examine the partial spatial transcriptomes of specific regions in normal breast tissue containing dense regions, including regions of normal density, the interface of dense and non-dense regions and the dense regions themselves using the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling system (DSP). Multi-label immunofluorescence was used to distinguish tissue morphology in FFPE samples from two health patients. We selected 24 regions of interest (ROIs) from each tissue section included dense, interface and non-dense breast. Using barcoded DNA oligos attached in situ hybridization probes (for RNA) via ultraviolet (UV)- photocleavable linkers, we screened over 1800 genes from Cancer Transcriptome Atlas panel. Our results indicated an elevated expression of CD68 and CD33, markers for macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in dense breast regions as compared to the non-dense areas. Identifying markers for myeloid lineage cells was followed by an increased expression of the genes EOMES, TIGIT and RORA, which are engaged in the immunosuppressive phenotype. This could be hypothesized to support a pro-tumorigenesis microenvironment preventing T cells from recognizing newly arisen tumor cells. In addition, we also observed a significant expression of cytokines (IL12A and IL26) and chemokines (CCL19 and CXCL10) in the dense breast, which are involved in the regulation of inflammatory response and chemotaxis of monocytes and T-lymphocytes cells. Both CCL19 and IL26 have been demonstrated to play a role in cell proliferation. Thus, these initial studies suggest that the dense breast microenvironment is potentially a pro-tumorigenic environment that, with sufficient factors, gives rise to tumorigenesis. These data also suggest potential nodes of therapeutic intervention that may lower such risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ace68846-cdb6-4eb0-8828-0b1651d2e330\/@A03B8ZBC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast density,Tumor microenvironment,Inflammation,Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12716"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ana Karina De Oliveira<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patcharin Pramoonjago<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher A.

However, the spatial relationships and histological features of the tumor microenvironment were lost during this process. Combining snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technology, and immunofluorescence labeling, we discovered novel ccRCC progression tumor markers, and uncovered their spatial dependent expression pattern in both human ccRCC tumors and patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Using snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, novel tumor progression markers such as NDRG1, MGST1, ABCC3 and PCSK6 were discovered, and their expressions were validated in ST. We found that one of the key novel tumor markers, CP, exhibited specific spatial expression patterns on tissue slides. The elevation of CP expression region is associated with a higher degree of hyalinization in ccRCC human tumor samples. Similarly, using immunofluorescence labeling, we validated the co-expression of CP and PCSK6 canonical ccRCC marker CA9. Overall, this study revealed novel ccRCC progression markers and linked their spatial expression pattern with histological features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/166d3c09-2a73-4b57-8156-ac5ff32423ec\/@A03B8ZBC\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12718"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chia-Kuei Mo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yige Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Terekhanova Nadezhda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caravan Wagma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Preet Lal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siqi Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nataly Naser AL Deen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruiyang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanyan Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuhito Sato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lijun Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mamatha Serasanambati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Shinkle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reyka G.

We therefore profiled CD163+ cells to better understand their impact on this tumor and identify possible targetable markers. We hypothesize that, not only the presence of CD163+ cells, a marker of M2 macrophages, in the tumor tissue, but also the spatial context of CD163+ cells might be relevant for MCL development and treatment response.<br \/><b>Material and Methods: <\/b>Sixty-nine protein targets were measured by the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. This method allowed for preserved spatial context, in tissue microarrays from a population-based cohort of <i>de novo <\/i>MCL patients while investigating different markers. A total of 235 cores from 131 different patients were sampled. Regions of interest for CD20+, CD3+ and CD163+ cells were selected, with more than 600 areas of illumination (AOI) collected. From those, 85 AOI, belonging to 61 patients, were from CD163+ cells. These were subsequently classified according to their spatial profile: CD163+ cells within the tumor area and CD163+ cells excluded from the tumor area. Differentially expressed proteins between different tissue types were also explored.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Among the highest expressed proteins in the CD163 AOI were CD45, HLA-DR and CD68. The higher expression of both HLA-DR and CD68 suggests that macrophages in MCL microenvironment may display mixed phenotypes between pro- and anti-inflammatory stages, the called M1 and M2 polarization types. Interestingly, p53 and Ki67 were highly correlated among the CD163 AOI collected, which might suggest higher aggressiveness of CD163+ cells. We explored the differently expressed proteins between CD163 AOI sampled located within the tumor and excluded from the tumor\/tumor barrier. We identified significant differences in the expressed proteins between the two groups, such as p53, VISTA, ARG1, LAG3 and HLA-DR. p53 was higher in the CD163 AOI within the tumor area, whereas VISTA was highest expressed in CD163 AOI excluded from the tumor cells\/tumor barrier. Among the 85 CD163+ AOIs, 47 were sampled from lymph node biopsies, 14 from bone marrow, 10 from tonsil samples, four from the gastrointestinal tract, six from other tissue types and four from unknown origin. Principal component analysis and k-means clustering showed that most of bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract biopsies clustered apart from the remaining samples, with a few differentially expressed proteins, such as NF1 and CD66b.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study demonstrates that spatial localization within the MCL tumor affects the expression of CD163+ macrophages, adding to the premise that macrophages in tumor are not easily characterized by the concept of M1 and M2 types. Our results shed light on targetable features of the MCL tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5199f508-6f51-451f-b5b1-509cfcf599a2\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mantle cell lymphoma,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Spatial analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12719"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joana Matos Rodrigues<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lavanya Lokhande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Sandström Gerdtsson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Nikkarinen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hollander<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Porwit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingrid Glimelius<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mats Jerkeman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sara Ek<\/i><\/presenter>.

While PD-L1 immunohistochemistry is an approved companion diagnostic test, it is neither sensitive nor specific. Here, we describe the use of spatial transcriptomics using the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) as a discovery platform to find biomarkers for ICI response or resistance.<br \/>Methods: Pre-treatment samples from 56 patients with NSCLC treated with ICI were collected and analyzed in a tissue microarray (TMA) format in two-fold redundancy. The human whole transcriptome, represented by 18000 genes assessed by oligonucleotide-tagged <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization, was sequenced on the NovaSeq platform to quantify the mRNAs present in each region of interest. Three molecularly defined tissue compartments, defined by fluorescence co-localization (tumor [panCK+], leukocytes [CD45+\/CD68-], macrophages [CD68+]) were generated to assess mRNA. All statistical testing was performed using a two-sided significance level of &#945;=0.05.<br \/>Result: 54000 gene variables were generated per case, from them about 27000 were analyzed after removing targets with expression lower than a prespecified frequency. Expression distribution of <i>EPCAM<\/i> in tumor, <i>PTPRC<\/i> in leukocytes and <i>CD68<\/i> in macrophages confirmed that DSP successfully profiled the molecular compartments. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis was performed for 6-month clinical benefit across two distinct tumor TMA spots per patient. This resulted in a DEG list of about 250, 125 and 122 genes in CK, CD45 and CD68 compartment respectively. When we used the intersection of significantly associated with benefit genes the candidate list was reduced dramatically to 5, 10 and 10 distinct genes in CK (<i>CYBA, ESD, SH3BGRL3, TOP2B, UFM1<\/i>), CD45 (<i>ATRN, DGAT1, DNAAF9, GMPS, IFT20, MPHOSPH6, PKP4, SOCS2, TFAP4, TGFB3<\/i>) and CD68 (<i>ANKS3, ARFRP1, CTSD, DPYD, GTF3C5, HS2ST1, KIAA0895L, PIGR, SFTPA2, YEATS4<\/i>) compartment respectively. From them, using the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model we further identified <i>CYBA<\/i>, <i>ESD<\/i> and <i>UFM1<\/i> in CK, <i>DGAT1<\/i> and <i>IFT20<\/i> in CD45 and <i>ANKS3<\/i> and <i>DPYD<\/i> in CD68 to predict survival as well.<br \/>Conclusions: Using DSP technology allows rapid, patient-specific assessment of the transcriptome in TMAs by <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization in spatially defined molecular compartments. Here we show a small set of candidate genes that are associated with outcome in this ICI-treated cohort. By intersecting two non-adjacent cores of the same patient tissue sample, we have begun to dissect tumor heterogeneity and pilot biomarker candidate information with unique molecularly defined compartments for tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Results from this cohort may lead to a novel, spatially defined, transcriptomic approach for developing new biomarkers for immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c3c7599e-4770-4dc7-83db-d974e7a4bc7a\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression profiling,Sequencing,Immune checkpoint blockade,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12720"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Myrto Moutafi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Martinez-Morilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rolando Garcia-Milian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thazin Nwe Aung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis Vathiotis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niki Gavrielatou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vasiliki Xirou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonidas Salichos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David L.

In this study, we aimed to discover and validate spatially resolved protein markers associated with sensitivity to PD-1 axis inhibition across multiple NSCLC cohorts.<br \/>Methods: We first used the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) system in a discovery cohort of 56 NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 axis inhibitors at Yale (USA). Pre-treatment tumors were represented in a tissue microarray (YTMA471) and analyzed using a 71-plex primary antibody panel. Proteins were measured from three molecularly defined tissue compartments: tumor (CK+), leukocytes (CD45+\/CD68-), and macrophages (CD68+). We used quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) to orthogonally validate candidate biomarkers. For external validation of identified predictors, we assessed pre-treatment whole tissue sections from a cohort of 128 NSCLC patients treated with single-agent PD-1 axis inhibitors at the Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) using DSP (39-plex protein panel, measured from CK+ and CD45+ compartments). In addition, we analyzed two immunotherapy untreated cohorts to address prognostic significance: YTMA423 (Yale, USA; n = 252) and CIMA-CUN (UNAV, Spain; n = 124), using QIF and DSP respectively.<br \/>Results: Using continuous log-scaled data, we found 5 markers independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in the tumor compartment (including PD-L1, p = 0.002). Among the novel candidate predictors, tumor cell CD44, a marker of pluripotency and stemness, was associated with longer PFS (multivariate HR = 0.63, p= 0.002). Using QIF, we orthogonally validated that CD44 expression in the tumor compartment was associated with longer PFS (p &#60;0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.03). In the external validation cohort, CD44 expressed in the tumor compartment, but not in the immune compartment, was predictive of clinical benefit (OR 1.22, p = 0.018), and was significantly associated with longer PFS (first tertile cutpoint: HR 0.62, p = 0.03). In contrast, high CD44 expression was not associated with survival in the two untreated cohorts. Using DSP data from two cohorts, regions of interest with elevated expression of CD44 in tumor cells consistently showed prominent (Fold Change&#62;1.5, p&#60;0.05) upregulation of TIM-3, and PD-L1 and multiple co-stimulatory molecules (including CD40, ICOS, CD27).<br \/>Conclusion: This work highlights CD44 as a novel indicative biomarker of sensitivity to PD-1 axis blockade in NSCLC. NSCLCs with high CD44 expression in epithelial cells may be associated with an immune contexture primed for higher response to immune checkpoint blockade. Further studies are needed to understand the interplay between CD44+ cancer stem cell phenotype and mechanisms of immune evasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c0b08fe9-25fa-462c-9a15-1025e6a0fe23\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD44,Immune checkpoint blockade,Predictive biomarkers,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12725"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Myrto Moutafi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Magdalena Molero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Martinez-Morilla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Javier Baena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis Vathiotis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niki Gavrielatou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Castro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gorka Ruiz de Garibay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vera Adradas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Orive<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karmele Valencia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alfonso Galvo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis M.

It is critical to see the spatial organization of the cells are and where they form multicellular interaction networks. Here we present a single-cell spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis of human mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) and proficient (MMRp) colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. High tumor mutational burden MMRd tumors are known to have an immune response characterized by higher cytolytic T cell infiltrates compared to MMRp tumors, making them an ideal system for spatial single-cell profiling and understanding how the immune-driven programs differ between these tumors. MERFISH is a massively multiplexed single molecule imaging technology which can simultaneously capture and measure the quantity and distribution of hundreds to thousands of RNA species within single cells across a tissue<sup>1<\/sup>. We designed a MERFISH library of over 450 genes including genes important to proliferation, apoptosis, immune signaling, immune cell type pathways and other critical pathways in CRC. Patient samples, obtained commercially or through MGH, were hybridized with the designed MERFISH library and stained with a cell boundary marker to delineate cells across the tissue. We performed unsupervised clustering to identify cell types and we calculated spatial statistics to characterize how the cell type distribution varied between MMRd and MMRp tumors. We identified the cellular composition of each tumor, including immune and stromal cells, and the spatial distribution of these cell types. We were able to readily identify all cell types and states previously discovered by single-cell RNA sequencing<sup>2<\/sup> in intact patient specimens, thus providing an accurate map of the cellular composition and spatial organization of these cells in the tumor microenvironment. We transformed these cell types into neighborhoods and discovered a highly organized spatial distribution of most cell types throughout the tumor. While spatial organization was observed in both MMRp and MMRd CRC we saw a significant shift in spatial organization between these tumor classifications notably in the immune population. Further, previously predicted multicellular interaction networks<sup>2<\/sup> appeared as spatially organized structures in the tissue and were distinct in MMRd versus MMRp tumor specimens. Our data provide a richness of concrete hypotheses about which cells are working together, how these cells function cooperatively, and where these cells are located which will be critical in advancing therapy in these immunologically distinct types of colorectal cancer. These cancer maps are critical to truly understand the biology of CRC as well as identify avenues for the development of future therapies for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/13696a91-7648-4f76-ac56-f483a9432d99\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Mismatch repair deficiency,Microenvironment,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12722"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Colles Price<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan H.

With its immune-privileged nature, starting from the early pre-neoplastic state, it appears to easily evade the antitumor immune response. Although there is rationale for targeting PDAC immune pathways, little benefit has been observed to date.&#8239;The aim of the study was to interrogate the&#8239;immune landscape of PDAC utilising the&#8239; Nanostring&#8239;GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP), enabling&#8239;high-plex proteomic&#8239;characterisation whilst maintaining&#8239;tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8239;topographical features.<br \/>We assessed tumor samples from 28 treatment-naive PDAC cases represented in a multiregional FFPE tissue microarray (TMA) for which extensive IHC, molecular, genomic characterisation and clinicopathological follow-up data is available. Multiplex immunofluorescent staining for nuclei, panCK, aSMA and CD3 was used to guide region selection using the GeoMx DSP system in multiple TMA cores. 60 immune markers were quantified simultaneously in different tissue compartments defined by immunofluorescence co-localization including tumor (panCK+), immune stromal (PanCK-) regions.<br \/>The spatially informed assessment by DSP was validated by both regression and variable prognostication compared with IHC for stromal CD3, CD8 and CD68 in near serial TMA PDAC sections. Unsupervised analysis of proteome data (DSP) in the panCK-negative regions identified an immune poor group associated with shorter OS (13.0 versus 31.1mths, P=0.005). When transcriptomic subtype was considered, the checkpoint inhibitor B7-H3 was significantly upregulated in the squamous subtype tumours versus the classical group (Log2: 1.63, P = 0.001). Patients with high B7-H3 expression, using a median expression cut-off, were associated with shorter OS on multivariate analysis (HR: 4.16, P=0.01) a finding that was validated in an external cohort at the bulk transcriptome level.<br \/>This pilot scale discovery study shows the potential of the Nanostring DSP technology to identify spatially-informed biomarkers with prognostic relevance in biopsy sized samples from treatment-naive PDAC. A number of relevant candidate immune predictors were identified in a spatial context, which are currently undergoing validation in a larger independent cohort and within the neoadjuvant setting. Future studies will apply this technology to pre and post treatment biopsy samples.&#8239;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2573ba21-4e64-4cbf-b946-190f422950b4\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Proteomic analysis,Microenvironment,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12723"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Assya Legrini<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Holly Leslie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephan Dreyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joanne Edwards<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Biankin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nigel Jamieson<\/i><\/presenter>.

To understand this disparity, we must apply advanced molecular profiling to racially diverse cohorts. We propose the use of spatial transcriptomics to map whole transcriptome data to several thousand coordinates within tissue sections, for comprehensive and unbiased characterization of TNBC tumors and their microenvironment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We applied the Visium Spatial Gene Expression method (10x Genomics) to 28 fresh frozen TNBC tissue sections obtained from 14 patients (7 AAB and 7 Non-Hispanic White). Sections were stained with H&#38;E, and regions of tumor and stroma were annotated by a pathologist. The assay yielded whole transcriptome data from over 36,000 spatially-defined features, averaging 1,380 features per section. Expression data from each sample was normalized and subject to dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. All sections were also integrated into a single dataset, from which integrated clusters (IC) were defined. Several bioinformatics tools were used to annotate the data at the feature, cluster, and IC level. Join count statistical analysis was employed to quantify patterns of spatial aggregation or dispersion of ICs across samples.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Clustering analysis revealed that all samples exhibited a great deal of heterogeneity; most contained several transcriptionally distinct regions of both tumor and stroma. Application of the ESTIMATE gene sets at the feature level accurately defined tumor and non-malignant regions when compared to histopathological annotation. Gene set enrichment analysis at the cluster level allowed further classification of biological processes within each sample. Following integration of all 28 samples, 9 ICs were defined from transcriptional data. Although all ICs were present in all samples, IC5 - characterized by a strong hypoxic signature - was overrepresented in AAB samples. ICs were then mapped back to individual samples and subject to join count statistics. This revealed strong spatial autocorrelation within each IC, as well as significant spatial pairings of ICs. The fibrotic clusters IC3 and IC7 were strongly contiguous in all samples (z-score &#62; 5), as were tumor clusters IC1 and IC4. Conversely, we found spatial exclusion between IC3 and tumor clusters IC5 and IC2.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our study provides novel evidence of spatially related populations across diverse TNBC samples. Our findings suggest that, while TNBC tumors are highly heterogeneous, they exhibit elements of a common spatio-transcriptional architecture. Moreover, this provides a new framework in which to evaluate transcriptional differences between racial groups within a broader spatial context.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/417cc6ef-0e10-441b-8796-9b3441583c61\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular profiling,Spatial transcriptomics,Health disparities,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12724"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rania Bassiouni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Idowu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lee D.

Identifying the pharmacodynamic (PD) impact of ICI on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inform therapeutic development for patients with progressive disease. We sought to identify PD changes in the TME from patients before and after ICI therapy using a spatial transcriptomics platform that allows highly multiplexed profiling of 1,800 genes (Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiler [DSP]).<br \/>Methods: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from 22 patients was sourced commercially. Patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, then underwent a surgical tumor resection. After surgery an adjuvant chemotherapy was administered until progression; patients then received monotherapy ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Once progressed on ICI, another resection was performed. Patients were then treated with chemotherapy and followed until progression and\/or death. The DSP technology was used to independently profile RNA from PanCK<sup>+<\/sup> (tumor) and PanCK<sup>-<\/sup> (stroma) regions in the tissue based on fluorescence staining. Six circular regions of 600&#956;m in diameter were selected for analysis using the GeoMx instrument; each area contained CD3<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Additionally, immunohistochemistry for PDL1 and CD3 was performed, images were scored by a pathologist and analyzed with digital pathology algorithms.<br \/>Results:<i> <\/i>Spatial transcriptomic analysis of pre- vs post-ICI treatment in stroma revealed significant increases in T cell genes (<i>CD3E<\/i>, <i>TCRB<\/i>, <i>NKG7<\/i>), T-cell activation markers (<i>CD69<\/i>, <i>IFNG<\/i>, <i>OX40<\/i>, <i>GZMB, ICOS<\/i>), costimulatory signaling (<i>CD28<\/i>, <i>CD80<\/i>, <i>CD86<\/i>), and immune checkpoints (<i>CTLA4<\/i>, <i>TIGIT<\/i>). Ayers et al., <i>JCI<\/i> 2017 identified 28 genes predictive of ICI response, 12 were significantly upregulated in the stroma post-ICI (26 were present in the DSP panel). We identified genes in the pre-ICI stromal microenvironment that were highly expressed in patients with partial response to ICI, the most significant genes were involved in immune regulation (<i>IFIT1<\/i>) and extracellular matrix remodeling (<i>MMP3<\/i>). In contrast, stromal genes highly expressed in patients with progressive disease were associated with T-cell maintenance (<i>ETS1<\/i>, <i>IL7R<\/i>, <i>CCL19<\/i>).<br \/>Conclusions: In this study we used spatial transcriptomics to profile tissue regions where T-cells were in close proximity to tumor cells (microns). This focused, local PD analysis confirmed activated T-cells are present post-ICI. Ongoing studies in a larger cohort will be used to identify tumoral mechanisms of resistance and immune dysfunction to inform future therapeutics and combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e81f9171-6f3a-48ec-88e2-72b0bdff2ec6\/@B03B8ZBD\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Checkpoint Inhibitors,T cell,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12728"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Li Fan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Omar J.

The Hyperion&#8482; Imaging System utilizes IMC, based on CyTOF&#174; technology, to simultaneously assess up to 40 individual structural and functional markers in tissues, providing unprecedented insight into the organization and function of tissue microenvironment. We have previously demonstrated the application of IMC in combination with Maxpar&#174; panel kits to highlight cellular composition of human tissues. Here, we showcase the recently released Maxpar OnDemand Antibodies for IMC application on mouse tissue. We introduced 11 additional biomarkers to our existing mouse antibody catalog, providing the basis for the use of high-multiplex imaging in preclinical investigations. To demonstrate the IMC workflow on mouse tissue, we analyzed a normal mouse tissue microarray using IMC spatial proteomic analysis. Tissues were stained with a 20-marker panel designed to highlight tissue architecture and major immune lineage markers combined with our IMC Cell Segmentation Kit*. The IMC Cell Segmentation Kit facilitates identification of cellular borders using plasma membrane markers that lead to improved nucleus and plasma membrane demarcation. We generated a detailed spatial map of the heterogeneous tissue architecture and successfully identified immune, epithelial, and stromal cell populations in various mouse tissues. Additionally, we classified the activation state of immune cell populations, adhesion state of epithelial cells, and molecular composition of the extracellular matrix.Overall, this work demonstrates the capability of IMC to identify subcellular localization of cellular and structural markers in the mouse tissue microenvironment. Information gained from IMC studies will enable in-depth high-throughput phenotypic characterization of the tissue microenvironment in various mouse models of development and disease, and thus accelerate preclinical discoveries.<b> <\/b><br \/>*The IMC Cell Segmentation Kit is part of the Innovative Solutions menu of custom-made reagents and workflows developed and tested by Fluidigm scientists to give faster access to new cutting-edge solutions for high-multiplex single-cell analysis.

Developing predictive biomarkers of response to therapy is currently an unmet clinical need. The composition of the cellular content of the tumour microenvironment (TME) is an important characteristic driving treatment resistance. In this study, we utilised spatial transcriptomics methods, including Nanostring digital spatial profiling (DSP) and multiplex IHC, to define the tumour\/stroma (compartment) specific proteome and transcriptome from a cohort of 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line immunotherapy treated NSCLC patients.

Moreover, <i>IL2 <\/i>mRNA (p=0.001) in the stromal compartment was significantly increased in patients that were sensitive to ICI therapy, whilst CTLA-4 and IDO-1 were suppressed in responsive patients. Tumour compartment localised CD44 was depleted in the responder group and corresponded inversely with higher stromal expression of one of its ligands, <i>SPP1<\/i> (p=0.008). Orthogonal validation of CD44 by multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed both its association with response and localisation to tumour cells rather than immune cell infiltrate. Cox survival analysis showed that tumour compartment CD44 expression was associated with a poorer prognosis (HR=1.61, p=0.01) whilst stromal localisation of CTLA-4 (HR=1.78, p=0.003) and ARG1 (HR=2.37, p=0.01) were associated with poorer outcome. Through a multi-omics approach, we demonstrate the utility of spatial mapping of NSCLC tumours and provide evidence for the role of a number of compartment-specific biomarkers which may aid in identifying those likely to respond to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/09a64a3a-8024-4ff6-a3ca-03cefb988041\/@C03B8ZBE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12730"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arutha Kulasinghe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Monkman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honesty Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Mayer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Mehdi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Matigian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Cumberbatch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Milan Bhagat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rahul Ladwa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Mueller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Adams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken O'Byrne<\/i><\/presenter>.

This effect results in disruption of mitosis at the cellular level, and at the clinical level with significantly prolonged overall survival of patients with glioblastoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The molecular alterations that occur at the genomic and transcriptomic levels following TTFields treatment are unknown. We applied a spatial omics approach to elucidate spatial intratumoral effects of TTFields at the molecular level in regions of interest (ROI) in a mouse model of MPM.<br \/>Methods: Eight Balb\/C mice were injected with AB1 MPM cells until sizable tumors were observed (2-3 weeks). TTFields were applied, with heat sham used as a negative control. After 14 days (6 days of treatment, 2 days of rest, then 6 more days of treatment) tumors were resected, fixed and paraffin embedded. Following the Nanostring GeoMx protocol, thin sections of all eight tumors were placed on a slide, and incubated with both Ki-67 antibodies, and a GeoMx Mouse Cancer Transcriptome Atlas RNA probe set. Using Ki-67 staining as a guide, 12 ROIs were selected across each tumor to capture intratumoral heterogeneity, including the core and periphery of each tumor The DSP barcoded RNA probes were cleaved, sequenced and analyzed. We compared differential expression of subset gene classes of TTFields vs heat sham treated tumors; results were further stratified into Ki-67 high and low subsets for each sample. Results were assessed by Gene Set Enrichment.<br \/>Results: Sham-treated tumors grew to over 300 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; TTFields-treated tumors averaged 100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>,<sup> <\/sup>confirming anti-tumor effect. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis uncovered upregulation of genes associated with interferon-alpha and -gamma responses in TTFields-treated tumors, which also displayed downregulation of pathway components associated with glycolysis, mTOR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, cell invasion, hypoxia, and TNF-alpha signaling. Spatial analysis detected a heterogeneous response and differential expression between different portions of tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: TTFields application induces clear patterns of differential expression in the transcriptome of treated tumors, including an increasingly immune-stimulated tumor microenvironment that also affects molecular pathways critical to cellular proliferation and invasion. These findings point the way toward improved understanding of timing and sequences of TTFields in relation to systemic cytotoxic, targeted, and immune modulation forms of therapeutic strategies. Our finding of upregulated immune response implicates TTFields as a potential synergistic tactic when coupled with immunotherapeutic approaches.<b><u><\/u><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f47e8f4c-826a-400f-8752-86e384ffb85c\/@C03B8ZBE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Immunomodulation,Mesothelioma,Tumor markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12731"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Emil Lou<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine Ladner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerem Wainer-Katsir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karina Deniz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yaara Porat<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Brant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shiri Davidi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Padmanabhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip Wong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amrinder Nain<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clifford J.

This necessarily utilizes histological stains and immunohistochemical (IHC) chromogens that absorb visible light, between 430 and 690 nm. To complement the visible stains, we developed chromogens for use in IHC that absorb light outside the visible range, and imaging methods for detecting dyes absorbing from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near infrared (NIR). Invisible chromogens partnered with conventional visible stains on the same slide provides complementary information, enabling pathologists to gain deeper insights from a patient&#8217;s tissue.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Invisible IHC was performed using conventional antibodies and antibody-enzyme conjugates utilizing covalently deposited chromogens absorbing in the UV and NIR. This was combined with IHC using visible chromogens or histological stains. Resulting stained specimens were evaluated interactively in real-time using a dual-camera microscope system comprising color and monochrome cameras, or by recording single microscope fields using multispectral imaging and the monochrome camera.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Multiplex IHC was performed with different combinations of visible and invisible chromogens, with the highest level of multiplexing - 7 biomarkers + hematoxylin counterstain (5 visible IHC chromogens plus a UV and an NIR chromogen) - demonstrated on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate tumor. Images of each stain were recorded using multispectral imaging, and staining patterns were concordant with single stain DAB analysis on serial sections. In addition to increased IHC multiplexing capacity, multiplexing of IHC with histological stain was demonstrated by combining an NIR absorbing chromogen, identifying MART-1 expression, with H&#38;E staining on FFPE melanoma specimens. The dual-camera microscope presented video of the visible H&#38;E staining (color) next to the NIR IHC staining (monochrome) on the computer monitor as the specimen was manually scanned. Archiving was afforded by multispectral imaging which also enabled quantitative analysis. An additional advantage of the NIR chromogen was the suppression of melanin pigment, the absorbance of which was significantly reduced in the NIR. Other conventional stains multiplexed with invisible IHC on colon, lung, pancreas, and tonsil FFPE tissues also showed good separation of conventional and IHC staining.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Taking advantage of invisible chromogens, IHC multiplexing capacity can be increased and conventional histological stains can be combined with IHC on a single slide. Clinical benefits include saving precious specimen, enabling differentiation of cell populations by simultaneous expression of multiple biomarkers, and providing biomarker expression within the cellular and morphological context of conventional stains.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/021c2499-713d-4765-b647-32584344bb96\/@C03B8ZBE\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Biomarkers,multiplexing,tissue morphology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/12824"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Larry E.
