[{"Abstract":"Background: The widespread uptake of electronic health records (EHRs) has made the creation of custom, real-world datasets for research more feasible. As a result, multiple research datasets with overlapping populations are often generated, using different methodologies, and frequently siloed within and between research groups, limiting the scope of the data&#8217;s use. Currently, there is no standard for collating and evaluating such data. Using existing lung oncology datasets, we developed an approach to determine optimal methods of combining and curating clinical data from different sources.<br \/>Methods: Two separate study datasets containing data for lung cancer patients diagnosed and\/or treated within Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM, Toronto) were investigated. Study 1 manually abstracted clinical data for 1,990 patients, first seen at PM between 2014-2016; Study 2 leveraged the artificial intelligence engine, DARWEN&#8482;, to extract clinical data directly from EHRs for 4,466 patients, diagnosed between 2014-2018. Each dataset was individually assessed for internal consistency before comparing the overlapping population (Test Group, n=1892) to identify, investigate, and resolve differences. Patterns of data extraction performance were evaluated to define optimal methods for combining datasets and informing future data collection. Herein, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status is used as an illustrative example.<br \/>Results: Study 1 and 2 had similar distributions of clinicodemographic data and frequency of EGFR mutations. The Test Group had 100% agreement for date of birth, and &#62;99% agreement for sex, with all discrepancies resulting from human error in Study 1. The Test Group had a 98% agreement for EGFR positivity and 98-99% agreement for specific exon mutations. Of the 106 disagreements for specific mutations, 50% (n=53) were due to Study 1 human error. Study 2 prioritized specificity over sensitivity for biomarker extraction, resulting in more false negatives (25% of errors, n=26). As DARWEN&#8482; only extracted EGFR data from pathology reports, 18% (n=19) of discrepancies were due to lack of access to relevant information captured elsewhere in patients&#8217; EHRs. Adjudicators could not resolve the remaining 7% of disagreements (n=8).<br \/>Conclusions: By comparing overlapping datasets, the strengths and weaknesses of each study design and extraction methodology were identified. This process demonstrated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence for extracting accurate patient-level clinicodemographic and mutation status data from EHRs, and the value of targeted manual chart review. Our approach provides a roadmap for leveraging existing clinical datasets to their fullest potential ,which is relevant across diverse data extraction methods and study designs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/aec9485d-8ba5-4748-9d86-d039f2b0ed67\/@v03B8ZCt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR,Databases,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11961"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin M.

The length of time between initial diagnosis and documented distant metastasis based on tumor subtypes has not been well-studied in real-world settings, which means that for any given patient, generalized screening recommendations may be either too stringent or too relaxed. Here, we report how tumor histologic and molecular characteristics analyzed from a real-world data platform correlate with the average time to distant recurrence. This information can guide more personalized surveillance for BC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Ciitizen (a wholly owned subsidiary of Invitae) leverages HIPAA right of access on behalf of patients to collect their medical records, extracts relevant clinical information into a standardized and validated longitudinal dataset, and - with their consent - enables research use of this data. From our current invasive BC cohort (n=1011), we identified a subcohort who were diagnosed at Stage I-III with associated histology and \/ or molecular characterization, then ultimately went on to develop distant metastases (n=195 cases involving 321 sites: bone, brain, liver, and \/ or lung). We calculated time from initial diagnosis to confirmation of distant metastasis at each site, and statistically analyzed differences using pooled hypothesis testing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In addition to finding expected associations between molecular type and site(s) of metastasis, i.e. bone and brain more common in Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+) subtypes vs HR-, we also characterized the average time to distant metastasis (TDM) to identify other statistically significant associations: <i>Molecular Type: <\/i>HR-\/HER2- (n=30) has an average TDM of 1124 days, which is significantly faster than HR+\/HER2- (2224 days; n=197) and HR+\/HER2+ (2159 days; n=32) (p=0.0043). <i>BRCA<\/i>: Individuals with BRCA1\/2 pathogenic germline variants have an average TDM of 1043 days (n=15), significantly earlier than individuals with normal BRCA1\/2 (2238 days; n=179) (p &#60;0.0001). <i>Histology<\/i>: Ductal carcinomas have an average TDM of 2262 days (n=242) and lobular carcinomas have an average TDM of 2812 days (n=24), both of which are significantly longer than the rarer metaplastic (739 days; n=11) and inflammatory (978 days; n=5) (p=0.0001).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>These real-world findings characterize average time to metastasis and reveal statistically significant associations based on histologic and molecular type, which taken together can inform more personalized screening recommendations for BC patients. Since the Ciitizen data platform also includes additional treatment and outcome variables, future studies can explore the relationships between these various features towards more granular prognostic and predictive classifications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e4ce588c-331f-41f2-95e4-e2185aaf88f5\/@v03B8ZCt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Predictive biomarkers,Databases,Molecular subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11962"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Amanda Nottke<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony B.

Real-world PFS (rwPFS) has been curated from clinician-documented progression in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), a time and resource intensive approach, that is not readily accessible in claims or structured EHRs. Alternatively, time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD) and time to next treatment (rwTTNT) are used as treatment-based scalable proxies of disease progression. We compared clinician-documented rwPFS to rwTTD and rwTTNT.<br \/>Methods: The study included patients with hormone receptor-positive\/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer (A\/MBC) who initiated first line treatment with palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor (1L) between 2015 and 2019 in US community health systems. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were extracted from EHRs. rwPFS was captured through EHR-documented confirmation by two clinicians of disease progression based on imaging and\/or pathology results. rwPFS, rwTTD and rwTTNT were defined as the time from 1L initiation until the date of clinician-confirmed progression, 1L discontinuation, or 2L initiation, respectively. Patients were censored at the first of: (1) death, (2) date of last contact, (3) study end date, (4) or at 2L for rwPFS.<br \/>Results: The study included 241 patients with median age 66 at A\/MBC diagnosis, among whom 85% were postmenopausal and 57% were de novo A\/MBC. During study follow-up (median 22.4 months), 86 (36%) patients had a clinician-confirmed progression (rwPFS events); 130 (54%) discontinued 1L (rwTTD events), and 96 (40%) initiated 2L (rwTTNT events). With clinician-confirmed progression as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221;, rwTTD had higher sensitivity (90% vs 71%) but lower specificity (66% vs 77%) than rwTTNT. Patient&#8217;s choice, hospice referral, and toxicity were common reasons for treatment discontinuation apart from disease progression. The 12, 24, and 48-month survival estimates were closer between rwPFS (0.78, 0.64, 0.51) and rwTTNT (0.80, 0.63, 0.47), than rwTTD (0.69, 0.51, 0.37). Median rwPFS (39 months, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 30-NA) and rwTTNT (32 months, 95% CI: 29-46) were also more alike (log-rank p = 0.90) than median rwPFS and rwTTD (24 months, 95% CI: 18-30; log-rank p=0.02). The correlation between rwPFS and rwTTNT was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.56-0.83), compared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57-0.84) between rwPFS and rwTTD. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses where death was part of rwPFS, rwTTNT, and rwTTD events rather than a censoring event.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest that rwTTNT may be a more adequate at-scale proxy for rwPFS than rwTTD. Studies should assess the generalizability of these findings to other tumor types and treatment settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5483aa9d-a479-4a4e-80ea-1d8d2d874a6d\/@v03B8ZCt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Progression,Real world evidence,TTNT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11984"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Monika A.

With the recent dramatic increase in the use of tumor genomic testing (TGT), records within EHRs are a rich data source for evaluating the impact of TGT results in real-world clinical practice of care and on patient outcomes. However, extracting TGT results from electronic health records (EHR) is challenging due to a lack of standards to communicate genomic information and an inability to store such information in commonly available EHR systems. Moreover, TGT results are delivered to clinicians in unstructured formats and image-based files (PDFs). We initiated a pilot study to assess the ability of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to convert EHR unstructured clinical text and PDF-formatted TGT results into research-quality data.<br \/>Methods: One author (RY) drew a sample of approximately 800 clinical text records from 21 breast cancer patients treated at University of Washington. Sources used for data extraction included medical record notes and PDF reports for two breast cancer gene expression tests: 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS, OncotypeDx) and\/or the 70-gene signature (MMP, Mammaprint). A team redacted all PHI and provided records to a commercial collaborator (Pangaeadata.AI, UK), along with definitions of variables to be extracted, but without annotated target answers. Existing NLP algorithms that leverage pre-training, fine-tuning and rules were adapted to extract 26 variables specified by the research team (e.g., age at diagnosis, histology, and RS or MMP dates and scores). The output placed variables into relevant, standardized formats and produced a research quality data set. The extraction strategy depended on the feature and variable characteristics. For example, cancer stage, an ordinal numerical variable, was determined with a rule-based extraction method from outpatient clinic notes and pathology reports, whereas the RS score, a continuous variable, came from OncotypeDx PDF and OCR semi-structured retrieval produced the output.<br \/>Results\/Conclusions: The Pangaea tool obtained an average accuracy of 97.3% with a standard deviation of 3.5% across all 26 variables. The approach is developed based on rules designed and validated by clinical experts, using a model that does not require training, making overfitting likely minimal. Qualitative analysis showed that: 1] algorithms used to electronically extract TGT results provided the same data as manual abstraction by physicians, and 2] context matters, namely, the capability of preliminary semantic understanding in the Pangaea model using contextual words and phrases contributed to high accuracy and can be generalized further with larger datasets. Expansion to other health care data systems is needed to assess scalability of these technologies to create research-quality data fit for use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/77f9c68e-01f5-472d-9caa-5489f3dc33cc\/@v03B8ZCt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11974"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rachel Yung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kari A.

However, with an abundance of tumor sequencing data and trial eligibility criteria available, it can be challenging for clinicians to identify PM trial options for patients. To address this challenge at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), we developed MatchMiner, an open-source platform for computationally matching patients to PM trials. MatchMiner has three modes of use: (1) patient-centric, where clinicians can view all available trial matches for a patient, (2) trial-centric, where clinical trial teams identify patients for their trials based on genomic and clinical criteria, and (3) trial search, where clinicians search for available trials based on clinical and genomic eligibility. Trial matching is performed via the MatchEngine, which computes trial matches based on patient genomic and clinical data and PM trial eligibility criteria. To encode trial eligibility criteria, we developed a structured format called clinical trial markup language (CTML), which uses Boolean logic to encode inclusion and exclusion criteria. Here, we describe our implementation of MatchMiner at DFCI including strategies that were successful and MatchMiner&#8217;s impact on trial consent. Since MatchMiner first went live in March 2017, a number of strategies have helped facilitate utilization of MatchMiner. The biggest impact has come from targeted departmental collaborations (Gastrointestinal, Breast, and Center for Cancer Therapeutic Innovation or CCTI), where the MatchMiner team worked directly with key departmental stakeholders to develop customized workflows. To facilitate access to MatchMiner among individual clinicians, we integrated the patient-centric and trial search modes into the Epic electronic health record. Other implementation strategies were piloted, such as weekly emails to clinicians alerting them to potential trial matches, but were less impactful. Overall, departmental collaborations have resulted in several ongoing MatchMiner initiatives. Thus far at DFCI, we have curated 354 PM trials into MatchMiner and facilitated 220 patient consents. For PM trials, 222 genes, 7 mutational signatures and nearly all cancer types were represented, demonstrating that there is a wide range of PM trial options available to patients. We also examined the distribution of trial phases and disease centers running each trial. The majority were Phase I and Phase II trials run out of the CCTI, consistent with the frequency with which novel drugs do not progress to later phase trials. Lastly, we have identified 220 trial consents that benefitted from MatchMiner. Retrospective analysis of a subset of these trial consents (n=166) revealed a significant 22% decrease in time to consent relative to other consents to the same trials, demonstrating the clinical impact of MatchMiner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/27be9c4a-3965-4531-b3fb-6bcc1f20f550\/@v03B8ZCt\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Targeted therapy,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11970"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"d90020c5-4381-49d2-bcbe-e4aa76aa5494","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d90020c5-4381-49d2-bcbe-e4aa76aa5494\/@v03B8ZCt\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Harry Klein<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tali Mazor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Priti Kumari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Ovalle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pavel Trukhanov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Hansel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Lindsay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hassett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Cerami<\/i><\/presenter>.

To overcome these limitations, we developed the Fuzzion2 program, which uses pattern matching to detect known gene fusions in unmapped paired-read RNA-Seq data. Given a set of patterns representing fusion transcript breakpoints, Fuzzion2 finds every read pair matching any of the patterns. Both exact and inexact (fuzzy) matches are detected; the fuzzy matching tolerates variations caused by sequencing errors, SNVs, and indels. By employing a novel index of frequency minimizers, Fuzzion2 needs only minutes to process a sample. We have also developed pipelines to produce patterns for Fuzzion2, from fusion contig sequences, from genomic breakpoints in DNA and RNA, and from fusion protein sequences.<br \/>To evaluate its applicability in clinical testing, we ran Fuzzion2 on ~2,000 RNA-seq samples profiled by the St. Jude clinical genomics program and confirmed its sensitivity in identifying lowly expressed fusions, such as KIAA1549-BRAF in low-grade glioma, which are frequently missed by commonly used fusion detection programs. Notably, Fuzzion2 detected a subclonal BCR-ABL1 fusion expressed at 1% and 6% of the wild-type BCR and ABL1 transcription level, respectively, in a B-lineage ALL sample that also has an IGH-CRLF fusion. Processing RNA-seq data from BCR-ABL1 cell lines, K562 with p210 fusion and OP1 with p190 fusion, diluted at 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 showed that Fuzzion2 can detect the fusion at 1:10-1:100 dilution, achieving a sensitivity 10 times greater than that of other fusion detection programs.<br \/>We also evaluated the performance of Fuzzion2 for large-scale data mining in a study to compare the prevalence of gene fusions in pediatric versus adult cancers. We assembled a set of 15,474 patterns representing 5,480 fusions identified in the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, NCI TARGET, clinical sequencing, and the COSMIC database. Fuzzion2 was deployed to the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud and analyzed 9,464 TCGA RNA-seq samples from adult solid and brain tumors. Processing took an average of 6 minutes at a cost of only US$0.16 per sample. Among the 105 recurrent fusions identified in pediatric cancers, only 11 were also found in adult cancers. These shared fusions can be classified into two categories: 1) gene fusions present in cancers that occur in both children and young adults, e.g., synovial sarcoma, papillary thyroid cancer, and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma; and 2) kinase fusions involving ABL1, NTRK, and FGFR. Our experience with Fuzzion2 demonstrates that it is a powerful tool for time-critical clinical application and large-scale data mining.

Finding the most recent information is not straightforward; clinical progress and drug approvals are recorded in clinical trial repositories, files from drug regulatory agencies, publications and conference abstracts. Often there is a delay between trials reaching their outcomes, publication and deposition of results in clinical trial databases. COSMIC Actionability is a new addition to COSMIC&#8217;s (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) portfolio of navigational databases for precision oncology. It indicates the availability of drugs that target mutations and tracks the progress of novel drugs through clinical development. All stages of drug development are represented, through safety and clinical efficacy to market approval, with additional data from case studies expanding mutation coverage. For each mutation-cancer type combination, a simple tiered system indicates whether marketed drugs are available and if not, indicates the progress of drug development efforts. Trial records available in databases such as Clinical Trials.gov and EudraCT are supplemented with trials identified in publications. Trial progression and outcomes are recorded; details are sourced from clinical trial databases, publications, conference abstracts, corporate announcements and regulatory authorities such as the FDA. Curation identifies results for approximately 40% more trials than are available in clinical trial databases alone.<br \/>Like other COSMIC resources, Actionability is manually curated by Ph.D. level experts. The current version of COSMIC Actionability (October 2021) has 49 fully curated genes with a further 237 having some clinical information. Details of 6244 drug-cancer type combinations are available, of which 2224 have clinical results. 963 drugs are represented, in 2224 treatment combinations. 149 point mutations and 520 further mutations or fusions are represented. This dataset will be made freely available in 2022 then released quarterly, with extended gene coverage and updates of previous content.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/447c7f02-e503-4987-b756-f2c49c1b62cb\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Databases,Somatic mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11982"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Steven C.

Rare molecular cancer subtypes pose difficulties in traditional clinical trials; however, collecting patient RWD can help elucidate the clinical utility of targeted therapies, molecular tumor boards (MTBs), and NGS-based genomic profiling. WAYFIND-R (NCT04529122) is a global registry that: 1) characterizes the treatments and clinical course of patients with cancer; 2) provides a data research platform to evaluate real-world treatment decisions and outcomes; 3) supports the design\/conduct of epidemiological research and clinical trials. WAYFIND-R will provide key learnings on data quality, sharing, and privacy for contemporary disease registries.<br \/>Unlike many disease registries, WAYFIND-R is global, prospective, longitudinal, generalizable (all clinically validated NGS-based tests of any panel size are permitted), and includes NGS testing and standardized data collection to enhance data quality and minimize missing data. WAYFIND-R includes adults with any type\/stage of solid tumor profiled with NGS &#8804;3 months before enrollment. NGS details, patient sociodemographics, cancer characteristics, patient-relevant safety data, treatment decisions, and outcomes are collected at baseline and prospectively every &#8805;6 months. WAYFIND-R will initially operate in ~12 countries, followed by further global expansion, in academic centers, community hospitals, and private clinics with regular MTBs. By 2026, WAYFIND-R aims to enroll ~15,000 patients. A key component is the potential to explore global and local data within a secure analytics platform (also known as a trusted research environment), accessed through a visual dashboard to find treatment decisions for similar patients elsewhere. Researchers can access the patient-level dataset for correlative analyses, after independent scientific committee approval. WAYFIND-R&#8217;s methodological\/operational aspects were guided by external experts and the European Medicines Agency.<br \/>As of October 2021, 11 patients have been enrolled.<br \/>WAYFIND-R will inform on best practice for NGS-based treatment decisions by clinicians, foster global collaborations between cancer centers (enabling robust conclusions regarding outcome data to be drawn), aid understanding of disparities in patients&#8217; access to advanced diagnostics and therapies, and ultimately drive advances in precision oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a04f63f-f9d7-476a-a966-eba09c29c83b\/@w03B8ZCu\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,cancer registry,real-world data,WAYFIND-R,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11990"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christophe Le Tourneau<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allan Hackshaw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Yves Blay<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jan Geissler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Clare Turnbull<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camille Perret<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Skatkova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Von Meyenn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodrigo Dienstmann<\/i><\/presenter>.

It has been a long-standing challenge for treating oncologists to select an effective patient-specific therapeutic strategy due to the molecular rationale, disease relevance, patient-specific issues, including patient access to treatments. We have developed a set of molecular and clinical evidence-based criteria as an algorithm for ranking therapeutic strategies in order to deliver optimal care and improve outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients included in the analysis received comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for selected biomarkers. CGP results of 50 patients with stage IV tumors were reviewed by our multidisciplinary Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), after which treatment recommendations were generated based on molecular matching only (Cohort 1). CGP results of the other current 29 patients with stage IV breast cancer were reviewed by MTB, and therapeutic recommendations were provided with ranking scores calculated by our molecular and clinical evidence-based algorithm with the criteria not only focusing on molecular matching, but also including disease relevance, patient-specific clinical considerations and treatment availability as weighting factors (Cohort 2). The matching rates from recommendations and treatment outcomes of the two cohorts were then assessed.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In Cohort 1, of the 50 patients, 34 patients (68%) were initiated with personalized therapeutic plans based on molecular matching that were recommended by our MTB. The other 16 patients were not treated with molecular matching therapeutic plans recommended by MTB, as the results of treating oncologists&#8217; choices, treatment availability or patient preference. Patients were followed and outcomes were then evaluated. Thirteen patients (38.2% of 34 patients) achieved progression-free survival (PFS) at 12-week time point, and 6 patients achieved PFS (including stable disease, N=4 and partial response, N=2) at 6-month time point. The other 21 patients (61.8% of 34 patients) could not be assessed due to disease progression, treatment termination per drug toxicity or death before the follow-up time point. Cohort 2 is ongoing, the results of which will be presented in the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our novel molecular and clinical evidence-based algorithm may be used to support oncologists decision-making to utilize the most clinically appropriate and effective therapeutic options. Additional studies with larger sample sizes in different type of solid tumors are planned in order to determine a clinically and statistically relevant range of score for the treatment recommendations with optimal clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/eba47f07-1602-4c72-bb28-06b21eefccd2\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Targeted therapy,Personalized medicine,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11989"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuliang Sun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Meissner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Elsey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leah Theisen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Jones<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Casey Williams<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cellular levels of ubiquitin are driven by the expression of RPS27A, UBA52, UBB and UBC. In cancer, the dysregulation of ubiquitination can affect various aspects of tumor progression including cell cycle regulation and gene expression. Ubiquitin B (UBB) gene has been shown to be over-expressed in some tumor types, including NSCLC and cervical cancer, and under-expressed in other tumors, in particularly a subset of ovarian cancers. A role for ubiquitin C (UBC) in cancer has not been well established but UBC has been described as a biomarker in renal cancer and CLL. In recent studies, repression of UBB in ovarian cancer cells was associated with sensitivity to UBC knockdown and demonstrated a synthetic lethal relationship. Since both UBB and UBC show substantial sequence homology, we explored the possibility of developing dual targeting siRNA that would silence both UBB and UBC. We identified unique individual siRNA sequences that efficiently silenced both UBB and UBC and led to rapid cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines including the colon cancer cell line HCT-116, the breast cancer cell line SK-BR3, and the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1. Treatment with either UBB-specific or UBC-specific siRNA did not show the same lethal phenotype. Dose response assays using the dual targeting siRNA designated U21 indicated EC50 for cytotoxicity between 50&#8211;500 pM in several cancer lines. Treatment of cancer cell lines with U21 leads to rapid apoptosis and cell death. Chemical modifications to pharmacologically stabilize the U21 siRNA sequence did not change its activity. The efficient cytotoxic activity of the U21 siRNA sequence has been integrated into our SeekR&#8482; platform to create aptamer-siRNA chimeras for targeted delivery of the lethal U21 payload to specific cancer cell types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f010d228-66db-461f-8d3d-97c8ae2e5738\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"siRNA,Ubiquitination,Cytotoxicity,Aptamer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11963"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David O.

SPTCL was initially described as an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma frequently associated with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and requiring aggressive multiagent chemotherapy. In 2005, this entity was restricted to SPTCL with &#945;&#946; phenotype, a less aggressive entity compared to its &#947;&#948; counterpart, currently known as primary cutaneous &#947;&#948; T-cell lymphoma. We conducted this analysis to explore the clinicopathologic characteristics of this little-known primary cutaneous T-cell entity.<br \/>Methods: In order to study the demographic characteristics, molecular and immunohistochemical signatures, therapeutic interventions, survival, and prognostic factors, we compiled a pooled database of 214 cases. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Cox proportional-hazards model and Log-rank tests were used to assess the influence of demographic and clinicopathologic factors on overall survival (OS).<br \/>Results: A total of 214 patients with confirmed SPTCL diagnosis were identified. The median age was 34 years with a peak incidence between ages 13 and 26. There was a female predominance with F:M ratio of 1.7. Upon presentation, 12% had lymphadenopathy, 12% had hepatosplenomegaly, and 27% had bone marrow involvement. No extra-nodal or extra-cutaneous involvement were reported. Cases expressed CD2 (8%), CD3 (85%), CD4(10%), CD5(10%), CD7 (9%), CD8 (77%), CD56 (6%), Granzyme-B (33%), and TIA-1 (34%). None of the cases expressed CD30. The most common clinical presentations were nodular skin changes (87%) followed by constitutional symptoms (57%). Fifteen and ten percent of SPTCL patients had history of immune-deregulatory disorders and immunosuppressive therapies, respectively. HPS occurred in 24% of the cases. Karyorrhexis, fat necrosis, and dermal involvement were noted in 15%, 9%, and 17%. The median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 4 months. Median OS of the whole group was not reached while the mean OS was 73 months. OS was not impacted by sex, constitutional symptoms, immunocompromising factors, presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or bone marrow involvement. OS was not impacted by histological or immunohistochemical features either. While older age and the occurrence of HPS negatively impacted OS, attaining complete remission positively impacted OS.<br \/>Conclusions: This study presents a comprehensive clinicopathologic data from a pooled cohort of patients with SPTCL. It describes the clinicopathologic features of SPTCL and identifies major determinants of OS in this rare disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a80e96be-bb9f-4cac-b97e-e6309f01ea8d\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-03 Retrospective clinical analyses,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Epidemiology,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11964"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Philip A.

All these comparative studies were small non-randomized studies that combined stages I &#38; II. The results were often inconclusive and occasionally conflicting. In the absence of direct head-to-head randomized controlled trials in this clinical setting, a network meta-analysis was conducted to compare these therapeutic approaches and their respective impact on 5-year survival in stage I\/IE ENKTL-N.<br \/>Methods: A review of the medical literature was conducted using online databases. Inclusion criteria consisted of English language, diagnosis of stage I\/IE ENKTL-N, treatment with chemotherapy (CT), radiation (RT), sequential CT and RT (SEQ), and chemoradiotherapy (CRT), comparative studies that reported predominantly I\/IE 5-year survival and disease-free survival rates. Studies that reported on mixed samples of early and advanced ENKTL were excluded. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted using the netmeta package and random-effects model.<br \/>Results: Seven studies comprising a total of 377 participants were included. Our network meta-analysis revealed that upfront RT tended to have better 5-year OS and DFS than CRT and SEQ, though it did not reach statistical significance. However, RT demonstrated significant 5-year OS and DFS when compare to CT alone in the frontline setting. Based on the pairwise and network meta-analyses, RT was ranked as the most effective first-line treatment approach followed by CRT, SEQ, and CT in decreasing order. Inconsistency analysis did not reveal any significant differences between direct and indirect estimates.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first network meta-analysis to compare all commonly utilized upfront treatment modalities in stages I\/IE ENKTL-N. It indicates that upfront RT alone may be sufficient as there was no signal that chemotherapy added any OS or DFS advantages.

This panel includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy agents. The test is run in our CAP, CLIA, and NYSDOH approved laboratory. For this study, we examined a subset of samples run in the clinical lab for the levels of Trop2 (target biomarker) and payload biomarkers (Topo1, TUBB3). Topo1 is a chemosensitive marker for irinotecan, while TUBB3 is a chemoresistance marker for tubulin inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: FFPE tissue sections from 1140 clinical samples from a variety of cancers were examined. These include breast (n=318), colorectal (n=228), ovarian (n=199), GBM (n=69), NSCLC (n=169), HNSCC (n=91), and Gastric cancer (n=66). Two sections (10 &#181;) of FFPE tissue were cut on DIRECTOR slides and only the tumor areas were laser microdissected for downstream analysis which resulted in tryptic peptides. 1&#181;g of peptides (~4000 cells) along with heavy peptides was injected into a triple quad mass spec and 72 biomarkers were quantitated concurrently.<br \/>Results: Trop2 showed a wide range of expression in various cancers. Almost all (95%)breast cancer samples expressed Trop2 which exhibited a wide range (93x; 157 - 14650 amol\/ &#181;g). Topo1 and TUBB3 were expressed in 93% and 60% of samples respectively. 1\/4<sup>th<\/sup> of NSCLC does not express Trop2 and there is a 106x difference in expression of Trop2 in NSCLC. Topo1 was expressed in almost all samples while TUBB3 was expressed in 80% of NSCLC. Majority of ovarian cancer samples (85%), HNSCC (89%), Gastric cancer (88%) samples expressed Trop2 with a 113x, 134x, 47x difference in expression. Chemosensitive biomarker Topo1 was expressed in almost all ovarian (96%), HNSCC (91%) and Gastric (99%) cancer samples. Chemoresistant marker TUBB3 was expressed in 66% of ovarian cancer, 44% of HNSCC and 45% of gastric cancer samples. In contrast to above cancers, only 10% of Glioblastoma samples express Trop2 and only 3\/4<sup>th<\/sup> of GBMs express Topo1.<br \/>Discussion: In a randomly selected group of cancers, we have found Trop2 is expressed in majority of Breast, Ovarian, Lung, HNSCC and gastric cancers and minimal expression in GBM. Given the range of expression of anti-tubulin resistance marker in many solid tumors, a payload biomarker guided clinical trial is highly recommended in ADCs that employ anti-tubulin inhibitors. In contrast, wide expression of chemosensitive biomarker for Topo1 payload makes it a promising candidate for many solid tumors. Further studies are warranted to determine the level of target and payload biomarkers that will be required for a clinical response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1b58742d-9b76-4cc8-9ab6-979cfa58a842\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Targeted therapy,Proteomics,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11966"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sheeno P.

However, a systematic atlas of tumor origins is lacking. Here we map the single cell organogenesis of 56 developmental trajectories to the transcriptomes of over 10,000 tumors across 33 cancer types. We use this map to deconvolute individual tumors into their constituent developmental components. Based on these deconvoluted developmental programs, we construct a Developmental Machine Learning Perceptron (D-MLP) classifier that outputs cancer origin. The D-MLP classifier (ROC-AUC: 0.974 for top prediction) outperforms classification based on expression of either oncogenes or highly variable genes. We analyze tumors from patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP), selecting the most difficult cases where extensive multimodal workup yielded no definitive tumor type. D-MLP revealed insights into developmental origins and diagnosis for most patient tumors. Our results provide a map of tumor developmental origins, provide a tool for diagnostic pathology, and suggest developmental classification may be a useful approach for otherwise unclassified patient tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/190478d3-305a-4fc0-a7a1-dbd5f9e3ecdd\/@w03B8ZCu\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas (MOCA),Machine learning,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11968"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Enrico Moiso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexander Farahani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hetal Marble<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Austin Hendricks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samuel Mildrum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stuart Levine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jochen Lennerz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salil Garg<\/i><\/presenter>.

Between 42 and 68% of BC patients suffer from other chronic conditions -comorbidities- at BC diagnosis. Comorbidities may be associated with the intake of chronic medications -comedications. The French health insurance system routinely collects health care reimbursements of almost 98% of the population: hospital abstracts, long-term diseases, outpatient care (medical consults, drug purchases under prescription&#8943;) and death status. The project ADRENALINE (Atlas for DRug and brEast caNcer survivAL INtEraction) analyzes the impact of comedications at diagnosis on BC survival on a French cohort using data from the French social security system.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We identified all women diagnosed with an incident BC treated with surgery in France from 2011 to 2017 and affiliated to the general health insurance scheme. Women with concomitant cancer or metastases at diagnosis were discarded from the analyses. Comedication intake was defined as the delivery in pharmacy of at least 3 months of full treatment (<i>e.g.<\/i> 90 pills) the 6 months preceding BC diagnosis. The analysis was restricted to drugs taken by at least 300 women. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each molecule. The model was adjusted on more than 100 confounding variables: social factors, comorbidities and other comedications. Two adjustment methods were tested: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and matching. We assumed that the adjustment was sufficient to control for confounding if the standardized mean difference of each confounder after adjustment did not exceed 0.1. Molecules which did not pass the adjustment quality test were discarded.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 235,375 patients were included in the study. Among 219 selected drugs, 91 and 171 passed the adjustment quality test for IPTW and for matching, respectively. The full set of<br \/>results is available on a web application. Among main findings, several drugs or drug classes were associated with an improved survival: proton-pump inhibitors (IPTW; HR=0.93; <i>p<\/i>=0.002); statins (<i>e.g.<\/i> rosuvastatin, IPTW, HR=0.65, p&#60;0.001); beta-blocking agents (atenolol, IPTW, HR=0.78, p=0.003); alverine (IPTW, HR=0.78, p&#60;0.001). Conversely, imidazoline receptor agonists may be deleterious (moxonidine; matching; HR=2.12; p = 0.001).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> ADRENALINE reports the impact on BC survival of 219 widely prescribed drugs. It can be used to identify molecules with a potential protective or deleterious effect relative to BC. Some of them are currently under mechanistical investigation within a drug screening program. This atlas highlights candidates to drug-repurposing trials or pharmacovigilance warnings, and will be extended to cancers of other localizations in a near future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9638eeee-b478-4d6c-9a7a-a3a6419cca3a\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Comedication,Survival,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11972"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elise Dumas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beatriz Grandal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucie Laot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Daoud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lidia Delrieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Espié<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Houzard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Le Bihan-Benjamin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe-Jean Bousquet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elodie Anthony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurélien Latouche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadir Sella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thierry Dubois<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Annabelle Ballesta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amyn Kassara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elaine Del Nery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Marande<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samar Alsafadi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Gougis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chloé-Agathe Azencott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabien Reyal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne-Sophie Hamy<\/i><\/presenter>.

A glioblastoma umbrella signature trial (GUST) posits multiple investigational treatment arms based on corresponding biomarker signatures. One contingency for an efficient umbrella trial is a suite of orthogonal signatures to classify patients into the likely most-beneficial arm. Assigning optimal thresholds of vulnerability signatures to classify patients as &#8220;most-likely responders&#8221; for each specific treatment arm is a crucial task. We utilized relative expression orderings (REO), entropy-regularized logistic regression (ERLR) and random forest classifier, to predict vulnerability classification. By applying semi-supervised algorithms to the TCGA GBM cohort, we were able to transform the samples with the highest certainty of predicted response into a self-labeled dataset and thus augment the training data. In this case, we developed a predictive model with a larger sample size and potentially better performance. Our GUST design currently includes four treatment arms for GBM patients: Arsenic Trioxide, Methoxyamine, Selinexor and Pevonedistat. Each treatment arm manifests its own signature developed by the customized machine learning pipelines based on selected gene mutation status, whole transcriptome data and real world outcomes from clinical trials. In order to increase the robustness and scalability, we also developed a multi-class\/label classification ensemble model that&#8217;s capable of predicting a probability of &#8220;fitness&#8221; of each novel therapeutic agent for each patient. Such a multi-class model would also enable us to rank each arm and provide sequential treatment planning. By expansion to four independent treatment arms within a single umbrella trial, a &#8220;mock&#8221; stratification of TCGA GBM patients labeled 56% of all cases into at least one &#8220;high likelihood of response&#8221; arm. Predicted vulnerability using genomic data from preclinical PDX models correctly placed 4 out of 6 models into the &#8220;responder&#8221; group. Our utilization of multiple vulnerability signatures in a GUST trial demonstrates how a precision medicine model can support an efficient clinical trial for heterogeneous diseases such as GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9d195944-8e13-4d9a-b795-3c8b10d8da70\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Machine learning,Precision medicine,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11985"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Michael E.

The implementation of functional precision medicine (FPM) - the integration of <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug screening and mutation profiling- can, therefore, provide better treatment options for pediatric tumor patients. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and clinical utility of FPM in the management of pediatric patients with recurrent and\/or refractory cancers. We use a functional <i>ex vivo<\/i> drug screening test (DST) panel encompassed 40 formulary drugs frequently used at Nicklaus Children&#8217;s hospital and 47 non-formulary drugs approved by FDA for cancer treatment, as well as drugs from phase III and IV clinical trials. Drug sensitivity scores (DSS) were calculated for each drug based on cancer cells&#8217; responses. DST results were then combined with results from targeted mutation profiles to match actionable mutations with selective targeted therapies. We have recruited a total of 21 patients into this ongoing clinical trial (number NCT03860376) and were able to perform drug testing and mutation profiling on 17 patients. We optimized and successfully performed DST on at least 13 different tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, ependymoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdoid, lung, and liver tumors. Our feasibility study, so far, has demonstrated that <i>ex vivo <\/i>DST can be performed within a clinically actionable time frame (median: 7 days).<i> Ex vivo<\/i> DST returned between 10 and 30 treatment options for each patient. These patients showed different responses to the 103 FDA-approved compounds used in the screen. More than half of the evaluated compounds were not active in any of the patients. Remarkably, DST provided valuable information to the oncologists on drug dosing and treatments that may not be effective and should be avoided. DSS synergizes with genomic data to further refine treatment recommendations. FPM-guided treatment regimens resulted in encouraging partial and complete responses as compared to progressive disease in prior regimens and physician choice regimens. Thus, our study shows technical feasibility of integrating functional precision medicine approaches for patients with refractory\/relapsed pediatric cancers. Routine clinical integration of FPM for treatment selection is technically feasible and has led to improved treatment of pediatric cancer patients with refractory malignancies in an initial patient cohort, warranting further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d8c1cf01-95c6-4db8-ab98-d9a742728b4d\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Precision medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11981"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Arlet Maria Acanda de la Rocha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maggie Fader<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ebony Coats<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joseph Dunn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leat Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cima Saghira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ileana Sotto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziad Khatib<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ossama Maher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haneen Abdella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina M.

Importantly, these life-saving targeted therapies remain underutilized due to a lack of cost-effective, comprehensive, and simple-to-use technologies for gene fusion detection. Our previous work using ASPYRE technology (allele-specific pyrophosphorolysis reaction; Silva et al, 2020) demonstrated detection of somatic variants at single-molecule level from DNA extracted from tumor tissue. However, DNA-based fusion detection requires tiling across large introns, which limits sensitivity particularly if breakpoints are located in repetitive regions of the genome. Here, we show that ASPYRE technology can also be utilized for highly sensitive detection of RNA fusions, scaling to over 30 fusion targets covering the main 3&#8217; fusion partners (<i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>NTRK1<\/i>, <i>NTRK3<\/i>) and from a single reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification reaction.<br \/>Methods: The ASPYRE assay consists of four sequential enzymatic stages: RT-PCR; enzymatic clean-up; combined exonuclease digestion, hybridization, pyrophosphorolysis and ligation; rolling circle isothermal amplification and detection. All targets are detected across two reaction wells using four channels on a standard real-time PCR instrument. A panel of synthetic RNA oligonucleotides comprising gene fusion boundaries was spiked into a background pool of lung-RNA, quantified using digital PCR (dPCR) and compared against a commercial reference standard to validate its suitability for assessing assay performance. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue from healthy donors to determine assay specificity, and from FFPE lung tissue from NSCLC patients with known fusions to exemplify end-to-end sample analysis.<br \/>Results: We demonstrate equivalence of our in-house reference samples to commercial reference standards. Using serial dilutions of input RNA standards, we show that detection by ASPYRE is consistent with detection of single molecules as input for common <i>ROS1<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i> and <i>NTRK3<\/i> fusions. In addition, ASPYRE was able to detect previously confirmed <i>ROS1<\/i> and <i>ALK <\/i>fusions and <i>MET<\/i> exon skipping variants in FFPE samples. ASPYRE had high specificity, correctly confirming the absence of RNA fusions and exon skipping variants in healthy control FFPE samples.<br \/>Conclusions: ASPYRE approached single-molecule sensitivity for over 30 RNA fusion targets in a single reaction. The assay required only 1 ng RNA input, with a turn-around time of &#60;4 hours from extracted RNA to result, opening the door to routine detection of RNA fusions from limited specimens. The simplicity and ease of use of ASPYRE, combined with its rapid turnaround time and analytical performance characteristics, provides a new tool for rapid and comprehensive treatment selection in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/024918ed-382f-4784-918f-ff4e25bc34ca\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutation detection,Diagnostic marker,Lung cancer,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11975"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eleanor Gray<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justyna Mordaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Efthimia Christoforou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristine Von Bargen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Potts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Palmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Barnaby Balmforth<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This gap in testing is compounded in ex-US and minority populations.<br \/>There are multiple barriers to access for biomarker testing, many of which stem from the complexity and high costs of current solutions, which limit testing to large, centralized laboratories. Alongside this, tissue requirements are high, turnaround times (TAT) for results typically take weeks, and reimbursement is uncertain.<br \/>We demonstrate how ASPYRE can address these limitations by enabling ultra-sensitive biomarker testing using existing staff and widely available instrumentation. The technology is based on four enzyme steps (Silva et al 2020), the last of which is monitored on a real-time PCR instrument. ASPYRE-Lung targets 111 markers in 11 genes, including 77 DNA variants (substitutions and indels), and 34 RNA variants (fusions and exon skipping) across 24 wells, with a TAT of less than &#60;4 hours from extracted nucleic acids to result.<br \/>Experimental procedures: Four test sites were provided with ASPYRE reagents and contrived samples including Seracare ctDNA Mutation Mix v2 and a panel consisting of synthetic RNA oligonucleotides diluted in a background of normal lung RNA. The Seracare sample included variants in <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ERBB2<\/i>, and <i>KRAS <\/i>at 0.25% variant allele fraction. The RNA sample included fusions in <i>RET<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i> and <i>NTRK1<\/i>, with each fusion present at a mean of 6 copies in a background of 1 ng lung RNA. Operators from a range of educational backgrounds were provided a set of written Instructions for Use, with no additional training.<br \/>Summary of data: The ASPYRE-Lung test was set up and performed at each test laboratory in as little as one day, using their existing real-time PCR instrument. The results demonstrated detection of the expected variants with consistent performance characteristics across the test sites and between users. Importantly, the sensitivity of detection was in line with, or superior to, the current gold standard.<br \/>Conclusions: Biofidelity&#8217;s breakthrough ASPYRE technology enables a dramatic simplification of workflows, and the ultra-sensitive detection of actionable biomarkers using existing real-time PCR instruments. This work has demonstrated the ease with which independent laboratories can implement comprehensive multi-gene assays based on ASPYRE technology, utilizing their existing staff and infrastructure. This stands in stark contrast to alternative solutions, which typically require substantial investments in new instrumentation, skilled staff, IT infrastructure and bioinformatics. Taken together, ASPYRE promises to remove key barriers in cancer biomarker testing, enabling all patients to access the right treatment at the right time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/3039a514-f939-4eb6-9faa-52a809b3c610\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Lung cancer,Targeted therapy,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11979"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Paulina Powalowska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicola Potts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brandon A.

However, little is known about the co-regulation patterns of complexes and how many of them could be potential therapeutic targets. We collected 16,680 complexes from CORUM, Reactome, Complex Portal, and Havugimana PC. Harmonization of subunits of complexes by UniProt ID removed 4,112 redundant complexes. We further found that 3,018\/12,559 complexes have at least one cancer driver gene involved, of which 2,408 complexes were found to have druggable genes, according to CiVic and OncoKB. Co-regulation patterns of 12,559 complexes were annotated utilizing gene expression and protein expression data from 1,101 cases across 10 cancer types (BR, COAD, OV, UCEC, HNSCC, PDAC, LSCC, LUAD, GBM, and ccRCC) from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Pairwise correlations across subunits of each complex at protein and RNA levels were calculated separately. Correlation &#62;0.8 would suggest strong interaction of the subunits of the complex. Protein-only co-regulation complex was declared for protein pairwise correlation &#62;0.8 and RNA pairwise correlation &#60;0.5. RNA-only co-regulation complex was defined vice versa. We found more protein-only co-regulation complexes than RNA-only co-regulation complexes. This validated that RNA expression doesn&#8217;t always correlate with protein expression and few complexes were co-regulated at both RNA and protein levels. Our study suggests the value of utilizing proteome data to understand the formation of complex and inner relationships between subunits of complexes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/71a2644d-4120-40ce-a36f-2696e95161c7\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,Gene expression,Protein expression,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11976"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yizhe Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Cui Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yize Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liang-Bo Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael C.

Lumakras<sup>TM<\/sup> (sotorasib), a KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitor was recently approved for treatment of NSCLC, and others, such as, Adagrasib have shown relatively modest activity for KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>.This modest activity may be partly due to incomplete target occupancy or due to unavailability of the drug at the target site, to elicit maximum clinical response. Clearly, this gives path for development of inhibitors which are potent, but also have desired drug like properties to achieve maximal clinical benefit in patients harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation. Here, we report the identification of VRTX126, a novel, highly selective and potent inhibitor of the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, discovered using fragment-based drug design. VRTX126 exhibited an IC50 of 10 nM in H358. VRTX126 also inhibited phospho-ERK with an IC50 of &#60;20 nM and &#60;10 nM in H358 and Mia-Paca-2 cell lines respectively, while demonstrating multi fold selectivity over KRAS wild-type or non<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant cells lines. In xenograft model harboring KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation, VRTX126 exhibited tumor growth inhibition at therapeutically relevant doses. Combination strategies with other targeted therapies such as, our proprietary SOS1 inhibitor, and other marketed or available MEK1\/2, SHP2 inhibitors targeting Ras\/Raf\/MEK pathway is being explored. VRTX126 showed favourable oral properties with dose proportional pharmacokinetics. VRTX126 was found to have no adverse effect on hERG (10 uM). Additionally, early evaluation in acute (&#62;1 g\/kg (p.o.) and &#62;0.2 g\/kg (i.v.) was well tolerated, with no elevation in liver enzymes and repeat does studies indicated good safety margins, thus supporting further evaluation of VRTX126 in IND enabling studies.

Germline variants in at least 15 different telomere biology genes have been implicated (<i>ACD, CTC1, TERT, TERC, STN1, NAF1, NOP10, NHP2, TINF2, RTEL1, PARN, ZCCHC8, DKC1, WRAP53, POT1<\/i>) with autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked (XLR) inheritance as well as <i>de novo<\/i> occurrence. We hypothesize that TBDs may be more common than the currently estimated 1:1,000,000.<br \/>We analyzed the prevalence of germline variants in the 15 TBD-associated genes using 1) The Genome Aggregation Database [gnomAD v2.1.1 non-cancer] and 2) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Germline TCGA variants were called using HaplotypeCaller, Freebayes, and UnifiedGenotyper. All variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &#60;1% in gnomAD non-cancer were considered. They were classified as potentially deleterious based on ClinVar and\/or loss of function classification and\/or stringent <i>in silico<\/i> predictions utilizing REVEL, MetaSVM, CADD, BayesDel, Eigen for missense and a combination of spliceAI, spidex, and dbscSNV for splice site variants. For <i>TERC<\/i> (RNA telomerase template) variants in the pseudoknot\/template region were considered deleterious. The known disease-causing inheritance pattern (AD, AR, XLR) for each gene was used to identify TCGA cases with a probable TBD.<br \/>There were 1215 potentially deleterious variants in TBD associated genes in the gnomAD v2.1.1 non-cancer dataset (n=134,187 samples) for a combined prevalence of 0.9%, without accounting for zygosity. In genes with AD\/AR inheritance, variants were most common in: <i>RTEL1 <\/i>(249), <i>TERT<\/i> (104), and <i>PARN<\/i> (104). <i>CTC1<\/i> and <i>WRAP53<\/i>, both associated with solely AR TBDs, also showed high variant frequencies (280 and 102, respectively). In the TCGA dataset, 9089 cancer cases (32 solid tumors and AML) were evaluated. We identified 227 cases (2.5%) with 161 mono- or biallelic rare, potentially deleterious variants in the 15 genes. Ninety-two cases had a probable underlying TBD [1% of total, 41 male, 51 female, median age at cancer diagnosis 46.5 (1-92) years]. Cancer diagnoses in these 92 cases included 24 solid tumors. The frequency of individuals with deleterious TBD-associated variants ranged from 0.4-2.8% in each of the 24 affected cancers. Notably, the heterozygous frequencies in lung squamous cell carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma were 1.6% and 2.2%, respectively. Our results show that the prevalence of TBDs may be noticeably higher than previously estimated, specifically in individuals with cancer. TBD-associated pathogenic germline variants may be implicated in the etiology of more solid tumor entities than previously recognized, warranting further studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9f8a0dbe-0fa7-476a-969f-fb3e034581b7\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL13-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Telomeres,Cancer risk,Cancer genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11978"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marena R.

Despite substantial research to identify effective molecular targets for therapy, TNBC remains particularly elusive in terms of improving patient outcomes for advanced disease. Here, we report that a covalent JNK inhibitor, JNK-IN-8, suppresses TNBC growth in cell lines and patient-derived organoids <i>in vitro<\/i> and patient-derived xenograft tumors <i>in vivo.<\/i><br \/>JNK-IN-8 reduced colony formation in TNBC cell lines and cell viability in both cell lines and patient-derived organoids in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, the compound significantly slowed tumor growth compared to vehicle in a patient-derived xenograft model <i>in vivo<\/i>. Cells treated with JNK-IN-8 exhibited large, cytoplasmic vacuoles with lysosomal markers. To examine the molecular mechanism of this phenotype, we looked at the master regulators of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy TFEB and TFE3. JNK-IN-8 inhibited TFEB phosphorylation and induced nuclear translocation of both TFEB and TFE3. This was accompanied by an upregulation of TFEB\/TFE3 target genes associated with lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Depletion of both TFEB and TFE3 diminished the JNK-IN-8-driven reduction of colony formation and the upregulation of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy markers. JNK-IN-8 also reduced the phosphorylation of other mTOR targets in a concentration-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of RagC (S75L) rescued mTOR signaling and restored TFEB phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization. In contrast, knockout of JNK1 and\/or JNK2 had no impact on TFEB\/TFE3 activation or mTOR inhibition by JNK-IN-8, but did inhibit colony formation. Similarly, re-expression of either wildtype or drug-nonbinding JNK (C116S) in JNK knockout cells did not reverse JNK-IN-8-induced TFEB dephosphorylation.<br \/>In summary, JNK-IN-8 induced lysosome biogenesis and autophagy by activating TFEB and TFE3 via mTOR inhibition independently of JNK. Together, these findings demonstrate the <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of JNK-IN-8 as a targeted therapy for TNBC and reveal its novel lysosome- and autophagy-mediated mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/2535d5ef-a56b-4c30-88f7-34781386755a\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),JNK ,Lysosome biogenesis,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11980"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Milad Soleimani<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamer Kaoud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Somma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Bustamante<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dennis C.

Comprehensive molecular profiling technologies improved clinical outcome of targeted drugs. However, the complexity of molecular interactions still challenges appropriate data interpretation. Hence, new strategies are needed to support current treatment decisions. One approach would be to consider additional molecular information, for instance microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns. By analyzing various cancer datasets, we observed that inhibition of miRNA expression occurs in a directed manner. Strong cancer driving mutations, such as in <i>KRAS<\/i>, result in a block of miRNAs inhibiting the cancer driver gene itself, or its associated downstream pathways. As many cancer drivers can activate diverse downstream pathways, we examined whether groups of strongly repressed miRNAs can uncover essential pathways. Therefore, we developed a miRNA depletion based cancer gene dependency model and related drug prediction workflow using miRNA sequencing data from cancer cell lines. We defined a pathway ranking score (PRS) and focused on druggable target genes. To validate our drug prediction workflow, we performed miRNA sequencing in various patient derived 3D cancer models (PDCMs). We predicted top hit pathway dependencies and individual druggable target genes for each culture. Subsequently, samples were used for in vitro drug response assays. Here, samples were significantly more sensitive to predicted targeted drugs, compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy, or non-predicted targeted drugs. Next, we applied our miRNA based drug prediction workflow to four patients and compared three sources for RNA sequencing for each patient: PDCM, primary tumor, and microdissected purified tumor from FFPE tissue. Of note, FFPE purified miRNAs extraction led to comparable results to PDCMs and primary tumors. Finally, we were interested whether our prediction workflow matches with a comprehensive genomic based drug prediction workflow from the MASTER precision oncology trial. Therefore, we sequenced miRNAs from 95 patients and performed subsequent drug prediction. Interestingly, a complete overlap was overserved in only 20% of patients. In 35% of the patients, MASTER drug recommendation was biologically related to our drug prediction, and 40% revealed no match. In 75 out of 91 patients (82%) with available RNA Seq data, at least one of our predicted target genes was noticeably overexpressed on mRNA level. In total, 40% of all with our workflow predicted target genes, and 52% of druggable predicted target genes showed an increase of 1.5 fold or higher on RNA level compared to the entire cohort. In conclusion, unidirectional silenced miRNA expression signatures give further insights into cancer cell pathways and druggable gene dependencies and might be suitable tools for precision oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e60f92ac-87d1-4a51-97b3-ab9e3e881a33\/@x03B8ZCv\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Biomarkers,MicroRNA,3D models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11983"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alexander A.

In part due to the increasing number of therapeutically actionable genomic markers in many cancers, whether a strategy of upfront broad next-generation sequencing (NGS) could potentially improve selection of patients for targeted drugs compared to narrow\/single gene panels remains uncertain. We examined recent trends in the proportions of patients receiving sequencing-directed therapy following the use of broad NGS panel testing among newly diagnosed patients with advanced cancer in the United States (US).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Using a retrospective cohort study design to analyze administrative claims data on patients (65-89 years) enrolled in a national US payer Medicare Advantage plans from 2018 through 2020, we identified patients with select incident advanced\/metastatic cancer diagnoses (lung, colorectal [CRC], breast, ovarian) based on previously validated algorithms. We defined 2 cohorts by the occurrence of broad NGS (51+ genes) versus narrow (&#8804;50 genes) sequencing within 182 days of diagnosis using a previously validated algorithm based on laboratory tax identification numbers, current procedural terminology codes, and diagnosis codes. We described the rates of sequencing-directed therapy (defined as receipt of an FDA-approved genomically targeted drug) within 90 days of testing by broad NGS versus narrow panels across tumor types and subgroups defined by race (White versus Black) and annual income (&#60;$50,000 versus &#8805;$50,000) data.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified 32,130 patients with incident advanced cancer during the study period. Overall (broad plus narrow panels) testing rates varied by cancer type (lung, 40.1%; CRC 28.6%; breast 53.9%; ovarian 41.7%). Compared to narrow gene panels, a higher proportion of patients with lung and ovarian cancer sequenced with broad NGS panels initiated an FDA-approved genomically targeted drug within 90 days of testing (lung: 8.6% versus 7.5%; ovarian: 9.2% versus 5.5%). For CRC and breast cancer, narrow gene panels matched a higher proportion of patients with targeted drug within 90 days of testing versus broad NGS panel testing (CRC: 5.1 versus 4.5%; breast: 41.7% versus 35.7%).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>A higher proportion of patients initiated a genomically-targeted drug after broad NGS panel testing compared with narrow gene panels in lung and ovarian cancer. As the number of actionable genomic markers in advanced cancers increase, it will be important to ensure that this technology is adopted to improve upon the existing standard of care and that aligns with values important to patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cdc6fed1-a312-4c5e-8cd7-baa61dceb893\/@y03B8ZCw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18394"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gboyega Adeboyeje<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eleanor O.

A large fraction of the CRC patients diagnosed with de novo metastatic disease do not benefit from the standard of care but still experience substantial side effects. Therefore, there is the urgency for a new model to predict clinical response.<br \/>Adult epithelial stem cell (ASC) -derived organoids are proving to be a major breakthrough in pre-clinical models. ASC-derived organoids can be developed from healthy as well as diseased tissue, including cancer lesions and therefore are often referred to as patient-derived organoids (PDOs or HUB Organoids<sup>TM<\/sup>). These model is established directly from patient tissue, represent the tissue of origin and faithfully recapitulate patient disease <i>in vitro<\/i> and can be propagated for drug testing in a matter of weeks. PDOs bridges the gap between the lab and the clinic and effectively bring a &#8220;patient in the lab.&#8221;<br \/>In this study we aimed to validate the predictive value of PDOs in the stratification of metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients for treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. PDOs from mCRC tissues were established following our optimized procedures and drug screening was performed. Clinical response was compared with PDO drug response and the best predicting drug response parameters (growth rate (GR), GRmax, GR50 and area under the curve) were identified. The patient response was evaluated by the percentage of change in size of the target lesions on response scans (% size change), best Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response and progression-free survival (PFS). Importantly, we validated the predictive value of organoids towards fluorouracil (5-FU). We are validating these results in a large trial.<br \/>Current efforts to further expand our PDO and drug sensitivity biobank will enable the implementation of the personalized HUB Organoid Technology to accurate and fast predict of the treatment response to improve clinical outcome of mCRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7b3965f4-cb5c-4ba2-a23c-c3cd0cc4c46e\/@y03B8ZCw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Personalized medicine,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11988"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Carla S.

Existing data is insufficient in establishing its efficacy on other rare EGFR mutated subtypes, central nervous system (CNS), or its resistance to 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib. Here, we report a case showing a good response on single agent amivantamab in an atypical EGFR mutation (G719A, exon18 substitution) NSCLC that progressed to CNS involvement on osimertinib. A 67-year-old male presented with stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma of lung with osseous metastases. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a speculated 7.7 cm right upper lung lesion with hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathies. MRI brain and spine showed multiple bone metastases without CNS involvement. Tissue biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with PD-L1 IHC 75%. Tissue next generation sequencing (NGS) showed EGFR G719A. He was started on osimertinib. Two months later, he was hospitalized for drug-induced pneumonitis which prompted off osimertnib. CT angiogram chest showed new diffuse pericardial thickening and nodularity, suggestive of progressive disease. Two cycles of chemotherapy were delivered followed by immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab. In 10 weeks, progression of disease was revealed in MRI brain demonstrating new parenchymal and leptomeningeal metastases. Amivantamab monotherapy was initiated with discontinuation of immunotherapy. The patient tolerated amivantamab without major complications. His performance status remained the same before and after amivantamab. He denied fatigue, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, however, endorsed rash, which was managed with hydrocortisone cream. Repeat scans in 6 weeks showed decreased leptomeningeal enhancement, and reduction in the size of parenchymal lesions, lung mass, and lymphadenopathies. The highest variant allele fraction from circulating tumor DNA NGS assay from Guardant360 was significantly improved on amivantamab from 25.6% (EGFR G719A), at time of diagnosis, to non-detectable. Amivantamab monotherapy has shown an encouraging outcome in a patient with an atypical EGFR mutated (G719X) NSCLC with leptomeningeal disease who progressed on osimertinib. Our case has shown significant response on CNS involvements, which is contrary to known poor blood-brain barrier penetration of amivantamab. This supports current trial evaluating the efficacy of amivantamab for NSCLC with rare EGFR mutations such as G719X, and ones progressed on 3<sup>rd<\/sup> Gen TKI treatment. Additional studies evaluating the efficacy of amivantamab on CNS metastasis are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d0c60482-1b5e-48d6-8416-331e20a9280b\/@y03B8ZCw\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Amivantamab,EGFR G719X mutation,Leptomeningeal disease,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/11965"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jinah Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Horyun Choi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yeun Ho Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leeseul Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/presenter>.

Both CBP and p300 possess bromodomain (BRD) and a lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain. These two closely related epigenetic modulators are known to play an oncogenic role in a variety of cancers. Functional synthetic lethal screens have identified preferential killing in CBP-deficient and \/ or MYC-dependent hematological cancer cells by suppression of the paralogue p300. CBP\/p300 BRD inhibitor could also prevent AR and ER signaling, thereby potentially inhibiting growth of AR and ER -dependent cancer cells. Thus, targeting CBP\/p300 represents an attractive approach for developing personalized cancer therapies.<br \/><b>Experimental <\/b><b>Results: <\/b>Multiple potent and selective CBP\/p300 BRD inhibitors that are structurally unrelated to known inhibitors were identified by iterative medicinal chemistry and SAR based approaches. The lead compound AU-18069 was optimized towards attaining good potency, selectivity, physicochemical properties and DMPK profile. AU-18069 potently inhibited proliferation of a wide range of cell lines derived from prostate cancer, breast cancer and CBP mutant\/MYC-dependent hematological cancers. The lead compound demonstrated good PK profile in rodents as well as in dogs. Excellent anti-tumor efficacy was achieved in leukemia and lymphoma xenograft models at well-tolerated doses. Significant downregulation of c-Myc was observed in a single dose PK-PD study.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Lead candidate AU-18069 demonstrated that selective CBP\/p300 bromodomain inhibitors are efficacious in models of hematologic malignancies and solid cancers in vitro and in vivo. Further evaluation of efficacy in other xenograft models, as a single agent as well as in combination with other agents is planned. Long term toxicological and safety pharmacology evaluation in different species and other IND enabling studies are in progress to support progression of this compound to clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone acetylation,Epigenetics,Transcriptional regulation,Bromodomain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21612"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Chandrasekhar Abbineni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saravanan Thiyagarajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aravind A B<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amit A Dhudashiya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sivapriya Marappan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naveen Kumar R<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raghavendra N R<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mamon Dey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avinash Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Uma Bharathi B V<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Girish Aggunda Renukappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>N Venkata Siva Reddy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asha Babu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aakanksha J Shetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Amith A<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Narasimha Rao K<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suraj T Gore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mahaboobi Jaleel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ramesh S Senaiar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vijaya Shankar Nataraj<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Subhendu Mukherjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samiulla D S<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Antony<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Girish Daginakatte<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajesh Eswarappa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kavitha Nellore<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shekar Chelur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Murali Ramachandra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Susanta Samajdar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
