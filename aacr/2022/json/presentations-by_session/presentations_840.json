[{"Abstract":"In 2009, a group of qPCR experts published the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines for reproducible experiments. Those guidelines shaped present-day qPCR, which is considered a gold standard technique in molecular biology. Fast forward to 2013, dPCR also took advantage of the publication of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments (dMIQE) guidelines to ensure global standardization. A new version of the dMIQE guidelines was published in 2020, considering the increasing number of applications and the introduction of new platforms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Afif M.

Despite the robustness of these individualized molecular classification approaches, the procurement of tumor tissues represents a major hurdle because of the requirement of invasive procedures. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are regarded as a noninvasive alternative to tumor tissues, offering the opportunity to gain insight into the underlying cancer. In my presentation, I will introduce our &#8220;Liquid Biopsy Digital Scoring Assay&#8221;, which is composed of an upstream liquid biopsy purification system for enrichment of either CTCs or EVs from blood, and a downstream digital PCR system for quantification of tumor-specific genes. Using clinical blood samples, we have validated the potential of &#8220;Liquid Biopsy Digital Scoring Assay&#8221; for diagnostic applications in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prostate cancer (PCa), showing the feasibility of translating tissue-based transcriptomic profiling into a liquid biopsy setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hsian-Rong Tseng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
