[{"Abstract":"CDK8 and CDK19 are two paralogous kinases of transcription-regulating Mediator complex, which mediate transcriptional reprogramming by potentiating the induction of previously silent genes that are activated by different signal-responsive transcription factors. CDK8 is ubiquitously expressed while CDK19 is highly expressed in only some tissues or tumors. Small molecule CDK8\/19 kinase inhibitors are being developed for breast and prostate cancers and leukemias and potentially for other cancers; their tumor-suppressive effects are mediated via effects on transcriptional reprogramming in both tumor and stromal cells. Mediator kinase deficient mice would provide valuable models for CDK8\/19 inhibitor therapy. Cdk8 knockout in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to early embryonic lethality (Westerling et al., Mol Cell Biol 2007;27:6177) but conditional Cdk8 knockout in adult mice was reported to yield no phenotype (McCleland et al., J Pathol 2015;237:508). The latter animals, however, still expressed Cdk19, which could have compensated for the loss of Cdk8. To evaluate the effects of the deficiency in both Mediator kinase paralogs, we have now developed and characterized mice with stable CRISPR\/CAS9 Cdk19 knockout. In contrast to Cdk8 knockout mice, Cdk19-\/- animals are viable, with no apparent diminution of the lifespan. Following multiple generations of back crosses to eliminate potential off-target mutations, Cdk19 homozygous knockout mice display no consistent phenotypic aberrations, except for the early onset of infertility in homozygous Cdk19-\/- females (but not males), starting from 3-4 months of age. To achieve conditional knockout of Cdk8 in Cdk19-deficient background, Cdk19-\/- mice were crossed with previously developed mice with floxed Cdk8 (McCleland et al., <i>ibid<\/i>) and with ROSA tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. Following tamoxifen administration at 700 mg\/kg\/day for 5 days, we observed massive Cdk8 knockout in all the tested organs (liver, lungs, spleen, bone marrow). Despite the lack of both Cdk8 and Cdk19, these mice remain viable and show no apparent abnormalities for at least 3 weeks of observation. The newly developed mice with constitutive Cdk19 and inducible Cdk8 knockout will be used to study the different physiological roles of Mediator kinase, to evaluate the stromal effects of Mediator kinase inhibition on tumor growth and to predict potential side effects of long-term CDK8\/19 inhibitor therapy.

Novel therapeutic strategies are being developed to target specific MM surface antigens. Yet, changes in antigen expression through MM progression are poorly understood in the clinic and have not been well characterized in preclinical models. Here, we were interested in understanding how BCMA, CD38, CD138 and HLA-DR surface expression patterns may be affected as MM progresses in preclinical models.<br \/>To do so, ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 cells were inoculated subcutaneously while MM.1S, MM.1R, U266 and NCI-H929 cells were dosed intravenously into NSG mice. Tumor xenograft or bone marrow, whole blood and spleen were processed for flow cytometry analysis. Antigen expression was measured at different stages of tumor progression as well as in vitro. Soluble BCMA levels were assessed in the mouse serum by ELISA. ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 subcutaneous xenografts show preferential growth when inoculated in PBS and 50% growth factor-reduced Matrigel, respectively. BCMA expression was reduced in both ARH-77 and RPMI-8226 xenografts compared to in vitro culture. CD38 and HLA-DR expression increased as ARH-77\/PBS and RPMI-8226\/Matrigel tumor volume progressed. All 4 antigens were detected in the bone marrow from MM.1S, MM.1R and U266-bearing mice, as early as 5-6 weeks post intravenous injection. In contrast, antigens were not detected in any tissue from mice injected with NCI-H929, likely indicating failed engraftment. At 5 weeks, antigens were detected in the whole blood and spleen in MM.1S-bearing mice only, suggesting organ invasion and a more advanced disease-stage compared to MM.1R or U266. Experiments are being carried out to test antigen expression in tissue at late-stage tumor progression as well as serum BCMA levels in the intravenous MM models.<br \/>These data highlight antigen expression differences in MM cells when analyzed in mouse tissue compared to in vitro culture. Like the widely variable expression observed between patients (2, 3), BCMA and CD138 were differentially expressed in the mouse bone marrow between models. Our observations suggest that commonly targeted antigens in MM vary kinetically in vivo and can be measured by flow cytometry. The present findings also support the use of RPMI-8226 and MM.1S cell lines when screening for antigen-specific immunotherapies and combinatorial studies for MM treatment.<br \/>References: 1.Howlader et al. https:\/\/seer.cancer.gov\/csr\/1975_2017 2.Brudno et al.

Pre-clinical models to study metastasis of human soft tissue sarcomas are limited. We have developed a system that allows for the formation of distinct soft tissue sarcoma subtypes from mesenchymal stem cells that have been depleted of p53 and Rb1 using CRISPR. Injection of these cells intramuscularly results in metastasis to the lung. Using this novel model system, we have performed a genetic screen to identify pathways and specific drivers of sarcoma metastasis. This pre-clinical in vivo model system will allow for the identification of putative therapeutic targets to prevent the development of lethal metastatic growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8184398d-8d88-4c18-a5c3-fcd034c3e725\/@v03B8ZTn\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Metastasis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17963"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Janai R.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains many factors influencing ICI responses. The ratio of effector T-cells (Teffs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in tumors has been shown to be associated with the efficacy of ICIs in murine models, indicating that increasing Teffs or decreasing Tregs in tumor may prevent development of resistance to immunotherapy. There is a high and restricted expression of CC motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) on tumor-infiltrating Tregs, whereas they are negligibly expressed on Teffs. Deletion of tumor-infiltrating Tregs via murine anti-CCR8 surrogates has shown effective anti-tumor activity in tumor models.LM-108 is a novel humanized anti-CCR8 monoclonal antibody with engineered IgG1 that enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The expression of CCR8 and Foxp3 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was analyzed using published single-cell sequencing data. The binding affinity of LM-108 was assessed by flow cytometry using CCR8 high- and low-expressing cell lines. <i>In vitro<\/i> measurements of ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) mediated by LM-108 were conducted in CCR8 overexpressing HEK293, CHO-K1, and Jurkat cells. Furthermore, <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity of LM-108 as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy was evaluated in syngeneic models and PD-1-resistant tumor models with human CCR8 knock-in mice. Analysis of published single-cell sequencing data showed that in comparison with CCR4, CCR8 gene expression was specifically overlapped with Foxp3 in TILs of breast cancer. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay revealed that LM-108 specifically binds with high affinity to human CCR8 in a dose-dependent manner. ADCC and ADCP effects induced by LM-108 were observed in HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells with different levels of CCR8 expression. <i>In vivo<\/i> data of CT26 syngeneic model showed that LM-108 murine surrogate antibody alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth. Treatment with LM-108 effectively depleted tumor-infiltrating Tregs accompanied by increase in CD8\/Treg ratio in tumors, leading to significant anti-tumor activity in MC38 model. Finally, LM-108 showed a synergistic therapeutic efficacy in PD-1 resistant models in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody. To conclude, LM-108 is a novel Fc-optimized CCR8 antibody that selectively depletes tumor infiltrating Tregs thereby improving anti-tumor immune response either as monotherapy or combination therapy. Thus, LM-108 can be a promising therapeutic approach to overcome ICI resistance in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/06dea965-236a-46a3-b50e-869d33b69e1a\/@w03B8ZTo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17964"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jie Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wentao Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junwei Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da Fei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Runsheng Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Our understanding of cancer and its therapeutic approach has improved greatly due to advanced cancer biology, functional imaging and next-generation sequencing. One of the key challenges in cancer therapy is how to effectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells intact. As specific oncogenic drivers have been successfully identified, targeted treatments have achieved great success in clinical practice. However, acquired drug resistance remains the major barrier to sustained success of targeted cancer therapy. Those patients who initially respond well to targeted therapies eventually become resistant to the treatments. Uncovering the underlying mechanism would help develop novel therapies that overcome the drug resistance.To mimic the clinical resistance after long-term drug treatment, we established a panel of drug-induced resistant tumor models by continuous dosing of targeted drugs to tumor-bearing mice or cancer cell lines, covering a series of first-line targeted drugs including Sotorasib, Palbociclib, Ibrutinib, Capmatinib, Fulvestrant, Tamoxifen and TDM-1. Resistant models were derived from sensitive ones harboring specific oncogenic drivers. After treated with targeted drugs and passaged several times, resistant models exhibited stable resistance phenotype. Given that target gene mutation, alternative pathway activation or tumor microenvironment evolution could promote therapy resistance and cancer progression, we performed transcript and protein analysis to explore the molecular mechanism, and evaluated the potential therapeutic strategies overcoming drug resistance in the established models. Taken together, drug-induced resistant tumor models provide a promising opportunity to the better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and to the accelerated development of next-generation anticancer agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f0f2dd37-74e4-4751-8cc9-947233808335\/@w03B8ZTo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Animal models,Anticancer therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17965"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ting Ni<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gaoxiang Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tongxin Huo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenting Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingyang Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qunsheng Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

It sometimes progresses to more serious conditions such as liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therapeutic agents for NASH have not yet been developed, and an animal model with high clinical correlation is required. The STAM mouse is a NASH model mouse with a background of type 2 diabetes. This mouse model shows the same pathological progression as human NASH patients, and has been used for the evaluation of many drug candidates, as well as basic research. However the gene profile, including mutations, has not been elucidated in this model. In this study, we analyzed the RNA-seq data of STAM mice at each pathological stage and examined the clinical correlation at the gene level.<br \/><u>Methods;<\/u>NASH was induced in male mice by a single subcutaneous injection of 200 ug streptozotocin solution 2 days after birth and feeding with high fat diet after 4 weeks of age. The mice were sacrificed and livers collected at 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 20 weeks of age. For liver samples, the left lateral lobe was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#176;C for RNA-seq analysis. Total RNA of the cells was isolated using RNeasy mini kit.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> The gene expression of the canonical pathway in NASH progression from steatosis to hepatocellular carcinoma was analyzed. Increased expression was observed in CCL2, TLR4, HSP47, alpha-SMA, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Since it has been reported that genetic traits are involved in the development of NASH-HCC, we next analyzed the genetic mutations in the STAM mice. The number of individuals showing mutations in Mtorinvolved in Insulin signaling increases as the disease progresses, especially in the liver cancer phase.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95988e61-6156-421c-954a-42f9654ef2e4\/@w03B8ZTo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Hepatocarcinogenesis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17967"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Taishi Hashiguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bui Phuong Linh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Sakakibara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryuto Tanaka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth H Pigney<\/i><\/presenter>.

The killing ability of NK cells is expected to contribute to death of cancer cell. To prove NK cells as a cell therapy, we frist manufactured NK cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donor who received informed consent in a GMP facility. And we verifed the killing ability of the NK cells by decreasing the size of the tumor in NOG mice inoculated with SKBR3, HER2-positive breast-cancer cell, into mammary fat pad (orthotopic models). In this study, sudden death of mice was not found even when 20 millions NK cells were injected into a NOG female with intravenous injection. Moreover, it was confirmed that the size of the tumor was significantly reduced after NK cell injection. It is necessary to study co-administration with a targeted therapy such as rastuzumab and pertuzumab, and NK cells as a cell therapy will help reduce the size of the tumor.

A growing body of data demonstrates the pivotal roles of the master regulators from the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;), in the development of resistance to Immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, co-inhibition of TGF-&#946; signaling is expected to enhance the antitumor responses of PD1\/PD-L1-based immunotherapies. TST005 is a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the truncated extracellular domain of the TGF-&#946;RII receptor (a TGF-&#946; trap) fused to a humanized anti-PD-L1 IgG1 antibody with ablated Fc immune effector function. Previously we showed the potent antitumor activity of TST005 in MC38\/hPD-L1 and EMT6\/hPD-L1 xenograft models. Here we report TST005 anti-tumor activities in MC38 colorectal cancer and EMT-6 breast cancer models compared to M7824 (Merck&#8217;s PD-L1\/TGF-&#946;RII) analog and its safety profiles following single or repeated doses in rats and non-human primates (NHP). TGF-&#946;1depletion from the plasma of MC38 tumor-bearing mice was observed even at the lowest dose (1mg\/kg). At higher dose (10mg\/kg), TGF-&#946;1 depletion persisted longer. The same trend was also found in MC38 tumor tissue. In EMT-6 tumor model upon TST005 treatment (30mg\/kg), TST005 showed better tumor inhibition compared to M7824 analog at high dose (30mg\/kg), which correlates well with the extent of TGF-&#946;1depletion. For TST005, TGF-&#946;1depletion was persistent throughout all time points tested (up to Day 14) in plasma and tumor tissue compared to M7824 analog at the same dose\/dosing frequency. TST005 treatment (3mg\/kg,10mg\/kg) significantly lowered phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) in MC38 tumors. TST005 was well tolerated in both rats and monkeys, no significant safety issues were observed following single or repeated doses in general toxicity studies and safety pharmacology assessment, the exposure of TST005 in both species was comparable between two genders and increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. No cytokine release was observed in monkeys. Based on the exposure of TST005 in monkeys and predicted exposure at First in Human (FIH) dose, the safety margin of TST005 will be higher than 200 and 500 folds calculated on Cmax and AUC respectively. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the antitumor activity of TST005 in PD\/PD-L1 sensitive and resistant tumor models as well as the safety profile in NHP, TST005 has been granted for phase 1 clinical trials in USA (NCT04958434).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e0d4bb2b-c10b-4532-b69c-a3c368a90a23\/@w03B8ZTo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17969"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Huanhuan Guo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xinlai Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chunming Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linlin Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongjun Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuang Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Di Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chengwei Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shenjie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fei Teng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xueming Qian<\/i><\/presenter>.

For example, many models revolve around the question of whether or not the <i>in vitro<\/i> models capture the relevant<i> in vivo<\/i> pathobiology and drug response information that may impact a patient's response to a therapy. Most <i>in vitro<\/i> oncology drug screening techniques are based on two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, which, to date, has failed to accurately imitate the physiological microenvironments due to the inherent limitations, such as the lack of interactions between intracellular and extracellular environments, or modifications in three-dimensional cell morphology, polarity, and division. These disadvantages prompted the development of models which would better simulate the<i> <\/i>microenvironment of tumor cells. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to mimic natural cell characteristics and tissue-like structures compared with traditional 2D monolayer cell culture. Currently, multicellular spheroid and organoid cell culture are two popular 3D culture methods to evaluate drug activity. Spheroid cell culture utilizes ultra-low attachment plate to allow cells grow in spheroid format. Organoid cell culture is accomplished by growing cells in extracellular matrix scaffolds (such as Matrigel). In this study, we attempted to compare different drug screening platforms, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and two 3D cell cultures (spheroid and organoid). Compound sensitivity, genomics, pathology and expression of clinical marker were profiled.

However, low establishment efficiency and high maintenance cost have hindered the development in the field. In recent years, patient-derived tumor organoid culture has been developed as an efficient and economic model to mimic and recapitulate the original tumor tissue, in contrast to conventional cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (Drost &#38; Clevers, 2018). Due to the limited availability of current esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) models, we aimed to establish a panel of ESCC patient-derived organoid (PDO) long-term cultures for ESCC study.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In the current project, we have established and biobanked a panel of ESCC PDO cultures <i>in vitro<\/i> from Chinese ESCC treatment-na&#239;ve patients undergoing an endoscopic examination or upfront surgery, or patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery in Hong Kong. We also established and maintained PDO-derived xenograft (PDOX) in immunocompromised mice. Immunohistochemical examination confirmed the squamous origin of the established PDOs and PDOXs. Genomic profiling showed consistent mutational landscapes of the established PDO, as compared to ESCC patient profiles. Transcriptomic profiling suggests organoid culture resembles patient tissue samples better than the cell line model in terms of global gene expression patterns. Notably, PDOs from CRT-treated patients show enhanced re-growth after recovery from cisplatin treatment, indicating a candidate cancer stem cell (CSC) sub-population enriched by neoadjuvant CRT. This sub-population can be further enriched <i>in vitro <\/i>by serial cisplatin treatment and recovery cycles.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> ESCC PDOs can be efficiently established from highly limited patient tissue samples and maintained long-term <i>in vitro<\/i> and can be feasibly integrated with mouse model. It preserves the original cell hierarchy and indicates existence of candidate CSC sub-population, which may be targeted therapeutically in future.<br \/><b>Reference:<\/b> Drost J, Clevers H.

We have developed MammoCult&#8482; Organoid Growth Medium (Mouse), a serum- and phenol red-free medium for the long-term propagation of organoids from mouse mammary tissue. To initiate the cultures, mouse mammary glands are resected and enzymatically dissociated sequentially in Gentle Collagenase\/Hyaluronidase, trypsin, and dispase\/DNase I to generate a single-cell suspension, and 4.5 x 10<sup>3<\/sup> of the liberated cells are then embedded in Corning<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Matrigel<sup>&#174;<\/sup> and maintained in MammoCult&#8482; Organoid Growth Medium (Mouse). Alternatively, freshly dissociated mammary cells can be expanded in adherent culture in EpiCult&#8482; Plus Medium prior to seeding into Matrigel<sup>&#174;<\/sup>. Approximately 8.4 &#177; 0.6% (mean &#177; SEM; n=10) of the freshly dissociated cells seeded in the Corning&#174; Matrigel<sup>&#174;<\/sup> will proliferate and generate organoids that are typically &#62; 200 &#181;m in diameter and have a highly branched morphology, although organoids with a cystic morphology are also observed. Immunostaining of these branched organoids reveals that they are composed of a polarized epithelium made up of keratin (K) 8-expressing luminal cells and K5\/14-expressing basal cells (n=7). Organoids upregulate transcripts for caseins (<i>Csn1s1, Csn2<\/i>), whey acidic protein (<i>Wap<\/i>), and lactoferrin (<i>Ltf<\/i>) upon stimulation with prolactin, hydrocortisone, and insulin (n=4). These multilineage organoids can be established from multiple inbred mouse strains, including C57Bl6\/J, FVB, BALB\/c, and CD-1. Organoids can be passaged every 10 - 14 days as small fragments at a 1:3 to 1:4 split ratio, and can be maintained for a minimum of 10 passages while still maintaining multilineage potential and a normal karyotype. These results demonstrate that MammoCult&#8482; Organoid Growth Medium (Mouse) efficiently generates and expands mammary epithelial cell-derived organoids and offers researchers a novel tool for in vitro mammary studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/5a7e141d-f9cf-40b4-9c52-c01433a3ea53\/@w03B8ZTo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mammary gland,Organoids,Stem cells,Breast,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17975"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"8f1e859b-abee-454b-a915-004ce86b3d72","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8f1e859b-abee-454b-a915-004ce86b3d72\/@w03B8ZTo\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>David Rowbotham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Rothwell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Allen C.

However, majority of patients eventually develop progressive disease due to heterogeneity in BCMA expression or loss of antigen during treatment. Therefore, new targets are required to overcome the problem of resistance encountered with these agents. The expression of GPRC5D (G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D) is high on MM cells and low in normal tissues. Although high levels of GPRC5D and BCMA were found in similar proportions of MM patients, they are independently expressed by MM cells. GPRC5DxCD3 bispecific T-cell-redirecting antibody is currently under clinical investigation. Preliminary results have shown early evidence in efficacy with tolerable safety profile. These findings identified GPRC5D as an ideal therapeutic antibody drug conjugate (ADC) target for the treatment of patients with RRMM. Therefore, the present study was aimed at developing a novel anti-GPRC5D ADC drug LM-305 and evaluating its preliminary efficacy by performing preclinical activity using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse models. The binding affinity of LM-305 was evaluated by flow cytometry in engineered GPRC5D over-expressing MM tumor cells and endogenous GPRC5D-expressing MM tumor cells. The internalization of LM-305 was assessed with pH-dependent dye in NCI-H929 and MM.1R cell lines. The cytotoxicity of LM-305 was assessed by cell viability assay in MM tumor cell lines. <i>In vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity of multiple doses of LM-305 (1mg\/kg, 3mg\/kg, 10mg\/kg) was evaluated in NCI-H929 and MM.1R tumor cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies revealed that LM-305 binds with high affinity to GPRC5D over-expressing cell lines and GPRC5D endogenously expressing MM cells in a dose-dependent manner. It can be efficiently internalized by GPRC5D expressing cells and further lysosomal lysis was detected by pHrodo dye. LM-305 displayed potent cytotoxicity when co-cultured with MM tumor cells (NCI-H929 and MM.1R) with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 nM. <i>In vivo<\/i> tumor xenograft models suggested that treatment with LM-305 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in tumor bearing mice. Additionally, LM-305 exhibited complete response (CR) in the GPRC5D high-expressing MM CDX models at a dose of 3mg\/kg. Moreover, LM-305 showed good safety profile in the animal studies. In conclusion, this preclinical data suggested that LM-305 is a novel GPRC5D targeting ADC with best-in-class potential, and therefore it can be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of RRMM patients expressing GPRC5D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6ec56993-be91-47b3-b67e-d4e268e9b30d\/@x03B8ZTp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17977"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Wentao Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Da Fei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xia Qin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Runsheng Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The standard treatment for NPC is radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite the high 5-year overall survival rate (85.6%) in early-stage patients, 15% to 20% of the patients still experience recurrence or metastasis. The development of new targeted therapy on NPC is still lagging behind. Considered that phase I clinical trials often recruit late-stage patients who previously received multiple treatments, lack of drug-resistant models may be one of the possible hindrances in targeted therapy development. In-vivo preclinical NPC models are very limited for research. Given the close association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in NPC, only four EBV positive (EBV +ve) PDXs and one EBV +ve cell line are available for research. Our lab has been engaging in establishing new NPC models. Previously, we had successfully established four new EBV +ve PDXs: Xeno23, Xeno32, Xeno47 and Xeno76. To establish a more clinically relevant models for preclinical studies and drug resistance research, we continuously treat the PDX transplanted mice with cisplatin. And we successfully established the first cisplatin-resistant Xeno76 (Xeno76-CR) NPC PDX.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> A 1 mm<sup>3<\/sup> PDX tissues were implanted subcutaneously in Nude mice. Once the tissue started growing into ~100 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in size, 3-5 mg\/kg cisplatin was injected intraperitoneally weekly. Once the end point has met, the tumor tissue was repeatedly implanted into another mice, while the rest of the tissues were used for further evaluation.<br \/><b>Result: <\/b>The growth rate of Xeno76-CR has no significant difference with Xeno76 in Nude mice. We confirmed that Xeno76-CR is resistant to cisplatin in-vivo. When treating both Xeno76 and Xeno76-CR with 3 mg\/kg cisplatin weekly, there is statistically significant 85.4% tumor growth inhibition in Xeno76, but no significant inhibition effect in cisplatin-treated Xeno76-CR. EBV infection of Xeno76-CR was confirmed with EBER staining. We have also studied whether Xeno76-CR is drug- or specifically cisplatin-resistant. We tested the Xeno76-CR with ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor that can inhibit nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signalling pathway, and found significant 57% tumor growth inhibition in-vivo.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We have established the first and only EBV +ve cisplatin-resistant NPC PDX, Xeno76-CR, that is a valuable and clinically relevant model for targeted therapies preclinical studies and resistant research. Single-cell RNA sequencing will be performed to examine if stem cell plays any role in cisplatin-resistance.

It is also one of the most vascularized human tumors. The anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab (BEV) is the only US FDA approved agent for recurrent GBM. Given the high resistance of GBM to current therapies and the failure of BEV to prolong overall survival, new therapeutic agents are in urgent need. Selinexor is a first-in-class oral inhibitor of nuclear export protein Exportin 1 (XPO1\/CRM1), it readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier and demonstrates anti-cancer activity in various hematological and solid tumors. Selinexor can attenuate multiple cancer hallmarks simultaneously, anti-angiogenesis is one of the many anti-cancer mechanisms that selinexor has. In a phase 2 clinical trial of recurrent GBM, selinexor monotherapy demonstrated clinically relevant disease control with manageable side effects (Lassman 2021 Clin Cancer Res). We tested mouse xenograft models of GBM to evaluate the anti-GBM effects of selinexor and BEV.<br \/>Methods: Thirty-two female nude mice with subcutaneously implanted U87MG xenografts were allocated to four treatment groups of eight mice: vehicle control, selinexor, BEV, and the selinexor and BEV combination. Selinexor was given via oral gavage at 15 mg\/kg once a week on Mondays, and BEV was given at 2.5 mg\/kg via intraperitoneal injection every three days, starting on Monday, for four weeks. Tumor volume and body weight of test mice were monitored throughout the experiment. Xenograft tumor samples were collected at the end of the study for gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry tests.<br \/>Results: Selinexor and BEV significantly inhibited tumor growth as single agents relative to controls, at Day 26, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 54.1% (p&#60;0.0001) and 64.0% (p&#60;0.0001), respectively. The combination of the two agents almost completely inhibited tumor growth, with a TGI of 95% (p&#60;0.0001). Gene expression analysis showed that genes involved in angiogenesis were significantly downregulated in tumor samples collected from mice treated with both agents and was more significant than in animals treated with BEV alone.<br \/>Conclusions: Synergistic anti-GBM effects of selinexor and BEV are likely due to the enhanced inhibition of angiogenesis related genes. An ongoing GBM clinical trial (XPORT-GBM-029, NCT04421378) is investigating the therapeutic efficacy of selinexor and BEV combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/da5983d7-5c9d-47f1-a557-e85cd87244df\/@x03B8ZTp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Xenografts,Angiogenesis inhibitor,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17979"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leah Henegar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

Thus, TMZ is more effective in patients who have GBM with <i>MGMT<\/i> gene silencing promoter hypermethylation. Selinexor is an oral selective inhibitor of Exportin-1 (XPO1\/CRM1) with efficacy in various solid and hematological cancers and clinically approved to treat multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Selinexor also crosses the blood brain barrier and demonstrates clinically relevant disease control with manageable and reversible side effects in a phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent GBM as a monotherapy (Lassman 2021 Clin Cancer Res). To evaluate the effects of selinexor and TMZ combination, preclinical studies were performed with GBM cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and in mouse xenograft models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: Cytotoxic effects of selinexor and TMZ were evaluated with two GBM cell lines LN18 and U87MG. The <i>MGMT<\/i> promoter is hypermethylated in U87MG cells while unmethylated in LN18 cells. The anti-cancer effects of selinexor (20 mg\/kg, PO, once weekly) and TMZ (50 mg\/kg, PO, QDX5, week 1 only) were also tested in a mouse xenograft model of U87MG using different dosing schedules (8 mice per treatment group).<br \/>Results: Synergistic cytotoxic effects of selinexor and TMZ were observed <i>in vitro<\/i> in both LN18 and U87MG cells, regardless of the methylation status of <i>MGMT<\/i> promoter. In mouse xenograft models of U87MG, at Day 29 of study, compared with the control group, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) is 64.5% (p=0.0002) for selinexor and 67.2% (p=0.0001) for TMZ. The combination of the two agents completely inhibited tumor growth, with a TGI of 101.9% (p&#60;0.0001) for a concomitant schedule and a TGI of 104.1% (p&#60;0.0001) for a sequential schedule.<br \/>Conclusion: The selinexor and TMZ combination demonstrated synergistic anti-cancer effects in preclinical GBM models. Previous studies have shown that selinexor treatment reduces DNA damage repair proteins involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, which would provide a mechanism to enhance the cytotoxic effects of TMZ in GBM cells independent of <i>MGMT<\/i> promoter methylation. This combination is now being investigated in an ongoing GBM clinical trial (XPORT-GBM-029, NCT04421378).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/85a8c6a9-28d4-4308-8bae-307192469d5a\/@x03B8ZTp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Xenografts,Alkylating agents,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17980"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Leah Henegar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hua Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher J.

Unlike chemotherapy or targeted agents, the pharmacological efficacy of immune-oncology therapies needs to be evaluated in animal models with functional immune system. Syngeneic tumor models are established by inoculating mouse cancer cell lines to immunocompetent mice with the same genetic background. The host mice have complete immune activity and show histocompatibility with homograft tumor tissues, which can maximize the simulation of the real tumor microenvironment. Subcutaneous syngeneic models are easily established and have been widely used; however, the subcutaneous tumors lack organ-specific stromal-tumor interactions that are critical for disease progression in patients. Orthotopic tumor models are established in organ-specific sites, facilitating metastatic spread, supporting immune and stromal component interactions, and providing a more disease-relevant tumor microenvironment for IO therapy assessment. In order to facilitate the development of IO drug, we have established a panel of orthotopic syngeneic tumor models. We generated a series of luciferase-labeled bioluminescent mouse tumor cell lines, which were then engrafted into the organ of interest to establish orthotopic models. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) enabled non-invasive <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging of orthotopic tumor burden, the real time tumor growth, and the response to therapies, monitored by quantitative bioluminescent signals. Overall, these established orthotopic syngeneic tumor models recapitulate the clinically relevant tumor microenvironment and serve as a useful tool in the pre-clinical evaluation of immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50ad8ef2-e391-4038-9e52-17a041a63244\/@x03B8ZTp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-10 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,orthotopic syngeneic model,IVIS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17981"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gaoxiang Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quanhong Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenting Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingyang Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qunsheng Ji<\/i><\/presenter>.

These rely on immunocompetent mice to model anti-cancer immune responses elicited by experimental treatments. Cytokines mediate these responses through cell signaling, which contributes to an immunosuppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment. Determining the secretion patterns of these protein modulators can help understand pathogenesis, disease progression and resistance to targeted therapies. To evaluate biological effects of potential interventions, we compared systemic cytokine activities in na&#239;ve and untreated tumor-bearing Balb\/c and C57BL\/6 mice.<br \/><b>Study Details:<\/b> Charles River wild type Balb\/c (n=9) and C57BL\/6 (n=10) mice were used for all experiments. CT26 and B16.F10 tumor cell lines for inoculations were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Serum samples were collected from colon carcinoma (Balb\/c) and melanoma (C57BL\/6) bearing mice as well as tumor-free animals. For rapid multiplex measurements on the Meso Scale Discovery platform the V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Mouse Kit was used (cat no. K15048D-1).

Furthermore, the composition of activated T cells was different between huNOG-Fc&#947;R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> and huNOG mice. HuNOG-Fc&#947;R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice had elevated numbers of activated T cells, both T central memory cells (T<sub>CM<\/sub>) and T effector memory cells (T<sub>EM<\/sub>), whereas huNOG mice showed an opposite trend, reduced T<sub>CM<\/sub> and T<sub>EM<\/sub> and increase of na&#239;ve T cells. Our results suggest that the novel NOG-Fc&#947;R<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice become a good model for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human tumor rejection by human T cells, and that they will provide a superior in vivo platform for evaluation of anti-cancer drugs, especially, in combination with ICIs like Nivolumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d4feafa3-c7db-4510-9142-ec1f83b637ea\/@x03B8ZTp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Tumor immunity,Nivolumab,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18382"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ikumi Katano<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Asami Hanazawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Iyo Otsuka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takuya Yamaguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misa Mochiduki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenji Kawai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ryoji Ito<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Motohito Goto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takahiro Kagawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takeshi Takahashi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although transgenic mouse models and patient derived xenograft models have been shown to capture the heterogeneity and complexity of SCLC, the costs involved and timeframe of generating these models can be extensive. Furthermore, these models lack the ability to study the patients&#8217; immune components and tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, in other cancer types in vitro methods to generate organoids have been successful in the hope to develop personalized patient derived organoids for screening and further downstream analyses. Here, we have generated and characterized small cell lung cancer patient-derived tumor organoids and confirmed that the organoids possess similar molecular characteristics, genetic profiles and morphological architectures to the corresponding patient tumor tissue. Organoids were shown to express hallmark features for SCLC, which included expression of neuroendocrine markers CD56, CHGA, INSM1 and SYP shown by immunohistochemistry. We suggest utilizing these organoids as SCLC patient models would be ideal for investigating the tumor microenvironment in SCLC, mechanisms between tumor immune cell interactions as well as assessing patients&#8217; responses to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/572cc689-837a-485b-a29d-efaaf6c5b79e\/@p03B8ZTq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Neuroendocrine tumors,Spheroids,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18882"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joshua D'Rozario<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roman Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although various approaches have been developed to date, most of the <i>in vitro<\/i> techniques were hampered by the limitations like small-volume, non-uniformity, irregular sphericity, short-term culture, labor-intensive and studies&#8217; complexities. Here, we have developed very intuitive methods to generate 3D tumor spheroid models and scaffold-based 3D culture models in a single well of universal plate for long-term cultivation.<br \/><u>Experimental Procedures<\/u>: The prototype of 3D printed chamber was designed by Sketchup software (Trimble) and printed at Illinois MakerLab (http:\/\/makerlab.illinois.edu) for this study. The human colon cancer cell (HCT116), obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and stored in a humidified incubator of 5% CO 2 at 37 &#176;C. Five universal 96 well plates (Corning, Thermo Scientific, CytoOne, Advangene, and Genesee Scientific), Elisa 96 well strip (Corning), Black 96-well plate (Thermo scientific) were used without any modification (Not a type of ultra-low attachment (ULA) plate).<b> <\/b>The prototype designs are flexible to be modified and will be utilized to develop a product beyond conceptual frameworks in the market.<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: Recently, microfabricated approaches have been intensively studied for micro 3D tumor models (&#60; 300 &#181;m in diameter) implemented with high-throughput analysis. However, the micro tumor model incubated in a short-term might not effectively develop tumor heterogeneity such as a non-perfusion core, diffusion gradient and increased interstitial pressure. We intentionally generated a tumor spheroid model incubated over 1 month with appropriate media replacement to supply nutrients. The spheroid in the system grew over 1.5mm of diameter with an excellent sphericity (&#62; 0.95). Besides, our methodology can perform various in-situ spheroid assays in basic cancer research and also generate scaffold-free\/based 3D tumor culture models in the system.

The average 5-year survival rate is 10% and only 3% for patients with metastatic disease. Partially because of the late diagnosis and partially because of its biology, treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer are limited and new interventions are desperately needed to gain the upper hand on this disease. One of the challenges faced by the drug developers looking for agents against pancreatic cancer is capturing the elements of the tumor microenvironment, which provides both a physical barrier and stroma-driven resistance to therapeutic agents. We developed a tumor-specific <i>Reconstructed Pancreas<\/i> (r-Pancreas) model, which recapitulates the cellular and extracellular elements of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. In the r-Pancreas model, tumor and stromal cells are embedded in a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristic of pancreatic tumors. Pancreatic tumor cell lines, MiaPaca-2, Panc-1, and Bx-PC3 robustly proliferate and survive for 14 days providing an extended therapeutic window to test anti-tumor compounds in the context of pancreas-specific ECM. Mimicking clinical response pancreatic tumor cells grown in r-Pancreas are sensitive to gemcitabine (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=0.4-0.6&#181;M) but are resistant to 5-fluorouracil (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=not reached). These cell lines were also 5-10 times less sensitive to gemcitabine when cultured in Matrigel (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=3-6&#181;M), soft ECM rich in collagen IV\/laminin neither of which is abundant in the pancreas. Incorporating a collagen-rich capsule into the r-Pancreas model further expands its physiological relevance as human pancreatic tumors have been shown to have an outer layer of stiff ECM, which provides a physical barrier that impedes drug access to the tumor. Finally, establishing a co-culture of pancreatic tumor cell lines with primary pancreatic stromal cells creates a complete model enabling testing of novel therapeutic agents within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Taken together these data suggest that to be clinically useful <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor models not only need to allow for 3-dimensional cell growth but also have to incorporate tumor-specific elements of the microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1ac1ebf0-b122-4fff-b9af-a9fdd9d305fa\/@p03B8ZTq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18884"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Eleanore J.

Thus, there is an unmet need to identify novel strategies for early cancer detection and prevention. The emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome has a role in promoting cancer. This microbiome including bacteria plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. An imbalance in bacterial composition may cause diseases including cancer. Here we developed a microfluidic chip that can accurately simulate the gut microbiome to test the effects of bacteria and therapies on cancer cells.<br \/>Methods and Results: To test the causal effect of bacteria on cancer, we developed a new high-throughput microfluidic device for simulating the environment of the gut. Initially, we used the photolithography technique where we designed the chip in AutoCAD and fabricated using photoresist resins and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Next, we tested the effect of bacteria on the growth of colorectal cancer cells. For this, we cultured colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is found in the outer membrane of bacteria, as well as the Bacillus bacteria in our microfluidics. Our data show that both LPS and Bacillus significantly accelerate the growth of cancer cells 2.02 times (p value = 0.012) and 1.58 times (p value = 0.011), respectively, over a 4 day culture period. These results show that the increased presence of certain bacteria can promote cancer cell growth and that our chip can be used to test the specific correlation between bacteria and cancer cell growth.<br \/>The previously described method was inefficient and time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, we designed a new chip that allows running 16 samples at once with improved efficiency and accuracy. The template of the device that had 16 microfluidic channels was printed by a 3D printer and used for PDMS replica molding. The PDMS device was attached to the modified multiwell plate to feed media to and collect waste from each channel in a high-throughput manner. In the initial design, the bacteria grew faster than cancer cells taking over the chips. Our new design has dual layered chambers to keep bacteria and cancer cells separated by a membrane, allowing only bacterial secretions to pass through the membrane to cancer cells, mimicking the human gut. The new design also allowed the chip to maintain continuous microfluidic flow and a hypoxic environment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that the new microfluidic device has broader implications including simulating other body organs such as the lung and liver, and testing the impact of viruses such as influenza and COVID-19 on human cells. This device can be used to test both the effect of bacteria and new treatment on clinical samples for the identification of personalized therapy, thus reducing the need for mouse model testing, which is a lengthy and expensive process.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/41d5a3fe-58c8-467b-b89b-3341d44f69ce\/@p03B8ZTq\/mp4?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Inflammation,Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18885"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ekansh Mittal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Young Bock Kang<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is partly because the lack of faithful disease models that accurately recapitulate human bladder cancer. In our previous study, we have analyzed mutation landscape of chemical-induced mouse bladder cancer and human bladder cancer by exome-sequence and found that some components of histone methyltransferase complex like <i>Kmt2c<\/i>, <i>Kmt2d<\/i>, <i>Kdm6a<\/i> were highly prevalent as common mutations and associated with <i>Trp53<\/i>. Additionally, the downregulation of tumor suppressor gene <i>PTEN<\/i> is known in human muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). We also investigated cell of origin of chemical-induced mouse bladder cancer using lineage tracing method and found that Krt5 expressing cells with <i>Trp53<\/i> alteration efficiently give a rise of high-grade MIBC with squamous differentiation. Based on these results, we have tried to make MIBC mouse model using genetically engineered mouse in which Cas9 and target gene mutation express specifically in Krt5 expressing cells by Cre-LoxP system, combined with CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing technique and 3D organoid culture system. Eight-week-old mice harboring <i>Krt5<sup>CreERT2\/+<\/sup><\/i>; <i>LSL-Cas9<\/i>; <i>LSL-Trp53<\/i><sup>+\/R172H <\/sup>were used in this study. After introducing gene recombination by administration of tamoxifen, we generated organoids from bladder epithelial cells. For further gene editing, we infected adeno-associated virus with sg<i>Pten<\/i> and sg<i>Mll3<\/i> to the organoids, which successfully edited the target genes. There seemed to be no significant differences in growth of the organoids in culture between the <i>wild-type<\/i> and gene-edited organoids. However, gene-edited organoids showed tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i> when inoculated in subcutaneous space, renal subcapsular space or bladder submucosa of athymic mice, whereas wild-type organoids did not show tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>. Histologically, the organoid-derived tumors showed morphological similarity to human urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, tumor derived organoid has a potential of tumor development in immune-competent mice. These tumors also maintain squamous phenotype and tumor heterogeneity. These findings suggest that the technique is a promising approach toward the establishment of a useful model of human bladder cancer for the elucidation of bladder carcinogenesis including driver genes. In addition, we think our syngeneic mouse model may be useful tool for further research of tumor immunity and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/902e4383-656f-456d-9e5e-be9188cbe0cd\/@p03B8ZTq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Mouse models,Organoids,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18886"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Akihiro Hamada<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Kita<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideaki Takada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenji Nakamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toru Sakatani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takeshi Sano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takayuki Goto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsuro Sawada<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shusuke Akamatsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>.

Numerous studies using cell line xenografts have shown that CEP55 is required for the viability and survival of a diverse range of cancers<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To decipher the mechanisms by which <i>Cep55<\/i> promotes chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>, we developed a novel knock-in transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously overexpresses <i>Cep55 <\/i>(<i>Cep55<sup>Tg\/Tg<\/sup><\/i>) and a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model of <i>Cep55 <\/i>(<i>Cep55<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>). While overexpression of <i>Cep55 <\/i>was sufficient to cause spontaneous tumorigenesis <i>in vivo, <\/i>Cep55 loss hindered tumorigenesis. When we bred adult <i>Cep55<\/i> cKO mice with other tumor-prone models: oncogenic Kras<i> <\/i>expression (Kras G12D) and Pten tumor-suppressor loss, Cep55 loss significantly delayed tumorigenesis and prolonged survival validating it as a promising therapeutic target for diverse cancers. This reduction of tumorigenesis is concomitant with the downregulation of AKT and ERK signaling pathways, attenuation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and increased cytotoxic CD4\/CD8 T-cell tumor infiltration. This indicates that Cep55 can impair the establishment of the adaptive immune response through modification in the tumor microenvironment and regulation of cell signaling. Mass spectrophotometry of mouse embryo fibroblasts and derived exosomes from wild-type and KO mice revealed the pathways altered by Cep55 such as extracellular matrix remodeling pathways, integrin-related signaling and cellular trafficking mediators indicating the contributions of <i>Cep55<\/i> to cancer are beyond what have been reported so far. Overall, CEP55 is a promising target to prevent tumorigenesis and the progression of cancer through various mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1d48294d-3e88-499b-94a8-24ef7e4967cc\/@p03B8ZTq\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cell signaling,Immune cells,Tumorigenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18887"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Behnam Rashidieh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon M.

Previous studies of cSCC have shown that patients with both <i>p53 <\/i>and <i>p16 <\/i>mutations have lower survival rates. There are currently no syngeneic mouse preclinical models to accelerate the efficacy of immunotherapy combinations to treat cSCC. Our laboratory has generated several genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) containing tissue-specific <i>p53<\/i> and <i>p16<\/i> gene mutations. Recently, we have immortalized three murine cSCC cell lines (cSCC-5690, cSCC-8006, and cSCC-8271) derived from spontaneous skin tumors from GEMMs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the double mutant cell line cSCC-5690 enhances cell survival, tumor aggressiveness, and has lower sensitivity to antibody immunotherapy. Protein and RNA expression of the cell lines were validated by western blotting and qRT-PCR assays. Sphere and soft agar assays were used to evaluate the stem cell population and tumorigenicity of the cell lines. Then, we examined the chemosensitivity with cisplatin through clonogenic assays. To further study the tumorigenicity of cells, we evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth on C57BL\/6J immunocompetent mice by injecting subcutaneously the tumor cell lines. The three cell lines expressed different levels of keratin 14 (K14), but cSCC 5690 and 8006 expressed high levels of genes related to oncogenic pathways as well as mesenchymal markers. The cell line cSCC-5690 expressing mutant <i>p53 R172H <\/i>with <i>p16<\/i> gene deletion, showed an enhanced sphere, and colony tumor formation and both tumorigenic cell lines (cSCC-5690, 8006) showed different sensitivities to cisplatin treatment. A higher tumor growth rate was observed with cSCC-5690 compared to cSCC-8006, while cSCC-8271 showed no tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that both cSCC-5690 and 8006 tumors expressed vimentin but only cSCC-5690 expressed K14. The most aggressive syngeneic tumor model (cSCC-5690) was used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficiency of anti-PD1, anti-CD47 antibodies, and STING-agonist. Preliminary results revealed a significant tumor response only to STING agonist (c-di-GMP) which activates the innate and adaptive immune response. Therefore, we were able to characterize all three cell lines and established a new mouse model of cSCC as a relevant platform for immunotherapy studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7f32162e-e225-42b4-aeef-4310cf3bef13\/@p03B8ZTq\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,p53,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18888"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alanis Enid Rodriguez Rosario<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Rangel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey Myers<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mucinous CRCs account for 10% of all CRCs and are likely to be microsatellite unstable including Lynch syndrome. Mucinous CRCs metastasize less frequently. However, once they metastasize, they exhibit resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, and are associated with poorer prognosis. Although there are some issues to be addressed in mucinous CRCs, mouse models are lacking for mucinous CRCs. Here, we report genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for mucin-producing colonic tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI), resembling human mucinous CRCs.<br \/>Method: To induce genetic alterations specifically in colonic epithelial cells, we used <i>CDX2P-G19Cre<\/i> transgenic mice. In this mouse model, a 9.5-kb fragment in the <i>CDX2<\/i> promoter lesion (CDX2P9.5) regulates Cre expression specifically in colonic epithelium (Hinoi et al. Cancer Research 2007). In addition, 19 guanine nucleotides are inserted just after the first ATG, and Cre only expresses in the epithelial cells in which the number of the guanine tract stochastically turns a multiple of three. This mechanism helps our GEMMs to avoid embryonic death due to the genetic events we introduce. We have also reported that tumors in <i>CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice have an abnormality in two of four MSI markers, suggesting that the tumors are driven by MSI (Sasada et al. PLoS One 2015). TGFBR2 mutation is frequently seen in human MSI CRCs, and inactivation of both <i>Tgfrbr2 <\/i>and <i>Apc<\/i> by Villin-Cre results in small intestinal neoplasm producing mucin. Therefore, to test if <i>Tgfbr2<\/i> conditional knockout affects the mucin-producing phenotype in the context of MSI-high in this mouse model, we generated <i>CDX2P-G19Cre;Apc<sup>flox\/+<\/sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i>.<br \/>Results: In <i>CDX2P-G19Cre; Apc<sup>flox\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbr2 <sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice, colonic neoplasia developed in 27 out of 40 mice. Approximately 60% of the tumors are well-differentiated adenocarcinoma producing mucin, while the remaining 40% are regular colonic adenomas. In these mucinous adenocarcinomas, tumor cells invade into the muscular layer. We also confirmed the immunoreactivity of &#946;-catenin in cytoplasm and nuclei at the invasive front of the tumors in IHC analysis, indicating that these tumors are driven by abnormal Wnt activity. Nearby to the invasive front, there were mucin that were positive for a PAS reaction.<br \/>Conclusion: Mucin-producing adenocarcinomas develop in <i>CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc<sup>flox\/+<\/sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>flox\/flox <\/sup><\/i>mice. This GEMM is a potential mouse model recapitulating human mucinous and microsatellite unstable colorectal adenocarcinoma. The precise mechanism in which mucinous adenocarcinoma develops needs to be elucidated by genomic and transcriptomic analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/152db06d-d027-4bfa-a018-57604f1fae5f\/@p03B8ZTq\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Colorectal cancer,Microsatellite instability,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18889"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Haruki Sada<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takao Hinoi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroaki Niitsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masashi Miguchi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naoya Sakamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naohide Oue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hirotaka Tashiro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideki Ohdan<\/i><\/presenter>.

In our prior studies we have demonstrated that west African ancestry is associated with more aggressive breast tumor phenotypes. Precision medicine approaches to cancer treatment exploit genetic differences to tailor therapy options that are specific to individual patients\/groups. We hypothesize that shared genetic susceptibilities to cancer, which are harbored within populations of common ancestry, may translate to options for targeted therapies. Specifically, we will investigate whether genetic manipulation of kinases in Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids (PDTO) from West African breast cancer patients uncover novel drug targets in a genetic background that has not been investigated in this context to date. PDTO are three-dimensional cellular models grown in culture ex vivo from the tumor tissues obtained from patients retaining cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We established and characterized PDTO from Ghanaian patients and optimized the experimental conditions to perform a lentiviral-based CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function mutation screen targeting kinases in breast cancer organoids. We analyzed which kinases are essential for tumor viability or directly impact the response to current therapy\/drugs. Tumor specimens were collected in Ghana from breast cancer patients and PDTO were stablished in Weill Cornell Medicine (USA). These PDTO were characterized by IHC, targeted panel sequencing and RNA-seq and biobanked. We established stable Cas9-expressing PDTO and we confirmed Cas9 expression by Western Blot and its activity by reporter-based assays, confirming that at least 80% of the cells present Cas9 activity. We performed a Kinome CRISPR Cas9 screen with 2 PDTO. The screening was performed in the presence of DMSO (vehicle to identify essential genes), a MEK inhibitor or an EGFR inhibitor. Preliminary analysis of the screening revealed efficient depletion of the positive controls as well as of previously proposed pan-cancer essential kinases, including CHEK1, ATR and AURKA. Additional analysis and validation of potential novel targets is currently ongoing. Conclusions: We successfully established the conditions to identify potential new therapeutic targets in PDTO derived from Ghanaian patients. Our Kinome Crispr Screen identified known as well as previously unknown essential kinases for breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/bea0a1d0-025a-4241-af7f-3894d1a897fd\/@q03B8ZTr\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,CRISPR\/Cas9,Screening,Kinases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18891"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Florencia P.

Therefore, we set up conditions for breast cancer PDOs and establish an in vitro drug evaluation system for future therapeutic approaches.<br \/>Methods: All specimens were collected from histologically confirmed breast cancer patients after obtaining IRB approval from the National Cancer Center (NCC2017-0146, NCC2020-0299) under patient&#8217;s informed consent. Fifty-four patient samples obtained from surgery or biopsy were delivered to the laboratory within 1-2 hours for organoid establishment. All process for cell isolation from human tissues, criteria of successful culture and passaging, quality control (QC), producing genomic and histologic data were adjusted to make standard operating procedure. For long-term cultured PDOs, we tested 30 drugs including kinase inhibitor or standard therapeutic drugs with concentration from 0.001uM to 100uM using 384well plate and the results were analyzed with AUC data with bortezomib as a control.<br \/>Results: We optimized organoids culture conditions for breast cancer tissues. Total of 54 tissues included disease subtypes as following: hormone positive (n=32), HER2 positive (n=2), triple-negative (n=19), and other (n=1). Nine organoids were successfully long term cultured over 5 passages and 4 were successfully cryopreserved. Clinic characteristics (TNM stages, subtypes, and disease status) showed no significant association with success of organoid establishment. Also, we confirmed that organoids had similar characteristics to the patients tissue through histological data (H&#38;E, ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, and CK-19). Measurement of AUC values for tested drugs showed variety range which implicates different drug sensitivity of each organoid. Currently, genetic information of long-term cultured organoid is ongoing with comparative analysis of drug sensitivity.<br \/>Conclusions: We have established breast cancer organoids which reflect molecular characteristics of the original tumor. This model will serve as the system that can recapitulate drug response profiles of human cancer, and pave the way for screening innovative drugs, identifying novel targets, and stratifying patients for pertinent therapeutic options.

We focus on use of <i>ex vivo<\/i> PDOs, PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), and <i>vivo<\/i> PDXs models for drug testing and personalized therapy. In this study, we investigated the oncogenic role and therapeutic potency of targeting WEE1 in breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: Fresh surgical specimens of primary TNBC breast tumor (N=3) were used for PDOs. PDOs and PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) were cultured in previously reported media compositions based on ECM hydrogel. PODs and PDXOs were subjected to drug screening for 22 anticancer drugs including chemoreagents and targeted drugs in the 3D HTS system. Drug sensitivity was tested in triplicate in different concentration ranges for 7 days. The IC50 for each drug was calculated by a sigmoidal dose-response curve, using the GraphPad Prism 9 program. For drug screening in PDXs models, PDOs were injected into the fourth mammary fat pads of NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1wjl\/SzJ mice. WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775) was administered by oral gavage (AZD1775, 30 mg\/kg) for 3 weeks. Immunostaining of ER, PR, Her2, CK5 and Ki67 was performed in PODs, PODXs and PDX tumor tissues.<br \/>Results: All PDOs, PDXs, and PDXOs were ER-, PR- and HER2- negative. PDOs and PDXOs (172T, 185T, 207T) showed differential response to 22 anticancer drugs. In PDOs and PDXOs models, 172T and 207T PDOs and PDXOs are highly sensitive to AZD1775, but 185T PDOs and PDXOs less sensitive or never respond to treatment with AZD1775 (10 &#181;M). In PDX models, treatment with AZ1775 decreased tumor growth (P&#60;0.0079) as well as distance metastasis in 207T-PDX mice, whereas in 172T- and 185T-PDX mice, the tumor growth and metastasis were not reduced compared with the vehicle group.<br \/>Conclusion: Consequently, PDOs, PDXOs and PDXs recapitulated immunohistological signatures of original tumor tissues. The results of WEE1 inhibitor response between PDOs, PDXOs and PDXs were consistent. This study may provide a preclinical tool to screen drug responses to standard-of-care and newly identified drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/e2fe2e51-0a00-4035-853a-971c6c52651c\/@q03B8ZTr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Organoids,Drug sensitivity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18893"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Seungyeon Ryu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hoe Suk Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Eun KIM<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>So-Hyun Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sangeun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moonjou Baek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-Byoel Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dong Woo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bosung Ku<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wonshik Han<\/i><\/presenter>.

These tumors are commonly treated with chemotherapy like those for colorectal cancer despite clear evidence that the two cancers are distinctly different in their clinical behavior and tumor molecular profiles. In this study, we created PDX models of appendix cancer and tested the efficacy of IP paclitaxel treatment.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>After obtaining informed consent, fresh tumor samples were obtained from 9 patients with AA cancer undergoing surgical resection at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Tumors were implanted in both the flank and peritoneum of NSG mice; from each patient 5 mice were implanted with approx. 0.5 cm<sup>3<\/sup> tumor. Mice were evaluated after 6 months to assess for tumor formation. Additionally, 3 AA PDX models were obtained from collaborators and implanted. A PDX model was treated with paclitaxel (25 mg\/kg, IP, 3 weekly treatments and 1 week off, for two cycles). Tumor size in MRI was evaluated by mucinous peritoneal Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mpRECIST) method.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>None of 5 well differentiated (grade 1) tumors grew in either flank and peritoneum (0 of 10 mice and 0 of 15 mice). Two of 3 moderately differentiated (grade 2) tumors grew in the peritoneum [8 of 9 mice (89%) and 8 of 8 mice (100%)], while only 1 grew in the flank [2 of 4 mice (50%)]. Three poorly differentiated (grade 3) tumors grew in the peritoneum [13 of 13 mice (100%), 8 of 8 mice (100%), and 2 of 5 mice (40%)]. Two of these tumors also grew in the flank but with lower rate of formation [8 of 8 mice (100%), 2 of 4 mice (50%), and 0 of 1 mouse (0%)]. Overall, the tumor formation rate was greater in peritoneum vs flank (30.8% vs 16.7%). Although low-grade tumor didn&#8217;t grow, the formation rates of grade 2 and 3 tumors were 56% and 67% in the peritoneum. PMP-2 and PMCA-3 models grew as a mucinous ascites, MAd20-001 grew as solid tumors, while TM00351 formed a mix of solid tumor and mucinous ascites. Histologically, in MAd20-001, neoplastic cells were poorly differentiated and arranged in sheets with frequent mitoses. PMP-2 and PMCA-3, both with <i>GNAS<sup>R201C<\/sup><\/i> mutation, had a mucinous phenotype similar to <i>GNAS<\/i> mutant appendiceal tumors in humans. IP paclitaxel treatment of the TM00351 showed 77.9% reduction of tumor growth relative to no treatment control mice at 12 weeks. No significant side effect of the treatment was seen in any mice. IP paclitaxel treatment of additional models is ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Interaction with the peritoneal microenvironment is important to promote growth of appendiceal tumors. Orthotopic PDX models recapitulate clinical, histologic, and molecular features of AA, including the indolent growth of low-grade and aggressive growth of high-grade tumors. Using this system we identify IP paclitaxel as an active agent for high-grade AA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ea90544f-a5bd-42fb-9bf3-7e8da05a84ab\/@q03B8ZTr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Peritoneal metastasis,Paclitaxel,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18894"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ichiaki Ito<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael G.

HCC represents an attractive target for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and tumor microenvironment (TME) agents. The development and success of ICI therapies requires a comprehensive model to study interactions of immune networks in the TME. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) have emerged as promising individualized models for <i>ex vivo <\/i>drug testing. While PDO are superior to previous models, due to their inherent heterogeneity and their enhanced capacity to capture tumor characteristics, the lack of mesenchymal and immune components limit their use for testing drug classes such as ICI or study tumor-TME interaction. Here, we developed and characterized a perfusion-based cultivated ex vivo HCC tissue model that preserves the tumor tissue architecture and maintains the pathophysiological microenvironment of human tissue for testing of TME-related treatments.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> Fresh tumor tissue was obtained from surgical specimens of six patients undergoing liver resection for HCC. Tissue fragments of 2x2x2 mm were installed between two discs of collagen type 1 porous scaffold and placed in a perfusion-based bioreactor (U-shaped Culture Under Perfusion; U-CUP) for tissue engineering or cultured in static condition. At different time points, cultured tissue fragments were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for downstream analysis. Cell viability and morphology was monitored on day 0, 5 and 7 by using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The changes in TME composition were monitored by immunohistochemistry using cell-type specific antibodies like CD34 for endothelial cells, CD3 for T-cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) for fibroblasts and arginase-L for urea cycle.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Microscopic analysis revealed that, compare to static culture, the morphology and the viability of the cells were preserved during the culture period in the U-CUP. Tissue histology as well as the immunophenotypic pattern observed in the original tissue was maintained. Similarly, the presence of endothelial cells (CD34+) and fibroblasts (a-SMA+) were detected in the U-CUP cultured samples in a similar proportion to the original tumor samples. The presence of T-cells (CD3+) was stable at all time points. Compared to the samples cultured under static conditions, the U-CUP tended to show less necrosis during the seven-day course.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><i> <\/i>Compared to PDO, U-CUP bioreactor tumor culture seems to preserve mesenchymal and immune components.

Here we represent our protocols setup process for ovarian cancer organoid establishment and PDX after data review and cell line xenograft experiments.<br \/>Methods: First, we reviewed the histologic subtype of ovarian cancer of biobank in national cancer center, Korea then tried to match common subtype ovarian cancer cell line by literature review for xenograft experiments. Patient specimens were collected from histologically confirmed cancer patients under informed consent (NCC2020-0219). We obtained fresh tumor tissue from standard primary surgery of ovarian cancer patient and tissue was dissociated. Then we plated cells in matrigel with modified growth factors media. Organoids were passaged with diameter larger than 50&#181;m and genetic analysis were performed to compare with original tumor. For PDX condition establishment, xenograft models using OVCAR3 in athymic nude and NOG mouse strains were compared, then SKOV3, SNU840, SNU251, and ES2 cell line subcutaneous xenograft growth were observed in NOG mouse.<br \/>Results: Frequency of subtype of ovarian cancers (n=733) in biobank represented as following: serous adenocarcinoma (70%, n=509), endometrioid tumors (11%), clear cell tumors (10%), mucinous tumors (4%) and others (5%). After adjustment of organoid culture condition, PDOs (10 patients and 11 samples) were successfully long term cultured over 5 passages and the subtypes were including high grade serous type (n=5, 50%), clear cell carcinoma (n=2), mucinous carcinoma (n=2) and low grade serous type (n=1). The median age was 65 (28-82) years and stage III-IV (n=6) were frequent. Among them, number of recurred patients was three. Currently, the genetic information of each organoid is ongoing with CNV analysis, and the sensitivity and comparative analysis of the drug will be performed.

However, how tumor cells evolve in PDMC and the implication on therapeutic response remains largely unclear. Herein, we leveraged ATAC-seq to compare the chromatin accessibility landscapes of matched sets of colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived organoids (PDOs), patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), PDO-derived PDX (PDOXs), and original patient tumors (PTs), supplemented by mRNA-seq for the transcriptomics information. In the study, nine surgically resected CRC tumor specimens were recruited at Duke. For a PT-PDMCs set, part of the original patient tumor was prepared for sequencing, and the remainders from the same specimens were subjected to derive PDXs and PDOs. Throughout the study, eight PDOs were generated, and three subcutaneous PDXs grew. Besides, we also developed six patient-derived xenografts through organoids. In total, we successfully established 6 matched PT-PDO-xenograft sets, including 3 sets that have both conventional PDXs and PDOXs. The global chromatin accessibility derived from PDMCs and PTs ATAC-seq libraries presented broad congruence (79.6% peaks remained unchanged), suggesting that PDMCs mostly retained their epigenetic identity of patient tumors. Nevertheless, paired differential analysis identified alterations in chromatin accessibility between PTs and PDMCs. We discovered two principal remodeling axes. The first one separates PT from all PDMCs, and the second separate in vitro and in vivo models. Interestingly, PDOXs are much more similar to PDXs than to PDOs, indicating that the PDMCs environment is the driving force for chromatin remodeling. Single cell multiome sequencing (10X Genomics) also agreed that the PDOXs are more similar to PDXs compared to PDOs. Based on our findings, PDOXs may be a good substitution for conventional PDXs. Between <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models, bivariate genomic footprinting analysis was used to further identify transcription factors (TF) that drive chromatin remodeling differentially. Our data suggested KLF14 and EGR2 have enriched motif&#8209;binding footprints in PDOXs from all patient cases. Their silencing enhanced CRC growth, which partially explains why PDXs tend to grow slower than PDOs. Downstream genes of EGR2 and KLF14 have also been analyzed. One of the targets, EPHA4, has been reported it would influence the drug sensitivities. Collectively, patient CRC cells undergo both common and distinct chromatin remodeling in PDOs and PDXs\/PDOXs, driven by their respective microenvironments. The datasets allow researchers to look into chromatin accessibility, gene expression, transcriptional factor binding, and pathways that are altered in PDMC compared to original tumors, which will shed light on their predictability for therapeutic profiling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20852b4e-2502-466c-8ffa-6616bdd735e3\/@q03B8ZTr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-11 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Organoids,Chromatin remodeling,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18897"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kun Xiang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ergang Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiang Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiling Shen<\/i><\/presenter>.

The invasive proliferating neovasculature of tumors lacks pericyte support and exhibits increased permeability thereby offering a unique, potentially selective target for anticancer therapy. Most vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) inhibit microtubule formation, causing rapid morphological changes in endothelia cells resulting in dramatically increased vessel permeability, cellular detachment, vessel occlusion, and vessel wall damage [doi: 10.3390\/molecules26092551]. Highly vascular kidney tumors are expected to be particularly sensitive to VDAs. We are evaluating OXi8007, a water soluble indole phosphate pro-drug derivative of the first generation VDA combretastatin. The prodrug OXi8007 is stable in saline but releases active OXi8006 is the presence of alkaline phosphate. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data benchmarked using <sup>13<\/sup>C-labeled OXi8006 and OXi8007 show rapid vascular clearance and conversion to the glucuronide conjugate <i>in vivo<\/i>. Doses up to 700 mg\/kg were tolerated by mice. Luciferase-expressing RENCA tumor cells were implanted orthotopically in the right kidney capsule of syngeneic BALB\/c mice. Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) was applied weekly to assess tumor growth and acute response to OXi8007. Following addition of luciferin substrate subcutaneously BLI signal from the tumor reached a maximum within 10 minutes. When BLI was repeated 4 hrs after 250 or 350 mg\/kg OXi8007 IP, the generated signal was &#60;1% of baseline signal indicating acute vascular disruption. Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) revealed matching acute changes in tumor vascular oxygenation and additionally showed distinct heterogeneity. An oxygen gas breathing challenge indicated lower oxygen saturation in the tumor following treatment. Histology showed massive hemorrhage following both doses. BLI signal recovered after 1 to 2 days and repeated administration of OXi8007 again caused acute vascular shutdown. These results match previous observations in breast tumor models [doi: 10.1016\/j.canlet.2015.08.021] indicating opportunities for therapeutic application.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a1752709-74a4-421f-806c-da6f7b6022ae\/@q03B8ZTr\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-04 Model organisms in drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Vascular Disrupting agent(VDA),Tumor targeting,In vivo imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19042"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hashini I.

Two-thirds of NSCLC patients harbor oncogenic driver alterations, among which <i>EGFR<\/i> activating mutations and <i>ALK<\/i> rearrangements occur in 16% and 5% of cases, respectively. However, in both genetic backgrounds the benefit of molecular therapies, including next generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), is temporally limited with therapy evasion representing a major roadblock against cancer eradication. Patient Derived Organoids (PDOs) have raised a tremendous interest in cancer research for their ability to preserve the original tumoral architecture, including its microenvironment, at both the genomic and functional level. Notably, PDOs can be stabilized from a very limited amount of starting material, such as needle biopsies from local and distal metastases, including lesions originated upon molecular therapy relapse. The possibility to perform pharmacogenomic screening and functional analyses renders PDOs an ideal tool for co-clinical studies. Thereby, we have systematically collected 87 oncogene-addicted lung cancer specimens, among which 48 were suitable for 3D cultures in terms of tumor cell number and viability. We successfully established 15 long-term PDO cultures that maintain the proliferation capability throughout passages, and obtained a subset of corresponding 2D cell lines. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PDOs faithfully recapitulate the features of the original neoplastic lesions. Moreover, targeted molecular annotation confirmed that our PDOs retained the somatic oncogene alterations of the matching tumors. In addition, drug sensitivity tests and functional experiments have demonstrated the ability of PDOs to reproduce patient response to targeted therapies, indicating the translational relevance of our platform. Furthermore, we exploited organoids to study the molecular circuits responsible for tumor cell evasion to targeted therapy, identifying bypass track signaling as critical for the emergence of drug resistance. Finally, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of drug treatments based on the combination of early and next generations TKIs. Overall, our data highlight the translational relevance of PDO interrogation in clinical oncology, especially for patients who relapse to different lines of therapy. We provide evidence that in oncogene-addicted tumors bypass track signaling is a common non-genetic mechanism of resistance to last generation TKIs. Thus, the correct co-administration of different molecules and\/or the use of earlier-generation inhibitors upon progression may improve treatment strategies, potentially impacting on patient&#8217;s benefit and clinical outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f72d860a-00b4-4036-8b49-a9d2463a8652\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Oncogene,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19044"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Francesca Picca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Bersani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Fabrizio Tabbo'<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesca Napoli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paolo Bironzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Listi'<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesco Passiglia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marco Volante<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Vittorio Scagliotti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisella Righi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>SIlvia Novello<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Riccardo Taulli<\/i><\/presenter>.

In this project, we developed a tumor organoid-on-chip platform (TumOC) by combining most recent technological advances: We integrated patient-derived 3D cell cultures (organoids) from colorectal carcinomas and microsensor particles measuring oxygen concentration and therefore allowing assessment of cell vitality in real time in a microfluidic system. The resulting TumOC platform allows for defined exposition of cytostatic drugs including dynamic treatments. Measurements of cell vitality in real time enables analysis of not only the final effect of a drug treatment, but also the kinetics of drug response. At the same time, utilizing organoids allows for recapitulating tumor architecture and heterogeneity. Here we report the first proof of principle results generated with this system. We measured the cell vitality in real time over 72 hours during treatment with classic chemotherapeutics or targeted cancer drugs and compared the results to end-point measurements on the same organoids in a static system. In conclusion, our TumOC platform with its ability to recapitulate tumor heterogeneity in combination with dynamic treatments and real-time cell vitality assessment is an <i>in-vitro<\/i> tumor model closely recapitulating the physiological situation in a patient. TumOC provides an impressive opportunity to test and, consequently, predict the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, this system is of interest not only for pre-clinical drug development but also for personal oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/95fe2789-92bb-414f-a951-1ad14c749185\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Microfluidics,Real-time measurement,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19045"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marie Flechner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Juergen Loskutov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrike Pfohl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Osman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian R.

Especially in cancer cells, increased Pyr metabolism meets the demand of higher energy consumption during rapid cell growing state. Therefore, monitoring tumor Pyr metabolic flux in vitro and in vivo should be necessary to develop a therapeutic strategy using small molecules which can inhibit the fluxes.<b>Aim<\/b>: We performed in vitro metabolic analysis on pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa2) and applied a novel in vivo imaging technology &#8220;hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HP-MRSI)&#8221; to dynamic monitoring of the impact of Glycolysis and OXPHOS inhibitors on the MiaPaCa2 xenografts.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used a novel LDH inhibitor &#8220;NCI-006&#8221; for Glycolysis inhibition and Mitochondrial Complex 1(MC1) Inhibitor \"Metformin(Met)\", which is already clinically available, and &#8220;IACS-010759(IACS)&#8221; for OXPHOS inhibition, in vitro and in vivo. Extracellular flux (EXF) analysis and HP-MRSI were performed before and after administration of each or both to assess inhibitor impact on metabolic flux in vitro and in vivo, respectively.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>HP-MRSI confirmed that LDH activity in the tumor was suppressed by NCI-006 (83.3&#177;4.4% decrease) and accelerated by Met (69.9&#177;6.6% increase) and IACS (88.6&#177;25.1% increase). We confirmed these in vivo observations are fully consistent with the effect of those inhibitors in vitro on the energy profile of MiaPaCa2, and also the close correlation of these data with the results of the <i>ex vivo<\/i> LDH activity assay, suggesting HP-MRSI can reliably monitor <i>in vivo<\/i> on target effects of the inhibitors without need for tissue sampling. In addition, combined treatment with the NCI-006 and MC1 inhibitor significantly suppressed in vitro cell growth and tumor growth in an efficacy study of MiaPaCa2 xenografts, compared to each single administration. Apoptosis assay showed the combined treatment induced apoptosis in MIA Paca2 cells.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Using EXF analyzer and HP-MRSI revealed that Glycolysis inhibition redirects tumor Pyr toward OXPHOS and also MC1 inhibition redirects tumor Pyr toward Glycolysis. Combination therapy suppresses metabolic plasticity, causing metabolic quiescence in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo. HP-MRSI is thought to be useful for pancreatic cancer patients to establish the current treatment model because of no need to obtain clinical samples, such as patients-derived cancer cells or spheroid from the patients. The current proof of concept can be of great value in developing new therapeutic strategies using metabolic inhibitors to treat cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/dd80963f-b9b3-405e-bf7e-01d54c02d86b\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-06 Noninvasive imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Inhibitors,Molecular imaging,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19191"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nobu Oshima<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Aisu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeo Hisamori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shigeru Tsunoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroki Hashida<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenji Uryuhara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyuki Kobayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masato Kondo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Koji Kitamura<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Satoshi Kaihara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazutaka Obama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krishna C.

Currently, they are gaining increasing significance in the field of personalized oncology, as they recapitulate the histopathology of the original tumor tissue and preserve its genetic markup. PD3D&#174; can be used to model intratumoral heterogeneity and for medium and high throughput drug screens. Using a reverse clinical engineering approach, PD3D&#174; models allow identification of chemoresistance\/sensitivity signatures (i.e., biomarkers) and can be applied in personalized oncology to identify treatment for an individual patient. We successfully established PD3D&#174; models from more than 300 tumor tissue samples, ranging from more prevalent cancers like colorectal, breast and pancreas carcinoma, to rare tumor entities including various sarcoma types and thymoma. PD3D&#174; models from different tumor entities differ in morphology and culture media requirements. When treating PD3D&#174; from the same tumor entity with standard of care drugs, we found that their response differed, as does clinical response of patients. Furthermore, we successfully used PD3D&#174; models to identify a biomarker for predicting chemosensitivity towards a targeted drug. For application of PD3D&#174; in truly personalized oncology, we developed a protocol that allows us to generate a PD3D&#174; culture and perform a drug sensitivity assay for an individual patient within a therapy-relevant timeframe. Using this protocol, we identified a combination therapy for a pretreated, metastasized appendix carcinoma within 29 days, that resulted in stable disease of the patient. In conclusion, PD3D&#174; models can be derived from various cancer entities and used to analyze drug response in cohorts of models for drug development or identification of signatures related to drug resistance or sensitivity. Furthermore, PD3D&#174; models can be used to predict a patient tumor&#8217;s drug response in a personalized manner, supporting the oncologist to identify the best treatment option for the patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/262beba1-e152-4e55-b329-ee231f087ed6\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Personalized medicine,Drug sensitivity,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19192"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Alina Pflaume<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha Exner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Herrera-Glomm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Jürgen Loskutov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrike Pfohl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuela Regenbrecht<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sushmitha Sankarasubramanian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lena Wedeken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Finkler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Larissa Ruhe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Quirin Graf Adelmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Reinhard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Stroebel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian R.

The incidence of the particular cancer type is directly connected to the availability of specific medication and amount of the research focused on it, resulting in a high unmet medical need for treatment options for rare cancers. Currently, NCI defines &#8220;rare cancer&#8221; as cancer with an incidence rate below 15 per 10^5 people per year and recently the term &#8220;ultra-rare cancer&#8221; was defined as cancer with an incidence rate below 1 per 10^6 people per year. These encompass drastically understudied entities, usually with poor prognosis and grim outlook for an improvement in treatment. Low incidence of such cancers makes development of targeted therapies not interesting from a commercial point of view and completely abolishes the possibility of large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, a personalized medicine approach appears to be the most promising strategy for the patients to get adequate care.<br \/>Here we report our experience with personalized oncology solutions for rare and ultra-rare cancers. We utilized patient derived 3D (PD3D) cultures to evaluate prospective therapeutic options in these exceptional cases to support the oncologists in providing personalized care to the patients. Fresh surgical specimens underwent several steps of mechanical and chemical dissociation. Subsequently, cell aggregates were seeded into 24 well plates in matrix-like scaffolds and allowed to grow until they started forming colonies. After harvesting, the cells underwent pathology evaluation to confirm origin and diagnosis. Therapies, recommended by the case leading oncologist, were used for drug sensitivity testing after transferring cells semi- automatically to 384-well plates.<br \/>Over the last 18 months, we handled 6 cases classified as rare or ultra-rare cancers. The diagnoses included: clear cell sarcoma, extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, CIC-rearranged round cell sarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, cardiac angiosarcoma and clear cell endometrial carcinoma. In all cases we were able to successfully establish PD3D cultures and perform a drug screen, identifying a potential treatment for the patient.<br \/>Overall, our results indicate that it is feasible to utilize our testing strategy for rare and ultra-rare cancer entities. Further research and rigorous follow up is required to confirm the benefit of the personalized approach vs current strategies. However, a demand for personalized care in such cases is clearly visible.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/544d023a-a498-4801-a304-e614c14b3867\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-07 Organoids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19193"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Juergen Loskutov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manuela Regenbrecht<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rica Sauer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Finkler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maya Niethard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Reinhard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Regenbrecht<\/i><\/presenter>.

Oral cancer has frequent local recurrence and lymph node metastasis even after curative surgery with radiation to prevent recurrence. However, more than 50% of patients show a relapse pattern, and it is difficult to improve treatment due to the lack of experimental models that reflects the heterogeneity of the tumors as well as markers to predict treatment response. Although the patient-derived organoid (PDO) system is a good preclinical model that reflects the characteristics and heterogeneity of the original tumor, there are only small numbers of patients with oral cancer, so it has been relatively difficult to secure clinical samples. Therefore, oral cancer organoid development has so far been insufficient. Here, we have established a normal organoid library as well as cancer using primary tissue from many oral cancer patients. Seventy patients were enrolled in this study between Jan 2021 and Sep 2021. Fifty tumor organoids and fifty-five normal organoids were generated and sustained. Among them, 29 tumor organoids and 28 normal organoids were successfully cultured over 4 passages and cryopreserved. Moreover, 15 pairs of normal-tumor organoids were established. The success rate of organoids has no significant relationship with clinical information such as TNM stages, disease status and differentiation. These organoids recapitulated genomic features and histopathological characteristics of the patient tissue was examined through copy number variation (CNV) and IHC with TP53, P16, CK8, and so on, respectively. Normal organoids derived from tissue adjacent to the tumor of each patient showed typical morphology such as multilayer epithelium. Moreover, we set the assay system to evaluate the responses to radiation and the drug treatment using AUC value. Each organoid including normal and tumor showed different sensitivity to radiation. This oral cancer organoids platform is the largest repository in the field so far, apart from head and neck cancers. It provides a valuable platform for personalized treatment.

They are rare cancers and thus difficult to study due to scarcity of patient material, large genomic instability and a wide histological heterogeneity (in OS) or a lack of satisfactory transgenic animal model and availability of preclinical tests (in ES). There is a dire need for new models and novel therapeutic approaches. Although patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) may recapitulate human tumor biology and predict drug response, propagating PDXs in mice limits its use as a drug-testing platform.<br \/>We have established and standardized ES and OS spheroid culture and developed a semi-automated drug-screening platform in tumor spheroids. We established several robust techniques for spheroid formation, with clear pathophysiological gradients, but without central necroses at the onset of drug treatment. We performed RNA-seq comparing spheroid transcription profiles to 2D culture and observed dramatic changes in overall expression patterns. We observed upregulation of genes shown to correlate with poor prognosis in OS patients. We saw upregulation of processes associated with regulation of cell migration, negative regulation of proliferation and modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to ES spheroid models, we created bioprinted 3D-models of ES cell lines and of cells obtained from ES PDXs, using extrusion bioprinting techniques (where cells are encapsulated within the cross-linked polymers, thus allowing homogeneous distribution and high cell density). PDX-derived cells were kept in liquid culture and as 3D-bioprinted constructs, while their transcription profiles were compared with the initial PDX. The mevalonate pathway was the most overrepresented in all ES 3D-models, consistent with predominant upregulation of this metabolic pathway integral to tumor growth and progression. After 15 days in 3D-bioprinted culture, we observed pronounced upregulation of genes involved in ECM signaling, suggesting that the construct promoted in vivo-like tumor-ECM interactions, without further promoting main proliferation and cell survival pathways, which was observed in liquid culture. Furthermore, we showed potential for combinatorial treatment with statins and confirmed feasibility of drug testing in patient-derived 3D models.<br \/>Finally, as our spheroid models showed upregulation of many processes involved in metastasis (genes associated with invasion, migration, angiogenesis and hypoxia), we focused on lung as the most common site of metastasis in ES and OS patients. We are thus establishing mixed airway organoid\/tumoroid cultures, to investigate further the lung metastatic niche, with a goal to provide proof of concept for patient-specific 3D-models of lung metastatic tumors to guide personalized drug selection for patients with advanced disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/be4edb6d-5ab3-475d-9cba-89018f23a6d2\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-01 3-D and tissue recombinant models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D cell culture,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,3D models,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20554"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Branka Radic Sarikas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathias Ilg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marica Markovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caterina Sturtzel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Scheuringer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Justine Zulini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Metzelder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Halbritter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Distel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Didier Surdez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Delattre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandr Ovsianikov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Heinrich Kovar<\/i><\/presenter>.

Our team has recently demonstrated the therapeutic effects of two novel heme-targeting agents (heme-sequestering peptide 2 (HSP2) and cyclopamine tartrate (CycT)) which effectively suppress angiogenic activities and normalize tumor vasculatures in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and mouse tumor models [1,2]. We have now applied non-invasive multimodal imaging to evaluate these heme related treatments of kidney cancer.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MultiSpectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) are ideally suited for investigations of the kidney and RCC given their extensive vasculature. MRI was performed at 9.4-T using high-resolution axial T2-weighted multi-slice images encompassing the entire kidney tumor were obtained with a fat suppressed fast spin-echo sequence in about 8 minutes. The MSOT system illuminates the mouse from all sides, providing effective excitation (700, 780, 800, 820, 850 nm) even at depth, revealing rudimentary anatomy, as well as functional oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. We used MSOT and MRI modalities to determine the degree to which CycT modified hypoxia in orthotopic PDX renal XP 334 tumor xenografts in mice.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> Both MSOT and MRI showed anatomical differences between treated and control tumors with treated tumors being significantly smaller <i>(p &#60; 0.002)<\/i>.<i> <\/i> Dynamic hemoglobin changes to oxygen-breathing challenge through MSOT as a response to control and CycT group in kidney tumors.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b><b> <\/b>MR and MSOT imaging allowed us to monitor and evaluate the effects of the novel heme targeting drugs CycT, which significantly suppressed orthotopic kidney PDX 334 tumor growth. MSOT demonstrates dynamic hemoglobin changes to oxygen-breathing challenge in response to CycT and untreated control groups in kidney tumors. Combining MR imaging with other non-invasive imaging modalities provides a clear guide on monitoring and targeting treatments for tumors in mice.<br \/><b>REFERENCES: <\/b>[1] S.

Here, we engineered triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) humanized PDX mouse (Hu-PDX) model to observe human immune system and tumor growth in TME. In addition, we analyzed gene ontology of PDX isolated from hu or non-humanized mouse model.<br \/>Method: Human CD34+hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from cord blood is reconstructed into mature human leukocytes (hCD45+) in NOD.Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid<\/sup>IL2&#947;g<sup>tm1<\/sup> <sup>Sug<\/sup> (NOG) mice. TNBC PDX tumors are established it with unmatched human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, confirmed by that hCD45+ engraftment levels did not exceed 20-30% in the peripheral blood of mice. To be repopulated functional human T cells in xenograft models with severely depleted thymus, hCD34-PBMC cells are directly intravenously injected into tail vein of humanized mice followed by hCD34+cells injected without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The growth and gene expression of TNBC PDX tumors, as well as engrafted human immune population including T, B , natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid cells in TME, are monitored and investigated in both hu and non-hu-mice model.<br \/>Results: Human immune reconstruction of cells, of the lymphoid as well as myeloid lineages, has been successfully accomplished in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time in TME. Although the number of human mature leukocytes was gradually decreased in mice by 17 weeks, humanized mice have enabled studies of human immunity and TME in limitation period. Also, one of remaining limitations is unable to positive and negative selection of human T cells in the humanized mouse thymus and required to human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in humanized mice. To overcome this barrier, additional stimulation factor for generating functional T cells have successfully engrafted by transferring hCD34-PBMC cells. Moreover, tumor infiltrating human lymphocytes (TILs) have obviously detected in Hu-PDX model, although the differences tumor growth rate was not significantly monitored, compared with non-humanized mice. Interestingly, the analysis of gene ontology; biological process, cellular component and molecular function, ribosomal relevant proteins, not immune related genes, were highly up-regulated in TNBC PDX humanized in comparison to non-humanized mouse model.<br \/>Conclusion: Humanized PDX model will contribute to studies more efficiently for the machinery underlying immunological response in breast tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, it might be an important unknown mechanism that the effect of elevated cancer-related ribosomal proteins expression within hu immune-TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/74dca20c-ec74-496a-a0b7-dc09658a2080\/@r03B8ZTs\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immune cells,Human,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/20808"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[{"FileType":"mp3","Icon":"far fa-file-audio","Label":"Audio","Reference":"b71d23c2-6c5c-433e-a1db-4336495ba00b","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/b71d23c2-6c5c-433e-a1db-4336495ba00b\/@r03B8ZTs\/mp3"}],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yujeong Her<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hye Yeon Son<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ju Hee Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Hang Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingji Quan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Songbin Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyeong Gon Moon<\/i><\/presenter>.

Considering their chemo-radio-resistance, alternative treatment strategies are therefore strongly requested, but their development is limited by the paucity of relevant preclinical models. Mutations affecting genes of the SWI\/SNF complex including <i>PBMR1<\/i> are frequently found in chordomas, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of epigenetic regulators in this indication.<br \/>Methods: Thirty-eight chordoma specimens derived from primary patients&#8217; tumors were grafted into <i>nude<\/i> mice. Relationship between grafted tumors and clinical, biological and therapeutic features of corresponding patients were investigated. We subjected the established PDX models to histopathological and genetic examination; finally, a therapeutic program focused on the EZH2-inhibition was performed in one PDX model.<br \/>Results: Twelve PDX models were established and characterized on histological and biomolecular features. Patients whose tumors were able to grow into mice had a statistically significant lower progression-free survival than those whose tumors did not grow after <i>in vivo<\/i> transplantation (p=0.007). All PDXs maintained the same histopathological features as patients&#8217; tumors. Homozygous deletions of <i>CDKN2A\/2B <\/i>(58.3%) and <i>PBRM1 <\/i>(25%) variants were the most common genomic alterations found. In the tazemetostat treated PDX model harboring a <i>PBRM1<\/i> variant, an overall survival of 100% was observed.<br \/>Conclusion: Our panel of chordoma PDXs represents a useful preclinical tool for both pharmacologic and biological assessments. The first demonstration of a high antitumor activity of tazemetostat in a PDX model harboring a <i>PBRM1<\/i>variant supports further evaluation of EZH2-inhibitors in this subgroup of chordomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/fd63d533-2bf5-40d7-a779-e8e7035599ec\/@r03B8ZTs\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-08 Patient-derived xenograft models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EZH2,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21566"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thibault Passeri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Dahmani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Masliah-Planchon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adnan Naguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marine Michou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rania El-Botty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sophie Vacher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachida Bouarich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>André Nicolas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Polivka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coralie Franck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Schnitzler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fariba Némati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sergio Roman-Roman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franck Bourdeaut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Homa Adle-Biassette<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hamid Mammar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sébastien Froelich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ivan Bièche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Didier Decaudin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) has been reported to be overexpressed in breast, lung and pancreatic cancers. PP4 plays an important role in the regulation of centrosome maturation, DNA repair, NF-&#954;B, and c-jun-NH<sub>2<\/sub>-kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. However, the expression and functions of PP4 in pancreatitis have not been studied.<br \/>Methods: To examine the functions of PP4 in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (AP), we crossed PP4<sup>flox\/+ <\/sup>mice with pancreatic acinar cell specific cre, CreERT, which was driven by a full length pancreatic acinar specific elastase I promoter. PP4<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, CreERT mice and control mice were treated with 8 hourly intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (50 &#181;g\/kg\/h). The pancreata were harvested at different time points for histopathological examination and molecular analysis.<br \/>Results: PP4 expression was increased at both protein and mRNA levels in mouse pancreas with AP. Compared to CreERT mice, PP4<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, CreERT mice demonstrated significantly less edema, less inflammation, less necrosis or loss of pancreatic acinar cells in pancreas after cerulein treatment. The serum amylase and lipase levels were lower in cerulein-treated PP4<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, CreERT mice compared with controls. The pancreata of PP4<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, CreERT mice exhibited decreased STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and decreased NF-&#954;B activation cerulein-treated PP4<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup>, CreERT mice than control mice.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that PP4 plays an important role in cerulein-induced AP through STAT3 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Inhibition of PP4 may help to reduce the pancreatic injuries and to prevent the development of chronic pancreatitis, which increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein phosphatase,Pancreas,STAT3 activation,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21630"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hua Wang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Reza Abbasgholizadeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rohan Moniruzzaman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baoan Ji<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anirban Maitra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huamin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.
