Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a non-classical major histocompatibility class I molecule with an immune tolerance role at the maternal-fetal interface. HLA-G has limited normal tissue expression, mainly detected in placenta and pituitary gland. However, HLA-G is expressed in multiple human cancers, with a potential role in cancer immune evasion. Comprehensive immunohistochemistry analysis of patient-derived tumors revealed high prevalence of HLA-G expression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC, 75% ), ovarian (61%), colon (64%) and rectal cancers (40%), and moderate HLA-G expression prevalence in lung adenocarcinoma, endometrial, and pancreatic cancer. JNJ-78306358 induces HLA-G-expressing tumor cell killing via T cell redirection. This bsAb features an anti-HLA-G single-chain fragment variable (scFv) domain that binds with high affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> ~ 13 pM) to HLA-G on tumor cells and a Fab domain that binds with weaker affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> ~22 nM) to the epsilon subunit of the cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3&#949;). The immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 heavy chains feature Fc region mutations that disrupt interaction with Fc&#947; receptors. JNJ-78306358 demonstrated potent PBMC- and T cell-mediated <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity (EC<sub>50<\/sub> 10.4 - 442.3 pM) against endogenous membrane HLA-G-expressing tumor cell lines and absence of killing against cancer cells lacking HLA-G membrane expression, highlighting the specificity against antigen-expressing tumor cells. JNJ-78306358 exhibited hallmarks of T cell engagement <i>in vitro<\/i>, including T cell proliferation and cytokine release. In addition, JNJ-78306358 showed HLA-G-expression-dependent anti-tumor activity in mice (humanized with human donor CD3<sup>+<\/sup> pan-T cells or human umbilical cord-blood-derived CD34<sup>+<\/sup> hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs]) bearing cell line- and patient-derived tumors. In these xenograft models, a dose-dependent increase in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration into tumors was observed with complete tumor regressions at low doses of JNJ-78306358 (0.03 mg\/kg). JNJ-78306358&#8217;s safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity are currently being evaluated in a first-in-human phase I study in advanced stage solid tumors with high prevalence of HLA-G protein expression (NCT04991740). This antigen-targeting approach may address an unmet medical need in patients with tumors expressing HLA-G.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,Tumor antigen,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nataša Obermajer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Adam Zwolak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly Van De Ven<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shana Versmissen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Brajic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ted Petley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Weinstock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Aligo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fang Yi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Jarantow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keith Schutsky<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Tian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angelilo Lorraine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Alvarez Arias<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristel Buyens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vince Torti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krista Menard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharine Rogers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Geist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marjolein Van Heerden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerald Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bie Verbist<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maté Ongenaert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julien Hasler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathryn Packman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jacintha Shenton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Brehmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josh Lauring<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Regina J.

HSF1 (Heat Shock Factor 1) is an ancient stress-inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in the transcriptional activation of the eukaryotic heat shock response. This leads to expression of many heat shock proteins, including molecular chaperones, and through this HSF1 acts as a master transcriptional regulator of proteostasis. Importantly, HSF1 is hijacked by cancer cells to activate a set of genes that overlaps with, but is not identical to, the classical heat shock response. The HSF1 pathway has been shown to play a key role in oncogenesis and the hallmark features of malignancy and is important in the initiation and progression of many experimental cancer models. Importantly, while HSF1 has been demonstrated to be important in mouse models of oncogenesis, knockout of the homologue of HSF1 has only modest effects in mice and flies under non-stressed laboratory conditions &#8211; supporting the potential for a therapeutic window. In addition, gene amplification, expression and activation of HSF1 has been shown to predict clinical outcome in many human cancers. Despite strong scientific rationale and pre-clinical validation, pharmaceutical exploitation has been limited because analysis of the available molecular structures of HSF1 shows it to be very difficult to drug. Because of this, we set out to discover inhibitors of the HSF1 pathway using an initial phenotypic screen that reports on the activation of the HSF1-regulated gene HSP72. This identified the bisamide series that was followed up by a detailed understanding of structure-activity relationships and medicinal chemistry optimization, particularly to improve pharmaceutical properties, leading to the selection of NXP800 (CCT361814) as the development candidate. NXP800 has good pharmacokinetic properties in mice, including oral bioavailability; also, pharmacodynamic studies show modulation of biomarkers of the HSF1 pathway and stress response in human tumour xenograft models. NXP800 exhibits striking therapeutic activity in xenografts of human ovarian clear cell ovarian cancer (OCCC) and endometrioid ovarian cancer, two serious conditions of high unmet medical need with limited treatment options &#8211; including prolonged tumour growth inhibition and regression at doses that show good toleration. The efficacy and tolerability data indicate a clear therapeutic window, supported by selectivity and safety profiting in pharmacology and kinome panels. In addition, we identified deficiency in ARID1A, a component of the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, as indicative of greater therapeutic responsiveness. This was confirmed through broader evaluation in human cancer cell line panels that also indicates therapeutic potential for NXP800 in additional cancer types. Studies to support mechanism of action and identify patient selection biomarkers will be described. A Phase 1 trial of NXP800 is now open, incorporating validated predictive, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers that provide a robust Pharmacological Audit Trail and support the prediction of dose-to-human.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heat shock proteins,Drug discovery,Transcriptional regulation,ARID1A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul Workman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Two types of genetic alterations result in SMARCB1 perturbation: SS18-SSX gene fusion and SMARCB1 loss-of-function mutations. In synovial sarcoma, a rare and aggressive soft tissue malignancy comprising approximately 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas, the presence of the SS18-SSX fusion gene drives the disruption of SMARCB1 function and leads to a synthetic lethal dependence on BRD9. In SMARCB1-null solid tumors, for example malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), poorly differentiated chordomas, and epithelioid sarcomas, the absence of SMARCB1 protein results in a similar BRD9 dependence. Thus, in SMARCB1-perturbed cancers, including synovial sarcoma and <i>SMARCB1<\/i>-null cancers, degradation of BRD9 is hypothesized to result in an anticancer effect. CFT8634 is an orally bioavailable heterobifunctional degrader that induces ternary complex formation with BRD9 and an E3 ligase, leading to the ubiquitination of BRD9 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Here we describe the chemical structure of CFT8634 and an overview of the medicinal chemistry path leading to its discovery. <i>In vitro<\/i>, CFT8634 promotes rapid, potent, deep, and selective degradation of BRD9 with a half-maximal degradation concentration (DC<sub>50<\/sub>) of 2 nM in a synovial sarcoma cell line. In long-term growth assays, CFT8634 is effective at impairing cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner specifically in SMARCB1-perturbed contexts. <i>In vivo<\/i>, oral dosing of CFT8634 in xenograft models of SMARCB1-perturbed cancers leads to robust and dose-dependent degradation of BRD9, which translates to significant and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in preclinical xenograft models.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The preclinical data presented herein support the clinical development of CFT8634 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-null tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Epigenetics,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katrina L.
