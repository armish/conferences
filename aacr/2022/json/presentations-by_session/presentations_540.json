[{"Abstract":"Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in women and mainly develops in older women. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and deadly subtype of ovarian cancer and recently has been shown to arise from the distal end of the fallopian tube. About 96% of HGSC cases were found to contain mutations in TP53 and missense mutation was the most frequent type. It is known that TP53 mutation is an early event occurred in HGSC and may drive tumorigenesis. Different TP53 mutations have been reported to promote cell survival, metastatic potential or tumorigenicity. However, the roles of TP53 mutations and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been satisfactorily understood in HGSC. In order to functionally characterize TP53 mutations in a systematic approach, primary human fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs) from normal fallopian tube specimens were used. We isolated and transduced FTSECs with hTERT for extending cell lifespan. Afterwards, both overexpression and knock down experiments were performed. According to the IARC TP53 Database, we selected four TP53 hotspot mutations found in ovarian cancer patients for further investigation. The mutant TP53, including R175H, Y220C, R273C, and R273H, were expressed in FTSECs. Meanwhile, knock down was achieved by introducing shRNAs targeting TP53. The transduced cells were subjected to RNA sequencing experiments to identify the significantly influenced genes and signaling pathways. The candidate genes and pathways will be validated in FTSECs and a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional assays, such as cell viability assay, migration\/invasion assay, and metabolism assay, will be performed to study the effects of TP53 mutations. The results can provide further understanding of TP53 mutations and the downstream signaling in HGSC tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/a5296bf5-5ee1-43c1-9e1c-ba424efc9463\/@A03B8ZSn\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53 mutations,High-grade serous carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17803"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ya-Yun Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Denise Prosser<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liudmila Velikokhatnaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Anna Lokshin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The p63 protein, encoded by <i>TP63,<\/i> is a master regulator involved in many cell events including cell cycle, DNA damage, cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and cell death in different cancer types. &#916;Np63&#945; is the dominantly expressed isoform of p63 in squamous cell carcinomas, playing a critical role in tumorigenesis [3, 4]. However, the functional roles of &#916;Np63&#945; in ESCC have not been fully elucidated. Our results have revealed that &#916;Np63&#945; is highly expressed and up-regulated in ESCC. We have shown that &#916;Np63&#945; protein expression plays an oncogenic role in ESCC cells, depletion of which inhibits <i>in vitro <\/i>cell proliferation and colony formation and greatly suppresses <i>in vivo <\/i>tumor growth, in a panel of ESCC cell lines and our latest patient-derived organoid cultures, potentially in a differentiation-dependent manner. Glycolysis pathway and two novel downstream signaling pathways of &#916;Np63&#945;, MYC\/4EBP1 and AKT\/NDRG1, are significantly suppressed upon &#916;Np63&#945; depletion in ESCC cell lines. Notably, xenografts of &#916;Np63&#945;-depleted human ESCC cells show elevated infiltrating cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which may contribute to tumor suppression by &#916;Np63&#945; depletion. These data not only shed light on the &#916;Np63&#945; functions and how they contribute to the ESCC tumorigenesis, but also unravel potential therapeutic benefits for ESCC patients in the future.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that SMC4 regulates prostate carcinogenesis. However, its roles on regulation of prostate cancer development remain unclear. Our previous studies showed that the expression of SMC4 is increased in highly lung-metastatic prostate cancer cells, RM1-LM, an organ-specific metastasis cell line that we developed. To investigate the function of SMC4, <i>SMC4<\/i> gene was knockdown in RM1-LM cells by CRISPR\/Cas9 system. Knockdown of SMC4 significantly diminished the cancer cell growth in RM1-LM. In addition, transwell assay results showed that SMC4 knockdown in RM1-LM suppressed the cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we observed that SMC4 protein is important in the non-dividing phase of the cell cycle. In particular, cell cycle flow cytometry analysis indicated that SMC4 knockdown leaded to cell arrest in S phase. Finally, RM1-LM cells showed increased lung metastases compared with RM1-SMC4<sup>+\/-<\/sup> cells in a murine model. The H&#38;E and IHC results confirmed that RM1-LM cells induced greater number of lung metastases and colonization than RM1-SMC4<sup>+\/-<\/sup>cells, suggesting the loss of SMC4 suppressed prostate cancer metastasis. The interactome of SMC4 was uncovered through IP-MS and revealed that SMC4 may interacted with GLUT1, a key protein in glycolysis pathway. The ATP rate assay and Glycolysis rate assay illustrated a significantly metabolic switch existing in RM1-SMC4<sup>+\/-<\/sup>cells compared with their parental cells. Collectively, our study suggested that the interaction between SMC4 and GLUT1, confirmed by Co-IP, promotes prostate cancer cells metastasis via modifying the cell metabolism.

In all cases, FGFR1 kinase is constitutively phosphoactivated as a result of chromosome translocations, which lead to acquisition of dimerization motifs in the chimeric proteins. Recently, we demonstrated that these chimeric kinases could be cleaved by granzyme B to generate a truncated derivative, tnFGFR1, which localized exclusively into the nucleus and was not phosphorylated. Stem cell transduction and transplantation in syngeneic mice were used to assess the transforming ability of tnFGFR1 in bone marrow stem cells, and the results showed that tnFGFR1 can independently lead to oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. These leukemia cells show a mixed immunophenotype with a B-cell B220+Igm- profile in the majority of cells and Kit+ in virtually all cells, suggesting a stem cell disease. RPPA and RNA-Seq examination of the related signaling pathways and target genes revealed that tnFGFR1, however, does not activate classic FGFR1 downstream signaling pathways but induces a distinct profile of altered gene expression with significant upregulation of transmembrane signaling receptors including FLT3 and KIT. De novo human AML also expressed tnFGFR1 which correlates with upregulation of FLT3 and KIT as in mouse leukemia cells. ChIP analysis demonstrates tnFGFR1 occupancy at the Flt3 and Kit promoters, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation. Cells transformed with tnFGFR1 are insensitive to FGFR1 inhibitors but treatment of these cells with the Quizartinib (AC220) FLT3 inhibitor, suppresses in vitro growth and development of leukemia in vivo suggesting an alternative approach for treatment of SCLL. This study demonstrates a novel model for transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by chimeric FGFR1 kinases results with the combined effects of direct protein activation by the full-length kinases and gene regulation by the truncated nucleus derivative tnFGFR1, which is associated with GZMB expression levels. Genes significantly upregulated by tnFGFR1 include Flt3 and Kit which promote a leukemia stem cell phenotype. In human AML, tnFGFR1 activation leads to increased FLT3 and KIT expression, and higher FLT3 and GZMB expression levels are associated with inferior prognosis. These observations provide insights into the relative therapeutic value of targeting FGFR1 and FLT3 in treating AML with this characteristic gene expression profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 Oncogene growth factors and their receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1),FLT3,Kit tyrosine kinase,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17807"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Baohuan Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yating Chong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hualei Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Mori<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Atsuko Matsunaga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xuexiu Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Cowell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Tianxiang Hu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase, <i>RNF43<\/i>, has been reported to negatively regulate the Wnt signaling pathway. Although, <i>RNF43<\/i> mutations are frequently seen in CRC, its role in CRC from Middle Eastern ethnicity remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the frequency of <i>RNF43<\/i> mutations, the clinico-pathological and molecular associations in two independent cohorts of Middle Eastern CRC. Exome sequencing was utilized to identify the somatic mutations in <i>RNF43<\/i> gene and in known CRC driver genes including <i>APC<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i> and <i>NRAS <\/i>among 113 CRC cases of discovery cohort. In validation cohort of 107 CRC cases, Sanger sequencing was employed to detect the mutations in exon 2, 4, 8 and 9 in RNF43 gene while Targeted capture sequencing was conducted to identify the mutations in entire region of <i>APC<\/i> gene and hotspot regions of <i>KRAS, BRAF, NRAS <\/i>and <i>TP53 <\/i>genes. <i>RNF43<\/i> somatic mutations were found in 5.9% (13\/220) of the entire CRC cohort, which is similar in frequency to <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations, which were identified in 3.6% (8\/220). The mutations in other known driver genes including <i>APC, TP53, KRAS<\/i> and <i>NRAS<\/i> were observed in 58.2% (128\/220), 50.9% (112\/220), 46.4% (102\/220) and 2.7% (6\/220) cases, respectively, in all 220 tumors examined. However, no significant association between <i>RNF43 <\/i>mutations and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations was seen. <i>RNF43<\/i> was found to be inversely correlated to <i>APC<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations. Clinico-pathological analysis showed a strong association of <i>RNF43<\/i> mutations with right sided and sporadic deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC. No association was identified between <i>RNF43<\/i> mutation and other clinico-pathological features such as age, tumor histological subtype, tumor grade or patients&#8217; prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that dMMR status (Odds ratio = 5.43; 95% confidence interval = 1.12 - 26.32; p = 0.0356) and wild type <i>APC <\/i>(Odds ratio = 4.77; 95% confidence interval = 1.51 - 19.77; p = 0.0312) were independent predictors of RNF43 mutation. Our results revealed that <i>RNF43<\/i> mutations do occur in CRC from Middle Eastern ethnicity at comparable frequencies with BRAF mutations and represent a distinct molecular subtype which further enhance our understanding of how different mutational subsets of Wnt tumor suppressor genes link to distinct tumor characteristics, which might be considered for treatment strategies for CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/053288fb-3433-418b-8fb3-637f0c72e38c\/@s03B8ZSo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Mutations,Signaling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17809"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rong Bu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abdul K.

Sorafenib, however, is associated with severe drug adverse effects and drug resistance. Therefore, the strategies to improve the antineoplastic effects of sorafenib are urgently needed. In this study, we observed that metallothionein-1G (MT1G), was significantly activated by sorafenib and mediated sorafenib&#8217;s antineoplastic activity both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our study also proved that sorafenib effectively inhibited the activity of several critical enzymes required for maintaining methylation level in hepatoma cells to activate MT1G. In addition, the ATAC-seq results demonstrated that the promotor region of MT1G become more accessible upon the treatment of sorafenib, which may make a few key transcription factors easier to bind to the promoter region of MT1G to initiate the transcription. Finally, next-generation sequencing (NGS) results showed that the expression of two tumor associated genes: KLF4 and CA9, were significantly altered by MT1G overexpression. KLF4 was required to bind to the promotor region of CA9 and then inhibit the expression of CA9, a hypoxia-induced gene involved in modulating tumor microenvironment. The decrement of CA9 expression was related to hepatoma cells suppression. Taken together, we deduce that MT1G-KLF4-CA9 axis is a potential novel pathway to suppress hepatoma cell progression regulated by sorafenib. The regulation of MT1G-KLF4-CA9 is plausible to synergize with<br \/>sorafenib to improve the therapeutic effects.

Due to fragile economic situation in the middle east and lack of awareness, BC women are characterized by late diagnosis and thus, there is an urgent need for a cheap early prognostic tool. BC progression involves several genetic mutations via activating oncogenes or disrupting the functions of tumor suppressor genes, such as; <i>BRCA1, BRCA2<\/i>, <i>P53<\/i>. Mutation in these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and thereof, can be used as prognostic markers. High throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) with help of different bioinformatic analysis tools give massive data about deleterious mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, in this study we aimed to establish High Resolution Melting (HRM) technique as an economic prognostic tool for identifying deleterious mutations in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> and <i>P53<\/i> genes amongst familial and non-familial breast cancer patients.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Forty-eight breast cancer patients (15 Familial and 33 non-familial) and 2 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the present study. Genomic DNA was extracted from breast cancer tissues and screened using NGS to identify types of mutations in both <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> genes. All positive samples were screened for presence of mutations in BRCA 1(exon 19), BRCA2 (Exon 11F) and P53 (exon 5) using HRM. All samples were analyzed for identifying types of mutations using sanger sequencing.<br \/>Results: Our results identified 57 different mutations in the three genes. Deleterious mutations are identified as follows; 13 frameshift (c.5345delA (36.3%), c.5321delC (36%), c.5337delA (27.2%)) and 8 missense mutations (c.T5320C (36.3%), c.T5330W(A\/T) (27.2%)) in BRCA1 (Exon 19). 6 frameshift mutations (c.3528delA (27.2%)), 13 missense mutations (c.T3840G (72.7%), c.G3839K(G\/T) (27.2%)) and 6 synonymous mutations (c.A3895R (A\/G) (45.4%)) in BRCA2 (exon11F).

A substantial body of scientific evidence indicates that truncated APC is essential for CRC cell proliferation by maintaining beta-catenin levels and WNT signaling at the &#8220;just right&#8221; level (known as the &#8220;Just Right&#8221; Hypothesis). Thus, AXIN2 is of particular interest because both wild-type APC and AXIN2 are part of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which is essential for tumor-suppressing ability.<br \/>Hypothesis: the degree of AXIN2 expression, in the context of truncated APC, is critical to maintain WNT-signaling activity at the &#8220;just right&#8221; level which is optimal for CRC cell proliferation. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of AXIN2 levels in CRC cells that contain APC protein-truncating mutations on WNT signaling (Top Flash assay), expression of WNT-targeted genes, and CRC cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that modulating AXIN2 expression altered WNT signaling, expression of WNT-targeted genes, and CRC cell proliferation in CRC cell lines with different <i>APC-<\/i>truncation causing mutations. Indeed, western blot results showed that knock down of AXIN2 gene expression increased truncated-APC and AXIN1 protein expression, and decreased expression of several WNT-target genes (<i>e.g.<\/i> <i>LGR5<\/i>, <i>CD44<\/i>, <i>c-Jun<\/i>, <i>c-Myc<\/i>, <i>Cyclin D1<\/i>), particularly genes that have reported roles in cell cycle regulation. These findings were consistent with our independent bioinformatics analyses of NCI TCGA RNA-seq data on CRC patients. Overall, our study suggests that<i> i)<\/i> The beta-catenin destruction complex is still functional at a certain level despite <i>APC-<\/i>truncating mutations; <i>ii)<\/i> Perturbing <i>AXIN2 <\/i>expression leads to changes in WNT-signaling activity that deviate from a level that is &#8220;just right&#8221; for malignant cell proliferation, likely by affecting the function of the destruction complex; <i>iii)<\/i> Deviation from &#8220;just right&#8221; WNT signaling levels alters WNT-target gene expression and diminishes the ability of <i>APC<\/i>-mutant CRC cells to maintain uncontrolled proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/693ad6e4-b2a4-431b-af04-41a2fffd8643\/@s03B8ZSo\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Wnt signaling,Cancer stem cells,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/17813"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caroline O.

We have been developing molecular therapies targeting oncoproteins with their companion diagnostics as follows, i) To identify overexpressed genes in 120 lung cancers by gene expression microarray analysis of 27,648 genes, ii) To verify the candidate genes for their scarce expression in 23 normal organs, iii) To validate the clinicopathologic significance of their protein expression by tissue microarray covering hundreds of lung cancers including non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and iv) To examine whether they are important for the growth or invasion of cancer cells by using siRNAs and\/or small molecule inhibitors. By this screening system, we identified dozens of candidate target molecules and selected a gene encoding protein with a GAP domain, LAPG1 (lung cancer-associated protein with Gap domain 1). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LAPG1 expression was observed in 69.9% of lung cancers. Moreover positivity of LAPG1 expression was associated with poor prognosis for lung cancer patients. Knockdown of LAPG1 expression by siRNAs suppressed growth of lung cancer cells. Introduction of LAPG1 increased the invasive activity of mammalian cells, indicating that LAPG1 could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancers.

BRCA1 mutation carriers have a high risk for developing aggressive basal-like triple-negative breast cancers with EMT characteristics. It has been described that normal mammary epithelium of BRCA1-mutation carriers is comprised of aberrant luminal progenitor cell population resembling basal-like breast cancer cells. Yet, the role of BRCA1 in regulating epithelial cell plasticity in normal mammary gland remains largely obscure. <u>Aim:<\/u> Here, we used patient-derived normal and cancer organoid cultures from BRCA1-mutation carriers and noncarriers, to examine the effect of the BRCA1 mutation background on epithelial cell plasticity and the susceptibility to EMT.<br \/><u>Methods and results:<\/u> Mammary organoids were established from normal or cancer mammary tissues obtained from consenting patients undergoing lumpectomy or mastectomy. Isolated cells were plated in adherent basement membrane extract (BME) drops and overlaid with optimized organoid culture medium. EMT regulation in breast cancer is usually studied using cell lines and murine models. To determine the possibility to study EMT on patient-derived organoids, organoid culture media was optimized and established organoids were exposed to TGF&#946; to induce EMT. Morphological and phenotypic alterations were characterized using immunolabeling and visualization with confocal microscopy. Breast cancer organoids induced with TGF&#946; demonstrated EMT-like changes including the downregulation of E-Cadherin and upregulation of N-Cadherin. Moreover, breast cancer organoids showed typical cytoskeleton rearrangements. Here, the transformation from cortical actin into stress fibers formed in dedifferentiated mesenchymal cells, was visualized with actin staining.

The rationale for the new treatment approach described here for tumors with mutant <i>KRAS<\/i> arises from the critical antitumor role that we have uncovered for reactivating the DLC1 tumor suppressor protein, which is frequently downregulated in a wide range of human cancers. Although several mechanisms account for DLC1 downregulation, here we have focused on a subset of mutant <i>KRAS<\/i> lung tumor lines that express wild type DLC1 <i>mRNA<\/i> but lack detectable DLC1 protein. We have recently reported that cytoplasmic EZH2 protein directly methylates Lysine-678 of DLC1 protein leading to its ubiquitination by CUL-4A and consequently, proteasomal degradation. In this study, we have found a specific inhibitor of CRM1 protein (Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1, also known as Exportin 1 [XPO1]) substantially reduces cytoplasmic EZH2 level in several mutant KRAS lung cancer cell lines demonstrating that cytoplasmic EZH2 depends on its nuclear export by CRM1. CRM1, which is the major mammalian nuclear export regulator, is frequently overexpressed and\/or mutated in human cancer, including lung adenocarcinomas, and these phenotypes are associated with poor prognosis. Endogenous CRM1 and EZH2 protein colocalized and formed a complex in several lung cancer lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts implying the cancer relevance of this interaction. In addition to blocking the cytoplasmic export of EZH2, pharmacologic inhibition of CRM1 increased the steady-state level of DLC1 protein in several mutant KRAS lung cancer lines and patient-derived xenografts. The tumor suppressor activity of the post-translationally stabilized DLC1 protein was further increased by kinase inhibitors of AKT and SRC, which reverse the direct phosphorylation and attenuation of DLC1 tumor suppressor functions by these kinases. The three-drug combination of inhibitors of CRM1 (Selinexor), AKT (MK-2206), and SRC (Saracatinib), which is well-tolerated in mice, induced potent inhibition of tumor xenograft growth and was associated with induction of markers of apoptosis and senescence. Although each of these inhibitors has multiple targets, CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of DLC1 abolished most of the tumor growth inhibitory activity of the three-drug combination, strongly suggesting that DLC1 is the predominant target for the antitumor activity of the drug combination. Interestingly, <i>KRAS<\/i> siRNA knockdown phenocopied CRM1 inhibition, as it reduced cytoplasmic EZH2, DLC1 methylation, and DLC1 degradation. Our findings suggest CRM1 inhibitors, when given in conjunction with AKT and\/or SRC kinase inhibitors, may have clinical efficacy against lung tumors with mutant <i>KRAS<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/9dc4aad3-741b-46d4-96dd-e9ebafe92baf\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Nuclear oncoproteins and tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DLC-1,Tumor suppressor,KRAS,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18740"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brajendra K.

Due to the late stage of diagnosis, gastric cancer carries poor prognosis and poor overall survival. Infection with H. pylori is the strongest known risk factor. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4) belongs to a family of highly conserved tyrosine kinases. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of FGFR4 regulation in response to H. pylori infection.<br \/>Methods and Results: Among all the FGFRs, FGFR4 mRNA expression level was the most significantly elevated in human gastric cancer samples as compared to normal samples, using Real-time qPCR. These results were confirmed using the TCGA and Geo database analysis, confirming that FGFR4 is highly expressed in gastric cancer. Using western blot, we found that FGFR4 is significantly expressed in dysplasia and adenocarcinoma lesions in the TFF1-KO gastric cancer mouse model. Following infection with H. pylori in in-vitro (J166, 7.13) and in-vivo (PMSS1) models, we detected a significant increase in the expression of FGFR4 at the protein and mRNA levels. We also detected activation of STAT3 in human gastric cell lines and mice gastric tissues. Furthermore, analysis of FGFR4 promoter revealed several putative binding sites for STAT3. To confirm that FGFR4 expression is dependent upon STAT3 activation, we performed ChIP assay and confirmed direct functional binding of STAT3 on FGFR4 promoter. Using the FGF19, the ligand for FGFR4, we found that FGF19-FGFR4 axis played a vital role in activating STAT3 through an SRC-dependent mechanism and discovered that there is a feedforward activation loop between FGFR4 and STAT3. Functionally, we found that FGFR4 protected against H. pylori-induced DNA damage and cell death.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study established a feedforward activation loop between FGFR4 and STAT3 in response to H. pylori infection and FGFR4 could be a possible druggable moiety for future therapies in gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c8a9ac47-0d67-4aa9-b110-2c543d1b6112\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 Oncogene growth factors and their receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Tyrosine kinase receptors,Overexpression,Src,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18741"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nadeem S.

Here we explore another potential mechanism for p53 autorepression, regulation of zinc metabolism. Proper folding of p53 requires zinc binding and cancer-associated mutations in p53 often lower the affinity of the mutant proteins for zinc. Our previous work showed that ZMC1, a zinc metallochaperone, can reactivate certain p53 mutants by raising intracellular zinc concentrations. Here we show that p53 activates transcription of ZnT1. ZnT1 can then export zinc from the cell, which in turn lowers p53 activity.<br \/>Methods: To explore the relationship between ZnT1 and p53, we studied several human cancer cell lines under various conditions, including ZnT1 overexpression, ZnT1 silencing, and p53 activation. For silencing gene expression, we used CRISPR-Cas9 with a lentiviral vector to knock out ZnT1 and also employed shRNAs to knockdown expression of p53 or ZnT1. To analyze the relationship between TP53 and ZnT1 genes in clinical samples, data from cBioPortal were examined.<br \/>Results: ZnT1 transcription increased after p53 was activated in several p53+ cell lines but did not increase in isogenic p53-null cell lines, suggesting that ZnT1 transcription is dependent on p53. p53 also bound to the ZnT1 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and activated transcription of a ZnT1\/luciferase promoter fusion. Overexpression of ZnT1 decreased p21 transcription, indicating lowered p53 function; conversely, knockdown of ZnT1 increased p21 transcription. By cBioPortal analysis, <i>ZnT1<\/i> gene amplifications were mutually exclusive with <i>TP53<\/i> gene mutations in breast and lung tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: These data suggest that autorepression of p53 occurs in part due to lowered intracellular zinc caused by upregulation of ZnT1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ec8b75f9-0d34-41eb-9725-1830cd18e285\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Zinc,Zinc transporter,ZnT1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18743"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ben Brik<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kathleen Carino<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wade Narrow<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris R.

Inherited pathogenic mutations in <i>BRCA2<\/i> are associated with a 38%-84% risk for breast cancer and a 16.5%-27% risk for ovarian cancer. It is therefore critical to distinguish pathogenic mutations from sequence variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs). Among the VUSs that require clinical classification are those that could potentially disrupt normal splicing patterns. The challenge in determining the spliceogenic nature of a VUS is the ubiquity of naturally occurring alternative splicing variants. <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3, which encodes a binding site for the interacting proteins EMSY and PALB2, is frequently skipped during alternative splicing events to different levels in different cell types under different conditions. It is not yet known whether <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping is a regulated event contributing to the spectrum of <i>BRCA2<\/i> functions or is a stochastic occurrence. A genomic deletion that results in complete allelic loss of exon 3 has been shown to be pathogenic, yet VUSs that result in increased frequency of exon 3-skipping have been shown to be non-pathogenic. Thus, the allele-specific ability of <i>BRCA2<\/i> to contribute to DNA repair is affected by the level of exon 3-skipping. Alternative splicing patterns have also been observed in response to DNA damaging agents, potentially linking some therapies to risks from genome-wide aberrant splicing. In this study we explore the effects of the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin on the frequency of <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping. Isoform-specific end-point RT-PCR shows that doxorubicin increases the frequency of <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping in the breast cancer cell line MCF7.<br \/>Methods: MCF7 cells were treated with doxorubicin according to standard protocols. RNA was prepared using Qiagen reagents and amplified with Invitrogen One-Step RT-PCR reagents.

The mutant enzymes convert 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). R-2HG promotes cellular transformation by modulating the activities of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases (2OGDDs). The only functionally validated direct target of R-2HG is TET2, a 2OGDD myeloid tumor suppressor that catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Interestingly, in clonal myeloid disorders the patterns of IDH and TET2 mutations are vastly different. TET2 mutations occur at similar frequencies in both low- and high-grade disease. IDH mutations, on the other hand, are associated with higher-grade and blast-phase MPN and MDS and with <i>de novo<\/i> AML and are rare in CHIP and low-grade MDS. This suggests that mutant IDH promotes a more aggressive disease phenotype and that R-2HG has additional targets other than TET2 that contribute to its leukemogenic activity. To identify other 2OGDD myeloid tumor suppressors that could be contributing to R-2HG-mediated transformation, we performed a positive-selection CRISPR-Cas9 screen under cytokine-poor conditions in TF-1 cells. We identified three H3K4 histone lysine demethylases, <i>KDM5A, KDM5C<\/i> and <i>KDM5D<\/i>, as genes whose sgRNAs were enriched upon cytokine withdrawal. Triple knockout of <i>KDM5A, KDM5C<\/i> and <i>KDM5D<\/i> (TKO) in TF-1 cells induces robust cytokine independence as does treatment of TF-1 cells with KDM5c70, a KDM5 inhibitor. We further found that R-2HG is a more potent inhibitor of KDM5A, KDM5C and KDM5D than of TET2. We then assessed the effect of mutant IDH1 expression, TKO, R-2HG treatment and KDM5c70 treatment on H3K4 trimethylation by ChIP-seq and found that each of these perturbations results in a significant enrichment in H3K4me3 peaks relative to controls, with the same sites being enriched.<b> <\/b>We then asked if mutant IDH positivity is associated with increased levels of H3K4 methylation in glioma. We performed ChIP-seq on a panel of IDH wild-type and IDH mutant glioma MCTS lines and found H3K4me peaks to be highly enriched in the IDH mutant lines when compared to IDH wild-type lines. Trimethyl-H3K4 levels were likewise increased in isogenic normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells ectopically expressing mutant IDH1. Expression of mutant IDH or treatment KDM5 inhibitor was sufficient to cause increased colony formation in NHA cells relative to controls.<br \/>Collectively, these data suggest that R-2HG inhibits KDM5 histone lysine demethylases to promote mutant IDH-mediated transformation in AML and glioma. These studies identify a novel direct target of R-2HG in IDH mutant tumors and provide a functional link between IDH mutations and dysregulated histone lysine methylation in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/38083880-fc66-49f1-8a57-19b7d1b8b9a0\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Histone methylation,IDH1,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18745"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kathryn E.

Therapeutic activation of p73 can restore p53-signaling in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells effectively bypassing the p53 deficiency. In addition to pro-apoptotic signaling, outcomes of p73 activation contain survival signals and this may provide insights in cell fate outcomes between cell survival and apoptosis after cellular stress. We report that cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a master antiapoptotic factor, is a novel transcriptional target of p73. To test if p73 regulates c-FLIP expression in p53-deficient cancer cells, we overexpressed p73 in p53-deficient cancer cells using p73-adenovirus. Overexpression of p73 dramatically increased c-FLIP at the protein and RNA levels. The effect of p73 on c-FLIP upregulation was blocked by knock-down of p73. ChIP assay showed that p73 binds to the c-FLIP promoter in a p73-level dependent manner. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay showed that p73 increased the c-FLIP-L-promoter-mediated luciferase reporter expression in p53-deficient cancer cells. To test the effect of the outcomes of p73 signaling on cell survival or death, we performed cell viability assay and found that p73 reduces cell viability in a p73-level dependent manner. We found an increase of both p21 and c-FLIP at the protein levels in response to overexpression of p73 in p53-deficient cancer cells, but no cleaved-PARP was detected and flow cytometric analysis showed the cells were arrested in G1 phase. These results suggest that p73 arrests the cell cycle and prevents apoptosis at the tested levels of p73. We knocked down c-FLIP using siRNA in p53-deficient cancer cells, and found that knockdown of c-FLIP enhanced cleaved-PARP, cleaved caspase- 3 and -8 correlated to high level of apoptotic signaling with Noxa and puma upregulation in response to the overexpression of p73. Our results suggest that the depletion of c-FLIP primes cellular apoptosis switching from p73-induced cell cycle arrest (cell survival) and sensitizes cells to p73-induced apoptotic signals in p53-deficient cells. The cell fate decision following p73 activation is determined by the adjustment of the balance of outcomes of p73 activation between p73-induced pro-apoptotic signaling and c-FLIP expression in p53-deficent cancer cells. Our discovery of the new function of p73 to upregulate c-FLIP provides a rationale for depleting c-FLIP to improve antitumor efficacy of p73-targeting cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/97701ffe-2153-4537-bef8-831a9e285bb1\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p73,Apoptosis,Cell cycle arrest,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/18746"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shengliang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wafik S.

More than 50% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease with a dismal 3% five-year survival rate. There is clearly an urgent need to identify novel targets to treat pancreatic cancer patients. Transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) signaling is dysregulated during cancer progression, inhibiting tumorigenesis while promoting metastasis. Approximately half of pancreatic cancer patients have mutations of genes in the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway, including SMAD4, SMAD3, TGFBR1, TFGBR2, ACVR1B, and ACVR2A. ALK4 (Activin receptor-like kinase 4), which is encoded by ACVR1B, is a type I receptor in the TGF-&#946; superfamily. Mutation or copy number loss of ALK4 occurs in 34% of pancreatic cancer patients, while ALK4 expression is significantly down-regulated in many cancers, including pancreatic cancer, with low ALK4 expression associated with poor clinical outcomes. Here we demonstrate that loss of ALK4 increases cell migration and invasion, induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promotes local and distal metastasis in pancreatic cancer models. Loss of ALK4 unexpectedly increases activation of the canonical TGF-&#946; signaling pathway and significantly induces TGF-&#946;-mediated expression of EMT mediators and effectors. Moreover, ALK4 loss increases the cell surface expression of T&#946;Rs (TGF&#946; receptor type I and II), without changing the receptor gene expression, by increasing N-linked glycosylation of T&#946;Rs, potentially by altering Golgi morphology and function. Proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins induced by ALK4 loss identified galectin-3 (Gal-3) as upregulated. Gal-3 is known to be upregulated by MGAT5 (Alpha-1,6-Mannosylglycoprotein 6-Beta-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase) and cross-links MGAT5-modified N-glycans on T&#946;Rs at the cell surface, suppressing T&#946;Rs endocytosis. Consistent with this observation, loss of ALK4 increased MGAT5 mRNA expression and induced Gal-3 protein expression, suggesting that ALK4 might regulate T&#946;Rs stability by promoting lattice formation with Gal-3 and preventing internalization. Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of ALK4 increases T&#946;R receptor stability through regulating receptor glycosylation, activating TGF-&#946; signaling, promoting the EMT transition and cancer progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/777e6c82-a6fb-4f45-ab45-be73e50015a7\/@t03B8ZSp\/vod?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Tumor suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,TGF-&#946;,Glycosylation,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19922"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manqi Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerard Conrad Blobe<\/i><\/presenter>.

Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is one of six secreted proteins in the CCNs. It has been shown that Cyr61 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis in glioma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer, and others. However, Cyr61 has not yet been elucidated on the tumorigenesis, proliferation, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma, and needs to be researched and discovered. In this study, the HGF-mediated association of Cyr61, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and NF-&#954;B (Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and cancer cell proliferation and invasion were investigated in two types of hepatoma cell lines.<br \/>Methods: In this study, cell culture, cDNA microarray analysis, western blotting, Real-time Polymerase chain reaction, Zymography, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide<br \/>(MTT) assay, Cyr61 knock-down with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, Standard two chamber invasion assay.<br \/>Results: First, we confirmed that the expression level of Cyr61 was up-regulated by HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) in hepatoma cells. To identify associated pathway of HGF-induced Cyr61 about IL-8, NF-&#954;B expression, the cells were treated with PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor (LY294002) and then analyzed by Western blotting. The HGF-mediated IL-8 and NF-&#954;B levels were decreased with LY294002. The role for Cyr61 associated with IL-8 and NF-&#954;B was determined by knock down cell of Cyr61. Cyr61-sh RNA cells showed a decreased level of IL-8 and NF-&#954;B. HGF-mediated cell proliferation and invasion<i> <\/i>were decreased in Cyr61 knock down cell.<br \/>Conclusions: These results suggest that Cry61 plays an important role in cell proliferation and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma, and Cry61 may be a novel target for the prevention of progression and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/c15051c7-a822-4ee4-abcd-056cded55999\/@t03B8ZSp\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 Oncogene growth factors and their receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocyte growth factor,Cyr61,Cancer progression,Cancer invasion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19231"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jiyoon Jung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sungae Koh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyunghee Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jaeryong Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.
