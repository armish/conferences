Thus, uncovering features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that contribute to this differential response can inform candidates for novel therapies and biomarkers for patient stratification. Recent advances in single-cell technologies allow for profiling of cell states and their spatial interactions within a tumor. Here, we performed multiplexed immunofluorescence (mpIF), a method for <i>in situ<\/i> single-cell measurement of 30+ proteins, as well as bulk transcriptomics and genomics on 180 tumor samples across 4 immunotherapy-responsive and -resistant solid and liquid cancers: in-transit melanoma (ITM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). In aggregate, we measured over 100 million single cells and identified over 1,000 unique tumor and immune cell states. We uncovered immune-suppressive cell states, such as macrophages negative for PD-L1 and B7-H3 in immunotherapy-resistant ITM tumors and all GBM tumors, which generally fail to respond to immunotherapy. In GBM, macrophages exhibited two distinct spatial topologies, infiltrated or excluded. In ITM, we identified pre-treatment cell states and gene expression signatures that associate with immunotherapy response such as MHC class I expression on the tumor cell surface, B cell aggregates, &#8220;exhausted&#8221; PD-1\/LAG-3\/TIM-3 triple-positive CD8+ T cells, and expression of interferon-gamma genes. We observed a similar immune checkpoint-rich (PD-1\/LAG-3\/TIM-3 triple-positive) TME in all cHL tumors, which have remarkably high immunotherapy response rates. We spatially defined the microniche (30-micron radius neighborhood) of &#8220;exhausted&#8221; CD8+ T cells, and within the microniches, found antigen presentation competent tumor cells, proliferating T cells, and B7-H3 positive macrophages, which together contribute to an activated TME. Together, we present a statistical workflow for the integrated analysis of spatially resolved multidimensional data for cancer target discovery that is tailored towards application in routinely collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancer biospecimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Tumor microenvironment,Glioblastoma multiforme,Hodgkin's lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maryam Pourmaleki<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caitlin J.

To comprehensively capture LUAD neoplastic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 257,481 enriched epithelial cells (EPCAM+ sorting) from 16 early-stage LUADs, each with 3 matched normal lung (NL) samples at defined spatial proximities to the tumor (n=47). 29,076 LUAD-derived cells clustered by patient and harbored distinct gene expression features (e.g., oxidative stress response), signifying interpatient LUAD heterogeneity. We also identified, using whole exome sequencing (WES) of matching lung and germline control samples, recurrent oncogenic driver alterations (e.g., <i>EGFR, TP53, KRAS)<\/i>. Transcriptomic features of malignant cells were shared between LUADs (e.g., loss of lineage-specific gene expression) or private such as those associated with driver mutation status (e.g., <i>KRAS<\/i>). Indeed, clusters of malignant cells were overall segregated based on driver mutations (e.g., <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>). Malignant cells from <i>KRAS-<\/i>mutant LUADs (KM-LUADs) had increased activation of NF-kB, estrogen and hypoxia signaling, comprising a unique gene module (GM) that correlated with a less differentiated state. We also found hallmark pathways (cholesterol metabolism, DNA replication, cell fate decision) specific to <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUADs (EM-LUADs). Notably, cells from one EM-LUAD and its 3 multiregion NL tissues clustered closely and had activated pro-tumor lymphoid signatures (CD4 na&#239;ve, Treg). Mutation burden increased with tumor proximity and intriguingly, <i>EGFR<\/i> exon20 mutation was evident in the tumor (VAF = 0.29) and its most proximal NL (VAF = 0.05), signifying a mutational <i>field<\/i> effect. Copy number variations (CNVs) derived from WES of all samples were overall consistent with those inferred from scRNA-seq data. Relative to EM-LUADs, malignant cells from KM-LUADs displayed lower CNV burdens. Interpatient CNV heterogeneity was prominent even among LUADs harboring the same oncogenic drivers. Notably, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) was high among epithelial cells within single regions from the same LUAD. Among LUADs, malignant cell clades with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations and lower CNV scores displayed less differentiated states. To investigate biological pathways driving ITH, we derived 6 GMs with tumor-relevant functional features, including a transcription\/translation regulation GM that consistently correlated with reduced differentiation. Our analysis of a large number of lung epithelial cells from LUAD patients reveals in-depth insights into LUAD taxonomy which can help identify epithelial heterotypes, unravel the continuum of early differentiation events and expand our understanding of early LUAD pathogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor evolution,single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq),Intratumoral heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guangchun Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ansam Sinjab<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dapeng Hao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enyu Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luisa M.

However, current strategies in targeting key driver mutations such as <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>SMAD4<\/i>, have found limited translational success. As a result, the standard of care for PDAC patients continues to rely on cytotoxic chemotherapies. Master regulator (MR) proteins integrate upstream genomic alterations to generate a common downstream transcriptional signature characteristic of a tumor cell population. Importantly, aberrant MR protein activity is requisite to implementing and maintaining a pro-tumor state. Therefore, MR proteins serve as critical tumor dependencies and represent a promising class of therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a novel, network-based approach to identify top MR proteins by utilizing a combination of ARACNe (Margolin et al, 2006) and VIPER (Alvarez et al, 2016) algorithms for the analysis of single-nuclei transcriptomic data. Specifically, we used VIPER to investigate the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to characterize the tumor sub-populations that co-exist in a patient PDAC specimen. Clustering analysis based on protein activity revealed six populations in the TME. The SingleR classifier subsequently annotated these clusters as myeloid and lymphoid immune, fibroblast, neuroendocrine, epithelial, and putative tumor cells. Next, we validated the putative tumor cells by performing InferCNV which detected widespread chromosomal copy number variations. We identified two distinct tumor subpopulations which were found to be enriched by the MR signatures of the Oncogenic Precursor (OP) and Lineage subtypes, previously demonstrated to represent more and less differentiated tumor cell populations, respectively (Laise et al, 2020). Interestingly, top MR proteins identified for the putative tumor cells using the single-nuclei transcriptomics closely corresponded with those identified by single-cell and previous bulk transcriptomics, providing orthogonal validation for the inferred protein activities. We characterized the diverse cell populations in the PDAC TME, delineated two distinct tumor cell subtypes, and demonstrated high concordance of inferred MR protein activity at the single-cell, single-nuclei, and bulk levels. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying systems biology-based methods to identify MR proteins in an N = 1 context and represent a novel precision medicine approach in the treatment of PDAC patients. Future lines of inquiry center on identifying treatments against each tumor subpopulation via OncoTreat, an algorithm that leverages high-throughput drug perturbation data to predict effective therapies based on inferred ability to invert MR protein activity (Alvarez, 2018).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Systems biology,Precision medicine,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jinjie Ling<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lorenzo Tomassoni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alvaro Curiel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth Olive<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrea Califano<\/i><\/presenter>.

Previous DLP-driven clonal evolution studies removed S-phase cells as replicated loci confounded phylogenetic inference from somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs), leaving single-cell replication timing (scRT) as an unstudied property. We thus developed a method that assigned S-phase cells to phylogenetic clones and used such assignments to infer scRT profiles in aneuploid cell lines and tumors. We applied this method to determine the relative proliferation rate between clones and obtain a single-cell picture of DNA replication fork progression for genomically unstable cancers.<br \/><i>Methods: <\/i>S-phase cells were assigned to phylogenetic clones based on copy number profile similarity and subsequently scRT profiles were inferred by normalizing out the effects of clonal, subclonal, and cell-specific CNAs before binarizing each genomic bin as replicated or unreplicated. scRT heterogeneity was quantified via a summary statistic representing the aggregate difference between expected and observed replication times (T-width). The scRT profiles were grouped into clone- and sample-level pseudobulks (aggregations of single cells) to determine genomic regions with differential replication timing. We then assessed the ability of S-phase enrichment to predict clonal expansions on time-series patient-derived xenografts of HER2+ and triple negative breast cancers that were either treatment-naive or exposed to cisplatin. In addition, we studied genetically engineered cell lines with inactivated DNA damage response genes (TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2) and primary high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples to quantify scRT heterogeneity at different states of genomic instability.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>We analyzed 15 datasets containing over 25,000 cells with ~1\/3 of cells in S-phase. Time-series datasets revealed that S-phase enriched clones were highly proliferative in the treatment-naive setting and were most sensitive to cisplatin. T-width values calculated from inferred scRT profiles increased as a function of genomic instability, with the degree of heterogeneity varied between genomic regions. Clone-level pseudobulk replication timing profiles revealed that whole-chromosome aneuploidies were more likely to have unperturbed replication timing compared to complex structural variants such as translocations, inversions, and micronuclei.<br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>Our time-series results show that S-phase cells enable the prediction of clone-specific proliferation and chemosensitivity using scWGS data from a single time point.

Conversely, spatial transcriptomics (ST) assays can profile spatial regions in tissue sections but do not have single cell genomic resolution. To address this issue, computational approaches (e.g., cell2location, RCTD) have been designed to deconvolute ST spots into proportions of different cell types. However, the spatial deconvolution method has the following limitations, 1) it can only infer cell type proportions of each spot and cannot reach higher granular \"cell states\" mapping; 2) it only predict categorical labels and cannot infer continuous cell information (e.g., lineage trajectories, gene signatures, continuous phenotypes) at a spatial resolution.<br \/>Here, we developed a computational approach called CellTrek that combines these two datasets to achieve single cell spatial mapping. Using a machine learning-based metric learning approach, CellTrek learned a cell-spot graph and then transfer spatial coordinates to cells. The CellTrek toolkit also provides two downstream analysis modules, including SColoc for spatial colocalization analysis and SCoexp for spatial co-expression analysis.<br \/>We benchmarked CellTrek using a simulation and two in situ datasets. We then applied CellTrek to reconstruct cellular spatial structures in existing datasets from normal mouse brain and kidney tissues. We also performed scRNA-seq and ST experiments on two ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tissues and applied CellTrek to identify subclones that were restricted to different ducts, and specific T cell states adjacent to the tumor areas.<br \/>Our data shows that CellTrek can accurately map single cells in diverse tissue types to resolve their spatial organization into cellular neighborhoods and tissue structures. This method provides a new paradigm that is distinct from ST deconvolution, enabling a more flexible and direct investigation of single cell data with spatial topography.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-06 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Bioinformatics,DCIS,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Runmin Wei<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siyuan He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanshan Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emi Sei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alastair Thompson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ken Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Savitri Krishnamurthy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicholas Navin<\/i><\/presenter>.

We present a novel bioinformatics pipeline to infer molecular changes from tumor and immune cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) from ST data. Latent space methods enable inference of biological patterns from ST without the need for spot deconvolution into cell-based spatial features. While linear latent space methods yield interpretable biological patterns, interactions between tumor and immune cells can be nonlinear. To enable comprehensive inference of the pathways in the TME, we developed novel algorithms to characterize biological patterns from ST data using linear latent space methods and further nonlinear effects from their interactions. For any given set of genes, the <i>patternSpotter<\/i> tool visualizes the spatial variation in the relative contribution of individual patterns to the aggregate expression at each location in the tumor sample. Application of this tool to latent features identified using CoGAPS non-negative matrix factorization on a Visium ST (10x Genomics) data from a lymph node with pancreatic cancer metastasis confirms its known immune cell architecture. Furthermore, we develop a <i>patternMarker <\/i>algorithm to identify sets of coexpressed genes associated with the patterns, which help us to pinpoint the underlying biological processes and cell types. Further analyzing a breast cancer sample with invasive carcinoma and multiple precursor lesions demonstrates that this approach can uncover tumor and immune regions without prior reliance on pathology annotations from H&#38;E imaging. In this case, an ensemble-based factorization of multiple dimensions enhances our resolution of intra-tumor heterogeneity and identifies distinct hormone receptor pathways in different precursor lesions with the <i>patternMarker<\/i> algorithm. Additional latent features are associated with immune cells, revealing further heterogeneity in immune infiltration between the invasive carcinoma and distinct precursor lesions. Still, the molecular interactions resulting from this infiltration induce a further non-linear alteration to transcription not captured through the inferred latent spaces. To resolve this, we develop a further <i>interactionMarker<\/i> statistic to identify regions of inter-pattern interaction and the associated genes. We apply this approach to detect additional intra-tumor heterogeneity in immune signaling from infiltration suggestive of differences in immune attack of invasive lesions. Altogether, our pipeline for latent space analysis of ST can identify the location and context-specific molecular interactions within the TME, broadly applicable to a better understanding of the key drivers of tumorigenesis and resistance to immune attack in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 New algorithms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Lymph nodes,Breast cancer,Statistical approach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Atul Deshpande<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melanie Loth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dimitrios Sidiropoulos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>QingFeng Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Genevieve Stein-O'Brien<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>NIkhil Rao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cedric Uytingco<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Williams<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cesar Santa-Maria<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniele M.

A series of manuscripts describing an extensive array of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and imaging datasets are emerging but careful curation is required to maximize the data&#8217;s utility. HTAN centers have generated data from over 30 assay types including more than a dozen imaging methods (e.g., fluorescence microscopy, metal-tagged imaging, digital pathology, spatial transcriptomics, and electron microscopy). The HTAN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) develops infrastructure and tools to ingest, curate, explore, and share these data in a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) manner. As of November 2021 the DCC had ingested over 150 TB of data, including nearly 150,000 imaging data files. HTAN metadata schemas were developed through a community-driven Request for Comments process, including schemas for raw, processed and QC-checked imaging data, segmentation masks and feature arrays. This work led to a set of Minimum Information for Highly Multiplexed Tissue Imaging (MITI) guidelines, which are complemented by detailed metadata on participants and biospecimens. The Schematic python package is used to provide a user-friendly interface for defining data-model schemas, generate (meta)data submission spreadsheets, and asset-store interfaces on various cloud platforms. Across assay types, the HTAN schema currently encompasses over 700 attributes from 35 components. The DCC manages the HTAN Data Portal, which provides community access to the atlases and enables filtering of released atlas data based on metadata fields, and pointers to data availability. To enable visualization and exploration of imaging data directly from the portal, centers can submit Minerva stories, which provide guided storytelling of multiplexed tissue images. We provide methods to automatically generate default stories with visually appropriate overlays of sequential four-channel groups. We developed Miniature to generate unsupervised and interpretable multiplexed image thumbnails to provide rapid contextual information when browsing image collections. Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce a multiplexed image pyramid to three dimensions. Pixels are recolored according to their coordinates in low-dimensional space, where Pixels with similar marker expression are assigned similar colours. Public data sharing requires careful consideration of data egress costs and de-identification of images and their metadata. The DCC is working closely with NCI Cancer Research Data Commons to ensure long term-legacy and reuse of HTAN data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adam J.
