[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction and Objectives: <\/b>Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) plays a crucial role in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression in bladder cancer (BCa) development. Previously, we reported on a monoclonal murine antibody (HL2401) towards CXCL1 which was capable of inhibiting growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. Herein, we have developed a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody neutralizing CXCL1 (NTC-001). This study is final step in pre-clinical stage. In this study, we aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of the antibody to move into phase 1 clinical trials in near future.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We humanized mouse anti-human CXCL1 antibody resulting in NTC-001, and then tested for the following: molecular weight and pH, specificity, binding affinity to ligand and to albumin, ability to inhibit in vitro angiogenesis, ability to inhibit cellular proliferation alone or with chemotherapy, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>NTC-001 had a molecular weight of 150kD, and was an acidic antibody (pH5.1). NTC-001 specifically bound human CXCL1 in both WB and ELISA. NTC-001 was bound to albumin and had minimal hepatic metabolism. NTC-001 significantly inhibited tube formation in HUVEC, and more efficiently with the formulation. NTC-001 significantly inhibited T24 cell proliferation (p&#60;0.001). Inhibitory effect of NTC-001 on cell proliferation was correlated with the levels of CXCL1 expression in BCa cell lines. Compared to CXCL1 expression-low group (RT112 and UMUC-14), CXCL1 expression-high group (T24, 5637, 253J, 253J-BV) tended to show low IC50. Synergistic combination efficacy was observed in NTC-001 in combination with gemcitabine (combination index&#60;1) though not with cisplatin. PK study demonstrated a half-life of 324 hours and 18 hours in CD-1 and NSG-SGM3, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>NTC-001 is a first in class humanized neutralizing monoclonal antibody towards CXCL1, and could be a promising therapeutic agent in BCa. We are going to proceed to complete our investigational new drug enabling studies in both small and large animals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/03fca782-d859-4d84-942b-1a7c337aa1ee\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Anticancer therapy,CXCL1,Preclinical model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16890"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kaoru Murakami<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuka Sasaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hideki Furuya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Charles Rosser<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, many patients do not respond to treatment with the so far available therapeutics, others for limited time only. Various tumor immune evasion mechanisms have been reported to counteract efficiency of T cell engaging therapeutics. Thrombocytes have recently been described to affect cancer biology by mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor invasion, metastasis and notably also immune evasion. Here we report that, upon treatment of prostate cancer patients within a clinical trial evaluating a novel PSMAxCD3 bsAb (NCT04104607), we observed profound treatment-associated platelet activation, mirrored by a decrease of total platelet count. Upon modelling the treatment setting, we found that platelet activation significantly reduced bsAb-mediated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity as revealed by impaired T cell activation, reduced secretion of perforin and ultimately inhibition of target cell lysis. The immunosuppressive effect mediated by platelets occurred in a TGF&#946;-dependent manner and was not restricted to the PSMAxCD3 bsAb, but was also observed with various other CD3-directed bispecific constructs including the clinically approved CD19xCD13 bsAb Blinatumomab. BsAb-mediated T cell reactivity could generally be restored by inhibiting platelets using dabigatran, but also specifically by blocking the TGF&#946; axis. Together, our findings unravel that platelets undermine the efficacy of T cell-recruiting bsAb and identify modulation of platelet function and TGF&#946; as means to reinforce the effectiveness of bsAb treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/20edefa9-4c6a-475a-ae67-805cfa01384a\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Platelets,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16891"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martina S.

However, about half of the patients in CR show remaining minimal residual disease (MRD), which constitutes the basis for relapse. With the aim to eradicate MRD and thus improve long-term survival in AML, we recently conducted a phase I trial evaluating safety\/tolerability and preliminary efficacy of an Fc-optimized antibody targeting CD135\/FLT3 (FLYSYN, NCT02789254) to induce NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity. This trial enrolling AML patients in CR with detectable MRD revealed that FLYSYN is safe and well tolerated, with about 45% of patients achieving a molecular response after treatment with the target dose (Heitmann et al., <i>Blood<\/i> 2020). Besides by reinforcing the ADCC-inducing capability of antibodies, NK cell immunity can be further increased by cytokines like IL-15, and multiple efforts presently aim to exploit the latter cytokine for cancer treatment. However, clinical efficacy of IL-15 so far is limited as systemic application causes substantial side effects due to unspecific immune activation (Conlon et al, JCO 2015). To overcome this limitation, we aimed to develop an immunocytokine consisting of our Fc-optimized CD135 mAb fused to IL-15. However, the activity of the cytokine moiety within classical ICs does not depend on antigen binding, and thus application of clinically effective doses is still prevented by toxicity due to unspecific immune activation. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of the unique mechanism of action of IL-15, which stimulates IL-15R&#946;\/&#947; on cytotoxic lymphocytes as membrane-bound complex with IL-15R&#945; on monocytes and DCs (trans-presentation) and generated an IL-15 mutant with abolished IL-15R&#945; binding. The latter allows to substitute physiological trans-presentation by binding of the construct to the target antigen, thereby limiting side effects. Functional analysis using primary AML cells as targets revealed that our modified immunocytokine (MIC135) induced target-restricted NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity in a profoundly greater extent than the Fc-optimized FLYSYN antibody. Notably, in stark contrast to FLYSYN, MIC135 induced prominent NK cell proliferation, and target cell killing upon treatment with MIC135 was likewise clearly superior. Analyses regarding off-target toxicity confirmed the target-antigen restricted efficacy of MIC135 compared to anti-CD135 immunocytokine with wildtype IL-15 (IC135). Furthermore, our MIC135 did not induce unwanted effects against healthy FLT3 expressing cells. Taken together, MIC135 induces NK cell reactivity against leukemia cells in a highly target cell-restricted manner and displays higher efficacy than Fc-optimized antibodies, thus constituting a promising treatment option for AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/8bfda4b0-6c19-43fd-8fe5-3f0aef44623b\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody engineering,Immunotherapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16895"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martina S.

One strategy to reduce CRS is subcutaneous dosing, which is hypothesized to mitigate CRS by reducing the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) and preserve efficacy by maintaining the same minimum drug concentration (Cmin) as intravenous dosing. Although promising for mitigating CRS, this approach is limited by its increased immunogenicity risks. A T cell engager designed to be dosed intravenously but engineered to mimic the PK properties of subcutaneous dosing could alleviate CRS without increasing immunogenicity. Here we describe TriTAC-XR, a platform of T cell engager prodrugs designed to become slowly activated in systemic circulation. This extended-release mechanism results in a slow build-up of circulating active drug and minimizes the Cmax\/Cmin ratio, similar to subcutaneous dosing. TriTAC-XR prodrugs were engineered by adding a peptide mask and protease-cleavable linker to the N-terminus of a TriTAC, a constitutively active and half-life extended T cell engager. The mask binds to the anti-CD3&#949; domain and inhibits T cell binding. Upon cleavage by systemic proteases, active T cell engager is released. In vitro, TriTAC-XR has markedly reduced binding to recombinant CD3&#949; protein and to primary T cells as well as reduced potency in functional T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assays compared to its unmasked active drug. In cynomolgus monkeys, TriTAC-XRs targeting multiple tumor antigens resulted in a gradual build-up of active drug during the first week post dose and significantly lower Cmax\/Cmin ratios than comparable constitutively active TriTACs. Modeling based on these PK data predicts that TriTAC-XR dosed intravenously will result in a slower build-up of active drug and smaller Cmax\/Cmin ratios than TriTAC dosed intravenously or subcutaneously. Cytokine release and target cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys were used to compare the therapeutic index of TriTAC-XR to TriTAC. A single dose of FLT3-targeting TriTAC-XR resulted in 100-fold protection in cytokine release and similar FLT3 expressing cell depletion when compared to an equivalent FLT3-targeting TriTAC. Similarly, repeat dosing of a TriTAC-XR targeting B cells resulted in complete B cell depletion with substantially lower cytokines than a comparable TriTAC. TriTAC-XR is expected to improve the safety of T cell engagers by reducing CRS and may increase clinical dosing convenience by enabling higher doses that will extend dosing intervals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cc95e9d2-dde8-4505-b45f-8ebbd87b96b9\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Prodrugs,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16892"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Kathryn Strobel Kwant<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sony S.

However, most patients still have not responded to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Thus, it is still urgent to find novel treatments for patients who have no response to ICI and acquire ICI resistance. We previously suggested that contactin 4 (CNTN4), known initially to act as an axon guidance molecule during neural development, is a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint protein. In addition, we confirmed that CNTN4 is highly expressed on the various types of human tumor tissue, and anti-CNTN4 antibodies, GENA-104A07 and GENA-104A11, show the anti-tumor efficacy by enhancing T cell activity. In the present study, we describe the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) expressed on T cells as a binding partner of CNTN4 and the preclinical characterization of GENA-104A16 as an immune-oncology drug candidate targeting CNTN4. Firstly, we investigated the APP expression on T cells and found that APP was detected in T cells' membrane and cytosolic fraction. Its expression level was higher on activated T cells. In addition, we observed that the immune-suppressive activity of CNTN4 on APP KO T cells was significantly decreased compared with APP WT T cells, which means APP as a binding partner of CNTN4 is a core molecule for transmitting immunosuppressive signal of CNTN4 to T cells. GENA-104A16 is a humanized antibody and binds to human and mouse CNTN4 with high binding affinity, which is matured from GENA-104A07 and GENA-104A11. In the <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays, GENA-104A16 showed the improved effects on the restoration of T cell proliferation and activation (i.e., inflammatory cytokine releases from T cells and T cell activity-related signaling cascade) suppressed by CNTN4 and on CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)-mediated killing for human cancer cell lines expressing CNTN4. In line with these effects, GENA-104A16 produced higher anti-tumor effects than GENA-104A11 in the CT26 syngeneic mouse colon cancer model. To identify the<i> in vivo<\/i> immune modulatory function of GENA-104A16, we analyzed the proportion of tumor-infiltrated T cells, Treg cells, and T cell subsets expressing perforin and granzyme B in CT26 tumor tissues. As a result, the population of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing perforin or granzyme B tended to increase in the tumors of GENA-104A16 treated mice while decreasing the FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>CD25<sup>+<\/sup> Treg population. Interestingly, GENA-104A16 treatment showed better anti-tumor effects together with the elevated level of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing perforin and granzyme B than atezolizumab treatment. Overall, these preclinical studies demonstrate that GENA-104A16 is a promising blocking antibody for CNTN4-mediated immune suppression and can serve as an effective immune-oncology drug for patients with cancer that highly express CNTN4.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4e3608b0-a60a-4003-8937-23f3c3b21f8d\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,Antibody,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16894"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mi Young Cha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunkyung Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bu-Nam Jeon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunuk Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Youngeun Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yunyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joo-Yeon Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soojung Moon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hyunseong Youn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Han-sol Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kyung Mi Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hansoo Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the advances achieved by their introduction in cancer treatment, an urgent medical need remains to improve and optimize the efficacy of antibody therapy. This may be achievable using the cytokine IL-15 which induces proliferation and activation of both, NK cells and CD8 T cells, and enhances their cytolytic capacity. So far, short half-life, poor accumulation at the tumor site and severe toxicity upon systemic application due to unspecific immune activation prevent the broad use of IL-15 for treatment of cancer patients (Conlon <i>et al<\/i>, JCO 2015). IL-15 predominantly acts as part of an immunological synapse with IL-15R&#945; expressed on antigen-presenting cells, which present IL-15 in trans to IL-15R&#946;&#947; receptor expressing cytotoxic lymphocytes. We here report on the generation of so called &#8220;modified immunocytokines&#8221; (MICs) which consist of an Fc-optimized (SDIE modification) CD19 or CD20 antibody for targeting of (malignant) B cells fused to an IL-15 mutant with abolished binding to IL-15R&#945; termed MIC19 or MIC20. The abrogation of IL-15R&#945; binding by the IL-15 mutation enables substitution of the physiological trans-presentation by target binding of the antibody, allowing for target antigen-restricted stimulation of the IL-15R&#946;&#947; on NK cells and CD8 T cells. Analyses of activation and toxicity with MIC19 compared to a CD19 immunocytokine with an unmodified IL-15 (IC19) or immunocytokines with unrelated specificity as control confirmed target antigen-restricted function of the MIC proteins. Killing of autologous and allogeneic CD19<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD20<sup>+<\/sup> target cells was clearly superior as compared to the CD19-directed Fc optimized antibody (Tafasitamab) and Rituximab that bear no cytokine activity. Compared to antibody treatment, the MIC proteins induced a pronounced and long-lasting proliferation of effector cells and were effective to treat leukemia in a xenograft (Nalm-6) leukemia mouse model. Anti-leukemic activity was further confirmed in a murine NSG xenotransplantation model using patient ALL cells and human NK cells as effectors. In summary, MIC constructs consisting of an Fc-optimized antibody and mutated IL-15 with deficient IL-15R&#945; binding induce target cell restricted activation and proliferation of NK cells, resulting in efficient anti-leukemic activity. Our MICs thus combine the benefits of Fc-optimized antibodies and IL-15 activity and constitute a promising novel treatment modality for B cell malignancies with low side effects that allow the application of truly effective doses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/50b65e19-87f4-4379-b073-e482aa1425a8\/@D03B8ZGb\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immunocytokine,IL-15,B cell malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16896"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ilona Hagelstein<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Latifa Zekri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boris Klimovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina S.

So far, short half-life, poor accumulation at the tumor site and severe toxicity upon systemic application limit IL-15 efficacy in patients. Fusion of IL-15 to antibodies directed to tumor antigens (classical immunocytokines, ICs) improves on accumulation at the tumor site and pharmacokinetics. However, since the activity of the cytokine moiety within classical ICs does not depend on antigen binding, the application of clinically effective doses is still prevented by toxicity due to unspecific immune activation. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of the unique mechanism of action of IL-15 which stimulates IL-15R&#946;\/&#947; on NK and T cells as a membrane-bound complex with IL-15R&#945; on monocytes and DCs (trans-presentation). We used an Fc-optimized antibody directed to CLEC12A, a surface antigen abundantly expressed on AML cells and leukemic stem cells but not on healthy stem cells. This antibody termed 33C2-SDIE was fused to an IL-15E46K mutant with abolished binding to IL-15R&#945;, allowing to substitute physiological trans-presentation of IL-15 by binding of the construct to its tumor-expressed target. Antigen-specific binding of the resulting modified immunocytokine (MIC12) was confirmed using multiple CLEC12A-expressing cell lines and primary AML samples from patients. Functional analysis of activation, cytokine release, and target cell lysis demonstrated that MIC proteins, in contrast to classical IC, stimulate cytotoxic lymphocytes in a highly target cell-restricted manner, allowing for the desired reduction of unspecific immune activation. At the same time, significantly superior NK cell reactivity against AML cells as compared to even the Fc-optimized antibody was observed. Both, IL-15 signaling and engagement of Fc-receptors by the optimized Fc-domain were found to be essential for optimal activity of our MIC constructs. Importantly, only treatment with MIC12 was capable to induce NK cell proliferation, which is required to overcome unfavorable target to effector ratios that prevail in overt cancer disease. In summary, our novel CLEC12A-targeting immunocytokine allows for tumor-restricted stimulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and reduced toxicity while displaying superior anti-leukemic activity and constitutes a promising compound for the treatment of AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/4ded047f-1ddd-423e-8819-22203afcf576\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Acute myeloid leukemia,Natural killer cells,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16897"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Boris Klimovich<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Leonard Anton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yangmi Lim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonghwa Won<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Chashchina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Pflügler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Latifa Zekri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gundram Jung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helmut R.

B7-H3 (CD276) is a member of the B7 immune checkpoint family. Initially thought to act as co-stimulator, recent studies revealed that B7-H3 rather has an inhibitory role for T cells and contributes to tumor immune evasion. Clinically, its overexpression has been linked to invasive and metastatic potential as well as poor prognosis. Due to its expression on both, tumor cells and tumor vasculature, in a variety of cancer entities including colorectal cancer, B7-H3 attracted our interest as therapeutic target for T cell-recruiting bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). We postulate that &#8220;dual targeting&#8221; of both, the cancer cells and the tumor vasculature may support the influx of T cells into the tumor site, a critical prerequisite for successful immunotherapy of solid tumors allowing for subsequent destruction of antigen-positive malignant cells. We generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed to different epitopes of the B7-H3 molecule. After biochemical characterization, we selected two antibodies with distinct binding proprieties and subsequently used them for the construction of Tcell-recruiting B7-H3xCD3 bsAbs in an IgG-based (IgGsc) format. To reduce side effects, constructs were cloned using a UCHT-1 derived low affinity anti-CD3 sequence. In vitro characterization using colorectal and other carcinoma cells allowed for selection of a construct with optimal functional properties (thereafter termed CC-3) as revealed by target cell-restricted induction of T cell activation, proliferation and tumor cell killing<i>.<\/i> <i>In vivo, <\/i>potent efficacy of CC-3 was documented in a lung metastasis model and by its ability to eliminate large established flank tumors using immunocompromised NSG mice adoptively transferred with human effector cells. Despite the high therapeutic efficacy of CC-3, no toxicity was observed in the absence of target cells. In summary, CC-3 is a bsAb with promising therapeutic activity against B7-H3 positive tumors. GMP compliant production of CC-3 is presently ongoing to enable evaluation in a clinical &#8220;first in human&#8221; study in patients with colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/d400606c-0995-4ba6-95b9-f4da9e9cf7ba\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,colon cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16898"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Latifa Zekri<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina S.

They can also promote tumor growth by suppressing the function of effector CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, Tregs are identified as one of the key resistance mechanisms hampering the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across many tumor types. Therefore, there is a high need for safe and effective agents that would specifically deplete tumor-infiltrating Tregs while sparing both peripheral Tregs and effector T cells.<br \/>Chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) is predominantly expressed on activated tumor-infiltrating Tregs and marks the most suppressive and proliferative Treg population. CCR8+ Tregs are associated with high tumor grade and poor overall survival across many tumor types such as lung, breast, or head-neck cancer. Thus, unlike other approaches directed against Tregs, targeting CCR8 offers the opportunity to specifically deplete intra-tumoral Tregs without impacting peripheral Tregs or other immune cells.<br \/>BAY 3375968 is a non-internalizing fully human glycoengineered (afucosylated) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, which <i>in vitro<\/i> selectively depleted human CCR8+ Tregs via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies using mouse surrogate antibodies showed strong monotherapeutic efficacy across a variety of murine tumor models with clear correlation of intratumoral CCR8+ Treg depletion and CD8+ T cell increase. The monotherapeutic efficacy of CCR8 depleting antibodies was further enhanced by combinations with ICIs. BAY 3375968 also showed a good safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys.

Utomilumab appears safe but has modest efficacy, while urelumab is more efficacious but causes severe dose-dependent liver toxicity. To unlock the full potential of CD137 immunotherapy, we engineered a ADG206 POWERbody<sup>TM<\/sup> by combining our SAFEbody<sup>&#174;<\/sup> technology&#8217;s precision masking of the antigen binding sites with the Fc engineering in order to achieve improved safety and efficacy profiles. In normal tissues, the CD137 antigen binding interfaces of ADG206 are masked using a covalently linked designer peptide to limit on-target off-tumor toxicities, whereas in the tumor microenvironment (TME), the masked antibody can be activated to selectively bind CD137, promoting costimulatory signaling in situ. The activity of ADG206 is further heightened by incorporating Fc mutations with increased Fc&#947;R-mediated crosslinking, resulting in enhanced T cell responses and antitumor activity. In vitro nonclinical studies demonstrate that activated ADG206 binds to CD137, with agonistic activity strictly dependent on Fc&#947;R-mediated crosslinking, in contrast to Fc&#947;R-independent stimulation of CD137 by urelumab. When activated, ADG206 exhibits up to ~4-fold stronger anti-CD137 agonistic activity than urelumab for T cell activation in the presence of a primary stimulatory signal, while masked ADG206 has much lower activity. In vivo nonclinical studies demonstrate that ADG206 has robust single agent antitumor activities in multiple syngeneic murine tumor models and synergistic efficacy when combined with other immunomodulatory agents. Moreover, ADG206 is well-tolerated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys in nonclinical toxicology studies, with normal pharmacokinetic behaviors and minimal activation in circulation. These results demonstrate that ADG206 POWERbody acquires a tailor-made product profile toward a best-in-class anti-CD137 immunotherapeutic agent that combines conditional activation in the TME with strong agonistic activity through heightened Fc&#947;R-mediated crosslinking. Further clinical development of ADG206 POWERbody may hold promises for achieving the long-awaited desirable tolerability and efficacy outcome of an anti-CD137 immunotherapy in either single agent or combination regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/388da7ea-428b-4d9e-b0a9-dd9b75242f2d\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Antibody engineering,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16901"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guizhong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengxi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiagui Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianfeng Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linhai Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Songmao Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiangchun Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Luo<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, their utility in treating solid tumors has yet to be effectively demonstrated due to on-target off-tumor toxicity and systemic cytokine release syndrome (CRS). To explore the full potential of TCEs as a powerful modality of immunotherapy for solid tumors, we developed ADG138, a novel HER2&#215;CD3 POWERbody&#8482; TCE by applying our SAFEbody<sup>&#174;<\/sup> precision masking technology to double mask the binding interfaces in both ADG138 arms using covalently linked designer peptides in order to limit on-target off-tumor toxicities in normal tissues and to avert systemic CRS. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), the double masked ADG138 prodrug can be activated for concomitant in situ binding to the targeted cancer cells by the HER2 arm and to T cells by the CD3 arm to selectively enhance T cell responses against tumor cells specifically. Nonclinical studies demonstrated that when activated, ADG138 was highly potent in inducing T cell mediated cytotoxicity of both high and low HER2-expressing tumor cells in vitro, whereas in its double masked prodrug form ADG138 exhibited high masking efficiency with greatly reduced HER2 binding, T cell activation, and T cell mediated cytotoxicity. In in vivo human PBMC-engrafted tumor xenograft models, ADG138 induced robust tumor regression of both high and low HER2-expressing tumors in mice. Furthermore, combination of ADG138 with our species cross-reactive immuno-oncology therapeutics mediated strong synergistic antitumor activities in HER2 positive syngeneic solid tumor models in human CD3e knock-in mice. The double masked ADG138 prodrug also exhibited excellent safety profiles and normal pharmacokinetics in exploratory toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, achieving over a 300-fold higher tolerated dose in striking contrast with its parental TCE that lacks masking. These nonclinical studies demonstrated that ADG138, a novel double masked HER2&#215;CD3 POWERbody TCE, exhibited an impressively high therapeutic index relative to its parental non-masked TCE in HER2 high and low expressing solid tumors. This provides strong support for advancing the ADG138 prodrug into clinical development for treating HER2-expressing solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other immune stimulatory agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/19ed19a5-0625-471b-806c-53701cd9fd75\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,HER2,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16902"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Guizhong Liu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengxi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiagui Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianfeng Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linhai Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron N.

However, the majority of patients do not respond to the therapy due to multifaceted reasons implicating a non-effective activation of the immune system in those patients. The co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB has been shown to be a key signalling component of T cells and the combination of 4-1BB activation and PD-1\/PD-L1 antagonism has been shown to be highly active in preclinical models. Systemic application of first-generation anti-4-1BB antibodies however have resulted in dose limiting hepatic toxicities. We have generated and are currently clinically investigating a novel 4-1BB\/PD-L1\/HSA trispecific MATCH3 immunomodulatory drug candidate (NM21-1480) that agonizes 4-1BB conditionally upon PD-L1 binding and concomitantly blocks the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. Here we investigate the impact of dose dependency in vitro and the translation of this to in vivo studies to aid the selection of optimal doses for our ongoing clinical study of NM21-1480 in cancer patients. In human PD-L1 tumor bearing mice, triple knock-in for human PD-1, human PD-L1 and human 4-1BB, we have investigated the impact of dose titrations of NM21-1480. We observe a dose dependent effect of NM21-1480 on tumor growth, systemic exposure, tumor exposure and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of immune cell activation. We also demonstrate the formation of a memory response in treated mice through rechallenge of the mice with tumor. We also investigate the effect of combination therapy of NM21-1480 with immune-oncology targeted therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we demonstrate that the combination of NM21-1480 with anti-CD3 T cell engagers is highly effective in T cell activation and tumor control. These data highlight the potential of NM21-1480 for the treatment of cancer patients and enable greater understanding of the relationship between dose, tumor exposure, immune activation and tumor growth inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/f54ac8ac-790e-4c92-9d8f-902326ccc0b9\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,4-1BB,CD137,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16903"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel Snell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tea Gunde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Warmuth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Lichtlen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linlin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shu-wen Teng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>ChaoHsuan Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peiqi Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Tietz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Brock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Simonim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Hess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Weinert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Johansson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bithi Chatterjeee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Bassler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niels Kirk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catia Mendes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robin Heiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Flueckiger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dania Diem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Mahler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belinda Wickihalder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Muntwiler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandro Wagen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elmar Vom Baur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Archie N.

Alongside a highly potent anti-tumor activity, is the risk of on-target off-tumor side effects due to low levels of expression of the target antigen in normal tissue. We have sought to overcome this issue with the design and generation of a target-density-dependent activation mechanism. We have generated reduced-affinity antibody fragments to the tumor associated antigen mesothelin and constructed a multi-domain MATCH4 molecule encompassing bivalent mesothelin binding domains, a CD3 binding domain, and a human serum albumin (HSA)-binding domain for half-life extension. Here we report the design of the MATCH4 molecule and the preclinical activity of the molecule in vitro and in vivo. We also report the biochemical characteristics of the therapeutic candidate molecule showing its highly favorable properties for clinical development. We demonstrate that the bivalent mesothelin T cell engager has increased in vitro potency in T cell activation and tumor cell killing in the presence of high mesothelin expressing cells, when compared to a higher-affinity monovalent counterpart. We also demonstrate that the activity on low mesothelin expressing cells, such as healthy mesothelial cells, is reduced for the bivalent molecule compared to the higher affinity monovalent molecule. Due to the shedding of mesothelin from the surface of cancer cells and the high circulating levels of soluble mesothelin in patient sera, we also demonstrate that the bivalent molecule is still highly potent in cytotoxic activity in the presence of concentrations of soluble mesothelin up to 500 ng\/ml. We also demonstrate dose dependent anti-tumor activity in in vivo efficacy studies in PBMC-reconstituted mice, and combination therapeutic activity with an anti-PD-L1, anti-4-1BB bispecific molecule (NM21-1480). Collectively, these data demonstrate an increased selectivity to mesothelin-overexpressing cells by this novel MATCH4 reduced affinity bivalent T cell engager. These data indicate the potential of this molecule to increase the therapeutic window by reducing safety concerns on normal tissue where mesothelin expression is low, and yet promote cytotoxicity on mesothelin over-expressing cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c683974-d0c7-43be-ab83-320adc6cad0a\/@E03B8ZGc\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,CD3,PD-L1,4-1BB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16904"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Bithi Chatterjee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Hess<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Daniel Snell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tea Gunde<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefan Warmuth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandre Simonin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthias Brock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fabio Spiga<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Johansson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Weinert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Tietz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Niels Kirk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Bassler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dana Mahler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dania Diem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Carrella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noreen Giezendanner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alessandra Alberti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giorgio Gambino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Belinda Wickihalder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bettina Bommer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simone Muntwiler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasemin Yaman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Naomi Flueckiger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robin Heiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandro Wagen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Urech<\/i><\/presenter>.

In vivo, FS118 downregulates LAG-3 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and increases soluble LAG-3 (sLAG-3) in the serum of mice. In a Phase 1 trial, FS118 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in sLAG-3 in the serum of patients with advanced malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that the tetravalent structure of FS118 is required to mediate this novel LAG-3 shedding mechanism.<br \/>Human ex vivo assays were performed by co-culturing expanded CD4+ T cells with iDCs in the presence of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and FS118, or controls. sLAG-3 was measured by ECLIA. The binding valency of FS118 was determined using chemically-crosslinked mass spectrometry mapping (XL\/MS). Variants of FS118 and FS118 surrogate molecules were generated with differing valency for LAG-3 and PD-L1. MC38 tumor-bearing C57BL\/6 mice were dosed once interperitoneally with FS118 surrogate or valency variants. TILs were analyzed by flow cytometry, and sLAG-3 was measured in the serum by ECLIA.<br \/>In patients receiving FS118 treatment, a dose-dependent increase in sLAG-3 was detected in the blood. In an ex vivo human T cell assay, the FS118-mediated increase in sLAG-3 was greater than with the combination of the individual bispecific components. sLAG-3 increase by FS118 was mediated by ADAM10 and ADAM17. FS118 demonstrated tetravalent binding to its target antigens using XL\/MS. All four binding sites simultaneously bound to target antigens, with preferential binding to PD-L1 in the presence of equal amounts of both LAG-3 and PD-L1. Variants of FS118 with reduced binding valency for target antigens mediated lower levels of LAG-3 release than tetravalent FS118. Compared to FS118, monovalent PD-L1 binding reduced sLAG-3 release and importantly, a variant of FS118 with monovalent LAG-3 binding generated the lowest level of sLAG-3. Data will be presented showing the role of binding valency on LAG-3 downregulation by TILs and T cell activation in ex vivo murine samples.<br \/>FS118 is tetravalent and can bind to two LAG-3 and two PD-L1 molecules simultaneously. Bivalent LAG-3 and PD-L1 binding is required for enhanced shedding of cell surface LAG-3 in vitro. Removing LAG-3 from the surface of exhausted TILs is a novel mechanism attributed to the tetravalent structure of FS118, which may be important to overcome compensatory upregulation of LAG-3 induced by blockade of PD-L1 in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0ad190d7-31fd-4d58-b9ae-e268843d83bc\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,LAG-3,PD-L1,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16907"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claire S.

However, the wide application of BiTE therapies is limited by accompanying severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Since human cancer cells are not incorporated in the CRS evaluation, currently used in vivo animal models and in vitro human immune cell activation assays do not reliably evaluate the induction of CRS by immune drugs that is seen in BiTE treated cancer patients. In addition, the differences between human and mouse immune systems hamper the development of new immune-oncology therapeutic drugs. Thus, establishing a predictive in vivo animal model that can screen both efficacy of cancer therapy and risk of developing CRS is critical for improving the safety of immune drug development for treatment of cancer patients.<br \/>Method: Humanized mice were developed in NSG-MHC class I\/II double knock out (DKO) mouse recipients following reconstitution with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The MDA-MB-231\/Luciferase-2A-GFP stable breast cancer cell line (MDA), which expressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were implanted in mice 5 days after PBMC engraftment. Following EGFRxCD3 BiTE treatment whole-body tumor burden was quantified by an in vivo imaging system. To evaluate the CRS levels in response to BiTE therapy, cytokine levels were analyzed by BD cytometric bead array. Clinical observations, CRS scores, body weight changes and human immune cell activation were also monitored for CRS assessment.<br \/>Results: PBMC humanized models were successfully established with breast cancer cell engraftment. After treatment with EGFRxCD3 BiTE, the mice exhibited elevated serum levels of human IFNgamma, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IL-4 compared to a vehicle control group. This cytokine production was dose-dependent and was associated with an increase of toxic mouse clinical evaluation score. In contrast, there was no significant inflammatory cytokine production in PBMC humanized mice without MDA cell implantation, suggesting T cell activation by BiTE followed binding to the cancer cells. BiTE treatment for 2-4 days significantly suppressed tumor growth in lung as measured by luciferin imaging. With serial doses of BiTE treatment, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a novel in vivo PBMC humanized mouse model bearing human tumor cells that can be used to determine the optimal dose of BiTE for inhibition of tumor growth with low toxicity risk. This model provides a growth environment similar to that of patients and has important application values in simultaneously evaluating the efficacy and safety of any T cell-based immunotherapies including BiTE to define optimal approaches for clinical cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/0f8a3188-eeba-469e-b106-730afa24124a\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BiTE antibody,Toxicity,Cytokines,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16909"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Guoxiang Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li-Chin Yao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael A.

Upon engagement, CD137 enhances immune cell survival, proliferation, cytokine production, and memory formation. As such, CD137 agonists have demonstrated promising pre-clinical anti-tumor effects, however their clinical utility has been limited due to dose-limiting hepatic toxicity. PSMA is highly upregulated on tumor cells and tumor neovasculature in prostate cancer and other solid tumors, including lung (NSCLC), kidney (clear cell RCC), bladder and colorectal cancers. CB307 is a half-life extended Humabody&#174; that selectively agonizes CD137 only in the presence of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA, HGNC:FOLH1). CB307 is trispecific with V<sub>H<\/sub> components selected for optimal binding to PSMA, CD137 and human serum albumin (HSA). We present here the non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology of CB307.<br \/>Methods: CD137 agonism and immune cell activation were evaluated in vitro using coculture assays with PSMA-expressing tumor cells as assessed by NF&#954;B-driven luciferase and cytokine secretion. CB307 was evaluated as a single agent and in combination with enzalutamide, PD1 or PDL1 inhibitors. In vivo experiments used a syngeneic mouse system transgenic for the human CD137 immune cell target, and human PSMA expressed on mouse tumor cells. Nonclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetics of CB307 were assessed in cynomolgus macaques.<br \/>Results: In reporter assays and PBMC cocultures, CB307 activated CD137 only in the presence of PSMA-expressing cells leading to enhanced immune cell activation. Enzalutamide pre-treatment of 22Rv1 (PSMA-low) cells induced a 1.5-fold increase in surface PSMA expression leading to enhanced CB307 activity. CB307 or PD1\/PDL1 inhibition alone induced IL-2 secretion in PBMC\/PSMA-expressing tumor cell cocultures; this effect was synergistically enhanced when CB307 was combined with either PD1 or PDL1 inhibition. In an in vivo pharmacology study in immuno-competent mice, CB307 demonstrated statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth. CB307 was well-tolerated in a GLP-toxicology study in cynomolgus macaques, with an observed half-life supporting weekly clinical administration.<br \/>Summary: CB307 is a novel CD137 agonist that selectively enhances immune cell activity in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Our data demonstrates CB307 immunological pharmacology both in vitro and in vivo which has supported the initiation of the phase I &#8216;POTENTIA&#8217; clinical trial (NCT04839991).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/cb5a928f-74f4-45da-82a1-bbbab26c91f1\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Tumor antigen,Immunostimulation,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16911"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andrew J.

These can comprise a significant portion of the tumor mass in&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173; many common carcinomas and contribute to immune cell dysfunction within the tumor. Stromal cells support cancer cells through several mechanisms and can promote metastasis. Tumor vasculature supplies cancer cells with nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth and dissemination. Thus, targeting these components of cancer can enhance tumor rejection directly and increase sensitization of surviving tumors to immune infiltration and chemotherapeutic treatments through weakening of the tumor architecture. While there are current antiangiogenic therapies being tested clinically, they have associated toxicities in normal angiogenic processes, limiting clinical efficacy. Tumor Endothelial Marker 8 (TEM8, encoded by the ANTXR1 gene) is a highly conserved integrin-like adhesion molecule that was discovered on the endothelium of colorectal cancer, and subsequent studies identified its expression on multiple stromal cells&#8212;endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes&#8212;in the tumor microenvironment of diverse human cancer types. Little to no expression has been demonstrated in normal human stroma, indicating that this would be a good target for immunotherapy. Using a mammalian expression system, we designed and expressed a TEM8 targeting TriKE (cam1615TEM8) consisting of a humanized anti-CD16 single domain antibody, a wild-type IL-15 moiety, and an anti-TEM8 scFv. cam1615TEM8 induces NK cell degranulation and cytokine production against TEM8+ tumor and stromal cell lines (endothelial cells and fibroblasts). Using TEM8- cancer lines and a TEM8-CRISPR knockout version of A549 lung cancer lines, we show that cam1615TEM8 only activates NK cells in the presence of tumor antigen. cam1615TEM8 also preferentially stimulates TEM8+ tumor spheroid killing. Moreover, the camelid anti-CD16 nanobody selectively enhances signaling by the IL-15 moiety to NK cells, specifically promoting NK cell survival and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In an in vivo xenogeneic mouse model, containing human NK cells and tumor, cam1615TEM8-treated mice had enhanced NK cell tumor infiltration, significantly decreased tumor growth, and enhanced survival when compared to IL-15 treated mice. Since TEM8 is highly conserved, and the scFv within the TriKE is reactive to mouse TEM8, we were able to show reduced tumor endothelial density in the tumors of mice treated with cam1615TEM8. Given the findings of this study cam1615TEM8 could be leveraged in several clinical settings by inducing NK cell specific targeting of the tumor itself and\/or the tumor endothelium and stroma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/7c9a788d-ea9b-4822-9819-77fbfbd795c4\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16912"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Martin Felices<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Kaminski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Hinderlie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Hopps<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Bendzick<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Melissa Geller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeffrey S.

Due to the huge potential of IL-15 to activate both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity, several IL-15-based immunocytokines are currently in clinical development. However, all of them preferentially act in the periphery and not locally within the tumor. To further increase the efficacy and safety of IL-15-based immunocytokines, we developed GT-00A x IL15, an immunocytokine targeting a tumor-associated, glycosylated epitope of MUC-1 (TA-MUC1). GT-00A x IL15 was designed to balance best tumor enrichment, efficacy and safety and thus represents a new cancer immunotherapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors with high medical need.<br \/>Experimental procedures: GT-00A x IL15 was extensively studied in several in vitro assays to assess its activity and characterize its complex mechanisms of action. Several pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, biodistribution and efficacy studies were performed in tumor-free or tumor-bearing mice to further analyze its pharmacological profile and efficacy in vivo. The safety of GT-00A x IL15 was assessed in a 4-weeks GLP toxicology study in rats.<br \/>Results summary: We can demonstrate in vitro that targeting IL-15 to tumor cells by using GT-00A x IL15 increases the cytotoxic activity of effector cells against TA-MUC1-positive tumor cell lines compared to parental GT-00A and an untargeted IL-15 control construct. Further, GT-00A x IL15 mediates a dose-dependent infiltration of NK and T cells into MCF-7 tumor spheroids that is not observed using the controls. In a biodistribution study using radioactively labelled GT-00A x IL15, we observed significantly increased enrichment of GT-00A x IL15 in the tumor compared to the untargeted IL-15 control construct. This tumor enrichment translated into activation and expansion of tumor-infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cell effector cells and single agent efficacy in different tumor models in vivo. The safety assessment of GT-00A x IL15 in a dose-range finding study using rats as relevant species did not show any safety concerns so far. The full data package will be available early 2022 to be presented at the AACR meeting.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results show that by using TA-MUC1 as a broadly expressed and highly tumor-specific antigen, we are able to direct IL-15 to the tumor. Local enrichment of GT-00A x IL15 within the tumor ultimately induced local effector cell activation and expansion. GT-00A x IL15 showed single agent efficacy in vivo with a good safety profile. These data highlight the potential of GT-00A x IL15 to increase the efficacy and safety of an IL-15-based immunocytokine by tumor targeting. GT-00A x IL15 shows great promise for the treatment of TA-MUC1-positive solid tumors either as monotherapeutic agent or as valuable combination partner.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/852e486e-56b1-4042-9b80-700674f5f0e4\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Tumor targeting,Immunostimulation,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16913"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Patrik Kehler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anika Jaekel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Gellert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christoph Goletz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Timo Lischke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anke Flechner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antje Danielczyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Theresa Neumann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Therapeutic approaches that specifically target these cells are needed to improve treatment outcomes in these tumor types. We are investigating CD133, a widely used surface marker to identify CSCs in colon, brain, and breast tumors. Here, we report the use of polymeric nanoparticles targeting CD133 by conjugating an anti-CD133 scFv-Fc to poly(L-lactide)-PEG-maleimide nanoparticles (anti-CD133 NPs) for effective CSC targeting. The Fc tagged anti-CD133 scFv was prepared and purified using an Expi293 expression system. Nanoparticles were prepared using flash nanoprecipitation and loaded with a hydrophobic, hydrolytically labile, silicate prodrug of paclitaxel. Flash nanoprecipitation allowed for generation of particles with a size of 232 &#177; 17 nm (increased to 289 &#177; 23 nm upon scFv conjugation), a zeta potential of -11.5 mV and a drug loading of 57 &#177; 8 wt% measured by HPLC. The anti-CD133 scFv-Fc was thiolated using 2-iminothiolane (2-IT) and conjugated to nanoparticles using thiol-maleimide chemistry. Thiolation of the antibody was optimized using different molar excesses of 2-IT. A binding assay using Caco-2 cells (which overexpress CD133) confirmed that thiolation of the antibody did not affect its binding, even at the highest molar excess of 2-IT used. With 200x molar excess of 2-IT, 2.9 thiols per antibody were added. Antibody conjugation was confirmed using gel electrophoresis; bands corresponding to the heavy and light chains of antibody were observed for anti-CD133 NPs after reduction but were not seen for non-reduced anti-CD133 NPs or for unconjugated particles. Cytotoxicity studies in MDA-MB-231-LM2 cells revealed maximum kill in drug loaded anti-CD133 NPs, which was significantly higher than for either non-targeted, drug-loaded nanoparticles or blank nanoparticles (p&#60;0.05). Overall, these studies indicate the potential for using anti-CD133 scFv-Fc in conjunction with FNP-produced silicate prodrug nanoparticles of paclitaxel for efficient targeting of CSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/6a35f734-8466-464c-976c-c1c64ce41998\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,Nanoparticle,Paclitaxel,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16915"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shubhmita Bhatnagar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mengyuan Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Hoye<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jayanth Panyam<\/i><\/presenter>.

Mouse PTX-35 (mPTX-35) is a TNFRSF25 functional agonist derived from a CDR that was humanized and affinity matured, then fused to a mouse IgG1-Fc backbone. Since costimulatory agonist antibodies have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials, our aims were to (i) determine the anti-tumor efficacy of mPTX-35, (ii) elucidate any mechanisms of resistance, and (iii) identify immune conditions that provide effective anti-tumor immune responses to mPTX-35 treatment. We studied the anti-tumor immune effects of mPTX-35 in both cold and hot tumor models. In a TC-1 cold tumor, we found that treatment with an anti-TNFRSF25 agonist antibody does not affect tumor growth or survival. In contrast, vaccination with an E7 antigen-specific vaccine leads to an environment that reverses primary resistance to the agonist antibody, inhibiting the tumor growth, and enhancing overall survival. Interestingly, we found that similar to other co-stimulatory agonist molecules, the immune effects of the anti-TNFRSF25 agonist are dose-dependent with lower (0.2 mg\/kg) and higher (5 mg\/kg) doses of mPTX-35 showing a reduced anti-tumor response than a dose of 1 mg\/kg, resulting in a bell-shaped response in all tumor models. Similar immune-mediated anti-tumor effects of mPTX-35 were found in a CT26 (hot) tumor model. In conclusion, these results show that anti-TNFRSF25 agonist antibody demonstrates high anti-tumor efficacy in tumors that are infiltrated with T cells while the absence of properly antigen activated CD8 T cells (such as in cold tumors) incurs primary resistance to TNFRSF25 agonist that is reversed by proper priming of CD8 T cells. These results highlight the importance of optimal priming to limit primary resistance mechanisms and drive an efficacious immune response via the TNSFR25 axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/07d4b752-de31-4d1e-bc98-6c2676401ab5\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Costimulation,Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16916"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dareen Sarhan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lara Rabah<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vikas Tahiliani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anh M.

IL-21 can have beneficial effects on anti-tumor immune responses due to its ability to activate STAT3 in CD8+ T cells and promote cytotoxicity, memory cell differentiation and survival. However, IL-21 can also induce immunosuppressive effects, such as suppression of antigen presentation, which may directly oppose its anti-tumor effects on CD8+ T cells. Although recombinant IL-21 did show monotherapy activity in the clinic, overall response rates were modest. In addition to the pharmacological sink created by the broad expression of IL-21R and potential immunosuppressive effects, clinical utility of IL-21 was further limited by its low bioavailability and dose-limiting toxicities. We hypothesized that maximizing IL-21&#8217;s activity on CD8+ T cells while avoiding non-CD8 cells would enhance efficacy and improve tolerability. We developed cis-targeted IL-21 (CD8-IL21) fusion proteins that exhibit improved bioavailability and selectively activate CD8+ T cells while exhibiting minimal activity on non-CD8 cells. In vitro phospho-STAT3 assays with CD8-IL21 in mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood cells showed &#62;1000-fold selective activation of CD8+ T cells over non-CD8 cells. A mouse CD8-IL21 surrogate demonstrated profound single agent efficacy in multiple syngeneic tumor models at considerably lower doses than an untargeted IL-21 control, despite similar in vitro potency. CD8-IL21 mediated anti-tumor efficacy without inducing body weight loss. Whereas prior data showed that repeated high doses of tumor-targeted IL-21 fusion protein (&#62;3 mg\/kg) had single agent efficacy in the MC38 tumor model overexpressing a tumor antigen [1], here we show that a single dose of CD8-targeted IL-21 as low as 0.1 mg\/kg induced curative responses in mice bearing established MC38 tumors. We demonstrated using the lymphocyte migration inhibitor FTY720 that this enhanced potency of low dose CD8-IL21 is predominately driven by the activation of peripheral CD8 T cells. Furthermore, curative effects in the MC38 model were elicited in the absence of substantial CD8+ T cell expansion (&#60;1.5-fold) suggesting that CD8-IL21 mediated anti-tumor efficacy through modulation of T cell phenotype. A CD8-IL21 selective for human and cynomolgus CD8+ T cells with improved bioavailability also exhibited improved tolerability over untargeted IL-21 in cynomolgus monkeys, showing that there is a tolerability benefit to CD8-selective activation. In summary, CD8-IL21 showed improved efficacy and safety over untargeted IL-21, demonstrating clear promise as a novel therapeutic agent which by activating STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells may offer complementary benefits to activation of STAT5 signaling by cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-15.Ref: 1.

We discovered that TAMs express the pattern recognition receptor Dectin-2 (<i>Clec4n<\/i>\/<i>CLEC6A<\/i>), an activating C-type lectin receptor (CLR) that binds to high-mannose glycans on fungi and other microbes and stimulates immune responses against infectious disease. Dectin-2 is selectively expressed by myeloid cells, and upon ligation, mediates enhanced phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, and proinflammatory cytokine production. Given these properties, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting Dectin-2 to reprogram TAMs using natural ligands as well as our novel agonistic antibodies. We show that Dectin-2 agonists can convert TAMs into immunostimulatory cells in vitro and in vivo, and drive robust anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Dectin-2 gene expression is minimal in normal human tissues but elevated across many tumor types, including breast, colon, lung, ovarian, and kidney cancers. We found that Dectin-2 is strongly expressed by macrophages differentiated in vitro and on primary TAMs from various solid tumors. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with mannan, a natural Dectin-2 ligand derived from <i>S. cerevisiae<\/i>, mediated tumor regression in multiple syngeneic tumor models, with high rates of tumor clearance in the MB49 bladder cancer model. These effects were Dectin-2 dependent, as efficacy was not observed when a Dectin-2-blocking antibody was co-administered or in knockout mice lacking Dectin-2 signaling components. Depletion of either macrophages or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells impaired efficacy, suggesting that Dectin-2-stimulated TAMs augment anti-tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses. Based on these data, we developed novel Dectin-2-targeted agonist antibodies capable of activating both in vitro-generated and primary human TAMs to produce an array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines akin to tumor-destructive &#8220;M1&#8221; macrophages. Furthermore, systemically administered Dectin-2 agonist antibodies activated TAMs and mediated anti-tumor effects in immunodeficient mice engrafted with human CD34<sup>+<\/sup> HSCs. The data presented demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Dectin-2 agonist antibodies as a novel pan-cancer approach for myeloid cell-directed tumor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/1fad22e7-687d-46cf-9130-89a33f204cfc\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Macrophages,Antibody,Immunostimulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/16918"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Justin A.

By bridging T cells to malignant cells expressing a selected tumor-associated antigen (TAA), CD28 bsAbs deliver the so-called signal 2 to T cells unleashing their full cytotoxic potential. Contrary to bivalent CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) superagonists, the activation of CD28 with monovalent CD28 bispecifics requires the binding of a TAA expressed by the cancer cells to induce CD28 clustering. Preclinical studies have shown the benefit of adding costimulatory CD28 bsAbs for the treatment of solid tumors, boosting the efficacy of bispecific T cell engagers (CD3 bsAbs) or PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Using our proprietary fully human &#954;&#955; body antibody platform, which relies on a common heavy chain and on two distinct light chains driving specificity and affinity (i.e., one kappa and one lambda), we have identified a panel of agonist anti-CD28 kappa arms. Using our existing lambda anti-TAA arms (e.g., targeting CD19, MSLN, HER2, EGFR), an array of TAA-CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies targeting different tumors were generated. The capacity of these CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies to provide signal 2 to T cells was assessed both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in combination with CD3 bsAbs. In the presence of cancer cells and corresponding TAA-CD3 bsAbs, the CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies enabled the activation of primary human CD4 and CD8 T cells, leading to T cell proliferation and secretion of cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN&#947;, and granzyme B. Importantly, when used alone or in combination with an untargeted CD3 bsAb (that is, in the absence of signal 1), CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies showed no sign of T cell activation, potentially limiting peripheral toxicity. The resulting change in the T cell activation status led to a potent <i>in vitro<\/i> T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) against TAA-expressing cancer cell lines. CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies targeting gastrointestinal tumors were tested in combination with CD3 bsAbs in xenogeneic tumor models and synergistically improved the antitumoral activity of T cell engagers, leading to an enhanced tumor control. Thus, via the identification of optimal agonist anti CD28 arms, CD28 bsAbs targeting multiple TAAs were designed for tumor-specific activation of the immune system. The resulting TAA-CD28 &#954;&#955; bodies can enhance the antitumor response induced by CD3-retargeting bsAbs via the induction of T cell proliferation and activation, increased cytokine secretion and boosted anti-tumoral cytotoxicity. Other anti-TAA arms are being explored, to expand the panel of TAAs that could be easily paired with our anti-CD28 platform arms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/ad3f462f-1473-47e5-a20f-e26a37f9a1d4\/@w03B8ZGd\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,CD28,Costimulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/19935"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sara Majocchi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Lloveras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Coline Burnet-Merlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lise Nouveau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Pleche<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pauline Malinge<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claudia Batista<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christelle Daviet<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maud Charreton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillemette Pontini<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Franck Gueneau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valery Moine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Giovanni Magistrelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Limin Shang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Walter Ferlin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Krzysztof Masternak<\/i><\/presenter>.

In contrast, the human T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes its cognate peptide antigen when presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, and thus detects a broader range of targets including intracellular proteins. Here we established an innovative strategy of generating fully human TCR mimic (TCRm) antibodies that can recognize antigen with a higher specificity and affinity. Previously, Biocytogen established RenMab&#8482; and Renlite<sup>TM<\/sup> mice (RenMice). These humanized immunoglobulin mouse models generate fully human antibodies that carry human Ig heavy chain and human kappa light chain variable domains. Here, HLA genes were introduced into RenMice to build tolerance towards HLA. When immunized with HLA- peptide complexes, these mice generate antibodies that specifically target the HLA-Peptide complex, with no reactivity to HLA alone nor other peptide-HLA complexes. Compared to natural TCRs, these TCRm antibodies show higher affinity and specificity. Using optimized immunization methods and high-throughput screening, our antibody discovery platform generated fully human TCRm antibodies from HLA\/RenMab&#8482; and HLA\/Renlite&#8482; mice. Producing TCR-like binders with this unique TCRm technology can become a very powerful tool in the immunotherapy field.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":"https:\/\/cslide-us.ctimeetingtech.com\/play\/420329f8-8dce-494d-be72-d8b72ba9dc71\/@x03B8ZGe\/pdf?cover=https:\/\/files.abstractsonline.com\/SUPT\/101\/10517\/cfg-cattendee-cslide-player-cover.png"},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Antigen presentation,HLA class I,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":"https:\/\/cattendee.abstractsonline.com\/meeting\/10517\/Presentation\/21611"},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jun Du<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nannan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Li Hui<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruixue Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Taolin Liu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qingcong Lin<\/i><\/presenter>.

Its tumor specificity allows CLDN18.2 to be an attractive target for developing biotherapeutics for the treatment of gastric and pancreatic cancers. DR30303 is a humanized ant-CLDN18.2 heavy chain antibody Fc fusion protein (VHH-Fc) generated via Doer Biologics&#8217; proprietary SMART-VHHBody platform. DR30303 exhibits strong and highly selective binding to CLDN18.2, but not its close splicing variant CLDN18.1. In addition, it exhibits enhanced ADCC activity as a result of Fc engineering and low immunogenicity risk validated via in-silico T-cell epitope predictor. Its smaller size (78 kDa vs 150 kDa for conventional full-length IgG) allows DR30303 to penetrate solid tumors faster and deeper, resulting in a strong competitive advantage and differentiation compared with other anti-CLDN18.2 antibodies in the market. Single-agent therapeutic potency of DR30303 was demonstrated in various gastric and pancreatic cell-derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models with a minimum effective dose of 0.3 mg\/kg dose of DR30303 led to TGI&#8805;90%, which is significantly more potent (p&#60;0.05) than the benchmark reference Zolbetuximab analog in same molar ratio. Moreover, DR30303 showed strong synergistic anti-tumor activities with paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and EOF (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models (gastric cancer) and CDX model (pancreatic cancer).
